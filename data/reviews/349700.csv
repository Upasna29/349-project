My first 30 minutes of this game were absolutely horrendous. I spent majority of the time running over the terrible looking map and constantly being annoyed by the same grass/flowers textures that would wave into existence 5m from my character. I managed to find several places to loot, finding small amounts of food and water and a LARGE abundance of items that are obviously meant for crafting. Here's the downside to having all those items; before you can properly use most of them, you first need to find blueprints in order to craft even the most basic of items. Want to build a campfire? Gotta find that blueprint first. They don't appear easy to find either- I looted an entire city and did not find a single blueprint of any kind. So 90% of the other items I  found were useless to me.\n\nSprinting requires no stamina, yet jumping takes it away which ultimately makes no sense. Both sprinting and jumping should decrease stamina. The zombies are a joke, with them doing so very little in the world. I stood 3m away from one without it aggroing and when it finally did aggro, it stutter-stepped everywhere and quickly de-aggroed when I started running away.\n\nThe lack of wildlife in a map that houses the perfect environment to house even birds, is quite annoying, given that animals would still be present at the time of this game.\n\nThe game itself offers no instructions in regards to things like group-making, crafting and a myriad of other important tasks. I had to do a manual search on the forums to find out how to group with someone, which turns out that you have to enter in a "/" command into chat in order to do so- a very annoying task.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone but if you're looking to at least try it out, go for it. It's free to play, but that doesn't mean it is exempt from being so horrible.\n\n\nNOW, onto the background of the game and those behind it.\n\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Sergey Titov is a lying and scamming whackjob (just two of the many names he is known by). Before WarZ (Aftermath's predecessor), Sergey was known for his absolutely horrendous game called Big Rigs. This game is broken beyond compare and really tells you just how bad Sergey is at actually making games himself. However, it certainly isn't his worse trait.\n\nIn 2012 when the DayZ mod was so popular that those behind it decided to make a standalone game (thus properly beginning the zombie survival mmo genre), Sergey and an associate of his, "RussianKaliber" essentially hijacked the DayZ mod forums and put forth an idea for thier own zombie apolcapyse game. This got people interested and so began the days of WarZ.\n\nDuring its Alpha stage, WarZ looked to be a promising title, with the developers promising a large amount of very tasty features that would (in theory) make WarZ the amazing zombie game everyone had always wanted. HammerPoint Interactive (the original development team for WarZ) were selling the game on their website for as much as $60 for a Legendary package, which consisted of a large sum of GC, a Legendary user icon both in-game and on the forums and lastly, 6-months of free stronghold server hosting. There were a few other packages available for less cost but the Legendary was the most expensive. Users were told that the game would never be so cheap. We were in for the biggest surprise of the gaming century.\n\nCome official launch day on Steam (Dec 2012), majority of the playerbase were shown just how much of a scam this all was. The game was being sold for a mere $15, it had one map that was only 30% complete (if that), the vast majority of promised features weren't even present in the game, including the promised stronghold servers and the game itself was filled with more bugs than a roach nest. The developers were quiet for days, having taken a small vacation given it was Christmas time and there was no one around to fix their broken game. It was so bad that Valve stepped in and pulled it from Steam and offered refunds to all for the first time ever.\n\nAbout a week or so later, WarZ was allowed back on Steam, having amended the description on the store page to more accurately reflect the state of the game. The damage was already done though. To make matters even worse, Sergey issued a supposed "apology" letter which actually more blamed the customers for "misreading" the store page than apologising for the ginormous ♥♥♥♥-up he had intentionally made.\n\n\nFrom there, matters continued to get worse and worse for not only the paying customer, but also for the company and those inside it. I won't go into full detail of the events that happened in the year 2013 in regards to WarZ, so I'll do a point summary:\n\n- Private servers were eventually added (not strongholds), but contained little admin controls and people were being charged ridiculous amounts to use them\n\n- The game underwent a name change due to the copyright claim by Paramount for the movie World War Z\n\n- People were being banned by power-abusive admins and an overzealous community manager, Kewk, for saying ANYTHING negative about the game, regardless of whether it broke the rules or not.\n\n- The forums were supposedly "hacked" and the source code for the game leaked to the public, resulting in new forums being made and everything on the old forums conveniently lost.\n\n- Artemis Knives (the hypocrite and sellout) joined the team not long after making several videos calling out the developers on their shady actions and horrible business practices. All videos of him doing so were quickly deleted.\n\n- Kewk was caught on video verbally abusing a group of players that legitimately killed him in-game\n\n- Sergey was caught lying more and more, specifically with the Super Zombie that was told to have already been in the game since launch yet no one had managed to find it.\n\n- Eventually the Super Zombie was actually put into the game, along with several other features including cars, minor crafting, strongholds and base-building, all of which were as broken as the game itself.\n\n\nThe list goes on and on and on people. But it is all TRUE, every word. There are MANY witnesses who can attest to these events and add even more to the list should they desire. Like I said, there's just too much to explain but I hope you get the idea of just how bad Sergey Titov is and how he cannot be trusted with anything he says, the same goes with his associates.\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed the read, if you actually read it.\n\n\nEDIT (16/11/2015): The developers incompetence continues to shine with their decision to change the current desert-themed map to a forested one with the guarantee of higher FPS. I made a statement on a thread about how it wouldn't raise FPS, but lower it and mentioned how stupid they are for thinking so. I was promptly banned and Artemis stated that some people don't understand how rendering works...\n\nFor anyone who may or may not understand WHY a forested map would give you less FPS, let me explain it to you. Every tree is considered an object within the game, given that players can collide with them. Now not only can a player collide with trees, but lighting does as well, which results in the engine having to determine shadows and lighting collisions for EVERY tree placed within the world.\n\nThe only way they would raise the FPS with this idea is if they made every tree a simple texture with no collision effects. No tree would be an object and the game would be even more hilarious.\n\nPlease educate yourself Artemis.","September 29, 2015","false","1.5"," 4,533 of 4,867 people (93%) found this review helpful 716 people found this review funny","93","533","4","716","159"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokalupsis/recommended/349700/","Apokalupsis","✫ Aionion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokalupsis/","447 products in account","It's the WarZ debacle all over again...these devs just seem to hate players\n== THE REVIEW ==\nI really wanted to give the guys who gave us WarZ another chance. But they are doing the same thing here as they did with WarZ, both with the game and in how they treat their community (in the forums - mass forum bans, critical posts deleted).\n\nThis game is WarZ's brother, it has only a few changes.\n\nCategory	Summary        GRAPHICS:        The graphics have potential, but the lack of opimization right now makes it a challenge to get the same results as shown on the store page.  If you turn the settings to Ultra and have all the settings enabled (such as SSAO and AA), you'll get the same or similar results as shown in the store slider. You're fps will most likely drop to 10-15 when in the middle of a city or town if you are like most people, and many people claim they get around 30-50 ordinarily (when not in the thick of it), which seems reasonable and is what I get as well depending upon the area I'm in at the time.\n\nI had previously been extremely critical about the graphics and shared 2 screenshots here that were taken with what I thought, Ultra settings. I was mistaken, they weren't. So I've removed those screen shots and amended this review accordingly.\n\nI apologize to the devs and those who read my review for that mistaken criticism.\n\nIn summary, the graphics in the game can be quote good, but it seems that an awful lot of optimization has yet to occur for them to be consistently realized. It's in beta, so optimization is to be expected as the game develops.	MELEE:	Pretty bad. You can stand there in front of a zombie and allow it to hit you. You take no damage. I did this over and over again with about 20 zombies to test it...even taking on 3 at a time. The only time I took damage is when I had my back turned.	LOOT: 	There is a variety of loot to gather, but very small amount of storage space. Some items do stack, and some items can be broken down. But most of this is meaningless w/o a method to store it all and your first backpacks will be insufficient.	BUILDINGS: 	Quality wise, the buildings are on par with WarZ. There is very little diversity with home architecture and styling.  City buildings such as police departments, office buildings,  garages, post offices, etc. are identical to those found in WarZ. There are towers and silos with ladders, but you can't climb them (ladders don't work).	GUNS: 	Gotta have them right? Some guns are found in the world, some guns can be bought in the in-game store (with real money).  You can also buy blueprints (with real money) for guns which will help give you an edge over other players. You can also buy chests which will have tier 1 guns and ammo.  	ZOMBIES:	Ahh, the most important part of a zombie game, no? Well, not in Aftermath unfortunately. Zombies just stand out in the open, still...just waiting for aggro. They do not roam, they will only move when you come into range. They aren't much of a surprise or threat.\n\nThey are super easy to kill because they do no damage. about 5 hits to the head with the average weapon (which does 20-25 dmg) and they go down. They have the identical look, sound, and behavior as WarZ. The one difference that I can think of however, is that the WarZ zeds did damage to you, and some roamed, and there were hordes. Not the case in Aftermath. Very uninspiring.          STABILITY:         The game is in open beta so it is expected that there will be stability and framerate issues. But right now at this stage, it can be a chore trying to not crash when logging in or trying to get consistent fps.  Many users are complaining about the game locking up on them and having to manually restart their computers. I have experienced this 4x so far when joining a server. There's a thread now about it in the forum. Some play 10-15 mins before locking up, some lock up at launch, some lock up when joining a server.\n\nIt should be noted however, that since yesterday, I have not experienced any hangups. I don't know if this issue has been resolved, if so, I'll update this review accordingly in a few days.\n\nLow framerate seems to be an issue most players are experiencing. The game clearly is not optimized yet. Even those with monster rigs that can handle most fully released, modern game are reporting they are having issues.  I run the game on ULTRA at about 10-20fps when near buildings and zombies. In the open, the fps is much better (40-50fps). But you can't stay in the open for long. You need to find buildings, people, zeds, etc.\n\nThere is a lot of work to do in this area.	SUMMARY:	 This game is nearly identical to WarZ with only a few changes. How much those changes set this game apart from WarZ, remains to be seen. The dev behavior and attitude towards the players, at least during the first 24 hrs of its Steam release,  has been the same as was seen in WarZ. So if you like being treated like dirt and/or want your non-violation criticism to be deleted and get banned from it...you will love these devs!\nBecause I felt that there just had to be some differences between the games, yet didn't see any nor could I find any explained outside the game, I decided to get help from the community. Surely the devs wouldn't just "copy/paste" WarZ into a new name would they? That's absurd. No...there has to be some differences...\n\nTrying to find out the differences...\nI actually created a thread asking for the differences. In the op I asked that no one flame the game or devs or even Warz. A nice poster responded and pointed out some of the differences.\n\nThe devs did not like that...at all. They don't want this game to be compared or contrasted to their previous mess and scam WarZ...at all.  They deleted the thread.\n\nI had heard that the devs were deleting threads and banning posters like crazy just like they did in their forums. I didn't believe at the time because I'd not seen it myself (only participating in a few threads here).  But sure enough, the claim became a reality.\n\nIf you have any experience with WarZ and were expecting...or even hoping...for a different experience and were nice enough to offer a second chance to the devs (like I was), don't. You are going to experience exactly more of the same.\n\nBad devs usually produce bad products. This is no exception.\n\n//// end original review\n\nUpdate\n== BANNED FROM FORUM ==\n\nWow...talk about making it easy to prove my case...the devs did it rather quickly.\n\nI posted in a thread where people were bashing, out right bashing the devs and WarZ with very nasty things. Instead of following suit, I responded with a well thought out post with my experiences and my personal opinions as a result of the devs being on a ban and thread delete rampage (just like they did on their own forums with WarZ).\n\nThe non-violation post\nThis is the post (and dev reasoning) that got me banned:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=525102063\n\nYup...that's it. While critical of the dev's behavior and the game itself, no obscenities or personal attacks...absolutely nothing that violates Steam's Forum Policies.\n\nSo what was the justification? Well, here is the dev's response who banned me from the forum for creating such a "horrible" and "violating" post:\n\nOriginally posted by You were banned by a Aftermath developer:Reason: "take a break, come back when you're not so entitled.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/volt615/recommended/349700/","volt615","Volt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/volt615/","405 products in account","Romero's AftermathRomero's Aftermath is an open world survival horror action game similar to other games such as DayZ, H1Z1, & Miscreated.   The game offers both player vs player (PvP) as well as player vs environment (PvE) in first and third-person views.  This is a survival game so expect to scavenge the large world map for resources while crafting items such as weapons, gear, and defensive structures.\n\nHistory RepeatsThe game was announced as being developed to both succeed and to make amends for the abysimal title Infestation: Servial Stories (ISS) formally known as WarZ.  The business model for WarZ/ISS was perhaps the worst I have seen in gaming whereby one had to play and level up multiple players to counter the real $$$ transactions to respawn or be forced to log out for awhile to wait for a respawn timer.\n\nWarZ/ISS was without a doubt a pay-to-win (PTW) whereby one could buy and bank weapons to later respawn fully geared as wallet commandos to lay waste to players with limited funds. Later updates made changes to this system but the publisher limited these changes to maximize profits.  Another troubling issue was very poor support to fight hackers.  These changes failed to meet consumer expectations and ultimately the game was a complet failure. We (gamers) were told the publisher refussed to further invest in ISS and forbid further developemnet which led to the developement of Aftermath.\n\nThe AftermathAftermath is not WarZ or ISS but it did not fall far from the tree. As you will see from my review there are some good elements to this game that could make it shine but unfortunately the bad tend to cast a very dark shadow.\n\nThe GoodControl: Typical first/third-person shooter very similar to H1Z1 and Miscreated.\n\nEnvironment:  The map is huge with lots of camps and towns to explore and scavenge.  Towns get over run and there is a meter to see what percent of zombies have been destroyed. There are also safe zones where you can buy supplies, ammo, and weapons.  You can also bank/unbank items on PvP servers in safezones.\n\nGraphics: The graphics fall in between ISS and H1Z1.  This is no AAA title and as such will be a downgrade in graphics from DayZ and H1Z1. But this is a FTP indie developed game so graphics are what would be expected, good but not great.\n\nFramerate: The game plays smooth at least on my high end gaming system.  For an early access (EA) game and my frame rate is much better than DayZ and about the same as H1Z1 with an average frame rate in the high 60's with lows in the 50's and highs as much as 100 fps with every setting maxed out.\n\nGood & BadCombat: The combat system is both good and bad.  The good is that hits require one to aim for head shots (HS) or you will have to hit players/zombies 20 times before they die which is a nice feature although 20 hits seems like overkill. The bad is that you can hit a zombie or player in melee from 10 feet away.\n\nZombie AI: I like that you can line of sight (LoS) zombies so that when you are low health you do not have to run for miles to lose them. Zombies afterall have very low intelligence with the one basic need to feed.  The bad is that currently you can stand on a something like a crate and kill hordes of zombies without taking damage. Hit response from the AI is better than other survival games, but that isn't saying much considering most survival games' combat systems combined with fps drops and lag make them horrible.  But at least in this game, you will not take hits while the zombie is facing the other dirrection like you do in the other survival horror games mentioned above.\n\nSurvival Challenge:  I liked the fact that you become infected which you must treat or die.  Of course it would be awesome to become a playable zombie, but that is wishful thinking.  However infection has little to no warning and sadly seems to be the only survival facter outside of zombies and other players.  There are no harsh weather conditions that I can tell.\n\nCrafting System: You can craft just about everything from meals to a fortified base. You must find/learn patterns to craft items, even basic things like a bandage or building a fire which can be problematic to survival.  In five hours of gameplay I found seven patterns and none of them were needed for basic survival.  You do gain health back from eating food but it is at a very slow rate.  Discovery is a much better system for crafting although this one would not be so bad if basic things like a fire and bandages were known at the start. I should mention that once you learn to craft something you will always know it.\n\nThe BadEconomy:  The rate at which you find or earn money by selling items is horrible.  I think I found $30 in-game-currency (igc) in my first three hoursof gameplay.  There where over 100 people on my server so it could have all been looted prior to me getting to locations, but I expect this to be the norm.  After about five hours of game play and selling an unwanted item (not needed for crafting) I had close to $300 igc, still not enough to buy a bottle of water at $430 igc.  Now if the zombies were lootable, and perhaps they are meant to be and are just bugged or will be later, it would be much easier to get money. But after learning more about the business model of this game, I doubt it.\n\nThe UglyBusiness Model:  The business model at first glance seems like a great improvement with the only items one can purchase with real $$$ is permanent skins.  Rare skins are bought through crates similar to Counter-Strike and H1Z1 while more common skins can be purchased by both real $$$ and ingame currency.\n\nAfter playing for awhile you figure out there is a real $$$ conversion system that enables wallet commandos to buy weapons and supplies. You may think that isn't so bad but when you look at the over inflated prices of a bottle of water selling for $430 igc and weapons as much as $3,000 igc you begin to wonder why after 5 hours of game play and selling items I still didn't have enough igc to buy a bottle of water.\n\nThere is a purpose behind these inflated prices, this business model forces you to buy and convert money to buy items so the developers can make money off of little to no innovative concepts. Rather than making money off of cool game features, the developers intend to line their pockets by charging real money for the bare essentials needed to play this game competitively in PvP. Off course you can farm the items if you intend to farm for 8-12 hours a day prior to joining PvP so you are stocked up on weapons, ammo, and medkits.\n\nAlthough this business model doesn't do mush to break a PvE game, in PvP being able to convert money quickly to buy weapons, ammo, and supplies over having to earn them in game can be game breaking for those that enter with limited supplies.\n\nPros-Decent Graphics (not AAA)\n-Control\n-Free-to-play\n\nCons-Money accrual is punishing\n-Crafting patterns\n-EA bugs/crashes\n-Business Model is PTW by design for PvP (little to no affect on PvE servers).\n\nRecommendationI wanted to believe the developers and support this game but the business model is deceptively a PTW to line the developer's pockets.  Until which time changes are made to either stop converting real $$$ for IGC or weapons are no longer sold, I cannot recommend Aftermath as much as I wanted to.\n\nIf you like survival games and do not already own H1Z1, Miscreated, or DayZ and only want to play on a PvE server then give it a try as it is FTP and BM does not affect PvE.  However, if you want to play competitive PvP, stay far away unless you plan on spending money over and over again for a competitive advantage.  There are plenty of other games in this genre to play that offer balanced gameplay without the PTW BM.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527631789","September 27, 2015","false","7.2"," 438 of 506 people (87%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","87","438","506","28","10"

Today, I got to my first in-game store inside of a safezone. I can sell a compass I managed to scavenge for $13. To buy the same compass from the store costs $1540. A bottle of water costs hundreds of dollars. Generally, any piece of junk you can find in the world is costing thousands of in-game dollars; but after nearly 10 hours of gameplay you will only manage to find about $30-40. Prepare to fork out over $10,000 for the rights to buy a gun.... and what you have is Romero's Aftermath.\n\nIf you don't pay into the game, don't expect to get equipment.\n\nIf you're free-to-play, your incentive is to go play on a PVP servers to 'gank' some poor sap's equipment b/c there is simply no other way to do it. Similarly, expect little cooperation from other people when their first inclination is to murder you in PVP for whatever you're carrying in the hopes of finding that 'nice thing' you might have.\n\nThe attack animations are garbage, and choopy. Zombies appear to take damage between swings, at random unconnected intervals. I've seen better animations in Morrowind (think 1990's game graphics- those graphics beat this game's graphics). It's a humiliating display of developer inneptitude.\n\nEnvironments can't be interacted with, not a single door or window can be closed. Items lay about, upon the ground, or sometimes floating in the air. I find the lack of environment interaction alarmingly simplistic. The graphics are complete garbage to be honest, the textures equally garbage.\n\nThe market economy, though is the deal-breaker for me. I can't even enjoy the game for what it's worth if all my actions are ultimately worthless according to the jacked-up prices. As free-to-play, I would be destined to be a cold-blooded murderer if I ever wanted gear worth having and that's not my playstyle.\n\nI gladly uninstalled this game with no regrets. I only regret the few hours of my life I can't get back.","October 11, 2015","false","4.4"," 194 of 236 people (82%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","82","194","236","11","2"

TL;DR\n\nI went into this game with a thought of hopefullness that maybe.. just maybe they finally did one of their games right despite all of the negative reviews already. After my game finished downloading I launched the game and registered, then it crashed. I didn't think nothing of it and tried launching the game again, only to find out it wouldn't let me because the game was still apparently running.. when it clearly wasn't. So after a good five or so minute wait, it finally let me back on the game. I spawned in and immediatley crashed again. After crashing I had to wait another five or so minutes and then finally it let me back on. I spawned in this time without crashing only to find one of the most horrible looking games I have every played. It is clunky and the looting system is nothing to write home about. I set all that aside and decided to try to make the best of it. I ran into the nearest town, found a gun with no ammo (even though it said I had ammo, it wouldn't let me shoot) and ran into two guys. I had aquired a bar of soap while looting before meeting these two gentlemen and decided to try to make friends with them. I told them that if they could spare me some supplies, I could give them a good time and drop this fine bar of soap I had just found. They yelled some spanish words at me and started beating me. I ran away to try to evade these guys and another random fellow also yelling spanish words at me joined the chase. I ran for a good solid minute until the unthinkable happened............. I crashed. Getting a black screen but still able to hear what was happening in the game, I listened helplessly while these 3 banditos beat me to death with shanks.\n\nTL;DR Don't bother with this game. Through some form of witch craft they managed to make an even worse game compared to WarZ or ISS despite this game still being in beta. If you download it you will only be disappointed by many crashes, a poorly executed game, and random bandits with shanks that kos.\n\nOh and one last thing I forgot to mention...

The combat system especially; as long as you're roughly facing a zombie from anywhere from a foot to seemingly 10 feet away, just swing your fists or melee weapon and you'll be sure to hit them. However, whether they'll go down in three hits or thirty is a complete mystery. Standard survival game stuff otherwise -- search for items, craft helpful objects, explore, etc. -- but a real low budget version of your typical survival game.

I simply saw Free To Play and though eh why not... I played for maybe about 45 mins and decided not to proceed anymore for the reasons below.\n\nThe game is boring. Simple as that.\n\nThe zombies off 0 challenge.\n\nThere is nothing to really collect or rather should I say nothing worth while to collect. There were about 50 cars where I spawned in at. The cars had the exact same loot. I started with a 24 pack and had it full within 2 mins of playing the game. I tend to do this on most games so it didnt really seem like a big deal until I continued looking for items. They were all the same. You could easily disassemble them into crafting ♥♥♥♥ but HOW? I mean you take broken glass right clikc and not its glass pieces. You take Drain X and right click now magicall you have chemicals and plastic... There is no sense in making a craft game if you dont have reasonable reasons to the crafting mechanics lol.\n\nI couldn't create an ax without the blue print. Then I would need tool, wood, parts, and a tool box... WHAT! i searched for 30 mins to find 2 parts and i would need 2 more of those and then the rest of this ♥♥♥♥ just to make and axe.... Mind you I would need the axe to get wood as well. In most game it is a little dumb to attack a tree to get wood but it makes more sense than tell the user, "well we arent going to stock your spawn with anything even resembling something useful in the game."\n\nI tried for 45 mins to find something good about this game, unfortunately the only thing i really found good was that it seemed pretty ..... smooth.... i guess. I mean i never had any stuttering of the screen. The zombies seemed to move right though it was kinda wierd their attacks going from above my head to the ground lol..... Odd that they have to sway their entire body just to attack. And the fact that every time i attacked the zombie it bounced back so in the 45 mins where i killed about 10 or more zombies i got hit 2 times. And that was when i found a better weapon that my hands or the knife i was given off the start lol. It did more damage but honestly was ♥♥♥♥ compaired to just punching a zombie to death and never being touched by the zombie.","October 10, 2015","false","0.7"," 96 of 125 people (77%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","77","96","125","12","4"

HOW awesome is that?\nI haven't found any game-breaking p2w elements... yet.\nServers with 120 slots.\nArtworks looks stunning.Cons:\nSame as WarZ/Infestation.\nBad graphics/optimisation combo.\nBad game mechanics (7 stabs with a hunting knife to kill a zombie, really?)\nPoor level design.\nU can't enter some buildings.\n[/td]    [/table]            Gameplay        This is my first priority. I don't care about the graphics, if the gameplay is great. Well, it's not so bad, but the worst in the zombi survival genre.\n- First of all, your character is an unskillful, clumsy, noob individual.\n- Hard to find a proper melee weapon. If you lucky enough to find a hunting knife, well... that won't change anything. You still need 7-9 punch to a zombie to kill him. 9 if the zombie leans and your character miss the punch. You can reduce that to 5 punch in first person. Dear Devs, Even Hershel Greene could stick a knife into a zombie's head. Why my dummy character can't do that?- Most of the stuff just useless materials, specially in the beginning when u don't have recipes to build stuffs.\n- You have to find recipes, there is a similar idea in Miscreated, but you can't buy them for REAL money in that game. You can here.\n- Have I said your character is dumb? He can't even make a campfire without recipe. OR a nailed baseball bat. He don't deserve to live in this situation. He is not zombi-post apocalyptic proof.\n- You won't be able to find guns in 1.5 hour. Actually that's not so bad, just irritating.\n- Backpacks, backpacks eveywhere.\nWarZ/Infestation?        Is it WarZ/Infestation with a different name?\nBasically, yes.\n- Zombies are the same. They used the models/sounds from WarZ. They should have made new zombies for this game.\n- The UI is new, but works in a similar way. Actually, WarZ/Infestation's UI was better, and looked cooler.             It's a f2p game, let's see the P2W elements.        - Most of the items are cosmetics, u can't buy guns if I'm right. But u can buy recipes for crafting... in a basebulding game. I can imagine how hard is to find recipes for your base.\n- You could rent servers in WarZ with passwords, so you could loot your server for gear, and kill everyone in other public servers. There are no rentable servers in this game, but you can buy legendary account. If you have legendary account you can join legendary servers. Idk what is that, and what you get for your money, but if they set the loot spawn rate higher on legendary servers, and they let you to join with that gear to casual servers, that would be p2w. I hope they won't do it.                Graphics/Optimisation        Graphics looks bad. Some people say, because your PC is not enough for this "beauty". Well... just look at Arma3, i thought that game has the worst optimisation. I am able to run arma on high with 45+ fps (stable 60 fps in better mods) and that game is a beauty. Just look at it. I can run this game in DX9 High-Med with terrible fps. And the game just looks bad. The textures, the props would be great for a game in 2005. I think the optimisation won't be better. They recommend i7 and gtx 970 for this game. There are way prettier games with better optimisation and lower requirments. Like Miscreated (that game uses CryEngine guys!)\nEven H1Z1 looks way better.\n- Bamburg and other citys: 20-35\n- Forests: ~ 30 fps\n- Deserts: 45-60 fps        Level Desing        There is an old Mayan saying: get a good level designer, and your game is already great. Actually, no one say this, but a good level designer can give a great atmosphere for games. Specially for zombie or other post apocalyptic games. I'm sorry, but I have to say, the level design is just poor.","September 29, 2015","false","1.8"," 101 of 135 people (75%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","75","101","135","29","1"

It is a blatant copy/paste of WarZ code and assets. Zombies come at you like they do in silent hill, except it's not intended. They lag and warp and stand right in front of you doing no damage. The loot system is one of the worst things I've ever encountered. You will spend hours collecting rubbish and maybe the chance of finding a blueprint to combine said rubbish into some crappy item. The world itself is unimaginative. It's a gigantic desert with some cities and camps here and there. It's ugly, and that alone would make me stop playing the game even if it was better.\n\nIt's the same developers. The only thing they did was drop the Publisher. Sergey, the "master of games" is still in control of the entire operation. Artemis "Sellout" Knives now has a 'developer' tag  and spends most of his lonely existence on the forums and replying to reviews making sure anyone who thought it was good gets their balls fondled.\n\nFor anyone who knows his past, he was just a random streamer who thought too much of himself. He wore a ragged old pimp hat that looked ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, and his neckbeard appearance just made me want to facepalm. In his mind he was the greatest thing to happen to WarZ. He made videos and posts about how corrupt the developers were and how bad the game was, until one day he decided to switch sides and become a "Developer". Unfortunately, the only thing he can do is stream himself exploiting in video games and pretend to be a "personal chef". (we all know he actually lived with his parents) He is in no shape or form a developer, coder, or anything that actually requires technical skill. It's just a tag, probably becauase Sergey wanted him to stick around and feel important.\n\nThe only reason it's worth downloading is so you can give it a negative review and save the world from this abomination.","October 17, 2015","false","1.6"," 157 of 223 people (70%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","70","157","223","38","9"

Infestation: Survivor Stories).\n\nGRAPHICSI wouldn't be surprised if most of the assets came directly from WarZ: the models are unpolished, the animations wonky, the cities and towns bland and the forests boring. The performance is also very bad, and I hardly ever got 60fps even at the lowest settings and resolution.\n\nGAMEPLAYIf you have played any other game of this genre, you know what you're getting: an open world with both zombies and human players, item and resource scavenging, crafting and overall survival. What this game does best is creating a huge map with many locations, a small amount of firearms and good food and water meters. But the rest is done terribly.\nThe combat is broken, with even the worst melee weapon stunning a zombie instantly, and the crafting is nonsensical. Also going from one part of the map to the other is extremely boring, and an auto-run button is really needed, with some journeys taking even 20 minutes.\nThankfully, the community is pretty great, and I've never been killed by another player that I encountered. But that isn't enough for saving a gameplay that is mostly unchanged from WarZ, and with even worse micro-transactions.\n\nCHALLENGEThe good aspect of this game is that your water and food meter will deplete very slowly, unlike other games in the genre. The bad aspect is that the zombies are way too easy to overpower, and you will probably die because you fell from somewhere or you went AFK for a couple of seconds.\n\nSOUNDFor some reason, the zombie sounds are inconsistent and repetitive, if they even play at all: once I was surrounded by the most quiet zombie horde I've ever seen. The sound effects are also very weak and the main menu music is basically nonexistent.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThe best aspect of the game: you will spend a lot of time playing this game and trying to survive, but only if you are a fan of the genre, otherwise there is nothing special about it to make you come back.\n\nOverall, even though the game is F2P, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone especially because you have to create another account and you might also have problems connecting to a server. Even as a fan of the genre, I was disappointed by the developers, who are also shutting down negative criticism and made some players pay 50$ to buy a F2P game.\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 3\nGameplay: 4\nChallenge: 5\nSound: 2\nReplayability: 6\n\nENJOYMENT: 3.5\nFRUSTRATION: 7\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","October 2, 2015","false","3.8"," 103 of 154 people (67%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","67","103","154","25","2"

First off, I played PvE, which makes this game have potential. Good amount of zombies to kill, crafting is there, building is there, so it's like a mix of L4D meets Rust.  But this game has much to work on, animations for one, the Zombies walk as if they are in a strobe light. You can easily kill a zombie 1 on 1 with fists or a knife just by croutching.\n\nNow this is really where the game gets really bad, You can enter forts or bases that are clearly military ( nothing but military zombies and fortifications inside ) but yet not find a single gun, or even ammo. Also Zombies don't carry a single thing, how is that possible? Oh wait one out of 2000 did a giant create that I have to pay to open!\n\nWhich now makes me put 2 and 2 together, can't find guns, but Zombies drop gun creates that need to be paid for to open.\n\nThis right here is what is ruining the game, it uses the worst P2P model ever, it's just wrong, they should have only made you pay for cosmetic items, people would buy it if they want it. I mean lets say you find heavy armor, you could pay for a cosmetic mod that makes that armor look like space marine armor, not to mention gun cosmetic mods, gun skins, hat colors/ skins, shirt colors/ skins, list goes on.\n\nIt's sad that it seems to be a trend between Russian/ ukraineian devs to just favor a faction with no actual balance  or true to life data ( WarThunder ) Promising things that never come ( Survarium ) or straight up ripping off their supporters.\n\nSo, with that I would refrain from paying a dime, i would even say don't play this, but that's your choice.\n\nAlso a message to the dev's/ Your supporters/ customers make or break you, without us you're nothing, start listening to what we have to say.","September 27, 2015","false","3.4"," 49 of 65 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","49","65","3","0"

I'm going to review this game as neutral as I possibly can, but I will be touching on some very strong opinions because of my past with this dev team. So be prepared for that. If you want to know what I think of the game in a "I can't read that much" fashion... skip to my final verdict at the end. Also note that although my time here is only 1.5 hours (on Steam) I have played this game out of Steam prior to its release here.\n\n\nOverview\n"Romero's Aftermath" is developed and self published by a spin off group named Free Reign Entertainment. I say spin off because the majority of the dev team came from War Z/Infestation Survivor Stories. Some of them were existing devs from the start, some joined further into the War Z project, and now, some are obviously new. The "lead" or head of all of this is none other than Sergey Titov. You will remember his stellar leadership paving the way for War Z which is arguably the single most controversial title to EVER hit PC Gaming.\n\nThat said... this is an open world, survival horror game. There is rumor that George Romero has approved of the use of his name in the title... but I wouldn't count on that lasting after he learns about this game and the dev team. Most people turn and run as fast as they can when getting involved in this group. That all said, I will try and be as neutral as I can be for the sake of the review.\n\n\nGraphics\nI reference graphics early on because a significant portion of gamers wont touch a game unless it's top tier standard in the graphics department. Well then look no further. If you're one of those types, don't bother downloading this game. The textures are extremely sub-par. I'm not entirely sure if this engine is to blame or the lack of dev experience... but they are exactly the same as War Z was which is a 3 year old game. Nothing has changed. I don't understand why the devs can't improve on something which was poor the first time around. Anyway, don't expect to be blown away by anything here.\n\n\nStoryline\nNow most survival games have almost no storyline. But plenty of open world games do. So while this game is both, it has no story at all. Don't expect anything in terms of questing, bits of story (like newspapers), NPC's, or anything else that would add weight to the game. It is kill, or be killed. You can do a bit of base building, but ultimately you need to go out there and gather supplies to survive.\n\n\nSide Questing\nThere is a sort of side quest system in place that allows you to complete "objectives" in a town like getting a generator fixed, that will give you a reward. But, don't expect to profit much from this, and certainly don't expect much in the way of depth to the "side quests".\n\n\nCombat\nThe meat and potatoes of this game is the combat. The majority of what you'll be dealing with, is combat. Whether that be killing AI zombies, or other players if you choose the PvP server... you will need to fight at some point. The store page talks about being a trader and such... but that would be near impossible without a little bit of fighting first.\n\nThe mechanics of combat is pretty terrible and clunky. The animations make it hard to really fight well. It's pull sniper duty, or spray. You can try some low level tactics with other players... flanking and the like. But the engine and how the game plays leaves little room to really enjoy the combat. It's mindless killing.\n\nThe Zombie AI in the game is horrendous and makes combat with them impossible. You just swing or shoot and at some point the AI dies. Coupled with the terrible performance (see below)... don't expect much in the way of ENJOYABLE combat.\n\n\nSkills, and Upgrades\nWeapons can be "upgraded" (attachments) and you can get skins for them. A LOT of skins in fact. If this is something that interests you (like Counterstrike players) then you might actually like that aspect of the game. The player too can be "upgraded" with various skins (all sorts of clothing items from hats to masks to shirts to pants). So if having a slightly unique appearance (not a long of ways to change your face and body)... then you'll have fun grinding for cash or paying for the in-game "premium" currency (GD)  to get the items.\n\n\nGame Performance\nI run a PC with the following specs:\n\nAMD FX-8370 (8 core CPU) @ 4.01ghz\nG.Skill RAM 16GB @ 1600mhz\nAsus GTX 960 2GB\nWindows 10\n\nThe MOST frames I pulled with the game nearly maxed out... 15. The average frames I pulled looking out to nothing was around 10 or so. Which even for a beta, is absolute trash. I was so frustrated with this latest version of the game when attacking a zombie at 8 fps, that I had to stop playing. I would have at least given it another 30 minutes or so... just couldn't do it.\n\nThere's also a LOT of pop in with graphics. Especially player gardens that seem to pop up within 50m or so. It was surprising and annoying. I was not at ALL impressed with how this game ran.\n\nI talked about clunky animations and due to the shart performance, the AI was laggy, clunky, and impossible to combat. I had to struggle at 8fps to run circles around the AI just hoping that between slideshows, that I was hitting something.\n\n\nFinal Verdict\nThe history of this dev team is going to weigh down on how their game is received and probably the future of it. Don't expect this game to set standards and raise any bars at all. With it's ridiculous fps problems (which is sub-par for most dev teams), poor animations and lacking combat... this isn't a game most people will enjoy.\n\nThere are some interesting features (skins and such) that some people might like. But it doesn't balance out the issues the game has. Even if it is in a beta state, this game is severely struggling and will continue to struggle.\n\nThe only thing going for it, is it's free. But there are some pay to win features that ruin that for most people. While you can't buy guns and ammo with real life cash like in War Z, you can buy blueprints. That's a HUGE advantage vs a player who spends nothing. Which plays heavily on multiplayer.\n\nIn the end... do I think this is a game you should get? No. If you want to play something for free with absolutely no intentions on committing to it... try it. But it's not worth it if you ask me.\n\n\nPost Review Update\nI just thought I would let everyone know that as of this morning I was banned from the Aftermath forums. This is the second time the War Z devs have banned me from a forum because I have openly criticized their game. This ban is for one month (which is pretty extreme for the Steam forums) because I disagreed with a player who stated that this dev team is the best and so is the game.\n\nI have to wonder if the devs aren't going around voting down critical reviews of the game while banning people that otherwise might speak out against the problems its facing just to keep the public opinion positive. Pretty disappointing that this group of people haven't changed a single bit. I certainly wont give this game another chance and certainly wont be trying anything else this dev team puts out in the future.","September 25, 2015","false","1.5"," 60 of 84 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","60","84","4","6"

Rocks and houses look decent enough altough some could use some work, The only thing i could agree on about this is that trees are freaking weird they just dont look right but really in the end, im paying more attention to players running somewhere near it than actually looking at the trees so in all summed up it really doesnt bother me at all\n\nPeople who are saying that there are so many cheaters must only play for -15 hours as they would be on novice and you will meet more cheaters there, once you can go in Veteran i literally have not met a single hacker, Anti-cheat seems to be doing an OK job could always be better ofcourse but no anti-cheat is perfect every game has and always will have some hacker in it no mather what you do,\n\non the matter of it being a Pay2Win game i totally disagree with everyone who says this, before i put money in the game i already had more than enough off everything, i just wanted more And lets be honest everyone likes more :P But what im trying to say is the game can be perfectly played without ever spending money on it, The blueprints you can buy are all findable in the world, it might take you a bit but they are there, and if you cant find one you could always trade for it with another player, the only thing i dont like to much is the limited GI i mean i filled my 100spots within a week filled with bullets, backpacks Lvl4 and up, scars, Mx-tac's, shotguns, M9's so the only real reason to spend money on this game is to upgrade your GI, Case keys can be found randomly on the map, or by killing zombies, and so far i already found 6-7, Big stash chest's and Trick or treat chest's can also be found on the map so if you say its Pay2Win i'll just say You got bad aim son!\n\n-Pro's;\n-Quick and easy switchable person view (1st and 3rd)\n-Easy to use base building\n-Liberating (a very nice concept)\n-Crafting system wich makes you adventure ( if you really want to make those Fruit smoothie's better go look for a plan :D )\n-Free2Play!\n-Easy playable with friends, with party's of up to 10 people\n-15-20 hours of novice wich will help you stack up a few items before throwing you in the big boy Pit (and if you really dont wanna wait all that time just stay in the safezone for a bit while you go do something else, stack up those hours boy! )\n-Oh and did i say Free2Play?\n\nCons:\n-If you have to run from one corner on the map to the other say North east to South west you better make sure you have a book to read as it will take you quite some time ( should easily be fixed once cars get added back in to the game)\n-takes some time to get used to the shooting mechanism with the bullet drop and max effective range and all that, but when you play for a while you will get used to it very quickly\n-the fact that in the chat window there is a "Clan" tab but has litterally no use is a bit sad (but will surely be added later in the game)\n-Graphics (wich could be a turn off for some but really im fine with it)\n\nThis is my very first zombie survival game so i dont really have anything to compare to or dont know anything about the ♥♥♥♥ that happened with Warz/infestation but in my eyes this is a very fun game, first time i really got into a zombie survival game, the game is more about the Battles with other players than it really is about surviving wich i am really happy about, ofcourse there is room for improvement as there is for every game, but i have high hopes for this one, its gonna make it far but people should give it a chance,\n\nHope you found this usefull and i made you reconsider to give it a shot, its truly worth it\nTo the Dev's keep up the good work there's still some work to be done but you are doing a great job :)\n\nPS: My first review be gentle :)","November 25, 2015","true","472.3"," 414 of 704 people (59%) found this review helpful 69 people found this review funny","59","414","704","69","52"

Romero, the master of zombies whose name is on this, but his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ son, George C. Romero, I've edited my review.\n\nFlatly, this game is awful. There's no easy way around it.\n\nThe sound doesn't work half the time, by this I mean that when you swing your fists, expect a sound to play about every 10th swing. That's just one of MANY sound bugs.\n\nThe graphics are absolutely awful. As many other reviews and a quick Google search will show you, they're mostly just copy pasta from their last game, which was also a massive flop.\n\nIf you're like me, you want to ignore this review and download anyways. Don't. Just don't. I did and it was a massive waste of time and it barely took 15 minutes to download and install. I still regret that loss of time.\n\nOnly postive thing about this game, it uninstalls.","October 9, 2015","false","3.6"," 54 of 87 people (62%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","62","54","87","10","5"

Most items are just random things like Drabo, Tide, Rope that has no meaning other than to break it down into base crafting ingredients, leaving you with little interactive fun.\n\nWeapons are too common, in my two hour stroll through 2 cities I found 4 guns, tons of ammo and too many melee weapons to count. Everyone is armed to the teeth, if you know whats good for you, stay inside a house, barricade it up and just grind the insanely fast repawn of items.\n\nAlso tons of bugs that seem they should of been fixed long ago, like not being able to use their slow website to reset a password you know you have correct (lmao I had just played, wrote it down, tried typing it in 10 times with error, this is funny)\n\nPersonal Rating: 1/5","October 3, 2015","false","2.5"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","16","20","5","0"

You never have enough room,  I scavenged the tools, parts, etc to make a locked storage container,  but when i crafted it, all the ingredients disappeared and no storage container.  I like the idea of their crafting system but too many glitches.  Also liberating the areas is a great idea, but having to gather all the zombies and kill them in one fatal swoop.

I was lucky enough not to die yet (so no idea if they kept the X Hours death timer) but so far it's strangely average\n\n- The world feels very empty\n- The Crafting System is very hard to get in (need to find the Plans beforehand and plan spawns are random)\n- The combat seems to basically be : Do 100 damage to a Zombie's head ( thus 5 hits with a 20 damage weapon)\n- Graphics are subpar\n- The "grind" feeling : Stuff costs an AWFUL lot. I managed to find 16 $ (in game money) ... whereas some items costs as much as 40000 $ for non combat items (like pants and shirts ... such as seen on one of the screen caps)\n- The "pay to win" feel : You can actually Buy Gold Coins with Real Life Money ... That you can Trade in For In game Money. So there is a way to actually buy gear In Game via the cash shop. So i don,t feel like it,s honest to say the cash shop Only serves for skins.\n- Many bugs\n\nWould I recommend the game to my friends ? Not Really\nWould i give it a shot and see if the devs actually work on the game to make it better ?

I played this in beta (because I sadly bought I:SS when it came out and they gave a code to ex-players) and I will say that the game was polished since, but only the gameplay. Romero's Aftermath is very similar to Infestation: Survivor Stories by it's graphics and the incredibly bad sound effects aswell as the overall boring gameplay.\n\nI do not recommend this game or any game made by Sergey Titov and his team, who have given up on making good games a long time ago. They release half-♥♥♥♥♥ games and only cash in on the genre of their game (Open World). Infestation: Survivor Stories was released in the wake of the DayZ mod's popularity and they cashed in on the fact that the market was empty, as DayZ:Standalone had yet to be released. Now they're pulling the same deal but with H1Z1's *supposedly* future F2P model, as that market has yet again no competition.","September 27, 2015","false","0.5"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","18","29","2","0"

If you want better weapons you have to buy it with in game currency which you would have to play for more than 2 months to find enough. There is more detail to the gun than your charecter. and the ammount of people there is on one server. pros: you can find scissors easy. You spawn with a flashlight. When the storage is not broken it has a free gift in there for you when you are new to the game. it is practicly not a pay to win. zombies are hard to kill in packs only. So this is what i could think of. But this game could be better if the developers try to fix the major bugs and redesign the movement and speed of the zombies.","September 29, 2015","false","13.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It may have been fun if it wasn't so hit or miss with the programming, but that just really was a buzzkill. Not to mention all I did was spend most of my time searching/looting for crap to convert into crafting materials I couldn't make anything into. I'm sure if I spent several hours doing this repeative process I would have had enough to make something more than just a campfire.

Ok so in the begining the game is sorta fun, but REALLY easy. You find ALOT of guns ,and ammo everywhere. If you play on PvP servers just LEAVING the safezone is literally walking to your death. Most frustrating part is when you find a pretty good gun and you run to a safe zone and get shot up. I was SO excited to get this game in the begining but now I look back and think why did i waste my time on this game? But hey why not give it a shot, eh? Go ahead and waste your time on this excuse of a game. Don\'t say i didn\'t warn you. Goodluck!","June 1","false","35.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

Just research Big Rigs, War inc, Warz, Rise of the Badlands and most recently Burstfire your soon see what this company/devs are all about.\n\nThey never fixed random server disconnects, game freezes, failed to join server issues, game crashes, public game servers could be down for anything from 1-5 days but also private servers and no refund was offered for your lost server time or even an apology, hackers (Encouraged these with everything they did or didn't do), the glitchy zombies, glitches in the map like walls that you could walk in and out of resulting in people hiding in them and waiting for people to walk by to shoot, the amount of car bugs they had in the game that would kill you was beyond funny whoever designed/implemented the cars should of been fired he obviously has no ability, they made the game more unstable as the months went on, they downgraded the server host which led to laggy servers yet increased private server prices, added graphic patches that mean't alot of the players could no longer play the game completely destroyer peoples fps, loot getting stuck in trees or walls etc, having your gun go through a wall or fence etc that could be shot, gun not firing in third person mode when too close to a wall, zooming in with your gun or binos would make your camera fly up in the air, reloading glitches, removing servers without telling anyone and people would lose their lockers and loot inside of them, removing private servers that people had paid for without saying anything or offering a refund, the game was completely pay to win unless you had a decent sized clan to run around with and kill for gear from the poor suckers that brought gear pretty as much all the best gear didn't spawn in the world or very rare, banning innocents, their total lack of professionalism on the forums to their fan base, lies and false advertising over and over, the total lack of communication with the player base, their useless customer suport that was always copy and paste responses and basically not giving a F*ck.\n\nThey are a disgusting company and shouldn't be allowed to operate in the gaming industry but unfortunately they are so all I can do is say play this game for free but please, please... don't spend any money on it.","September 30, 2015","false","0.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I generally avoid looking at reviews before playing a game to avoid being influenced to feel a certain way before forming my own opinion of the game itself, although I kind of wish I’d read the ‘mixed’ reviews of this game…\n\nNevertheless, before I stray too far from the topic at hand – My experience playing this game.\n\nMy eight minutes of playtime went as follows:\n•	2 Minutes spent making an account to access the auxiliary downloads\n•	1 Minute spent performing auxiliary downloads to access the game\n•	1 Minute spent selecting a server from a ‘wide variety’ of servers\n•	3 Minutes playing\n•	(1 minute total loading screens ETC)\n\nI spawned into a heavily detailed… Sorry, sparse, low poly and lazily textured landscape, with what I’m presuming was meant to be a derelict street with rusted cars parked along either side with various spoils hidden inside them (the usual; empty bottles, bandages ETC)\n\nAs most new-spawn players do, I grabbed everything I could out of lack of knowledge as to how complicated any crafting in-game is… Better to be safe than sorry… The loot spawns were fairly normal as I stated above, just bandaged, water bottles and fairly useless junk. However, as I approached the brow of the hill, a sedan was parked horizontally across the street, and what was in the car, I was astounded to see, amazed, in awe. Both at how amazing it was, and how bloody ludicrous is was.\n\nIt was a pineapple.\n\nA FREAKING PINEAPPLE.\n\nOh and it was so huge that it was nearly clipping through the vehicle model.\n\nLike, imagine a normal sedan, with a 4-foot high pineapple in the drivers seat.\n\nI wanted it, it would be mine. My pineapple! AdhesivePineapple!\n\nI reached out with a shaky, excited hand, and just as I was able to brush the spiky leafy things on the pineapple… I was shot by a player infinitely more equipped than myself. I Collapse to the floor, and frantically try to find the key to use my microphone to cuss the player into oblivion, and then he shot me again.\n\nI quit the game.\n\nSUMMARY:\n•	SPENT 5 MINUTES DOING SETUP AND LOADING SCREENS\n•	PLAYED FOR 3 MINUTES\n•	GOT KILLED BY A PLAYER\n•	DIDN’T EVER SEE A ZOMBIE\n•	QUIT THE GAME\n•	UNINSTALLED\n\n10/10 The only aftermath I've experienced playing this gamewas the annoyance of spending my valuable hard drive space on such utter twaddle.","February 26","false","0.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","7","10","5","1"

Although I know diddly about high specs, coupled with the fact that I just got this gaming pc the other day, I found the low frame rate a little odd seeing as how I can play Skyrim on ultra with no problems. Then i figured that skyrim has no network aspects to it as you play...so I went and played Planetside 2 with no drops in frames. I dont think its my rig...\n\nAbout 10 minutes in my frame rate stabilized. Things certainly got better after that, but I had a few stutterings that I am going to assume were network related on the game's end (as a note, havent had any stutterings on Planetside, Warface, Warframe, or Dirty Bomb). Less than 30 minutes in and the game doesnt seem all that great to me. Figured I would start off by doing the stabby stabs to zombie's heads to almost get laid out by one zombie with Commando lunges. I dont need to go through that again...\n\nOddly enough, seeing as how the sole purpose of my getting a gaming pc to begin with was for the performance consoles so sorely lack, none of the above completely turned me off from this game. The lack of any kind of "this is how you do this", even a little bit, got on my nerves I will admit, but I figure that might be par for the course for most survival MMO's these days. What turned me off was that I was disassembling items in the hopes of getting chemicals for some health items, disassembled a tube of glue and got a wheel of plastic.\n\nTube of glue....gave me a wheel of plastic. I think the non logic of that was a sign, because then the game crashed.\n\nSorry, no dice for me.","September 30, 2015","false","0.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There's one other issue i have and thats the fact i can't launch the game anymore after 80 hours of gameplay unless i do a forced shutdown on my computer (press power button 10 seconds).\nWhilst i'm waiting for a fix i would give this game a 9/10.\n\nEDIT: There are people who complain about this game being a 'running simulator' i can tell you this is not true. You are able to reach key destinations in just a few minutes and if you are in a group (The grouping system is GREAT!) you can always group spawn on your friends. If you are one of those who do not have any friends i am sure you will make some ingame. And if you do not like pressing shift there's always the option to press Num Lock which makes you run without even having to touch your keyboard.\n\nEDIT 2: The bug has fixed itself and my game launches properly again.","November 4, 2015","true","110.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

I am sure there was content that I didn't experience. All-in-all has the potential to be a great game but really should not have seen Steam without drastic overhaul. The first issue that ruined this for me was the sound. Yes, the sound. I would be looting in a house with my headphones on when suddenly I would hear a zombie sounding like they were having an ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Others sounded constipated. The god awful running around would keep the same noise regardless of terrain. Unless it was grass. So for the gameplay it wasn't too bad. It reminded me a lot like Rust and H1Z1. It has a neat crafting system except you have to find blue prints for the most basic items. It also requires you to spend a lot of time looting junk or break down into crafting supplies. Fix the crafting. The combat was dull. It took me 30 stabs with a butcher knife to kill ONE zombie. No thanks.\n\nNow, what I really liked in this game is respawning and the ability to have a map that shows location. After you die you can select a general area to respawn in. This saves 20 minutes running across a large ♥♥♥ map. The map location was refreshing and I hope future apoc sandbox games follow suit. Also, throw in some vehicles. I have no idea why in almost every apoc sandbox game cars magically go extinct and mechanics forget how to work on cars. I mean I can construct a complex explosive but not fix a car? Cmon. This game is far from being polished and maybe in a few months I'll come take a peak again.","September 25, 2015","false","2.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

After 30 mintutes pf playing I still had no idea what to do. Everytime you die you are respawned somewhere else. When you quit the game and come back the next day, your on the other side of the map.\n\nYou can't travel fast to any place so you have to run, which in between cities is boring as there is nothing to do.\n\nI eventually got a Level 4 backpack and a few usfull items, well would have been useful if I didn't need blueprints to make simple items. So I kept them for when I do find blueprints (which was very rare in my opinion)\n\nIn the city "Luton", I had my Lvl 4 backpak stocked up well, and then I died climbing a roof which had barbed wire stopping me that I couldn't see. Once I spawed (a few miles from the city) I ran back to get my backpack. Only to find I couldn't pick up my Lvl 4 backpack anymore and was stuck with my Lvl 1 pack. I could loot my own items from the backpack but didn't have enough slots for all 30ish items. Which ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me of as I spent quite some time gathering everything.\n\nSafe to say, after this I uninstalled it.\n\nDon't waste your time with it!\n\nGo outside and play instead!\n\nPeace Out!","January 3","false","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You just collect crap and then break it down to get more crap that you cannot use without finding the rarest thing in the world.\n- Lots of flashy backpacks, guns, armour and there is ZERO chance of finding them. Want some cool stuff pay for it.\n- Environment was really flat. It looks nice but there is no interaction (opening doors etc) and it breaks the game down a lot\n- Animations lag behind a few seconds and same for footstep sounds. You swing your bat (cause you never find a gun) around and its like 3 seconds later you hit them.\n\nThe game has a nice protential to become something small, but it lacks so much.

I liked the fact that this one has also a PvE Mode involved and is for free so i could just have a look at the genre.\nAfter installing the game and starting it first thing happened... it crashed because i don't had enough disk space left on my OS partition (i installed it on my gaming partition). Ok, after that i freed some diskspace and it worked. Still wanted to try this one out. So i started a new game. The graphics are not really good, but i wasn't expecting to much as it is free. I was starting in one of the save camps in the south. Forgot it's name but it doesn't matter. In the camps we're absolutly nothing to loot so don't bother to even try to find something. After leaving the camp i found myself in something that seems to be a desert. At least the buttom looked like it could be sand (i was playing with best graphical details). I ran arround a little and looted some of the small camps and killed some of the zombies nearby. You will just find Zombies near any POIs. Pretty quick i found out that the Zombies won't hit you if you are just standing in front of them holding the Mousebutton to hit them. So not much survival there. I came through 2 towns before i reached the main city in the middle (probably in 6-7 ours of play). I had found 3 weapons at that time. 2 of them needed munition i haven't found once during playtime. At least the Shotgun we're usefull. I also found some blueprints, but none for any weapons. Just a lot for building different vegetable patches. Which weren't really useful. But the worst thing of all we're the main city, which made me stop playing. From the distance you'll see a lot of big buildings which promises some nice loot. But when you reach it... A lot of the big buildings are just deco. You can't enter them! And when you found a stair or something to enter a apartment complex there are no arpartments to enter. One of the bigger buildings which you can enter had 5 floors (from outside it should have 30-40) with nothing in the rooms except some loot in the edges of the rooms laying on the ground. I recommend to spare you're free time playing something else. Maybe this game will be playable and fun in 1-2 years but now it isn't.","October 2, 2015","false","10.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've been playing for only a little while and I had to go to the forums to figure everything out. Sure, a tutorial would take time and effort, but it's well worth it. I was on PVE and it was a server with only 7 people, including me in the 7. I had about 5-10 FPS. Not to mention whenever I would try to send a message to the people in the chat, the message never goes through or it takes 2-3 minutes to send.\n\nIt's free, so definitely give it a go if you like the DayZ-esque games without the price, but I'd still recommend DayZ in the long run. (I haven't personally played it but I watched a few playthroughs, prompting me to find this as a related game)","February 27","false","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Seems a bit like Pay2Win. Also many of those skins look familiar to weapons/skins of CS:GO.\n\nI played this game with a friend but somehow we couldn't find the names of each other and couldn't add us in the friendlist which was weird.\n\nWhat I have seen so far:\n-Bugs, I mean i jumped on a Table and got stuck in it. Really game? There was no way to get out of that and I lost all my stuff then.\n-Graphics are alright\n-The Zombies are not that smart. I felt like they didn't even really try to kill you because they just looked at you and let you kill them. (Which took a crazy amount of hits before they died!)\n\nAll in All I would say, don't download this. It doesn't make fun and I don't think it will ever do.\n\n10/10 would deinstall again.\n","June 5","false","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This ones for you.. Very few types of guns in it. Ammo for half of them is rare. Most the guns are only worth breaking down to get "parts and tools" <-- remember those words as we go.\n\nFind other things in the world.. Which you can do nothing with... But break them down for more "parts and tools" o.O Seeming a pattern here....\n\nWait.. Something good... Liberate a city and get air drops :D :D To get the same worthless guns.. That you break down... For "parts.... and tools......"... Lots of knifes that do hardly no damage... Knifes are worthless.....\n\nOutfits :D That has to be good right ?.. -.- Spend $30... End up getting the default items the game gave you in the start... Have to open chests for clothes.. -.- and it picks what you get... Spend another $30 :) Surely Ill get it this time... -.- More copies of things you already had....\n\nBuild a base :D Thats GOT to be good... -.- Forced to stick a statue in the CENTER of where you wanna build.... But its explained as you go. Very limited on the things you can build,  -.- Few walls.. Only one box storage per claim -.- Cant sort your items out into different chests... (food, or building, or crappy guns...)\n\nAh just go back to looting :) but.. then looting gets you nothing but parts and tools -.- and looting values are now dropped to basically nothing for PVE players... Even PVP players hardly get nothing.. They are trying to force you to buy their legendary pack, which is worthless, and gets you nothing but "PARTS and TOOLS" slightly faster...\n\nThe whole game... Is all about parts and tools... and how much money they can trick you into spending for worthless junk...\n\nSo about the "PARTS AND TOOLS!" There must be a reason for so many right ? Build your base walls.. Build your shack in the middle of those walls since you cant build actual custom bases. Run out of the very limited things your able to build... and just keep saving those "parts and tools" Its all the game has for you to do in it.\n\nBut MAYBE if the devs that did a live broadcast for a map they never let out after promising it for a month, spent time working on the game instead of on CS:GO as he was on the broadcast for this game... Then the game might actually have some content other than "parts.... and tools...."","December 21, 2015","false","163.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

The moment I tried to join the server it said I was kicked for no apparent reason. I looked at one tab to see if there even was a character creation and I was unpleasently surprised at the boat load of microtransactions. So needless to say I was quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥. So I tried looking in my settings to turn the resolution down to better fit my monitor but all there was is 180 and 720 not like I'm saying anything bad about that its just that it looks ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a monitor like mine. My resolution is 1280x1024 and it looks horrendus on the game even at 1280x720. So I finally got into the actual game there was no inventory ui no menu ui all I got was a grey screen with my character behind it. I tab out on accounts that windows was asking ot verify the program so I clicked yes. I went back into the game only for it to crash and leave my desktop broken.

Where do I begin. Well the minute I loaded this game up I knew I just knew that it was a mess. The UI for the main menu is terrible the character creation (or the lack there of) is like George A Romero sweet tart ♥♥♥♥ fart. The moment I tried to join the server it said I was kicked for no apparent reason. I looked at one tab to see if there even was a character creation and I was unpleasently surprised at the boat load of microtransactions. So needless to say I was quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥. So I tried looking in my settings to turn the resolution down to better fit my monitor but all there was is 180 and 720 not like I'm saying anything bad about that its just that it looks ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a monitor like mine. My resolution is 1280x1024 and it looks horrendus on the game even at 1280x720. So I finally got into the actual game there was no inventory ui no menu ui all I got was a grey screen with my character behind it. I tab out on accounts that windows was asking ot verify the program so I clicked yes. I went back into the game only for it to crash and leave my desktop broken. This game had some potential but dont let the free gameplay of this peice of garbage fool you it is a broken buggy disgusting mess. 1/10","September 29, 2015","false","0.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

After creating an account, briefly creating a character and selecting a server I readied myself for the apocalypse.\n\nI spawned at the edge of barren desert town. I expected my journey to be lonely, hard and arduous; and so I ploughed on. I started by walking towards a large factory like building and caught the attention of three zombies. I needed to act, and fast. I needed a swarve and brilliant maneuverer, so I jumped on the roof of a car. This somehow stopped a group of ravenous, flesh hungry killers. I decided on my next plan action, I needed to make a break for it, so ran round a corner. This seemed to do the job. I moved across the street into a house and came across a firearm, a rifle of some sort, what luck I thought to myself; although to my dismay there was no ammunition. Never mind, a magazine would undoubtedly turn up somewhere as I looted the houses in this small village. I put the gun away and walked out into the rear garden, making a turn I started towards the next house. There I was, a freshly spawned, mostly unarmed survivor. All I had to my name was an empty water bottle, some bandages and an unusable rifle in my backpack.  A loud crack sounded behind me, a hole appeared in my head and I fell to the floor. My character had neither the adamantium nor healing powers of wolverine, so I was finished. Three armed assailants entered the garden, fondled my body and walked off. That was the story of my life…\n\nAll three minutes and  forty-three seconds of it.\n\n10/10 The only aftermath I’ve experienced playing this game was the mess created after my bowels shot fecal matter everywhere.","February 26","false","0.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","4","7","3","0"

Managed to fight two zombies to get in, Looted a little bit, Killed a zombie it dropped a weapons chest, Oh my lucky day, but it was one of those TF/CS crates that can only be oppened with your real life money. Meh, I didnt expect a gun so quickly anyways, also I probably wouldnt of gotten ammo. Searched further down and I heard this massive growl. Now what I can only assume was a freshly spawned horde comes in, naturally I leg it. There pathfinding was poor so when I got abit away while they were learning if you could walk over train tracks I decided to check my inventory again. What sounded like a shotgun blast in the earlobe scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me and I look around. No-ones there. I get shot again, what the hell. I back into the corner with a lot of cover and knife some zombies who found me but didnt dare walk near my corner and simply let me stab them. Died of what I think was blood lose.\n\nGG was only to assume this would happen on a pvp server. Second life. One flashlight and ♥♥♥♥ all else. why?\n\nMy last words on this is, This is another one of those "Russian Survival Games" since zombies are too stupid to be a threat and the russian speaking bandits are everywhere and your probably in atleast one of their scopes at any given time. This isnt the games fault but im pretty sure we have all had less than pleasent experiences with russians in particular in survival games. Maybe they're too good or just more prone to agressiveness. Who knows?\n\nI might change this to positive or atleast add more details as I put more hours in. but thats only if.","November 20, 2015","false","1.3"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","10","19","3","0"

After playing about 20 hours, I decided to stop playing after once again running into the problem which has taken I:SS to its grave. Hackers. When originally starting this game, I decided that if I encountered more than 1 hacker, i'd quit straight away. This didn't take long, with several players no-clipping through buildings to kill me and my friends.\nSome other problems I got frustrated with included:\n- Pay to Win aspect through 'Stash Chests'\n- The overwhelming frequency of 'Case Drops'\n- The poor rewards from city liberation\n- Terrain and collision model errors (causing bullets to hit invisible walls midair)\n- Low variety of weapons and ammo types\n- Lack of cars/trucks (not once did I encounter any of these)\n- Unusual craftables, with somethings being craftable that shouldn't be, and vice versa\n- Extremely low performance\n\nHowever to credit the developers, they did do some things pretty well:\n- Range of materials to disassemble (this was a nice touch, but for the size of the map, this needed to be expanded more)\n- Bandit system enforcing banditry as a risk\n- Uncommon ammo, as you'd expect in a zombie apocalypse\n- Good town/location distribution (walking was not as frustrating as in I:SS or other similar games)\n- Powerful melee weapons (this really helped even the gap between new players and ones who were already geared)\n\nOverall, the game feels like an alpha version, unfinished and unpolished. Given time and a good development team, it could have turned into a wonderful game. History says that this won't happen with Aftermath though, and I don't expect it to.","October 10, 2015","false","19.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Grease and line a 24cm round springform cake pan.\nStep 2\nSift the flour, cocoa, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl. Set aside.\nStep 3\nMelt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water (don't let bowl touch water). Cool slightly.\nStep 4\nBeat butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. With beaters on medium speed, add vanilla, then add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Pour in cooled chocolate and beat until well combined. Beat in a third of sifted ingredients, followed by a third of the milk. Repeat until all ingredients are incorporated, beating until smooth.\nStep 5\nPour mixture into the pan and bake for 45-55 minutes until risen and a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes, then invert onto rack to cool completely.\nStep 6\nTo serve, spread the icing over the top and sides of the cake using a hot palette knife, then decorate with chocolate curls.\nStep 7\nTo make chocolate ganache: Melt 150g chopped good-quality dark chocolate with 125ml pure cream and 20g unsalted butter in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water (don't let the bowl touch the water). Stir until well combined, then set aside for 30 minutes to cool and thicken before use.\nStep 8\nTo make chocolate curls: Using a palette knife, spread melted chocolate 2-3mm thick on a hard clean surface such as a glass chopping board or marble slab that you can move. Stand at room temperature until almost set. Shave curls using a peeler or palette knife, pulling towards you at an angle. If the chocolate breaks, it is set too hard - leave in a warm place until more pliable. To make small curls, simply run a peeler along the side of a block of chocolate.\nFind recipes that make the most of seasonal produce in our spring collection.

After seeing mixed reviews, I decided to install the game. As I got in the game, it prompted a screen that required a login. After creating my account, it took me to the main menu. And like most games, it takes my system specs, and makes the game playable (somewhat.) A few minutes, post-gameplay, I noticed a couple issues. The combat just doesn't work well with this game, to be honest. The developers just didn't really take their time developing this Free-To-Play title. I honestly thought this game could've had some potential, but I guess the reviews were right. Don't waste your time installing this Free-To-Uninstall title, you'll find yourself regretting it.","February 13","false","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The looting felt epic and exciting, the loot tables seemed to be well balanced too - after the 10 hours I thought I had a pretty good horde of items. Then I decided to buy a few of those boxes from the store.... this is where the game really let me down, I realized that all those hours of looting were wasted. I have enough high end ammo and guns in my global inventory to last me a month of YOLO. I will never have to do loot runs again. Basically if you have $10 in your steam wallet the value of items in game will be worthless.\n\nSad to say that this game is P2W :(\n\nIf it switched to just cosmetic items I would deffinitly return to playing, but for now this gets a thumbs down.

However, how the character responds to controls is a whole different story.\n\nDue to very basic artwork, any upclose encoutner with a zombie would be full of surprises.  I could not gauge how close I could be to a zombie without getting hit.  The weapons would sometime hit the target from one distance and then from the other.  But this was something I could probably have lived with.\n\nHowever, the blue screen of death errors caused by this game was what completely turned me away from it.  First day playing it I get an "IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL" error.  My system is midgrade so I checked to see if recently updated graphics driver was causing the error with windows 10.  To my surprise in the system event log there is no error recorded prior to shutdown.  Next day I get a shutdown with "VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE (igdkm64.sys).  Now mind you I am running dual GPU system with onboard Intel Graphics used for non-gaming purposes.

So, how the hell do I get an error on the onboard chip if it shouldn't even be utilized at the time I am in the game??  To top all of it off, I go back into the system error log and again there is nothing recorded prior to the forced shutdown.\n\nI've run nearly a dozen games on this machine with a lot higher demands for harwdware than this game.  Not one caused a full system shutdown.  At worse, my Nvidia would be shutdown while playing Sniper Elite V2.  Why in the world would this game with such low requirements cause blue screen errors???\n\nThere is no way I will continue beating up my system for a game that is at best mediocre.

After seeing mixed reviews, I decided to install the game. As I got in the game, it prompted a screen that required a login. After creating my account, it took me to the main menu. And like most games, it takes my system specs, and makes the game playable (somewhat.) A few minutes, post-gameplay, I noticed a couple issues. The combat just doesn't work well with this game, to be honest. The developers just didn't really take their time developing this Free-To-Play title. I honestly thought this game could've had some potential, but I guess the reviews were right. Don't waste your time installing this Free-To-Uninstall title, you'll find yourself regretting it.","February 13","false","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I did this 3 times and its about 2 minute load time.\nThe graphics are ok, they could be better.\nI've only crashed twice since playing this game.\nA lot of people have been complaining about the sprint option not draining stanima....well yeah, when your only real means of getting around is by foot, jogging kind of takes too long. Even when you are sprinting it takes awhile to get where you are going.\nwhich brings me to another point: The zombies are dumb. You can out run them, you can find a car or rock to stand on and kill them without taking any damage, they are alittle rough when it comes to chasing you. They are easy to kill as well.\n\nA few things I hated to see. I could find guns and weapons but you cant sell them. I can buy binocolers for 850 but the sell price is 50? It will take awhile to buy anything good.\n\nAnother thing I would like to see changed is music...there is no music or ambient sounds. I know that seems small but it makes a difference for me atleast.\n\nOther than that, I get a good 80 FPS out of towns and cities and I get roughly 50 FPS in cities.\n\nI like the game, I think its fun, I havent tested any of the building features yet but it seems cool, I think having to find blueprints is a good challenege although others will diagree.\n\nI rate this game 8/10","October 7, 2015","true","29.1"," 67 of 134 people (50%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","50","67","134","11","4"

But as far as pve is concerned this is a good game.  Made great if you also enjoy the social aspect of gaming.  If not, this game isnt for you. The pve community has always been cool and open to helping out new players, far more so than 99% of other games I've played. But that doesnt mean you can just hop in the game and start telling people to give you stuff and they'll do it. You wont have fun or get much of any help at all going into it like that. If you come into the game not begging for stuff immediately or try attacking everyone you see (it's pve you cant hurt anyone, you just look stupid) for no reason, you'll find that there's more to this game. I can honestly say I've met some of the best people to enjoy gaming with online here. And still having a lot of fun with it\n\nThe only negative i would have to say is the dev could really be more open the happenings to the community. For example waiting for this next map update. Telling your earliest supporters of the game that its coming "when it's reasdy" isnt a way to keep their support. Especially after having them remove all the things they've put their time into building.Nothing good comes from  them siting wonder when they can use what is a huge portion of pve again. I know several people who have just moved on, that most likely would have stayed had some effort of communication even just a reasonable time frame been given to them.

Or maybe closer to 1.2.  The majority of resources appear to have been ripped from WarZ (yes, it's "infestation" now), just like they did with WarInc before that.  Zombies are still the ridiculous-looking creatures that run with their arms at their sides and use the same (bad) animations from the previous game.  In fact, all the animations are simply dreadful.  I would expect this from a game over a decade ago or a team just starting out, but but the only conclusion at this point is that they're simply incompetent or don't care.\n\nSounds and animations are no better than previously, with a lot of sounds being completely inaccurate to the source.  For example, punching a glass door sounds like a gunshot.  Attack animations don't match up to the hit detection in the least and you'll very often have no idea why you took damage or why you actually hit/missed the zombie with your attack.  Trees "blow" in the wind with a motion as if they're one of those novelty robotic dancing flowers.\n\nItems still float over a lot of surfaces (yet another thing they never got working in the last game).\n\nTextures are laughable and, while I don't care about graphics in a game as long as it's fun, seeing visible 'seams' from where things are stacked on top of each other is just stupid.  Some things, "zombies" included, still sit halfway into the ground or whatever object they're supposed to be on top of.\n\nIt's still one giant walking simulator, with it taking me well over 15 minutes to run from one area of any note to the next and the actual 'survival' aspect is still almost nil, since items (food and water even) are plentiful if you head to any noteworthy location.\n\nThere appear to be plenty of craftable items, which can be a plus.  Variety of items is actually something I kind of liked in the previous game.  PVE servers can be fun for a while, if you're the exploring/looting kind of person, as I am.\n\nI'm willing to call it an improvement to the WarZ, but not in any real way that makes it a much better game.   The biggest plus I've found is that they didn't con money out of anyone because there's no (required) cost to play.","November 15, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

How about you stick to one game and fix it so it actually works and is enjoyable to play instead of releasing broken games and stealing money of customers.\n\nCannot run game to many issues with connecting to servers to update or run game, game is broken and even if you disable all sercurity, WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT EVER, game still wont connect to servers or run!!!\n\nHow about instead of changing names and releasing the same rubbish you actually keep the name and fix the game before releasing a rebranded one and never finishing a game!

Backpacks, come on you seriously need us to empty the pack before we can move the pack, wtf.  Game play is clunky, game mechanics with lag are complete crap, wait till they fix more of it before you waste your time trying to play this game.\n\nIve been trying to play this game for a few weeks now.
