No problem, just play with freeplay on.\n\nSo it does fix the two biggest complaints about Metal Slug 3's Steam version. How is the game itself? It's a bit easier than Metal Slug 3. That doesn't mean that it's not challenging though. I've played it now twice from start to end, once in single player and once in multiplayer.\n\nThe game runs a bit more fluid than MS3, but it will still slow down when the screen is full of enemies and you and your friend both have laser gun. The music does fluctuate a bit. Only noticed it on the China level, as I was otherwise too busy trying to keep myself alive. It's nothing major, but some players will notice it.\n\nI have only played the multiplayer once now, but it didn't have any desync issues. Menus are a lot better this time around and the port overall seems to be higher quality than MS3.\n\nI preordered it at 5,99€ and I'm not sorry about my purchase. I'll end this review here and go back to play the game. See you in multiplayer, maybe?\n\nHere's some gameplay, if you want to see it in action:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=321403889","October 2, 2014","true","10.5"," 133 of 140 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","133","140","2","3"

If you haven’t played this before expect to die every five seconds but the chaos on screen and barrage of death is actually part of the fun!\n\nIf you are wondering whether to get Metal Slug 3 or Metal Slug X my advice would be to wait until they are on sale and get both! They are both very good games and it really just depends on what mood you’re in and how much time you have as to which game to pick.\n\nMetal Slug 3 is a longer game overall and a slightly more difficult one too. It has a little more variation in the type of enemies that attack you, at least from level to level and there are branching pathways to explore. There is more variety with some flying and underwater levels and a greater amount of craft and animals to get in/on to mix things up. This along with more actual levels to fight through at the end stages bulks the game out more.\n\nMetal Slug X is a more streamlined game that takes less time to complete and is a little easier overall. It has a more linear level design and more opportunity to pilot the Metal Slug tank itself. This perhaps gives it a bit more of an early arcade experience and possibly provides a little more flow to the feel of the gameplay. This is also good if you’re looking to squeeze some side scrolling Shoot ´Em Up action into a busy day or don’t feel like spending a great deal of time playing.\n\nBoth games have enough differences (as well as positive similarities) in level design and feel/vibe to warrant buying/playing them both if you like this genre of game and it really is more down to what frame of mind you’re in to which particular one you feel like playing. They are such enjoyable, well designed games to play it’s hard to say which is better. I do suggest you get both but I guess if I had a Heavy Machine Gun pressed to my head and I had to choose only one then Metal Slug 3 might come out on top by a (POW´s) whisker but I would miss playing X too.","February 14, 2015","true","17.4"," 59 of 60 people (98%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","98","59","60","5","0"

Sadly, there are again port issues, such as the sound of a level occasionally stopping but a single noise looping. When there is intense action and a huge number of sprites on the screen, slow-downs can be experienced.\nOn the other hand, unlike the Metal Slug 3 port it is possible to have more leeway on the number of credits allowed to play the game (from 5 credits to infinite credits/lives) (Edit: this has now been patched in Metal Slug 3, allowing infinite credits as well).\n\nDespite the imperfections of the port, Metal Slug X was and still is a great and fun game.\nI used again the HQ4X filter to "remove the aliasing"  http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=321706061\n\nWhat would I want to see now from DotEmu/SNK Playmore?\nFirst, a patch on Metal Slug 3 to add the few features added to the Metal Slug X port (Edit: this has been done, awesome!). Then, a patch to correct the port issues on both games.\n\nWhich other Metal Slug game would I want to see ported?\nHonestly, the two greatest ones (X and 3) are on Steam so the others are dispensable. Metal Slug 1 would still be the next logical choice I guess. And then... Metal Slug 6, which is the only one that added some variety and crazyness to the franchise after the great Metal Slug 3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/312610/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","METAL SLUG X is an upgraded version of Metal Slug 2. This game made it's way onto PC late last year, but has actually been out since March 1999. This remastered version aimed to increase the difficulty and resolve a couple of the technical faults the original had.\n\nSome of the other improvements such as altered music, more variety on power ups, as well as day/night versions of all of the levels.\n\nThe gameplay in METAL SLUG X is almost identical to the other games in the series, it is a run and gun side scrolling platformer. I played METAL SLUG 3 earlier this year, and it felt as if I was just playing that again in terms of gameplay.  At the start of the game you can choose how many lives you have depending on how you want the game to be. Throughout each level, you'll need to help prisoners escape captivity as well as find power ups and weapons for your character.  Each of the weapons have their own feel and have their own advantages and disadvantages so you have to choose wisely.\n\nDifficulty wise, METAL SLUG X is as hard as you want to make it, personally I played through it on Normal difficulty but with unlimited lives - this essentially means you will finish the game since you can just keep dying over and over again without any repercussions apart from a lower score.  The hardcore gamers out there will probably enjoy the fact you can set your self to have either 20, 15, 10 or even 5 credits per run through!\n\nEach stage has its own atmosphere and feel to it, which is something which a lot of side scrolling games like this has. I personally enjoyed the Egypt style level as if you get killed by a Mummy, rather than dying, you actually come back to life as a Mummy yourself, which was a nice little feature to see.\n\nA full playthrough of the single player story took me just under an hour, which to be honest was a little disappointing. I would of at least like to have seen this last at least two or three hours but you can get more mileage out of the game if you ramp up the difficulty I suppose.  We also see CO-OP making a big play in this game as well, you are able to play local or online co-op of the story mode which is something I always like to see in games.\n\nI had no major issues while playing, you can play METAL SLUG X in higher resolutions at 60 fps, not much more you can ask from a game like this.\n\nThis game is something I will recommend, but only with the warning on that you have to want to replay the game on higher difficulties or play co-op to get your moneys worth out of it. If you just want to play it for the single player story, you aren't going to get your money/times worth out of the hour long single player, OR, wait for this game to hit the sales, I managed to get mine for mega cheap on the summer sale, so the £1.99 price tag was well worth it for me.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afndWP444pE\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

New online multi like 3 has, leaderboards, and a new feature I love of unlimited token-play. As for the game, the Metal Slug franchise is SNK's attempt at there own Contra. Super C being my favorite Contra, the Metal Slug games are a superior throwback to a genre much under-appreciated. The difficulty is a one-hit concept per life, like the Contra series, and asimilair it can be beat without a hit and features many one-hit enemies. With blistering detail in every sprite, tons of power-ups (4, and vehicles), and enemies that surprise you. The only con in the whole game is the lack of multiple paths that 3 has. If you've never noticed, these games have a story going on that is pretty hilarious, no spoliers. A great game if you are dying for a good challenge and a great game for a kid or if you drink too much like me.

You know, once I've written a review of one Metal Slug, I could just copy and paste them for all the games. I know the developers sure did when it comes to art and animation, but with a style so great it was the wise choice to use assets from the previous game. Metal Slug X is a modified version of Metal Slug 2 rather than the tenth game in the series.\n\nThere's a lot new to the game that's fresh from its predecessor. Metal Slug X becomes a parody of itself. Rather than a game full of strict action and a few chuckles here and there, this game brings charming absurdity and laughs.\n\nThe story is simple, again the world is in danger and you need to stop him. Like all Metal Slug games, you can bring a friend for some cooperative action. There is online multiplayer, but no one is using it. The big twist with Metal Slug X is rather than saving a world, you turn unite with the enemy to face the greater evil evil.\n\nAt the start, there is get four characters to chose from. There seems to be no difference between them and if you get a game over, you can chose a new character. Each character starts with a pistol, a few throwable bombs and a jump. You can fire three directions and four if you jump. Getting close to an enemy and attacking will perform a melee slash which is also good for cutting larger projectiles out of the air.\n\nAs you progress through the levels you'll face off against mummies, and later wall crawling sewer ghouls. Mummies, mummy dogs and bats have the ability to turn your character into a mummy. This constricts you to a pistol and slow movement. Jumps feel stiff because you're wrapped in bandages. Rather than throwing a grenade, you can throw your head instead.\n\nAlong the way, you'll pick up items for points; things like fruit, pigs, cats and medals. If you eat too much food, pigs or cats your character will become fat. This makes you move slow, but your bullets are much larger as a trade off. It will still get you killed in an instant. Metal Slug is a sluggish game in general, but getting hindered by obesity is a sure fire death sentence.\n\nThe game in general is just a death sentence, but a fun one. The screen fills with enemies and projectiles so its easy to die with how stiff your character moves. Its all that great animation weighing you down. Since this is a home version of the arcade game, there are several different difficulties and a free play mode that gives you unlimited continues. Once you complete the game, it tells you how many continues you used and then you can multiply that by quarters you would have spent in an arcade machine.\n\nThere are more vehicles in this game than the previous. Instead of just the Metal Slug tank, you can now drive a camel through the streets. The camel performs a lot like the Metal Slug, but you're susceptible to dying while you're mounted the hump. The a new mech is a good one to pilot because it has twin guns that are more accurate than the tank or the camel. Last, but not least is the jet that lets you fly around and fire missiles.\n\nAnother thing that sets this game apart from other Metal Slugs are the environments. The first level is in an Arabian city. The second level is through a mine that turns into catacombs. There are rehashed cities from the previous game, but they manage to feel fresh with cars that explode up rather than get crushed under tank treads. There is a dark sewer and an alien base.\n\nA few of the bosses are recycled from the original game and pallet swapped. Other bosses are brand new. Things like a giant metal worm that's eating a stone tower that forces you to keep jumping up or die. You'll find many bosses that rely on you having to leap into the air and shoot down at them.\n\nOne thing I did notice about the bosses is how many bullets they takes. When you need to shoot them with a pistol and push the button for each and every bullet you fire, it turns into a test of endurance. The incentive to put another quarter into the game when its game over is the fact that a heavy machine gun drops for your next game.\n\nThe heavy machine gun fires a burst to make it more effective than just a pistol. All the previous weapons are back; the shotgun rips enemies in half at short range, flame thrower with the best burn animation of any game, rocket launcher that steers projectiles toward an enemy and a few others. A lot more weapons make their debut. A bouncing ball gun. Chasing rockets that are more agile than the standard rocket launcher. Some sort of bomb radio car that drives along the ground. There seems to be both a fat and thin laser. You can even find alternate bombs like one that ignites the ground on fire. Each of the weapons has incredible impact and is fun to use; except the pistol.\n\nTo get weapons or items you need to save prisoners-of-war that will wave you over. Once you shoot or stab them, they'll be free to walk around and then when you touch them they'll pull up a pair of boxer shorts and reveal an item within. It sounds bizarre, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI always go out of my way to save every POW; no man left behind! They will amount to a bonus score at the end of the level, but only if you haven't died after saving them. One of them tries to help you out with some fancy moves from Street Fighter 2.\n\nLike the other Metal Slug games for the PC, I have a feeling this is emulation. There's no way my beast of a computer would slow down from an arcade game from over fifteen years ago. Its designed to emulate that old Neo Geo feel, warts and all. Its nothing game breaking, but it is noticeable.\n\nYou'll find modernization here like achievements and a wide array of video options. There are controls for the keyboard or a 360 controller, but sadly, no mouse exclusive input where the middle mouse is the gun, the right button is the jump and the left button is the grenade. Such a missed opportunity there.\n\nWhile the linear ride is over in an hour, that's still twice the time of the original Metal Slug. Its a great time for any arcade game and it leaves you wanting more. Lucky for you there are so many Metal Slugs.","January 9","true","1.0"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

Metal Slug 3 is probably second, but I don't like all the swimming/flying, I prefer the traditional running and gunning, and there's more of that in this one. Also, there's a lot of chances to drive the titular Metal Slug, or SV-001, which is probably my favourite part.\n\nThe music is good as always, although slows down sometimes a little in this port but it's not too noticeable for the most part.\n\nGraphically it's a good as any other Metal Slug game (i,e., very) and it sounds like a small thing but I'm glad they bought back the original portraits in the character select screen. Metal Slug has its own unique art style, and the portraits in MS3's Steam port were alright but kinda inconsistent IMO.\n\nI dunno how the controls are for keyboard, but I use a PS3 controller with a driver to wrap it as Xinput (actual X360 controllers are the bane of my life), and it works just fine. I haven't actually tried online multiplayer yet, but I hear it's pretty well done, and it sounds fun.\n\nMy only gripe is that in my first playthrough of the game, I got 11 of 15 achievements without even really trying. I'd like a /little/ more challenge at least, although there are less grindy achievements like MS3's "play as X character 100 times" achievements.\n\nOverall, it's a great run 'n' gun game that stands the test of time, and is great value for money.","October 5, 2014","true","8.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/312610/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Metal Slug X is a remaster of the second game of the series that introduces a few new guns and enemies. Metal Slug is well known for it's action packed 2D run and gun gameplay which X further improves upon over the original. It is a far sillier game than the original and introduces outlandish enemies such as mummies and aliens to the fray. With that variation in enemies X does become more difficult since there are more than simple soldiers to fight. There are four difficulty modes and the higher up you go the faster and more plentiful enemies become.  You can choose the number of continues you start with ranging from 5, 10, 20 or Freeplay which gives you infinite continues.  Even on the easiest difficulty I would recommend going with freeplay since this game is brutal.\n\nYou can play either solo or with a friend either locally or online. Arcade mode and Mission mode are exactly the same minus having the ability to choose which mission to start at in “Mission mode”. Outside of that there isn't really any other content other than the leaderboards.  And considering the game takes about 45 minutes to beat it may be a hard sell for some. There is no real reason to replay other than having fun so that may be something to consider when purchasing. Starting off the game you are given a choice of one of four characters which play the same though have different grunting noises while dying. Which will be quite frequent depending on your skills since it only takes one hit and you are done for.\n\nOne of the unique things about Metal Slug is that you do not die from merely touching an enemy instead they need to actually attack you which is a feature that I personally love. Though you will obviously die if you touch a tank as it rolls over you. You can find much more powerful weapons by rescuing prisoners or in random crates though you lose them upon death and they do have limited ammo unlike your basic pistol. Quite a few weapons are included in X such as the Flameshot, Machine Gun, Laser and the famous “rawkit lawnchair”. There is also a throw grenade button which will be pretty much vital to be any good at the game and is very effect against the tougher enemies. You can also find a power-up that will upgrade it into a molotov cocktail though they are rare. Picking up a lot of food item makes you fat and upgrades your weapons though at the cost of being a much larger target.\n\nThis is not a bullet hell type of game and the number of bullets coming at you is usually never overwhelming. The difference lies in that you can be attacked from all directions including rooftops so simply camping on the left side of the screen and mowing down enemies will not work here.  You also have the option of riding certain vehicles throughout the game like tanks and jets to more wacky ones such as a camel with mini-guns attached to it. They are surprisingly delicate and will go down if you take a couple of hits. Somehow even the tank can jump to avoid bullets so with enough skill you should be able to mow through quite a bit of the level before abandoning ship. You will be able to eject from the vehicle when it takes enough damage or you simply want to be on foot now and go back to dying in one hit.\n\nThroughout the levels you can free prisoners that will gift you weapons and items. They give you a huge score once you save them which sounds easy but actually rescuing them means going through the level without dying after freeing him. Once you die all your previous freed prisoners are gone. Using a continue resets your whole score back to zero so it takes a lot of talent to make it anywhere near the top of the leaderboards. Unfortunately this port of the game is not so great. There are occasionally terrible bits of slow down where it feels like watching a slideshow and that will likely break your flow, getting you killed. It is a shame too. Once you see the swirling staircase in the last level instead of thinking “Oh cool” you will likely be wishing they didn't even include it so you can get a solid frame rate.\n\nVisuals  have been untouched and are showing their age though you can play it in a 16:9 ratio instead of the 4:3 shown in the Steam page. Funnily enough it does look much better than most indie retro inspired games available. It thankfully improved upon the over-usage of the color gray from the first game and added a lot more color to the backgrounds. You start off in Egypt, make your way through a cursed mining site and end up riding a train to China all within a few levels which is a lot more memorable than going from gray place to gray place like the original. The quality of the animations are outstanding from a blast of fire to the simple idle animations of merely standing around. Enemies don't just stand around waiting for you, they talk with each other, cook and even sunbathe on fold-able chairs which adds a lot of quirkiness to the game. Music is also very fitting and frantic. Sounds effects such as gunfire and soldiers screaming when on fire are quite good as well.\n\nBoss fights are the craziest parts of the game and the most difficult. They are all enormous robots and absolutely dwarf your character in size. They can very easily kill you multiple times and are your biggest obstacle to saving the Prisoners. You never know what to expect either, as an example the first boss is a giant robot with multiple forms and the second one is a robot chasing you up a giant pillar which requires a good amount of platforming. Platforming does not show up much and when it does it is very simple jumping. It is far more action than platforming. Some bosses can be annoyingly bullet spongey though which makes sense considering they are giant robots but it still gets tiresome after so much shooting.\n\nThis is one of those cases of quality over quantity. Due to the short length of the game every part of it is full of detail and has great care put in to it. Whether that is a good trade off, is a question only you the reader can decide. Metal Slug X has aged gracefully and is still as much fun to play now as it was back then. Though the slowdown caused by the port does bring it down some.  If you are wondering which Metal Slug game should you start with, know that it doesn't really mater. There is no story whatsoever though it may be odd going back to the relatively “sane” Metal Slug 1 after fighting all sorts of crazy enemies in all of the games after MS1. Overall if you are looking for a good 2D run and gun game or simply looking to kill an hour this would be a pretty good option.","June 26, 2015","true","2.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

It is one of the best classics and ports I have played and it has almost everything a Steam Game should have!\n\nHere are my thoughts on it:\n\nPros:\n♦ Great Graphics\n♦ Awesome Arcade Port\n♦ Enjoyable Music\n♦ Multiplayer\n♦ Highscores that sync Globally and with Steam Friends\n♦ Many Characters and Many different credit modes\n♦ Awesome Cards\n♦ Gameplay was awesome (Could have added an actual ending cinematic though, but won't complain)\n♦ Sidescroll shooter that just works!\n♦ Huge incentive to replay the game to beat your highscore, the global highscores or even your friends highscores!\n\nCons:\n♦ Fairly Short (6 Missions - This is only an issue if you are playing in Free Mode as it's easy to run through. However with Credits you have to try not to die which makes the game take a little more skill and time to finish)\n♦ Multiplayer Lobby seems empty (I guess multiplayer is only for friends and shouldn't need a global lobby but still)\n♦ Multiplayer seems unneeded (To me it seems pointless to why you'd want to play this with two people, but the option is nice)\n♦ Single Player Controls are weird (Would be nice to shoot with mouse left click and throw grenades with right click)\n♦ Audio seems really loud (You have the option in settings to turn the Audio to 10... I play on 3 and I can hear the game fine)\n♦ Could have had more Achievements (Such as Achievements for different difficulties and for playing as other characters etc to make you want to play on different difficulties and as other characters etc. Don't get me wrong 15 is a nice number, it was just way too easy to get them all quickly)\n\nOverall, even though I found a few cons they are really minor compared to the pros. This game has it all, Steam achievements, cards, multiplayer, Global and Friends highscores, great graphics, awesome audio, epic gameplay and to top it all off it's an epic port from the good 'ol nostalgic arcade machines! So if you ever played this on an Arcade Machine or hell even played a game on an Arcade Machine and want to relive the good 'ol Arcade Machine Days... then this game is definitely worth $8!\n\nPS: Make more of these and my wallet will be yours!","April 20, 2015","true","2.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Of Course! First of all you can choose between 4 characters (totally ininfluent, but it's nice to see the two guys from the First Metal Slug and two new girls), there are lots of new mass destruction weapons while the old ones have been improved, there are new kind of enemies, new status as the "mummy" (there are mummies that can turn you into a mummy as well just with their purple breath) and "Biiiig!" (when you pick up too much food you become fat and your weapons become more powerful, though you become too slow). More important news are the vehicles: a more powerful metal slug, a mecha, a plane and a camel.\nHowever  the most important news is the difficulty. Metal slugs are always crowded, but X is a total Mayhem, really overcrowded. It's pretty difficult not to die even at the easiest difficulty level, so this chapter is a very hard challenge.\nOf course, as usual, you can play Coop with a friend on the same computer or through Network.\n\n+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. As any other Metal Slug, the gameplay mechanics are simple and immediate. Everything is enriched by the huge amount of enemies, old and new, with different variants and specific behaviors; new weapons; huge bosses; Nice music.\nCOOP. Clearly this game is way more fun with the help of a friend and you can play both on the same computer and online. Smart move.---CONs---PORT ISSUES. This isn't the best porting ever. Seems like this chapter suffer the same issues like Screen Resolution Bugs which caused me problems if I try to set my native 1080p, as it just crops visualizing just the upper left corner of the screen, so I had to play in 720p... Which is not that bad issue as it's not like I'm going to miss high res textures or stuff like that. Another problem involves performance issues: lots of player (if not all of them) noticed there are huge FPS drops in overcrowded situations... Which is ridiculous considering the game and the "engine".\nDURATION. This is a short cabin game so I knew I shouldn't expect anything exceptional, yet I still complain about its lenght as there are still 6 missions. Even though it's a right lenght considering this is a quick game designed for quick rushes. Luckily I bought this with the Metal Slug Bundle, so I still have a way to go on B-)","March 30","true","4.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/312610/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1599 products in account","Metal Slug X was initially released in March of 1999, and it is a revised version of Metal Slug 2; both games feature the same characters, storyline, and missions. This version includes increased difficulty, as well as solutions to some technical issues that were unresolvable at the time in Metal Slug 2. Initially an arcade-only release, Metal Slug X has found itself ported to various platforms throughout the years, and it finally found its way to Steam in late 2014.\n\nThe Metal Slug franchise is a must play for any fan of run and gun arcade games, the titles are cult classics that never gained the popularity that they've deserved throughout the years. Metal Slug X takes place two years after the events of the original game, and the player can choose between a variety of four characters; Marco, Tarma, Eri, and Fio. The former two characters returned from the original entry, while the latter two were new additions to the series at the initial time of release. You will face off against an onslaught of Rebel Force opponents, an army with a brand distinctly ripped off from the Nazi logo, while also taking on various other enemies such as mummies and aliens.\n\nBelieve it or not, Metal Slug actually has a fairly well thought out storyline, and while there is no in-game dialogue that progresses this feature, it is up to the player to interpret the majority of what is happening by being aware of what is going on within each mission. The real chunk of the story can be found on the official Metal Slug website, while back in the day you'd have to hunt down a copy for the home NeoGeo that was complete with a booklet. The game itself is rather short, coming in with 6 missions in total that last for just a few minutes each; although the ending boss battle takes up a large amount of time. It's important to remember that this game was a huge quarter grab back in the day, with its high difficulty and one-hit player death, so the lack of longevity to the game can be forgiven in this day and age.\n\nThe graphics are classic and timeless 2D pixel artwork. Everything from the backgrounds, to the explosions, to the enemies and character models are deliciously detailed. Every mission is radically different from its predecessor, although there is little variety in enemies. Not to mention the brilliant soundtrack, which has everything from upbeat, frenzied  tracks to laid back, jazz inspired scores. The game has definitely aged well, and I would hate to ever see one remastered in 2.5D. Many people complain that this title has "slow downs", and while this is true, the actual in-game FPS counter never drops below 60. It's the same scenario as the Mega Man Legacy Collection, in that it's just how the game was at the time it originally released, and as such it has not been modified in order to give it that true retro feeling.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the Metal Slug franchise, here is a brief breakdown of what sets it apart from other arcade/run and gun games: While not largely based around it, the game does have a point system where you can show off your highscores; there are P.O.W.s that you can save who grant items to increase your points, and every shot that you land on an enemy also increase your score. If you die and have to use a continue, your score is reset, as well as the amount of P.O.W.s that you've saved. There are various weapons that you can gather, and all but the pistol have a limited supply of ammo; while your favorite gun will depend on your play style, you can choose from ones such as the laser, heavy machine gun, rocket launcher, flamethrower, drop shots, and much more.\n\nWhile I do not necessarily consider Metal Slug X as much of a fan-favorite or classic in comparison to the first or third entries, it's still a great installment into this timeless series. If you've never played a Metal Slug game before, I suggest picking up 3 instead of this one, however, simply because it's better and more fun (in my opinion, of course). The Steam version of Metal Slug X includes the original Arcade Mode, where you must go from Mission 1 through Mission 6 in one sitting, lest you lose your progress, and also a Mission Mode, where you can quit once you get to the next mission and then pick up on the one that you left off at. The game also features leaderboards, and a variety of difficulties ranging from easy to very hard. For those of you with friends, there is a two-player mode as well that is suitable for both local and online play. If you're a hardcore fan, pick it up for full price; if you're skeptical of your enjoyment, wait for a sale.\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","March 23","true","3.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Some improvements over Metal Slug 3 (Freeplay!), but also some changes for the worse.\n\nWe got a whole bunch of options for the visuals this time. Still the game is not "pixelperfect" (despite offering an aspect-ratio option), every odd row of pixels gets stretched. No proper letterboxing. Since the emulation doesn't work off .ini files anymore, this will be a lot harder to fix this time around. You can always blur all those inaccuracies to oblivion using the built-in filter option, of course.\n\nScanlines seem to be better / scaling properly with the resolution, but are very subtle (or something is not working as intended, which wouldn't surprise me).\n\nApart from that, the game suffers from ♥♥♥♥ poor perfomance on my machine (i7-2600 @3,4Ghz, GTX580, 16 GB Ram, Win7 64 Bit). It seems to never truly hit the 60frames mark, and has an almost constant feeling of slowdown. This time around not even running it in windowed mode helps. To add insult to injury I get some sort of "mini-freezes" every now and then. The visuals freeze for about 1 second before refreshing again. The game does continue to run even in that moment were the visuals do not refresh. Needless to say one second of not being able to react in the heat of battle basically kills the game outright. And no, these are not the built-in slowdowns of the original machine. I think there is some sync-problem in the emulation and I do remember people complained about it on the Metal Slug 3 port as well.\n\nThe sound is just as terrible as in Metal Slug 3, with songs not playing at correct speeds and soundeffects being messed up pretty badly. There is also some crackling and stutter every now and then. Bad stuff.\n\nOnline does have lobbies now and seems to work pretty good (finished one game with a random guy). Online-coop is pretty much the best part of this port.\n\nIf it weren't for the aforementioned mini-freezes and the overall sluggish/slow emulation, online-coop would make this port okay-ish. Unfortunately, in it's current state I cannot recommend this to anyone unless you don't care about the poor emulation / inaccuracies and want to take a chance on seeing wether you have the same freezing-issue I have. Everybody else: avoid this until they patch it.","October 3, 2014","false","1.9"," 73 of 137 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","73","137","0","0"

With fun and frantic gameplay, a good sense of humour, and an art style that, in my opinion, has held up very well since 1998, this game is incredibly fun. BUT it comes with its own little caviats, firstly, like the sense of humour that the game has, the controller support is a little quirky, and it seems to switch between two settings. The second issue is that there is some pretty serious optimisation issues causing serious slowdowns during the more frantic sections. The final issue is that the game is quite short BECAUSE it was originally an arcade game. Where the difficulty would extend the play time in the arcade, because the player can just continue on the spot, there is no punishment for death apart from a lower high score. But, overall, I do recommend this game if you like the old school shooters.","November 20, 2014","true","1.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Oh yeah.\n\nSo, for the new people that they never played METAL SLUG, don't think that this game have a story and things like that, this game is a shooter NOSTOP that you have to kill EVERTHING and EVERYONE that moves, so if you are not in that kinda of thing, don't touch this game.\n\nThat's it.\nThe game is perfect as usual.\n\nSo it's worth it to play?\n\nYES.\n\nSee ya and have some fun.\n\nEDIT 15/10/14:\nYes YES YES!\nThis game is what i expected from Metal Slug.\nIs very good and the game never crashed to me, but freezed sometimes when i played in Two Player Mode.\n\nMaybe is my computer, i don't know.\nAnyways, is pretty good, i finished the game 2 times and played again.\nI love this game and yeah, i don't have to say anything about it, it was pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good.","October 2, 2014","true","21.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Hopefully they'll keep them coming on a more timely schedule, but it's nice to see they made a few improvements over the port of 3 in this one.\n\nOne such improvement is an unlimited credits mode, so that you don't have to worry about seeing that Game Over screen. The biggest drawback to X is how short it is, however. And it feels less full than 3 (it is a beefed up version of 2, after all). It took me a little over an hour to play through the game. But really this also makes it a great game to enjoy with friends. If you got 60-90 minutes you can finish a fun game with your buddy who popped over for dinner; even better it's challenging to play well, but it's not going to punish you for struggling, so you can challenge yourself without the pressure.\n\nThis series defined the run & gun genre, and I can't recommend it highly enough. The price to playtime ratio is a little bit questionable, but in truth the quality of the game makes it absolutely worth it. The game has not only held up over time, but I imagine folks will be playing it in the distant future when squidy aliens really do invade.","October 13, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Metal Slug is a throwback to those masochistic arcade shoot-em-ups designed to bilk naive kids out of their quarters. Thank goodness, then, that the designers were kind enough to include a "freeplay" option, otherwise the game would not be possible past the third mission.\n\nThere are also some noticeable technicle foibles; netplay a total crapshoot being the most obvious. Also, if you hold down more than two keys at once (for instant Jump, Right and Fire) your character freezes up and utterly fails to respond.\n\nNot to harp on Metal Slug; this is a fun little game worth a few hours of play at the price offered.

Bug fixes, new weapons, a couple new enemies.\n\nNote that the Steam version is an iOS port, much like METAL SLUG 3. However, it's still perfectly playable, despite the sound anomolies.\n\nI've had as much fun with this game, and the series, back then. And 15 years later, they are still fun to play. Note that the game can be rather difficult until you learn the pattern of the game; enemy behaviour, weapon locations, hidden secrets, boss battles. Once you learn the pattern, you can usually get through each level without dying. The difference between this version and 3 is that you can now choose to play the game on Free Play, meaning unlimited continues.\n\nOnline should be the same on this game as the online on 3 - stable if you have a good connection.\n\nOverall; yes, do buy this if you love the series and have no other means to play the game. Otherwise, if you still have a working PS2 or Wii, search for the METAL SLUG ANTHOLOGY, which have really good emulation and contains the games 1-6. Saying that, show your support to SNK by buying it on Steam, if you prefer.","October 3, 2014","true","2.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I cant imagine SNK really made this. Still have my Neo Geo and my Neo Geo pocket and they get frequent use. This game is so far from what Metal Slug really is that its shocking. So, get Metal Slug 3 on steam instead of this. I couldnt believe how "off" everything was. That includes having to dodge incoming enemy bullets, mortars, missiles, et al. But, if you want to die every few seconds and have to see the "Continue" countdown every 60 seconds or less, then by all means get this volume. Metal Slug is a fairly demanding side-scroller action gaming anyways. It has always required a fast thumb. You are always ducking and dodging while having to fire at enemies. But Metal Slug X is almost ridiculous and laughable. I wonder if they had some of the Devolver folks work on this.\n\n4/10 - Still looks like Metal Slug and it almost plays like Metal Slug.

There's a wider variety of enemies and places to fight; every mission feels completely different and there's a nice twist in the final mission that had me laughing pretty hard.\n\nAction-packed arcade fun at its best\nI still remember rocking this game at the arcade when I was a kid. The best device to play any Metal Slug game is a fighstick, so if you have one, I highly recommend using it to go back to the good ol' times; if not, any controller will do, just DON'T play it with your keyboard. It's definitely an inferior experience... and this is coming from someone with a mechanical keyboard.\n\n\nCONSEmptier than your wallet on a Steam sale\nDon't even think about MM'ing with strangers, because this game is depressingly empty. In fact, I feel like there's just a dozen of us playing it from time to time. Co-op is possible, but your friends must have the game as well... and given that this is a 30-minute long game, I don't recommend buying 4 copies. Hell, I don't even recommend the game as is, unless you've got some bucks to waste.\n\nMeh port\nI really appreciate the effort that DotEmu put into this port. I really do, but there's no denying this is a meh port. If you play the game in high resolutions (and by high I mean anything above 480p), everything becomes a blurry mess. As expected, the pixel graphics aren't upscaled to the desired resolution (like in every modern pixel graphics game), and everything looks just awful.\n\n\nNOTES	Controls are customizable, although a controller is strongly recommended\nDon't pay full price for this, wait for a sale","January 6, 2015","false","2.2"," 7 of 35 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","7","35","2","0"

Unfortunately in the wake of 3's release on steam, paying the same price for what is a lesser game isn't recommended.\n\nWhile the inclusion of the iconic character selection screen (or at least part of it) in this release is welcome, the lack of a gallery mode is a shame, especially since the artwork produced by Nazca is amazing. The game also suffers from frame drops at times, and netplay in some points slowed to a near halt at times.

One of SNK arcade classics now on steam with steamworks.  Gave a gift copy to a friend and runs great on my rig with no problem. Was able to invite a friend easly with steam invite and used steam voice chat and had a 2 player coop blast.  I used a xbox 360 wired gamepad without a prob and played great. You can use keyboard/ gamepad rebind your keys to your liking. If you're a fan of the Metal Slug series you should have this on you steam library already!\n\nThis game does have multiplayer lobbies but I seen it mostly empty. Its better to buy one for yourself and for a friend to have a blast. Cause you can invite each other to play together. Its awesome that SNK brought this to steam A must buy when this game is on steam sale.  This is a very fun 2d side scroller shooter with awesome music to boot have fun!\n\nIn 2player coop it took us about an hr to play through the end on normal/medium setting.  There is 4 diffuclty settings and on medium it was pretty crazy. You can set it higher for a more challenging time.","June 4, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's amazing! If you like Contra you're gonna love Metal Slug! It's a challenging, but still fair game. If you're careful you'll survive without many deaths, which is good because if you die just once after rescuing a ton of prisoners then they won't count towards your total score at the end of the mission. I always raged after saving so many prisoners and then just getting killed because I wasn't careful enough. >_<\nI especially like Metal Slug 6 because they throw in 2 characters from the King of Fighters series, Ralf and Clark.\nIf you can find it some where you should get it too :3\nGet this game! it's awesome! :D","May 18, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The games are just that darn addictive.\n\nSNK Playmore has blessed PC owners with a port of Metal Slug X, which is basically the director's cut of Metal Slug 2. Now some people prefer the original version of no.2 because of it's less forgiving difficulty (which by Metal Slug standards, isn't say much) while others appreciate the added variety of enemy, power-up and weapon placement seen in X. Personally I enjoy X more than no.2 but hopefully SNK will bring over no.2 to make everyone happen.\n\nThe performance of the PC port is good, but suffers from slow down when things become hectic and this is more apparent during the last mission. Granted this rarely happens, so it never becomes a problem and I've seen worst lag in some of the weaker Metal Slug ports, like no.2 on the PS3. Video options include resolution, full-screen, aspect ratio and scanlines. Plus controller support with optional button mapping. Online leaderboards are also here, so you can see how bad you fared against the rest of the world. Sadly this port is just the original arcade machine, so the Combat School or Another Mission from the PS1 port are MIA. Yes the modes recycled assets from the base game, but still offered great challenges that expanded the game's replay value. I'm also disappointed to see the art gallery didn't make the cut and would love to see all the art work in tasty HD clarity (and without enduring long PS1 fetch times).\n\nThe important thing is the main game is here and it still rocks. For those who haven't played Metal Slug before, it's a fast paced, frantic 2D shooter with beautiful hand drawn graphics and catchy music. The game is only one hour long, but they still crammed a lot into these six mission. Caramels with mission guns mounted to them, alien space ships, mummies, mutants and trains that want to run over you. Bosses that try to crush you with tanks, food that makes you fat and shoot bigger bullets, Metal Slug's trademark humour is always a breath of fresh air, especially during today's more serious approach to game design.\n\nHowever this game was originally designed to eat dollar coins at the arcade, so it's brutally difficult with one hit kills happening every 10 seconds for those who don't pay attention. Fortunately the port comes with unlimited continues and adjustable difficulty. The port also retains local co-op and Metal Slug has always been a multi-player favourite with my friends. Sadly SNK just doesn't know how to make a good netcode for their games and renders the online completely useless.\n\nOnline issues and missing features withstanding, Metal Slug X's chaotic, humourous action has successfully made the jump to Steam. I recommend it to die hard Metal Slug fans or anyone who enjoys the odd arcade shooter.","June 13, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
