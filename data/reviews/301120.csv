A lot has changed since EHM 2007 was released in September 2006; not least the rise of the likes of Steam and social media. These platforms make niche games cheaper to launch and easier to market. Indeed, Eastside Hockey Manager: Early Access (or EHM:EA for short) is being released exclusively on Steam and is likely to be heavily marketed using platforms such as Twitter and hockey forums such as The Blue Line and HFBoards. Against this background maybe, just maybe, the game will become a more viable project than it was before.\n\nThis new iteration is being released as an Early Access game. The game will be continuously developed over the coming months with regular updates being pushed to users via Steam. To call it a beta version would be grossly unfair and inaccurate. The game is highly polished. It’s simply that the game will be developed whilst we play. The thinking behind this approach is to test the waters. If the game generates enough sales then it will return as an annual release. If not, then it won’t.\n\nFull Review -> http://gmgames.org/eastside-hockey-manager-early-access-ehm-ea/review/","March 26, 2015","true","49.3"," 83 of 94 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","83","94","6","5"

The reason I gave this a go was because of its low price and the fact it seemed on the face of it similar to Football Manager. Whilst daunting at first I quickly got to grips with the interface and the basics of the game, whenever I hit terminology or anything I was unsure of a quick google was more than enough to gain an understanding of what I need to know.\n\nIf you're someone who enjoys Football Manager but would like an alternative to play I'd highly recommend it, especially at the price it's at. If you love hockey then this should be a no brainer.\n\nI'd also highly recommend downloading roster updates and graphcis packs should you get the game to give yourself a more complete experience!","March 27, 2015","true","536.1"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","58","63","0","4"

In that case - the game is just for you! You can make your own God-awful decisions like an actual Oilers GM! How cool is that!\nWell.. kinda cool. Yeah.\n\nThe EHM-series was created by the Finnish Risto "Riz" Remes and picked up by the SI Games (Sports Interactive - Football Manager [the ol' Championship Manager] and OOTP-baseball-manager-thingye). That's how it's been for about fifteen years or so. And it's awesome that the few that enjoy manager-games that are just basically Excell-sheets with a bit of graphic.\n\nThe game is awesome as it was in the year 2006 (?) when EHM-07 was released. And quess what? IT'S STILL THE SAME DAMN GAME! The engine is the same and the mechanics work the same way. It even has the same glitches (the junior players refuse to sign to the team, the international games happen at the same time as the European leagues etc). Ok. The year is now 2015 in the game or something like that, but nothing much.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I love the game. I actually bought it three times when it was the crappy Sega-distribution that allowed you to install it three times and three times only. (So when you must re-install Windows - there goes one licence. Oh yay). Now it's yours eternally when you buy it from Steam but that's prolly the biggest change in the game.\n\nI know it's still an early release (though 10 years old), but I really hope that the developing theam has the courtesy to update the game A LOT or it's just a cheap way to make some money.\n\nSummary: You like hockey? You hate the way EA handles the managing-bit? Bored of Maso Hockey Manager? Yeah. This is for you. Prepare to be annoyed, though. The game has a few bugs (ok. new bugs that weren't in the earlier version, so that's a feature for the old-timers) and a cheap feel to it, but as a managing game of hockey made in the UK - it's pretty ok. Worth your money, but hopefully offers a lot more in the future.","May 25, 2015","true","275.8"," 44 of 49 people (90%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","90","44","49","20","0"

NOTE: This was after loading the real league DB\n- Selected the Flames\n- Had a mediocre first year. Ended up 4th last. Wideman was a superstar!\n- Was able to Draft Austin Matthews 4th overall.\n- Young stars played well but asked for small bridge contracts (3.5 for Gaudreau and 5 for Monahan) in the end.\n- Was able to trade assets like Juri Hudler and Jonas Hiller for young stud prospects like Kerby Rychel, Oliver Bjorkstrand and John Gibson\n- This salary dump and low contracts allowed me to get Jamie Benn of Free Agency for 3 years at 8.5 mil\n- Existing Flame prospects Poirier, Klimchuk, Anderssen and Bennett started to shine.\n- The next year with these players resulted in an early playoff exit against the OIlers, with Poirier getting the Calder trophy on a line with Monahan and Gaudreau. Damn you McJesus!\n- The second year ended up losing in the quarter finals to the Stars who went on the win the cup with Voracek in place of Benn, Klimchuk started to whine about his ice time and the Calgarian Media.\n- The third year, refused to comment to media about our chances and won the cup in dominating fashion. Majority of players were in that 24-27 sweet spot. Gibson won the Conn Smythe. Hartley won the Jack Adams\n- The following year, couldn't afford Benn despite letting an old Wideman go to free agency, Matthews wanted 5 mil a year. Managed to get 35 year old Pavelski and 31 year old Simmonds on sweet deals in free agency. So far, I'm 3-5-2 though. Feeling the cup hangover as there has been LOTS of little injuries to start the season and a T.J. Brodie 3 game suspension.\n\nAll things considered. The game is fun, largely accurate, though not fully believable in some aspects. The free agent list is obsurd. The salaries that some quality players are asking for are rediculously low. High end talent costs a LOT in dollars (8 million plus). The salary cap never goes up. There are some bugs regarding team record notifications that make no sense and are poor english. Some menus are tedious to mantain. Trade system is fairly good. Scouting is annoying as it doesn't auto reset for Entry Draft scouting - scouts go idle. I'll likely play another two seasons and stop forever, but worth it if your a GM junkie.","January 4","true","542.7"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","34","39","2","0"

The reason is that I want to draw attention to the negative sides that I don't feel get mentioned often enough.\n\nFirst of all, there are still bugs in the game. After so many  itterations, one would have thought that things like trading and contracts would work flawlessly, but nope, you'll still run into situations where you need a save file editor or create another GM just to get the game to follow hockey rules.\n\nMy other and biggest issue is with the way this game compensates. Let me explain. I've been playing EHM since the very first version, probably spent thousands of hours on all versions together. One thing you have to realize is that this game is essentially a numbers generator, working with probability and such. Thing is, if you've been playing this game long enough, you'll find ways to build fantastic teams, with (probably)  the best coaching staff in NHL history and you can pretty much win the Stanley Cup with any team by your second, in a worst case scenario 3rd season. But! The game detects when your team or player start producing extraordinary numbers, and it will start compensating to keep things "realistic". Won too many Stanley cups in a row? Well, you'll lose in the playoffs, no matter what you do (tested by replaying the same saves when things got weird on countless occasions). You'll win with the same team next year, but the game won't let you win, say 4 times in a row, just because. Same if your team is scoring too much. Built a scoring machine with 1st line level players on your 3rd line? Well, bad luck, because you're gonna get punished by periods where your team will refuse to score, until your goals scored total returns to a "normal" value, then, without changing anything, you score again. Same goes with winning games. Winning 90% of your games mid season? Well, here's a drought, it'll end once you're around 75-80%, then you'll dominate again and the cycle repeats.\n\nBloody hell EHM, let me build super teams if I want to, don't punish me for finding ways to work the system. Sheesh! What's the point in learning to play a game if it will punish me for that and promote mediocrity?\n\nOtherwise, I really enjoy this game and I value the work they put into it, it's a great game, but the compensation system can be incredibly irritating.","May 5","false","261.1"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","38","46","2","0"

Yes, I'm one of those. And yes, you can imagine which team I'm playing with right now, the Mighty Ducks.\n\nThat said, here goes the review.\n\nGameplayThere's not much to say, considering it's a management game. Being from a well known developer, mostly known for the Football Manager (FM) series, you can expect to find some FM similarities. Any ice hockey fan, with an interest for managament games, will enjoy the game and will most certainly spend hundreds of hours playing it.\nThe gameplay is just you'd expect from a managament game, allowing you to set tactics, practice, and take care of the team's transactions. You'll also be able to lose yourself with all the statistics avaiable, trying to find that change that will allow you to tweak your tactic. But don't think for a second you can just grab all the big guns and ram your way through! You can also scout for prospects and develop them, so you can later use them to win the cup, or just use them as a bargaining chip.\nIt's your game, your team, your choice. Until you get fired.\n\nPros Plenty details;\nGood trading and contract system, considering the AI doesn't scam you, or lets you scam them;\nQuick booting and load/save system;\nHas a nice number of leagues, and hopefully more will be added soon;\nThe match engine is quite good, and entertaining, with a few minor problems (see cons section);\nGood tactical interface, with a lot of options that can make or break your streak.\nConsidering it's Early Access, and they're open to suggestions, and also considering by the end of its EA state will be most likely be as polished as the FM series appears to be, I'll reduce my cons to what I've found in the actual game so far.\n\nCons Sometimes the players flip out a bit on the 2D engine, and either just stop for a couple second, or during penalties and faceoffs they just ram into each other until they find a way to go to their spot, so the play can start;\nUI could be a tad bit better, as somethings are harder to find;\nTo withdraw an offer after all the parties have accepted you've to right click the player's name and manually withdraw it, as there's no "Cancel" option on the news screen, just a confirm option.\nVerdictI'd give it a 9/10 considering it's EA status and the series long hiatus. Tons of potential.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, they don't have the licenses yet, but you can easily get a "fan made" database to "fix" that.","March 31, 2015","true","651.8"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","39","49","0","0"

EHM EA is no different.    The difference with using the word here is that this is a reputatble company, with a development team that has a huge passion for hockey.\n\nThere are some advancements from EHM 2007 but it still is very close to the same game currently in terms of features.    The AI is improved, the regen system has changed and development seems better so far.   All the old bugs are fixed, I have yet to come across any new bugs and the stats so far seem more realistic than 07.\n\nAlthough the more I think about it the more I'm saddened that SI wouldn't commit fully, It's better than nothing.   It's finally back (sort of) and hopefully will stay for a long time!   Thanks Riz!\n\nEDIT:   Expect the game to crash.

I always enjoyed various football (soccer for us in N. America) simulations but I love hockey and am so glad that a game developer has introduced (in this case re-introduced) a simulation for hockey fans.\n\nPros: The game offers a variety of setting which allow you to establish how many hats you want to wear when managing the team you take over.  You can just manage (draft, develop prospects, sign free-agents, trade players, hire and fire coaches, scouts and other personnel, salary cap) while analyzing endless statistics or micro-manage every aspect of your team by adding coaching responsibilities to your portfolio and establish in-game tactics and select game-day rosters.  The game has an active modding community.  You can download NHL player rosters or other professional league players and team logos for a more realistic experience.\n\nCons:\n- The game could offer higher resolution settings than the 1024 x 768.\n-  Also while the lower resolution does not detract from game play I have found that when I quit a game the default      resolution setting on my Windows desktop sometimes reverts to the 1024 x 768 resolution setting that the game uses (from my normal desktop resolution of 1920x 1200). Not a big deal to change resolution back to 1920 x 1200 but a nuisance.\n- In rare instances some of the historical statistics do not tally correctly.\n-  Some statistics do not export correctly to a file or printer\n\nGame Improvement:\n- I would like to see some graphical updates made to the game as some of the 2D graphics seem a little dated like when watching individual games.\n- Also would like to see when winning a cup or when a player I manage wins an individual trophy,  it would be nice to have a graphic of a newspaper where headlines highlight the achievement like I have seen in other sports sims.\n\nRecommendation:  The game for an early access product is well developed and if no further development of the game was offered would still represent extremely good value.  There are some small tweaks that need to be made with the game which is to be expected with an early access product.  With that said I can say without hesitation that if you enjoy sports simulation games, you will not regret purchasing this title.","May 16, 2015","true","407.9"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","1"

As an early access game, this is a very polished and solid initial effort.\n\nFor those who haven't played EHM, the game is a text management sim where you take complete control of a team and attempt to use your skills as a general manager to take your team to glory.  As the game is in early access mode, there are no official licenses or real players.  However, www.ehmtheblueline.com has a very nice roster set, logos, and real team and competition names that provide that.\n\nUnlike NHL by EA Sports, you are the General Manager and do not control the players during games.  You sign free agents, hire coaches, scouts, and of course, trade as you desire.  Additionally, you can set your lines, practices, and tactics.  You also can promote and demote players between minor leagues and choose how to build your team.  As you're unable to control your players directly, tactics are very important in helping you win games.  The games themselves can be viewed via 2d mode where the players appear as dots with the puck, similar to the initial offerings of Football Manager 8 years ago, before it went 3D.\n\n\nThe game engine is solid and provides a decent way to watch games and observe your players.  The minor gripe I do have with the game engine is that it does look dated especially compared with how SI has evolved its Football Manager franchise.  Having said that, the fact that this game was developed as a side project by SI mitigates that gripe somewhat.\n\nThe menus are cleaner than EHM 2007 although again, not as intuitive as the newest Football Manager games.  The other issue is that the game can only be run in one resolution which means that newer screen owners will not be able to view the game on a full screen.  Hopefully, that will be addressed in a future update.\n\nIf you love Football Manager, Out of the Park Baseball, and text sims, you owe yourself the privilege in checking this game out.  For $14,99, you simply can't go wrong.  The more people that purchase this game, the more likely we will see official licenses and future releases.  If you're an armchair hockey fan who thinks, sleeps, and drinks hockey, you definitely need to check this out.  Disappointed that your team continues to build around a questionable core?  Fix it yourself in EHM.  You won't regret it!","April 6, 2015","true","187.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

For example, I miss watching the pixel circles run around the ice surface, so I could actually see at least somewhat what my players were doing on ice, and get a sense of personality from them that you just can't get from repetitive text. I missed a tactics layer that made sense and was easy to use (which EHM has), and a trade system that made sense, and an interactive scouting system that made sense, and all the great rosters the guys at the Blue Line keep making. I just missed all that.\n\nIt took me a while to figure out a hotfix of my own to get the game running on Windows 10, which is frustrating (I love Steam, I do, but why can't you guys be more like GOG and make the games playable before you sell them to me)... but once I did, I fell in love all over again.\n\nEHM is a game I have played almost more than anything...more than Civ 4 and 5, more than XCom... EHM put me to sleep at night, head nodding over my little laptop in years gone by, because I just couldn't stop until little hours of the morning... and it still gets me that way. I lost a whole morning with the Canucks today trying to decide if the McCann/Virtanen gamble was worth it, or if I should send them back to juniors.... and watching Vrbata miss shot after shot...it was just like real-life Canucks hockey!\n\nSo here's to you, EHM, and your amazing creator. I suspect, by the quietness of the updates, that EHM on Steam may not have a long, vibrant life full of changes and improvements (I'm looking at you, more on-ice graphics, because I remember Wayne Gretzky Hockey 2 and 3), like that Other Simulator is getting, but until That Other Simulator figures out how to show on-ice play, and simplifies and streamlines tactics and lines and coaching, I'll be keeping this on my computer and playing it until I fall asleep at the keyboard.\n\n","March 9","true","56.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Sadly, that's not possible in EHM - if you don't own your arena (small teams won't) you can't expand it and you can't build one and thus you can't build up an income. Some teams will even start with 0 ticket price, so you'll never get money from home games (which means you'll never have any money - you won't go bancrupt, just no possibility to invest or pay salaries).\n\nThere are also bugs and a distinct lack of customization - hopping between different info screens because if you combine them you get 2/3rds of the info you want. Graphics and sound is poor, not that it matters to a manager game but it feels really outdated.\n\nI wish this had been in early access still, because then there would have been a decent chance of some of those issues being fixed.

If you aren't a hockey fan, and if you don't like pretty deep simulation-based games, there's nothing for you here.\nHowever, if you like those two things, EHM isn't perfect, but it is the best option in the genre. Sports Interactive know what they're doing, and EHM is no different, although it is a little barebones. It's a shame that, for what is ostensibly a new game, there's no modern features such as achievements. Thankfully it does have Workshop support, and it's here we see EHM's trump card.\nEHM's modding community is what, for me, pushes the game from standard sports-sim to something engrossing. Real-world rosters and clubs, as well as facepacks, allow for something more realistic - and thus, fun. For me, trying to turn my beloved Calgary Flames from perennial bottom-feeders into an actual force is far more enjoyable than doing it with a fantasy club, with fake players. Without these mods, EHM is pretty sparse.\nOn its own, EHM is a tough sell. Even with it's fantastic mod support, it caters to a pretty small niche. If that niche includes you, though, you'll be treated to a game that demands time and patience, but yields great reward.","April 1","true","66.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It's a game that is easy to lose yourself in and you know you want to come back to play it once you've shut it down. Even though right now the game doesn't have actual NHL rosters in, it is incredibly easily to download the real rosters and facepacks to go along with it. The Blueline website does a better job than EA has ever done on their NHL games at updating their rosters; you can expect an updated roster almost once a week during the regular season from the website.\n\nThere are a couple of problems with the game right now, obviously. The trading in the game doesn't work very well. You never see a blockbuster trade in the game and teams are constantly sending good players that are underperforming through the waivers. On my simulation Dion Phaneuf had a 50 point season but when I put him on the block, the best trade offer I can expect is a couple of 3rd or 4th round draft picks. This could be because of his salary, but I still think the game's trading mechanics need to be a little reworked.\n\nIf you are looking for an extremely detailed GM simulator than Eastside Hockey Manager is the game to get. Don't let the "Early Access" deceive you, this is a game that is easy to waste hours on and is challenging and rewarding.

The fact that they're doing literally everything they can to incorporate as many fixes; features, and updates with rosters, teams, and even more proves that this game will be timeless for quite some time.\n\nBut again, it is only a simulator so if you want the real hockey video gaming experience sadly you got to shell out the money for a PS4 and copies of EA Sports NHL every year. Every bug I've ever seen has been patched quickly, every feature I've wanted besides a few have been already put into this game. Besides no means of easily adjusting Salary Cap, Rosters, and Attributes between Playing and Non Playing staff this game has basically everything needed for a proper hockey sim. It's expanding to more and more leagues, and they even update the rosters regularly.\n\nIt's nice to see a game having such support for such a small fanbase, even the Workshop has all the facepacks you could ever need. So far it's kind of a slow start out of early access, but this simulator has limitless potential in the long run.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nEverything is aesthetically pleasing and as cohesive as it needs to be, with the Workshop addon it's easy to get the team logos you want without much fuss. I've ultimately no complaints with the GUI, as everything works as intended and should.\n\nEngine: 9.5/10\nThe speeds are as fast as they've ever been with as good looking of a GUI as you can get, completely optimal in every way. Injuries for some reason seem more reasonable, but still far too common. There must be an option to either increase or reduce chance of injuries, because I feel for the entire NHL league they are FAR too common.\n\nCustomizability: 6.5/10\nThe game is fairly basic even now, as I previously mentioned in my Early Access review there's no real way to edit the leagues completely. I'd love to be able to add, edit, and delete teams from leagues just to experiment around with them. Usually simulators like this will have a sandbox-ish feel, but I feel fairly limited to original concepts which doesn't really have a "refreshing" effect if you think about it. It'd be nice to at least edit rosters, and staff however - you can import EHM 2007 databases which you can edit at your own will but to be frank that's quite a bit of a hassle.\n\nSome more open modding support would be awesome as well, or at least - more settings to tweak. Few more complaints is there's no way to edit rosters, staff, salary caps, etc... It feels less like a "Manager" more like just a "Be A GM." This isn't to say the simulator isn't accurate and doesn't meet it's intended purpose, but Simulator and Sandbox are something that go hand-in-hand. Especially when you're trying to make things interesting, and have fun with different ideas. I raised this to a 6.5 from a 6, because a lot of the bugs preventing personnel customization and hiring were fixed (like hiring physio's + scouts from players.)\n\nInterface: 10/10\nThough the resolutions you can use do not have the ability to be custom, there are new selectable resolutions! Basically all the standard resolutions, but it's so nice being able to just play 720p on my third monitor. The GUI is quickly responsive, and very intuitive. Easy to learn after a few clicks around, and nice to look at. I use the minimal GUI without pictures, background images, and news images to speed up the sims a little. Still looks great, and runs very smoothly.\n\nFunctionality: 10/10\nAlthough some of the resident errors still pop up every once in a blue moon, there are no crashes I've found yet. You can usually just mash right through the errors and the game will still continue to no fault, it's a rare a game can just work through errors so I have to say these devs did a spectacular job with this simulator.\n\nSound: ?/?\nSound isn't a necessary or objective need in a simulator game, by any means and will not be counted towards the score.\n\nOverall: 9.2\nThe workshop support is astounding, hopefully some people will make some addons relating to being able to edit rosters; salary caps, etc... very easily. Being hoinest this will probably be the closest I ever give a review to any game being this close to it's objective "Perfect 10." The support is awesome, rosters are residually updated and tweaked. Bugs are fixed commonly, and so far the game lives up to expectations and standards and even exceeds. Being honest I can only imagine this game getting better and better with time. It's not common that a game will have the ability to be timeless, but a simulator like this probably could being given the right amount of "Tender Loving Care" or "TLC" as it ages.\n\ntl;dr: This STILL was totally worth the $15 I spent on it, in short.","April 5, 2015","true","257.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You can also generalize the scouting by assigning a scout to a continent, or country/nation, or you can assign him to individual leagues, you can even assign a scout to a particular player if you'd like.\n\nGame simulation- You can choose to simply speed up games to get it over with, or you can watch the game real time and make tactical changes, line changes, etc.\n\nLine Changes/team tactics/unit tactics/player tactics- Wow. Just great. You can change defensive zone strategies, neutral zone defensive strategies/positioning, neutral zone offensive strategies/positioning, forecheck, breakout strategies, offensive zone strategies, and of course special team units like PP and PK. You can choose which player is le playmaker of the line, choose who takes faceoffs (which is great I'll explain further in), etc you have absolute control of your lines. You can also change individual tactics, so if you have two offensive players and a power forward on your first line, you can change the line to not body check often or hard, and not be aggressive, then go to your power forward individually and make him check hard, play aggressively and with a high tempo to balance out your line, or set a defensive type of player to shadow an opposing player and keep him in check.\n\nYou also have control over practice so you can train what coaches do what (coaches have attributes like coaching defensive players at 17/20, but then he might have 11/20 for coaching forwards and a poor goalie stat as well, so make him only handle defeinsive training. I believe it helps, clarification would be nice though. You can make certain player focus on an area of the game that maybe he is weak at, or boost what he's good at even more. You can have signing bonuses for games played, points, shut outs, etc.\n\nThose are a few things that stuck out that I liked\n\nCons:\n\nNow, I know you want it to be hardcore simulation, very in depth etc. But damn, it takes a looooong time to get through seasons. I want to go outside and do ♥♥♥♥ still, and have a life. I like it being in depth. Although I have quite a bit of time played, I find it extremely hard to get in to when it takes me like six hours or sometimes longer to finish the season. Just make an option to set a date a date simulate up to it. I know that's like EA NHL's simulaion, but it does work good. Or at least a quick sim game option. I know it might "dumb the game down" but the players that don't want it don't have to use it. Not everyone has time to play for six hours, although it's so good I have played for even longer in one session before. It may also interfere with game longevity, so I guess it's a choice the devs need to make. I really hope that isn't an option already that I haven't found lmao.\n\nPlayer Overall and progression- (My only semi-major gripe about something wrong/broken with the game, not having quick sim is not wrong/broken, it's just not included)This is pretty simple to understand why it must change slightly... I will have great prospects for the future, but they are young and only really strong in the physical category on the far right like speed, strenghth etc. and since they are so strong in that category, they have a four star "current rating" so if he's playing in the AHL he will be unhappy because he's rated four stars, but then I call him up, and he's a complete liability on the ice, and he does poorly in the big league, and his potential may drop or he may not grow properly. The worst part is, if you don't call them up they will get unhappy and eventually request a trade and in some cases not resign a contract so you just lost out on a valuable draft pick simply because he was being a cocky bigot (imporper use of bigot ik) that thought he was the ♥♥♥♥, then his hopes got crushed and blames it on me. If there's a way to fix this, I'd love some clarification, maybe I'm the only one with the problem. That being said, the rookies are in no way broken lol, this happened in a few particular cases. but maybe make it so that certain statistics count more towards your current rating and others less, physical category should have the "least say" in the current rating. Also, maybe have an overall stat or at least break up the stats into better catagories like defensive, offensive, physical, it is sort of like that but then teamwork is in defense (could be in both but offense makes more sense IMO) and stick checking and positioning is in offense so it's a bit odd when figuring out what type of player a player is. I don't really like the player type system either and how it changes. I draft a rookie and he is a playmaking offensive forward for 2 years, then he grew one year and he turned into a two-way. Maybe have a current player role and projected player role like what sort of player he will be at his peak (which you can alter using the practice system), and not just a comparison to an NHL player. I saw you did so in the most recent update, although I think the player/prospect progression could use some more tweaking. Although I have decent time played, I'm still learning so if I have gotten anything wrong I'd love an explanation on how a few mechanics work:) and I know it's early access so it's not fully complete, but it's already a great, complete game in my book. I recommend this 100% to anyone thinking about purchasing. My Vancouver Canucks did great in regular season, and got swept in the first round by a division rival. 8/8 realism. Love the game, looking forward to updates. Would continue to play even if you didn't update.:) Sorry for the long review. P.S. I'd rather spend 60$ on this rather then the 60$ I spent on NHL 15 on "Next-Gen" (lol) consoles.","August 20, 2015","true","150.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Better player interaction - team meetings and 121 talks with players would be a bonus.\n2. Better contract negotiations.\n3. Being able to arrange friendly international games.\n4. Being able to hold training camps for lesser teams (  the elite league doesn't allow them but I know the teams have them prior to the start of the season ).\n5. Forming new affiliated teams.\n\nOn a whole this game can take hours of your life it has with mine and it will for many, many, many more hours.

It's still a work in progress, but it is already an improvement over EHM 2007. Once things have been tweaked further, I think it will be a big improvement over EHM 2007. It already makes a difference having customisable start dates (great for retro rosters) and having up-to-date rules and league structures. The player progression and attribute modelling has been overhauled - and the introduction of Player Roles will lead to better database updates, in my view.\n\nVisually the game has undergone a bit of a facelift. It's not a complete overhaul, but a nice improvement and will be familiar to anybody who has played the EHM 2007. This has made the UI more spacious but it would be nice to see support for wider/higher resolutions in the future.\n\nThe game ships with a fictional database and no logos.

First of all i want to thank SI for doing this, we really need a new Hockey Manager game. But when i started playing this Early Access it just feels like a new skin for EHM 2007. No big new featuers, and my expectations that many of the functions from Football Manager would be included in this game was wrong. And that makes me really worried. Because atm i feel that there is no need for me to stop playing a updated version of 2007 if there isnt any big difference between the games.\nI know that this is a early access game so many thing can happen along the way. But the lack of new functions makes me worried for the future. But i will still support this development. But i hope that you are doing it 100% SI and not only a fast rework of a old game.","March 30, 2015","false","293.1"," 31 of 57 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","31","57","2","0"

Scores are more realistics and player statistics after a season are more like real life.\n\n- In the real NHL speed is pretty much around the same for all players except a select few who have incredible speed or are really slow. In game most players have speed ratings difference of ~10 except a couple of players (Hagelin, Kreider).\n\n- In game ratings are mostly well balanced and are very close to that of the real life player. (Note that ratings can be changed with a 3rd party freeware).\n\n- Drafting is very nice having good players in most drafts lets you get good prospects on a yearly basis.\n\n- Player development is good. Keep in mind that you need good coaching staff with the rating "working with youngster" high enough for the prospect to develop well.\n\nThe Bad ;\n\n- Trading is awefull, Wanting to trade my Stamkos, i was offered a 2nd round pick and two 3rd round picks by all of the teams that had interest into him, Same goes when trying to trade for a player. EG : I needed a first line key winger and i had a surplus of Key 1-2 defender. I offered Subban for Kessel and they did not want to negotiate, so just out of curiosity i add four 1st round picks and they still would not want any part of it. Overall trading needs to be tweeked but you can get a steal every now and then when a team is desperate or overly incompetent.\n\n- Way to many injury blows or long term injury. At one point in my game, Galchenyuk, Subban, Price and Pacioretty had over 3 months injury. the longest was Price with 8 months. This to say, i was left with an AHL team in my hands.","December 10, 2015","true","108.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game is an enjoyable experience for anyone who loves sports and likes management games. The 2D Graphics are smooth and easily followable, and the tactics are in-depth and provide a wide range of ways to play each game and develop your team. The game's tutorial is easily followable, but they could use some more added (especially the draft, that had me stumped a bit). The statistics portion allows in-depth analysis of all players in order to create your dream team and lead your team to victory.\n\nOn the bad side, each game can somewhat take an overly long amount of time, even playing on fast and very fast speeds. The fast forward speed is what you will use for most games throughout the season. The difficulty is variable and on my first season I was able to win the Stanley Cup. I feel like they should make some new degrees of difficulty and they should allow us to change it (unless I'm missing something and just couldn't find the option)\n\nThe game is surprisingly addicting and lovable, and the $20 price tag makes it completely worth it. Easily a better deal than the money-grabbing Football Manager made by the same developer as this game. So far EHM has not dissapointed me and I'm looking forward to more seasons.\n\nOverall I give this game a 9/10 as a lover of management games. If you're not into the Management series of games or if you're looking for a hockey game such as EA's NHL Series, this is NOT FOR YOU. If you do not like this style of game, you could be bored and you may not enjoy it at all.\n\nThanks for Reading!\n-Joe "Bonzaijoe"","December 7, 2015","true","29.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

At the moment, it seems that it is mostly just a facelifted version of EHM 2007 with new league structures and updated (if scrambled) data.\n\nI was expecting a bit more, to be honest (didn't have the time to check if they've fixed the salary cap mechanics or the entry-level deals to actually span three years even if you sign the prospect in the spring), but just having an EHM which works on my machine makes me extremely happy. I somehow managed to kick my Football Manager habit umpteen years ago, so this just might be my favourite video game franchise of all times.","March 26, 2015","true","4.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Yes I was enjoying it. At this point, it is on the shelf until improved. I would love to play more but will not. The reasons are below.\n\nA very flexible game that let's you be the General Manager for a team at almost any level of hockey. You manage coaching staff, scouts, players and contracts. You can coach at a very detailed level or leave those details to the AI. Many features will let you play your way.\n\nEven though the game has a lengthy manual, much of how it works it not explained. This is one of those games that you need to figure out and google. You will learn about hockey and how it works. You will learn about how hockey works and how this game is different.\n\nI learned the game and the many options. While I found it acceptable, I also find it falls short in some important design areas.\n\nFor example, here[community.sigames.com] is a long list of possible enhancements for the latest version 1.1. You can see in this discussion that the developer is not aligned with the reality of their game (regarding salary cap). This shows a lack of thorough design.\n\nWhen I first bought the game at version 1.0.2, it would frequently lock up. There was a work-around where you could "go on vacation" to get past the day with the error but you were then missing the simulation for that day. This error was fixed in 1.1.1, more than two months after release. This error was related to simulating many leagues when you play and again shows a lack of thorough design.\n\nWhat finally made me put it on the shelf is that after being fired from my favorite team and working 7 game years and more than 300 actual hours to return to that team, it is not possible to GM the team because my old history is not reset upon re-hire. This means the team has no tolerance for my presence and is a hair away from firing me as soon as I start the job. Again, something that seems like a lack of thorough design.\n\nSo even though it is version 1.1, I would label it 0.8 or 0.9. It's close but not yet ready for long term playability.\n\nIf you do end up buying the game, save often, it still locks up pretty frequently.","April 8","false","355.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

This version of the game is an iterative improvement over FHM 2007.  It appears to be a conservative migration to SI's latest app engine, but maintains a very similar flow to EHM 2007, not the latest Football Manager game.\n\nWith that said, this game is simply spectacular.  I've only played a few games into my season with this version (so I'm not an authority on the state of completeness) but what I've seen so far is fantastic.  I've had some gripes with FHM 2007, fortunately it appears that quite a few of them have been addressed.  The fact that SI is bringing this game back is astonishing considering how they unceremoniously dropped the game after pirating concerns shortly after it was released in 2006.  Those of us with the Mac version really got screwed since there were some terrible bugs that were never fixed.\n\nRegardless, I'm really excited for the future... If this game gets half the attention FM gets, we're in for a treat.  I have a feeling what we are playing now is a wait-and-see product- see what the respose is to this conservative effort and decide if it's worth investing any additional effort.  Judging from the response so far it should be a resounding YES, this game deserves 1st class attention!\n\nAnyway, newcomers from FM are going to need to be patient, the UI is no where near as mature as FM.  FM has had the benefit of many years of iterrative development... while EHM has been in stasis for 8 years.  Even if this release just brings EHM up to date and nothing more, we all win.  Hopefully next years release will start incorporating some of FM's ground breaking systems.\n\nThis game is worth every penny whether you are new to the series or upgrading from EHM 2007.  My favorite sports sim ever, hands down.\n\n","March 29, 2015","true","707.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

If you like hockey or sports management sims in general, chances are you'll have a blast with it.\n\nI don't generally write reviews, but I saw somebody complaining in the comments of the latest update (15.9.0b) that this game was an Early Access "half-product" and that the developers had lied about their intentions. There are plenty of those kinds of games around, but EHM isn't one of them. I would've paid the asking price just to get EHM 2007 running with community mods on my modern PC system. Instead I get new features and updates with detailed logs of the changes every two weeks. If that's not good enough for you at a $15 price point - which, it should be noted, is lower than what people will pay for the game after its Early Access period is over - it might be time to reconsider the choices that have led you to this point in your life.","August 2, 2015","true","179.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is as close to the ideal hockey management sim there has ever been, by a long shot, and that can probably be seen in my hours played lol. The amount of detail and customization available in this game is staggering, and the ability to pick any league/team is refreshing, as taking over junior teams is one of my favourite features. The drafting/scouting system is very well thought out, and even acts like real life, with players falling/rising and teams drafting based on positional needs rather than BPA. Free agency can be a little iffy at points, with many core/superstar players all available at once. The salary cap rises very slowly from year to year, which is another issue, but it's a fun challenge to go along with building a dynasty. Developing prospects requires patience and playing them in the right spots, and it really is rewarding to develop a superstar, or watch a 6th round pick grow into a key player. Trading is good as well, as there will be times where you get 'ripped off' and others where you come off with a steal - asset management is a big thing in this game. The only complaints I have, albeit minor, is that if you draft well, the game gets easy very quickly, as you just trade good players for picks, let them develop, and repeat. As well, if you don't know hockey that well, the game may be a bit tricky to begin with, but the tutorials help with that. Additionally, the custom roster/logo//facepacks that come along with the game are very well done. I would highly recommend this to any hockey fan/sports management fan - 10/10, 2 thumbs up!","May 21","true","133.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","1"

It will take some time getting used to everything and learning the ins and outs of everything, but soon enough you'll find yourself hooked and wanting to play all sorts of different scenarios to see how you can come out on top. Depending on how you play you can turn a rebuilding team into a franchise in a matter of a few short years.\n\nPros:\n\n-Steam Workshop allows essential face packs/team logos etc.\n-Really feels like you're running a team.\n-The Draft is incredibly important and if your scouting is good enough you can really make strides early.\n-Playing prospects in the NHL too early can hurt their growth and I really like this aspect of the game among other things\n\nCons:\n\n-Trading is both awesome and incredibly broken. Salary doesn't factor into trades and this can lead to some very interesting situations to say the least. Sometimes you can make some very good trades that feel realistic but in general it's going to take some getting used to when it comes to this aspect of the game.\n-Something tells me this game isn't nearly as integrated as say, Football Manager, made by the same Developer; Sports Interactive.\n\nRating:\n\n8.5/10\n\nFor all its quirks this is as close as it gets to an in depth GM mode for hockey fans.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VanillaEars/recommended/301120/","VanillaEars","VanillaEars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VanillaEars/","58 products in account","An extremely in-depth version of GM Mode, I'm at September 9th, two days into the season and I have a headache from all the transactions and moves that I'm making, just like a GM would. Glad it's back and you'll all love this game if you buy it, worth every penny.\n\nHaven't found any glitches yet, but even if there are, it's Early Access so I'm sure they'll be fixed by then.\n\nOtherwise, really good potential for this game, very engaging and fun to play, and worth $16.99 CAD.\n\nSuggestion 1: Disallow players to put same players on the same line (Ex. Stamkos-Stamkos-Stamkos)\n\nSuggestion 2: Be able to mess with contracts a little bit. More flexibility (Ex. When player asks for 1.1 million a year, you should be able to offer him more or less depending on how he played last year)\n\nSuggestion 3: Remove having to name a different captain if current captain is injured. Takes too much time to rename temporary captain and rename regular captain after returning, and in the NHL today, we do not see this happening. Captains stay captains through the season.\n\nEdit 2 (November 15, 2015): Through ten years of my Tampa Bay GM Mode and winning the Cup a couple of times, there are just a few problems I've noticed that consistently occur.\n\n1. The AI in trading is an absolute travesty as of right now. It definitely could be worked on to be more balanced, perhaps like EA's NHL AI. As of now, the AI will trade each other ridiculous things like "Dany Heatley and a 7th round pick for Patrick Kane, Jonathan Toews and a 1st round pick", but when I try grabbing a player like Mike Green, they won't even take Stamkos for him, claiming to need just a little more. Definitely an irritating aspect that needs a little time to be worked on.\n\n2. Injuries, like EA's NHL, should have the option of being turned off at player's discretion. I've had a period of time where players such as Hedman, Stamkos, Vasilevskiy, and Drouin would all go out in the span of a week with major injuries that would take them out for 3 months or more. So for the future, either have the option to turn them off entirely, or fix it so such major injuries occur less frequently.\n\n3. A minor, miscellaneous problem with aesthetics I've noticed is the inability to "expand your arena" at all. It's a button there, but somehow despite my near-top attendance records season after season, it never seems to stop being grayed out. If it's there, I suggest a time when we could potentially expand our arena. Could be a cool little mini-feature, going into the future.\n\n4. Finally, player growth through practice really needs to be revamped. A player can spend 6 months on the practice screen as "working on shooting", but at the end of 4 years of that "shooting practice" their overall for that has not gone up at all. I'm not sure the logistics behind player growth, but I feel as though practice should be a factor in whether a player grows a certain stat or not.\n\nThrough 10 years however, I have had little concern to doubt buying this game. An excellent pickup, which I am sure will please all hockey fans on PC even more when the game is fixed of its tiny bugs and glitches here and there.\n\nEdit 3 (December 31, 2015):\n\nNoticing a very disturbing trend that my goalies keep having extremely sub-par nights, despite their overall. Yes, I understand that every goalie has an off-night some nights, but I really don't think that a 5 star goalie such as Vasilievskiy can let in a combined total of 25 goals on 78 shots in 4 consecutive games, while this no-namer with red attributes shuts me out with ease in a 33 save effort. Going back to the "practice" screen, goalies working on their "Goalie" instructions should continue to grow more consistent and more capable of stopping pucks, and perhaps just going into the coding, tweak a couple of settings here and there.","April 3, 2015","true","270.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

If you enjoy hockey, or any sports gm games, you owe it yourself to pick this game up.\n\n\nFrom Version 15.0.1b (first early access version) here are some of my findings on the game:\n\nPro's:\n- Has nearly all the features from the EHM 2007, meaning it already is the deepest hockey sim available.\n- Nice new touches like players bio information talking about players close friends on the team.\n- Nice tactical improvements like individual strategies for players\n-Tactical improvements for lines including choosing who would be the playmaker on the line.\n- Free Agency is much more realistic. Don't expect to always build your teams on July 1st, UFA's want money and term just ilke in real life.\n-Position's of players are more in-depth, including their roles like defensive defenseman, stay-at-home defensemen, 2-way forward, skilled forward, quick forward. This adds to the fun of building cohesive forward units.\n-Tons of international tournaments, take control of your favorite national team and try to build a team to bring glory to your country.\n-The in game match view has been improved and is very enjoyable watching your team battle it out.\n\n\nCon's:\n- Interface and menus are very similar to EHM 2007 so it is missing some more modern interface options.\n- Resolution needs to be improved for modern pc's\n- Scoring has to be balanced a bit more to 2015 scoring levels (its a bit too high at least in NHL games).\n- Missing leagues like the Swiss leagues, Russian MHL, and British Hockey leagues from 2007 version.\n- Coaches and GMs get fired a little more than in the real world.\n\nThere are a few issues like the small window the game runs in and the interface definitely needs some modern touches, but the rest of the cons are minor. The positives far outweigh the negatives with this release. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game if you enjoy the sport of hockey and have ever wanted to build your dream team or test your management skill in the lower leagues and build a legendary story as you climb the ranks to finally leading your national team to world glory.","March 27, 2015","true","192.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Those poor saps won't have any idea how fun it is to TANK FOR MCDAVIDDDDD\n\nSI seems to be going for a natural progression from the last version (2007) to what might have been a 2008 game.  So it'll certainly feel like a huge step back for Football Manager fans.  For hardcore hockey nuts like me, this is an impulse buy, no questions asked.  IF YOU ARE HOCKEY NUT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A CHOICE YOU WILL BUY THIS GAME.  If you are a fan of sports sims this is basically the only hockey manager out there (others don't even come close).

It needs time and they have already made changes to the product to attempt to improve it.  I expect this to continue based on the history this team has.\n\nSecond, Some have posted that "it doesn't have the features of Football Manager" but that is a ridiculous expectation for a game that is a third of the cost of Football Manager and has not had the number of releases as that game.\n\nNow that I got the disclaimers out of the way.  I recommend this product to any hockey fan that has always wanted to run a team.  It has some growing pains but it shows a lot of promise.\n\n\nThe positives:\n+ It's a hockey sim, a market that is in dire need of a good product.\n+ The stats are believable.  Scoring and penalties may be slightly inflated but I grew up watching hockey in teh 80's so I have no issue with the increase in scoring.  A 4-3 game is more entertaining than a 2-1 game.  :-)\n+ The 2D view allows you to watch the action, or just highlighted versions of the action.  It still needs work but it has a bit of a feel like the old Gretzky Hockey days.\n+ Did I say it's a hockey sim?!?!?!?\n\nThe negatives:\n- Issues with CPU GM's (players getting put on the trading block but when you inquire you get a message that says the player is untouchable; teams with cap room waiving star players, not overly common but it does seem to happen and in the major case that I saw it was said player from the trading block being waived the next day after my inquiry and said player was the scoring leader at the time)\n- 2D match engine could use some work, there are some times where the penalty being called doesn't seem to fit the situation or the play being made by the player with the puck doesn't make a lot of sense or for that matter the play made by the defender\n- The UI could use some work, takes a bit of poking around to find things","April 18, 2015","true","39.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This goes way more in-depth than any other hockey GM simulator I have ever played and it is by far the most realistic of any hockey simulators I have played. The strategies mean a lot in this. In my first year of Tampa, Ben Bishop was terrible: 3.43 GAA and a .878 save percentage. I made lots of strategy changes that made more players defensively-minded and it raised Bishop's stats to a 2.75 GAA and a .902 save percentage. In EA's be a GM mode, the strategies mean nothing. You can't decide how a player plays, you can't coach the players, you only assign what lines the players are on and that is it. In EHM, you decide where the player plays, the length of his shifts, his shoot/pass ratio, his practice, almost everything. Overall, it is incredibly addictive. I only have two games on Steam: TF2 and Eastside Hockey Manager. I have played more TF2 than Eastside Hockey Manager, but Eastside Hockey Manager has almost completely gotten me away from NHL 15's GM mode. When you compare the two, EHM is by miles better, and it's still in beta. Bravo to the developers for making such an amazing game.\n\nWishlist/Gripes:\n*The ability to edit players. No matter what simulator I play, there will always be tweeks needed to the rosters. For example, Cam Talbot has worse stats than Robin Lehner in this game which I highly disagree with. In NHL 15 on current gen, you are able to edit players and make the sim even more realistic. I would like to see a player editing option because I still find that there are players who are rated too high or too low.\n\n\n*More casual options. I think options like injuries, waivers, and an assistant coach rotate goalies option would all be welcome in my opinion. I feel that waivers make it a little too easy and they need some fixes. I have seen the following players in years one, two, or three get placed on waivers:\n*Marian Hossa\n*Jiri Sekac\n*Brandon Saad\n*Dustin Brown\n\nIf options like this are available then I'm stupid, just saying.\n\n\n*More simple simulation. I find it frustrating that when I go on a vacation the assistant GM completely takes over. I think there is an option that can turn him off, but it is still very annoying when I'm a cap team and my assistant GM brings in Marian Gaborik. And the coach will also make lineup changes when there is no injury which is annoying. I wish the simulation way more like EA's but at least it isn't a major problem.\n\n\n*About the injuries, sometimes it feels like the injuries do get way out of hand. I always see like one or two or tears a month and those are four month injuries. I remember on my Edmonton play through in year two I had an injury every other game it felt like. All were minor (thank god), but it got to be very annoying. I think injuries can stay because they add a lot of challenge (like when I lost Jason Demers to a damaged spine which is essentially a year-long injury), but turning down the frequency of the injuries would be welcome.","June 4, 2015","true","139.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Seriously, I want to know. The game is just as unpolished and ugly as it was in Early Access mode. Sure, I get it, EAHM doesn't have the same sized market as FM, but seriously; everything about this game is seven years behind. The interface is ugly and outdated, the game simulations are only 2d overhead (3d tv broadcast angle would be so great), players keep dumping the puck from their own zone resulting in a lot of icing calls and players struggle to accept passes at the point making a little figure skating pirouette; a play that most of the time ends up offside. Even when the man on the point is wide open and the pass is tape2tape. The game/sim speeds has very little variation: It's very slow, slow, somehow slower and speedoflight. It's difficult and time consuming navigating through all the in-game-menus (and at times its unresponsive as you have to left-click the choices half a dozen times before the page changes) and the need to confirm changes every time you look at your tactics, shortlist, free agency etc ,even if changes weren't made, is simply annoying. The lack of an established community where you can share succesful tactics you've created, custom designed jerseys  or AAR is a major let down. I mean, there is a community but it's SO empty. The boards are pretty much ghost towns. Even real players playing this game, the way proffesional soccer players play FM, would make the experience somewhat better. If you play FM you will know exactly what I mean.\n\nEntry-level contracts are also broken in the NHL but that might just be a bug in the rosters I downloaded.\n\nMy teams seem to always have trouble keeping pucks out of the net but I'll give EAHM the benefit of a doubt on this one and assume that A)my goalies are just that bad B)my tactics are just that bad C)A&B. I'm leaning towards A because I have experimented a lot and my skaters are stacked while my goalies are usually mediocre.\n\nSo would I reccomend this game?  I have in the past touted just how excited I was to own this game "The game is addicting although it's very raw but only because it's in early access".  Is what I would say, telling people to be patient. But know I don't feel the same way. I actually feel cheated and betrayed. Everything that I hoped and expected would be updated wasn't. If you're not hockey mad then stay away. If you enjoy this concept then play FM. sure it's made and published by the same companies but it's so much better.\n\n\nStill going to play the game until I puke at the sight of an NHL logo","December 16, 2015","false","139.6"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

Sadly this game does not (yet) deliver the quality one has come to expect from SI.\n\nThe game itself has huge potential. but it feels rushed in a whole.\n\nCurrently i have 2 MAIN ISSUES with this game.\n\n1) The screen resolution does not support 16:9  only 4:3 for a modern game this is uncceptable as widescreens are the norm. nowadays.\n\n2) very very prone to crashes during the matches.  I had to atleast replay each match twice due to crashes of the game. for a game that draws heavily on the FM engine (or so it looks like) this is very unexpected as one should think the engine has already proven his worth in the FM sries.\n\nso currently while this game has huge potential i can not recommend it at this time.","December 2, 2015","false","0.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's not every day some yankee ♥♥♥♥ from Seattle takes interest in the best game in the world.   So we fired it up, and after 2 hours of figuring out the right port to connect to each other's network, we finally got in.  We spent another 2 hours trying to set up a league without it crashing.  Want to load a save?  Crash.  Want to save a save? Crash.  Want to name your team?  That's a crash bud.  Did you just try to sign a coach?  CRAAAAAASH.   We spent a combined 5 hours trying to get the game to work, and this isn't at all because SEGA made it.  A company whose last grasp of glory was a blue ball trying to jump through holes.  Kinda like I do when I need to relieve stress looking at pornographic material after playing this abomination.  The previous version of this game was dated at 2007, and they failed to test simple crashes in those assumed 10 years of development.   Did a monkey test it?  Did a monkey design it?  I mean, my CPU usage shot straight to 100 percent as soon as I click "Drop the puck".  Highly optimized.  The immersion value is terrible in this game. with several players having the same last name.   That never happens in real life.  On top of that, my friend figured out some kind of cheat where I would lose every time I faced him.  Go figure.

I have already played this for a few hours and I still feel lost sometimes, the price isnt too bad at all. but with this game you get full control over the team but you have to worry about different things like no trade clauses, sending your scouts out to draft in any league. Oh and if you buy this game go to the website and download the real nhl pack makes it a lot better because you have crosby, ovie, patrick kane etc. The Other thing that is really nice is that they have a bunch of hockey leagues you can be the gm of any team from Plymouth Whalers of the Ohl, to the Mosco Dynamo and every team in between. I will recommend it but just be weary it will take you a lot time to learn it and be as good as normal.","April 8, 2015","true","203.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So I set up my own challenge by making up rules and a league managing several teams at once.\nUnfortuantely this new EA 2014 EHM game still lacks a medium or higher level of difficulty.\n\nI've noticed improvements in this 2015 EA version. Trading for the better players is harder. Excellent suggestions by dejaqwho on how to make it more challenging. Still, it's easy to sign outstanding staff, even stockpiling. It's super easy to stockpile good mid level players and then trade some for better players - all before your first training camp is over.\n\nStarting in the lower leagues (like in FM) could be an option to make it harder. When you can make your team 4x or more better before you get out of your first training camp (as you can in this edition and could in earlier versions) it's fun to do but way too easy! We should NOT be able to build a championship team in training camp.\nLove that the game is back. I'm hoping this develops into a FM 2013 quality product over the years. Way too easy to keep me interested right now!\n\nI love a good turned-based strategy game and studying gamification, one aspect of getting playes hooked is enabling them to be challenged regardless of their level of experience. In my opinion this company fails to do that in this game and in it's FM series (often way too hard for most players at lower leagues).

Iknow the tag has been abused by many devs in recent memory, but this is not really a new franchise.\n\nEHM is a game series that has been around since 2004 with EHM: Franchise Edition, and in spirit since 2001 when the original freeware EHM was released.  After EHM:FE, SI Games released EHM 2005 and then EHM 2007.  The fan community has kept 2007 alive and updated since then.  So this is not a brand-new, from scratch game.  This is a game built on an already successful core from EHM 2007.  Riz and the SI guys are not new at this, and SI is the company behind the super-popular, long-running Football Manager series.  EHM:EA marks essentially the 4th release in the EHM series after a hiatus of many years,\n\nThere is not a more-detailed, in-depth hockey management simulation game available on the market, period.

Having played hockey myself for many years, this is the ultimate sports sim. The tactical options on display gives a multitude of options in terms of implementing the game plans you have in mind from individual players all the way up to the team as a whole. Line matching could be a bit more transparent and flexible, but by and large all the necessay tools are there to make your guys play the way you want them to.\n\nGraphically the 2D engine does a good job of representing what's happening on the ice, and while I would like to see and option of chosing between 3D and 2D just as in Football Manager, I'm more than content to settle for the current model as it serves it purpose really well.

However, as I did get into it a little bit, I started to understand how it worked and it became a bit more fun.  I am obviously aware that this game is in early-access and there are a few things that it could work on.\n\nAs of now, I would recommend the game but only if you are prepared to play a buggy game because you would like to support the early-development...  I do hope that the developers work to fix the bugs and the other issues with the game including the terrible resolution.\n\nPros\n- Has a decently realistic simulating system.\n- Has a good game-view during the simulation.\n- Lets your either view the game on the ice or play-by-play text.\n- Keeps you busy for long periods of time without getting bored.\n- More to be added as I play the game.\n\nCons\n- Very confusing and hard to learn.\n- No good tutorial.\n- Ugly menus (Not completely terrible, but could be made a lot better.)\n- Has many bugs with the menu that sometimes make buttons unusable or disappear all together.

Really in-depth, so if you're just a casual hockey fan, prepare to have no idea what you're doing. But, that's not really the developer's fault, because being a GM is hard as balls. Seriously, there's so much going on here between the pro club, the farms clubs, juniors, and other leagues that there's almost no way you'll ever feel like you're playing an easy game. And that's a great thing, because creating a Stanley Cup winning team isn't easy. I recommend you buy this game if you're a hockey fan, if for no other reason than to understand the work that goes into building a team.

I have played many hockey based games from AAA to brower games and this games management depth is outstanding. If you want a indepth pure GM mode this game is for you, allowing you to control everything from drafts to contract clauses. Only flaw I can leverage about this game is of course the lack of league and player licensing but that can be overcome with a simple install of fan made update files. Was also impressed the being able to branch out and not be forced to manage a NHL team but instead play a lower tier  Finnish league team if I so desired. EHM doesn't deserve to be called Early Access since it is jam packed and destroys anything EA Sports GM mode will be putting out anytime soon.

And I'm not talking about your standard CTD, this thing fried my operating system requiring a hard power reboot to recover from.  Afterward I removed the game from my system and placed in my steam “Dislike” category.  Just Keep in mind that the following review is after only less than ½ hour of play.  Another thing worthy of note, I've never actually played a game like this before. Wile I'm really not a big sports game fan, I do like statistics and derive a great deal of enjoyment from management sims.\n\nAccording to this games wiki page, it started as freeware, got picked up by SEGA once it got popular and (much the way of the Frankenstein monster) has exploded out of proportion from there.\n\nLets start with the good.\n\n1. The Content is Extensive and Comprehensive, and covers data from wide variety of dates, and players from a staggering number of places.\n\n2. Includes Steam Workshop Support.  Thou the content in the workshop is limited, the fact that it is moddable at all is a good sign.\n\n3. The Game derives statistics from a staggering number of categories.  Training schedules, play tactics, talent scouts, fan loyalty, and dozens of other things all factor into the gameplay.\n\n4. Its one of the only sports titles that isn’t made by EA, to me that's a big selling point.\n\nAnd now the bad.\n\n1. If your like me, and your looking at a good management simulation but know very little about hockey, PASS THIS GAME UP.  The games design assumes anyone that plays this is a hard core hockey fan. If you don't know the game intimately, or play it yourself, none of the information in this game is going to make seance.\n\n2. The game has one of the most dreadful tutorials I have ever seen.  Seriously SEGA, if your reading this, PLEASE watch the extra credits episode “Tutorials 101”\nHere\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCPcn-Q5nKE\nSeriously, your a professional game company, you should know better than this.\n\n3. The UI is extremely awkward.  I can see how they wanted to model it after a web browser but its so clunky that combined with the awful tutorial, the experience is unapproachable and unfulfilling.\n\n4. I would like to address any bugs the game has, however since I couldn’t figure out what was going on, the game could have hundreds of bugs or none and I in all fairness wouldn’t know.\n\nAll in all, a great idea.

The key aspects of the game that keep me from recommending it are the poor menu system, the lack of in game tool tips, and the unsatisfactory resolution.\n\nThe game has a lot of potential to be something great.

I mean, what's the use of managing a team if you're stuck with the same old roster from start to finish of a season?\n\nEven trying to trade top 6 players along with picks and / or prospects for other top 6 players is a hard sell as teams don't want to let go of said players... (Trading Alex Galchenyuk along with 5 first round picks can't get me McDavid or Nugent-Hopkins or Draisatl or even Yakupov for god's sake... I then switched Galchenyuk for Subban as Oilers needs a top 2 defenseman... So, Subban and 5 first round picks and I'm only asking for Nugent-Hopkins... I'm getting as an answer: "This offer is seriously unbalanced, we're not prepared to talk"... This makes no freaking sense!!!)\n\nI hope the final version allows for more flexibility as far as trades goes. I don't want it to go back to the point where I was able to trade Gionta, a 2nd round and half the club in Hamilton to get Crosby as this made no sense whatsoever (in previous versions) but, man, there has to be some kind of middle ground where we're able to make fair trades and enjoy the game even more.","November 28, 2015","true","289.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

And it looks like it. Important features are buried behind menus and different screens and navigating to them is far from intuitive. So your left blindly clicking hoping to find what you need. To make matters worth, some buttons are links without a hover state. So it doesn't look like a button or link, and doesn't behave like one until clicked. I discovered some features this way be accident. You can filter some lists, but I've always found this buggy.\n\nThen there's how data is laid out, which is in a busy, packed manner. Wheres FM lays things out in easy to look at, well spaced datas, organized in a pleasing and logical layout; in EHM you have glaring or just poorly chosen colors that either flash or blend with the games background. And did I mention that to date you're going to play this in windowed mode in a display resolution harkoning back pre-1080p monitors? Yes. This game doesn't know what 16:9 is.\n\nThe actual games are laid out on a 2d, with stick-figure hockey sticks glued to little circles. Albeit this is better than OOTPs rendition, but its a laugh-out-loud insult to those who enjoy the live 3d action of FM.\n\nI could go on, but, to end on a positive is the community. There are update rosters and all kinds of nuggets of info to be found at http://www.ehmtheblueline.com/forums/portal.php.\n\nTo be fair, to date I've put in 10hrs and aside from the horrific UI - when you get the hang of it I did have fun. But I just find the interfaces learning curve to much work that it sucks all the joy out of what could be a really fun game.\n\nHonestly, if you're a hockey fanatic get this on a massive steam sale. If not, move along.","October 10, 2015","false","25.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I've played 400 hours of Football Manager and have a pretty good grasp of this genre's concepts, but this game is so frustrating in many ways. First off, even moreso than in Football Manager, your team will make STUPID STUPID STUPID mistakes all game, every game. They'll take 24 PIM in a single game, your coach will put in the 4th line to dump and chase with a minute left in a game you're losing by one. Your goalie will allow goals from half ice. Your PKers will refuse to clear the puck, instead passing it into your own corner for the opposing team to pick up. Something is very wrong with this game (not to mention that it is basically just a very watered down reskin of FM) and I would not recommend it unless you absolutely NEED to have a hockey managing simulator. I've had some fun with it and will probably give it another try, but the frustration is just not worth it for a pretty mediocre, sometimes ridiculous game.","February 21","false","35.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

By that I mean the game and the stability, features, engine etc are all well done. But the lack of NHL Licensing causes you to have fake teams and players, this is where the empty canvas becomes painted upon by "The Blue Line community" http://www.ehmtheblueline.com These guys have made rosters, facepacks, logo packs and essentially give you the player the final pieces to have a great game from KHL to CHL Junior Hockey to the NHL... all the leagues and rosters are well done and really are as good a roster as any developer could do.\n\nTo Summarize, it's become a good enough and improved enough game to be worth buying regardless if you own EHM 07 or not.. and The Blue Line rosters and Logos, Facepacks are a must to give you a great managing experience for whatever league you wish to take part in.\n\n","December 1, 2015","true","485.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","4","2","0"

Unfortunately this is "Early Access", whatever this means when it comes to sell a game from the year 2006 (see other negative reviews). If you like the complexity of the FM series you got to realise you won´t find most of the possibilities here. This is a very "light" version of what could be possible, it´s boring as hell since you will miss the complexity you already know. And as to the marketing term "Early Access" - you do not know where this will lead.

First, I never played Football Manager in any form, nor did I play this game's old 2007 iteration. I had no biases coming into this game. Second, while I am a hockey fan (Go Bolts!) I was not a hardcore fan. I was (and largely am) still fairly casual in that I don't follow mundane stats, am not up to date on every player in the league and don't watch every single game.\n\nThat being said. This game is fantastic! I am having loads of fun with this gaming experience and as far as I can tell will be having lots of fun for months if not years to come.\n\nWho would like this game?\n- anyone who enjoys management games\n- anyone who enjoys stats and tactical games\n- any sports fans (hockey is a plus!)\n\nPROS:\n- addictive gameplay that makes you feel involved and responsible for your teams success and failure\n- a "one more turn" type of pull (days are done in turns)\n- a unique and highly realistic game simulator that you can watch in real time or sped up (highly entertaining)\n- HEAPS of potential, this game is still in Early Access but it is very fun and playable in it's current state, updates will only launch it to new heights\n- in depth stats and tactics including fully realized and modeled shot analysis for games (impressive)\n\nCONS:\n- confusing and unoptimized UI (needs streamlining)\n- can't control players yourself (this should go without saying but some people don't come to grips with this concept until they're in game)\n- lack of useful tutorial and helpful tooltips (had to bumble around some things before finding them out myself)\n- no sounds except crowd noise (might benefit from certain ambient sounds a calm musical track)\n\nAll in all this game as it stands is great and will only continue to get better over time. It's a low price, can be played in short bursts or long stretches, has an addictive one more turn type of gameplay that makes you feel involved and connected to your team.

As I started getting bored (and tired of forking over that much cash) I started looking for alternatives. Finding this game was the best thing to happen. It's far more in depth, but that's a nice change of pace for me.\n\nI recommend this game, but only if you're looking for a very in depth game.

This game is very detailed and there is a lot of directions you can take to help your team succeed. But, with that said this game does have its fair share of issues considering it is an early access game. The first being the player overalls, there are no player overalls which can make the game quite daunting for newcomers like myself. Given i have limited knowledge of hockey i have to just rely on my coach to do a lot of the strategizing which, in turn, takes away a key feature of the game. Also, there are a few problems with the matches in game. Although not a huge issue the matches seem to be really clunky and laggy looking. On top of this rather minor issue i hope they put in a 3-d POV in the matches because, unlike in FM, i think it is fairly necessary to have a 3-d POV to have an understanding of what is going on in the match. But, with all that said i do recommend this game to people who have the time to invest in this game leading me to give a score of 7.5/10.","July 8, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Found it while on another sites Forum pages that this was a revamp of an old game that HAD gotten a lot of support and play a long time ago. I will tell you that it does not have NHL rights to all the pics and stuff but a dedicated fan base has made sure that with a little elbow grease you can have it looking and playing better than NHL 14 in a matter of hours at most.\nGame play has a learning curve to it but that's to be expected and once you get the hang of it there isn't one thing that you can't modify or tweak to some degree. While the other game has flash and sizzle, it, like chine food will leave you hungry for some meat and EHM-EA is it!!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hockey17jp/recommended/301120/","hockey17jp","TragicBronson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hockey17jp/","31 products in account","This game makes me so angry. I honestly, despite 440 hours of mostly enjoyable gameplay, can't recommend this game to anyone.\n\nThis game is so full of bugs it's stupid and what's worse is that the developer has seemingly abandoned the game altogether. When I first downloaded the game about a year ago everything was great. The dev released very frequent updates and bug fixes and everything was peachy. The game ran super fast and smoothly and while there were small problems there was nothing major that had a big effect on gameplay.\n\nThese frequent updates continued until the game was finally released until December 1st, 2015, when the game was taken out of Early Access and given a full release. As a huge fan of the game I was super excited for this new "EHM 1". There were a lot of cool new features added and it was the biggest update I had seen thus far. Unfortunately EHM 1 would be the beginning of the steep decline in the quality of EHM. This 1.0 update was so full of bugs it was actually unplayable for a large portion of players. Myself and a ton of other users had to spend days combing online forums and google searches for solutions to the problems we faced. I remember being so frustrated that this huge update came out on December 1st but I actually couldn't play it until mid December, and even then I just kept playing a save game from an earlier version of the game because the new version was so messy.\n\nAs if this disaster of an update wasn't bad enough, a lot of these bugs have gone totally unfixed even now on May 29th, 2016. Since the 12/1 full release, there have been only 3 updates to the game, the last coming out more than 3 months ago on February 17th. These updates were two minor bug fix updates and then a 1.1.1 update that added some new content to the game. The game is still in shambles, and the developer hasn't touched the game in more than 3 months. He used to release updates on a weekly basis, and now he doesn't release updates at all.\n\nLet me break down a couple of the major bugs that have made me want to pull my hair out, and keep in mind that this isn't all of them.\n\n- You can't minimize this game. If you minimize the game, or if some pop-up automatically minimizes the game you can't open the game back up. You better hope that you saved recently because all of your progress will be lost. This bug has been around since the December 1st update, and has been unsolved for almost 6 months now.\n\n- The in-game clock was completely ruined by the December 1st update. In EHM you can't play the games, you just simulate all of them. You can mess with the in-game clock settings to make it slow, medium, or fast. I can't speak for everyone, but my friends and I and a lot of other people I've seen on the online forums play the game on the fastest clock settings. We do this because we don't want to sit and watch a simulated game for a long period of time, we'd rather it just be over with as fast as possible. Before the December 1st update you could simulate a game in under 30 seconds and it was absoulutely tremendous. Being able to fly through games so fast meant that you could finish entire seasons relatively quickly and your manager's career would progress at a nice pace. The December 1st update made the clock much much slower than it was before, even on the fastest settings. That quick 20 second game suddenly took almost a minute or more to simulate. I get that a 50 second game still doesn't seem like much, but when all you can do is just sit there and watch a screen for 50 seconds you get bored really quickly. This bug actually frustrated me to the point where I just stopped playing the game completely for almost a month. It's a really boring game when you have to stare at your screen for a collective two hours and do nothing just to finish one season. Luckily I found a fix to that bug by tinkering with the settings, and I was able to play the game with a super fast clock again, until earlier today. My clock is now super slow again, and there is NOTHING I can do about it. I've already tinkered with the settings as much as I can and my clock is super slow. I'm sick about it.\n\n- The bug I talked about earlier that kept most players from playing the new update for a few days after the 1.0 release is still around for a lot of new players. Whenever you start up the game you get some error message that breaks the game. You can't open the game, you can't do anything until you go into the game's properties and change all of the resolution settings, just so you can finally open the game and change the in-game resolution settings, before you go back and reset your computer's resolution settings. You have to do all of this annoying tinkering just to be able to play the game! Come on Riz!\n\nThis game is super fun, don't get me wrong. I've played more than 400 hours. Unfortunately this is a game I cannot recommend to anyone, as it is just a giant headache.\n\nI'm sure the developer Riz is working on other games, and I'm sure he's very busy. He's the only developer of this game and while I'm very thankful for all of the work he's done the fact of the matter is that this game is abandoned right now. There hasn't been an update in MONTHS, not even a tiny bug fix!! I don't understand why the guy would just let this game that he worked so hard on sit and rot.\n\nTL:DR\nThis game right now is a buggy pile of mush. Before it was taken out of early access it was absoulutely brilliant, but now that it has been fully released it has been completely abandoned by the developer. Only buy this game if you want to deal with a bunch of problems before you can really enjoy the game. Don't buy this game unless it's on sale.","June 18, 2015","false","473.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love ice hockey and have always wanted to play it, but, growing up in the Bay Area, I wasn't able to, so I had to turn to video games. I couldn't get into EA NHL's Be a GM mode because it quite frankly confused me. >>FAST FORWARD PAST ALL THE SCHEISSE>>. I bought the game, started it up, went to start my career and was very confused when I selected the SJ Sharks for my team, and didn't see any familiar players. So, I naturally questioned what the hell is happening, and I restarted the game to see if there was another mode I missed; there was not. Then, I tried installing something from the Steam Workshop to give me real players to work with; that didn't work either. So, at that point, I said screw it and applied for a refund.\nIn all seriousness, I can't recommend a hockey game with no player licensing. There's just no point. I had come to expect that from Sports Interactive, since they were able to license so many players and leagues in Football Manager 2016. If you want to see what Sports Interactive is really capable of, save your money and buy Football Manager 2016, it's an overall better game, and considering it came from the same dev, you think they'd put the same amount of time into both projects.\n\nMY REAL REVIEW- 5/10\nEverything about this game is fine. All it really needs is player licensing, and it's all fine.","May 29","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is the best experience for anyone who wants to try their hand at managing a hockey team, hands down. It's easy to find real player names and faces online, and there are helpful tutorials along with them. A little bit dense to begin with but once you start remembering where the important menus are the game begins to speed up. Exactly what a hockey buff like me needs.","June 2","true","185.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't play as my city franchise, and yet this game is oddly captivating for someone who never excelled at math or considered themself a stats junkie. If you can't figure out how to add real world players or franchises to this game via third parties then I don't think this game should bear the brunt of your negative review.\nThe developers clearly put a lot of effort into this game and if you have half an imagination allows for the fleshing out of some pretty cool narratives. I can leave this game open in windowed mode and do other things like watch TV shows. The game demands as much attention as you want to give it at any given point in time.\nThe game has some flaws and minor glitches but only one of which I found particularily annoying and hope the devs have been made aware of: if you're in the playoffs and you check a player's bio it sometimes has a spoiler about the end of the series (which is weird that it's pre-determined) in the form of "will be disappointed their team couldn't win the Stanley Cup this year" while the series is still in progress and by all appearances still TBD. Everytime I've seen this message it plays out like clock work - that team loses in the playoff series.\nI don't think this game is for everyone and the learning curve was pretty steep for myself.\nIt's a pretty addictive and fun game overall, I played the last incarnation of EHM and this one is improved in many ways.","May 30","true","410.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
