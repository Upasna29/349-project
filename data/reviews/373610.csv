What is it with mankind anyway? It seems like every alien race in the universe wants to see us enslaved, obliterated, or pushed into the mud. Once again you're the lone hero who must push back, and you can't stop until the extraterrestial menace is well and truly wiped out. Shoot 1UP starts with the most basic concept imaginable: You shoot, and you collect 1UPs. Since I grew up on arcade 2D shooters, I'm surprised to see any game where more than two or three extra lives can be attained per play-through. In Shoot 1UP, you get a 1UP every two or three seconds. Wow, not only is it Christmas, but I got the cyborg unicorn that I always wanted.\n\nNow hang on a second. What's with this generosity? In this game, you don't control one ship, you control up to 30. That's right, all of those extra lives are under your control at the same time. So let's just say you're in charge of a squadron. The triggers on your Xbox 360 controller expand and contract your squadron. When expanded, the ships can cover more ground, and this increases the multiplier. This also results in a wicked sweet laser. When you need to conserve ships, that's when you contract for that extra space. Note that contracting is a concious decision to place survival over score, which means your multiplier drops. Once you get a handle on the controls, it isn't hard to figure out when and where to spread your squadron.\n\nNow if you want the best of both worlds (survival and scoring) you have to master the shield. By letting go of the fire button, you start building energy for a shield. Hit the fire button again, and all bullets and most enemies are destroyed. Shield-kills result in a HUGE multiplier bonus, so you'll want to go for them whenever possible. Granted, not every situation will allow you to easily shield-kill everything, so you should use your shot/laser weapons to weaken larger enemies before attempting the finishing blow. Shield-kills are risky because they can result in lost ships due to collisions or stray bullets. When your ships are destroyed, they create small explosions that eliminates nearby bullets and enemies. Unfortunately, this means you don't get a fat multiplier bonus. It's like poetry.\n\nEach of the six stages revolves around applying what you've just learned. Enemies will come from multiple angles; all with their own tactics. It's up to you to figure out how to destroy everything, get the highest possible score, but with minimal losses. This aspect of the game can lead to some very inventive play. Since you're controlling multiple ships at once, you have to monitor their positions, making slight movements to avoid dangers. It's very important that you don't spend too much time playing defensively. The harder difficulties make it seem like you're supposed to play it safe. However, if you don't take the initiative, everything becomes increasingly claustrophobic. Since you have to destroy enemies to obtain 1ups, it can mean sacrificing one ship, in order to obtain two ships. Above all, don't forget about the shield. It's actually a very powerful weapon, and can make short work of most enemies when properly timed.\n\nThe Score Trek mode takes Shoot 1UP into a different direction. You're given one ship that becomes stronger with each power-up collected. However, since you're limited to a single solitary ship, it's game over if you take a hit. To balance this out, the game saves after the completion of each stage. Once you defeat the last boss, you start again on a harder loop. This continues for I don't know how long. There's an achievement for completing at least five successive loops. The key to scoring in this mode is simple: abuse the shield. With each loop, the shield becomes more effective. Before long, it's faster to destroy bosses with shields than anything else. Conceptually, this is a neat extra, but it's a little too one-dimensional compared to the main game.\n\nAside from the long-term appeal found in all shmups, which is playing for the hi-score, Shoot 1UP's original ideas and abstract art-style are what give it staying power. Controlling multiple ships at once is a cool idea, and it's thoroughly explored, as opposed to having an idea but never bothering to capitalize on it. The standard level of difficulty isn't too high. This gives players an incentive to really learn how everything works, so they can maximize their score. Mommy's Best Games always has an eye for choosing colors that I never knew existed. While the environments are repetitive, the creature design is well-done, and the art-direction reminds me something found on the Amiga. All in all, I think this game is worth checking out.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","October 13, 2015","true","4.7"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","27","27","2","2"

This game has a unique gameplay twist where you can keep stacking on more and more ships with every 1UP you get.  You can easily have 30 ships under your control.  Using the left and right triggers you can expand your ships to take up a larger area on the screen or you can compress them down to the size of a single ship.  You might not think there would be any reason to expand them but the weapons change a bit once you spread them out, making it very handy in some cases but increasing danger by giving yourself a larger area to get hit.\n\nI've never seen a shmup where the direction will change from moving upwards, to sideways, to backwards, constantly throughout the levels.  You often have a choice of which direction to go as well.  Not only is this mechanic unique, it's also exectuted perfectly.  Truly a benchmark for the genre.\n\nThey could have made it a bit longer though.  I was able to beat the entire game (on normal difficulty) on my first playthrough in 20 minutes.  There were quite a few stages and there is even another game mode where you do not have extra ships, just a single one where you can continuously keep upgrading it over time (but you can only get hit once for each stage or you lose that progress).  This mode is more difficult but adds to the replayability factor.  The Steam leaderboards work well too so even if you were a master of the game, you can keep replaying it to get as high on the leaderboard as possible.\n\nI also loved to see the inclusion of the almost-naked girls everywhere in that one level and the boss battle with the giant girl who shoots you from her nipples.  Although it sort of throws the atmosphere off, it is still tastefully implemented.\n\nI can't wait to try some co-op with a friend.  A must-have for any shmup fan!","January 25","true","3.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","3"

Worthy and robust - with branching paths to different challenges.

When you pick up an extra life (a 1up), instead of just increasing the number of times you can die, it adds another ship to the screen for you to control. Obviously it's a challenge to keep up to 30 ships alive at the same time, but not because of the game's controls, which make controlling a whole squadron of ships surprisingly straightforward.\n\nIt's possible to play the game very conservatively by keeping your ships tightly stacked and using the shield mechanic, but if you want to get a high score you'll have to split up your ships and make good use of all the abilities at your disposal.\n\nThe game is very short (I beat the normal difficulty in about 20 minutes), but there's plenty of replay value, between two ship types, achievements, optional side paths in levels, several scalable difficulty options, co-op multiplayer, and global score leaderboards. There's also an endless 'score trek' more which gets harder the farther you get, but you only have one ship - which feels a bit lonely after playing the regular mode.\n\nThis is a neat little shmup that can be played casually, but which drives you to master its unique mechanics if you want to get a huge high score, or if you just want to kill every enemy on the screen at once.","September 25, 2015","true","4.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I offered myself up as a low tech option since I'm still running Vista 64-bit.  The game runs well.  A 1.5x video scale option was even introduced for those with low resolutions.\n\nI'm not the most skilled player, but I managed to 1CC the game on normal difficulty on my first attempt.  I've been a wannabe long enough to know I should spend that time on survival.  However, I often found myself risking a wide formation to earn greater point medals just because it felt so natural... As expected, my meandering was punished on the higher difficulty. ;)\n\nThere's room to tweak runs.  Ship spread can be adjusted for multipliers, levels fork, and there's a rechargeable shield mechanism which can result in a score multiplier when used offensively.  For those with casual-intermediate skill like myself, trying to master the basics while taking the harder fork choices on normal difficulty seems a good fit.\n\nSome may believe the game is short.  However, the circles I lurk in have always claimed that roughly 20 minutes is the perfect time for a shmup.  The goal is to continue playing and reaching higher scores.  You're going to get out of it what you put in.  If you're still dedicated to completing it only once, I recommend playing for survival on the highest difficulty to pad the time with your deaths/retries.  There's also an endless mode which trades the fleet for a more traditional lone ship and saves progress.","September 28, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198109626876/recommended/373610/","76561198109626876","TwitchinSal","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198109626876/","813 products in account","Disclosure: I helped with pre-release testing for this game, and was given a key by the developer for that purpose.\n\nIn addition to the above disclaimer, though, I should note that I bought Shoot 1Up several years before this on XBox Live Indie Games, and that it quickly became - and still is - one of my personal favorite "homebrew" shooters. As the official description says, in most scrolling "shmups" you control one ship at a time and simply switch in one of your reserve lives when you die, but here 1Up items are not only fairly commonplace but are deployed instantly, to the point where you can control up to 30 onscreen fighters simultaneously, A novel concept, certainly, but more important is how well the developer has implemented his marquee mechanic, and thus created something much more noteworthy than a never-to-be-revisited experiment for its own sake.\n\nWhile the only "main" buttons you ever have to worry about here are "move", "shoot", and "brake" (which slows you down for more precise positioning), the "expand" and "contract" commands are equally important - hold down the former and your squadron expands outward in a circle formation (but will squish together when pressed against the screen's edge), while the latter will condense everyone down to the size of a single ship. Staying tightly together makes dodging enemies and their attacks, which come from all sides of the screen, much easier, but also limits your firepower to "pea shooter" power - to really wreak some havoc you'll need to get dangerous and spread out, which not only sends shots in additional directions but unleashes the huge "plasma auger" laser, which is great for mowing baddies down.\n\nIf you prefer to get more up close and personal with the opposition there's also the "burst" weapon. If you stop shooting for a moment a circle will start to expand around each of your fighters; tap "fire" after this and a short-range blast within the circles' area will heavily damage enemies and cancel bullets too. Your final "weapon" is the explosion left behind when one of your ships eats an attack; like the burst it causes heavy damage and neutralizes enemy fire, giving you a chance to regroup and get back on the offensive.\n\nWhat really makes all of the above so engaging, however, is the scoring system. It's actually very simple: basically, the more spread-out your formation is, the more valuable the point items destroyed enemies drop. Moreover, finishing baddies off with the "burst" grants an additional bonus, so if you're brave enough to both leave your fighters vulnerable and get right in your targets' faces before unloading at the last second, you'll be swimming in points in no time. That said, extra lives are not point-dependent, so newer players are free to progress more conservatively and get the feel for things, while genre vets can jump right into the heavy risk-reward stuff: it should be noted that just getting to the end isn't particularly difficult or drawn-out, even on the "Hard" difficulty setting, so the real challenge here comes from score attacking and mastering the constant tug-of-war between moving out or falling back.\n\nMommy's Best Games has always had a knack for creating memorable, irreverent and occasionally disturbing visuals for its releases, and that talent is on full display here: a strange, unnerving combination of the organic and mechanical infuses every sprite and background on offer, from fortress-sized protozoa to militarized orca corpses to the infamous "robo-boob" lady boss, and almost makes you forget that there's a pretty run-of-the-mill "last desperate hope against the alien menace" plot behind it all. The sound takes a similar tack, with most of the music more subdued and foreboding than you usually expect from a shooter, and a good deal of unearthly wailing and bellowing emitting from the bosses in particular, alongside the requisite bevy of explosions.\n\nFinally, if you prefer a slightly more "traditional" shooter experience there's also an easily-unlockable "Score Trek" mode, which limits you to a single ship (this means Game Over after one hit, so be careful) whose power increases in a more traditional fashion via the "1Up" items. Moreover, you can save your progress after every level to mitigate the reduced margin of error, and the game loops upon completion, so your opportunities for climbing up the leaderboards are limited only by your persistence. Two new modes ("Goof-off", which grants loads of extra 1Ups, and "Turn-based", which pauses the action when no buttons are pressed) and numerous tweaks (prettier score medals, incoming enemy warnings, adjusted squadron movement, etc.) have been added for the Steam release, so unless you're really down on "oddball" games or scrolling shooters in general I simply can't think of too many reasons not to recommend this, especially for the asking price.","October 3, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
