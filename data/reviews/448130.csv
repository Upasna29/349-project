You press the right arrow key on your keyboard and you are shown a few 1-liner text boxes which have extremely poor grammar/spelling.

It’s a simple “pixilated+” graphics game where a young woman walks through a dark and mysterious landscape filled with disturbing images. The only actions are walking and reading. It lasts no more than 10 minutes, but that is clearly stated on the Store Page, and Sharf costs less than $1US, and is now on sale for 10% less.\n\nIf you have lost someone to senseless violence, especially someone young and innocent, Sharf will be very worth your time, if only in the connection it will likely create between you, the DEV, and the community of like-minded gamers feeling this endless pain. There is minimal replay ability, but that’s hardly the point. The point is to remember, and to mourn, those we lost far too soon.\n\nSharf originally had some minor issues with imprecisely used English text, but they have been, or are, being addressed. Sharf has three guaranteed achievements, and if you’re a 100%er, this is an absolute gift for you.\n\nI thank this DEV for creating Sharf, and reminding us that the pain is nothing more than a measurement of the love and trust people once shared.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hshman/recommended/448130/","Hshman","Fenny Benny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hshman/","20 products in account","*Sigh* I'll probably get alot of hate for this, considering the strenious fact that this game is in dedication to a murded victim, butI'm here to gudge this game as a game not a momento, or memorium. The game is horribly paced, so much so that I seriously concidered quitting the game on about 3 occasions; am I glad I didn't? Not really: I get what kind of impact the game was trying to go for with the ending, however it just had me sitting there, thinking to myself; "I don't really feel anything." The ending just kinda falls flat on it's face, and then tryes to guilt you into feeling sad, and yes I get that that's far from the actual intention, however that's the feel it gives off.\nThe games art is generic however it isn't that bad, on the other had the animations are simply atrocious. There's only about 3-5 frames of animation per object, which makes them look simply laughable, especially the magic crows that seem to faze in and out of existance; perhaps if the I wasn't constantly thinking about how bad said animations looked, I would have been more invested in the ending.\nBeing the greedy monster that I am, the game just feels like a convinient use of a tragedy to get money to me, however I have to assume that this is also far from the intentions. But still the game is nowhere woth the $0.99 price tag it demands. And yes I know what may will say; "you're probably the type of person who only cares about money" so on, and so forth, but I'm just trying to be helpful.\nThe game just feels like it tryed to tug at your heart strings, but unless you're very, very highly susceptible to that kind of thing, I doubt it would even make an impact on you. There's also many things in the game that are just wasted; like the giant angel of death who's sword seems to crumble when you see him for the second time, or the crashed car. They could have set up a whole plot point where this was a kind of limbo where you resided until you found out what happened to you. Maybe if the game actually had somewhat of a story, or purpose, then the ending would have actually had an impact.\nOverall I can't recommend the game the slightest bit, and that's honestly bad considering that the author seemed to have such a connection with the murder victim, which brings me to, what seems to be, the games strongest point: the writing. Over the course of the game there are signs scattered around that give you a general feel for the authors feelings, and while there are only about 5 signs, and they each have only 2 sentences to say, they really shine in comparason to the rest of the game, however this kind of makes it even worse, because this give the game wasted potential, potential that would have actually made it worthwhile for me, had it been turned into product.\n\nI rate the game a 2/10. You can call me a monster, or a greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or wahtever you like, however I judge games by what they actually bring to the table, not by their backstory. And what the game does bring is a very short, unimpactfu, overpriced, waste of potential.\nWoah that sounded way harshe that it should have","March 12","false","0.2"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","24","35","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/448130/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","Sharf is a short and simple casual title. The store page proclaims that it's a "psychological visual story, which everyone will understand differently", however this is not the case seeing as the game explains the events that inspired its creation at the very end. Yes, I understand that the story does hold significance to the developer, but this title is one of the most lackluster experiences on Steam. I'm expecting the hate and downvotes for this review, but I'm not going to cater to a dedication; I've played far more interesting games dedicated to victims of violence.\n\nThe length of the game lasts a mere eight minutes, which is noted on the store page, and within that time you will hold down the right arrow button to progress the story. That is, until you come to a red scarf and then you will hold down the left arrow to go back from the direction you came from to finish the story. The four minute travel back to the start of the game doesn't even feature any different landscapes or visuals from the initial venture across the screen.\n\nThe plain, morose, silhouette pixel artwork and dreary, atmospheric backtrack to Sharf scream Limbo and, to a lesser degree, Nihilumbra ripoff. You will be greeted with animations that loop every 2-3 seconds and have a maximum of 5 frames; such as trees shedding leaves, crows disappearing and nooses swinging in the wind. You will get a few dialogue snippets from signs that you pass by as you travel both to the left and right of the screen. Once you arrive back at the beginning, the event and purpose of the game will be revealed to you.\n\nUnfortunately, the touching tribute does not make up for the fact that Sharf is a terrible "game"; if you can really call it that. Rather, it's a button holding simulator with "stylish" and repetitive silhouette artwork that can, and will most likely, be deemed as lazy. This is another piece of homework that someone decided to sell for $1.09 CAD, like so many recent titles that are marketed at this value. To be fair, for that price you usually can't expect much; but you should be able to expect more than holding down a button just to see repeating 3-5 frame looped animations. If you're really itching to spend a dollar, go buy Blood and Bacon instead.\n\nRating: 1.0/5.0 - It's bad.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","March 13","false","0.1"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","1"

Why? Mostly because it was fairly indistinct in this regard. Also, a lot of the text on your return bleeds over the initial set of text rendering it literally unreadable.\n\nSo, some positives: the music helped to set a somber mood. The imagery was interesting enough. It's nothing too extraordinary from a technical standpoint, but it does look cool. The melting crows/ravens, the nooses in moonlight, and so on do a lot to also help create a dark and somber mood. There is a cool death with sword image about halfway through. The ending also looked pretty neat.\n\nThe game itself is 2-D side scroller. You literally use the right arrow until you can go no further (at which point you will have unlocked two of the three achievements), then you head back the other way until the end, where you will unlock the final achievement.\n\nLike I say though...at least for me, I had no idea what the game was really meant to convey until the ending script. Also, the game is 9 minutes long. I spent 89 cents of card farming cash on this game, and while I dont regret that choice, I think that maybe 89 cents is about 70 cents more than you should actually pay for this.\n\nI'm going to offer it a 5.5 out of 10.

It was only 89cents so I decided to buy it and try it out.\nActuially, that game is just a walking simulator. You're playing as a girl and you're in the woods surrounded by cryptic and horrific sceneries. Basically, you have to cross these woods until the end, where you'll find a scard, and you'll have to go back again, during like 10 minutes. The game tries to implement a kind of story with sentences written on some signs but that doesn't work at all and doesn't really mean anything.\nI know that this game has been created to pay homage to Christina Storozhenko, a girl sexually abused in the woods, but the gameplay is just uninteresting and there could have been a better homage to her.\nHere's an advice: only buy this game if you want a fast 100% achievement - that's all.","March 13","false","0.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Should it have been free? Yeah, I think so. Should people complain about losing a dollar for a game someone worked on for their amusement? No. I could buy a soda for a dollar and it would last half as long and I wouldn't complain. However, despite that, let me enlighten those who are checking this game out so that you can have an actual review of what the game is about.\n\nFirst of all, no, this game is not like Limbo, as I came in to expect it to be. It's more of what I can describe as an "obscure pixelized narrative" of a game. You will not find much to do in this game, as it is straightforward and to the point. Push left arrow to walk, read the signs and keep walking until you discover the end. Walk back, and you finish the game. This is where people would immediately put the game off and call it "garbage, boring, half-a**ed" etc. With that in mind, let me explain why this game was made.\n\nThis game was made as a memorial, as dedication to someone who was murdered, r*ped, and killed in the forest, left to rot for 10 days before the body was discovered. That kind of dedication is admirable, even if it's with a 10-15 minute game. The fact that someone put effort and time into a game - no matter how "garbage" it may seem to others - and only charge the amount of a cheap soda, is equally admirable. Yes, there are games out there that are objectively better and free, but those get crap reviews too.\n\nOverall, for a memorial to someone dear, this game is great to me. In my own personal opinion, it could be the base for expanding into a deeper, greater game. If this were a demo to a bigger game, I would absolutely be interested in it even further. Furthermore, for a game that costs as much as a coke, I would happily reccommend it. Give a dollar to experience tragedy, and if you really don't like it, then don't spend your money. Plain and simple.","March 12","true","0.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

Now, instead of being able to skip through all of the rubbish dialogue, you have to crawl along through every piece of text s you walk from one end of the level to pick up a scarf.  But wait, there's more!  Once you have picked up the scarf, you get to repeat the journey all the way back to the beginning of the game where the game mercifully lets you finish.\n\nI actually really dig the art style (apart from the weird leg animation), but there just isn't any substance at all.  When the main feature of your game is the story, having everything such a poor narrative is a cardinal sin.  I get that not everyone speaks English, and to appeal to the widest audience on Steam, games have to be in English, but when you're left scratching your head over certain sentences, it undermines the whole experience.  I might even be able to forgive some slip ups, but having text overflowing outside of speech bubbles is just plain lazy, especially on such a short game.\n\nThe only way I can recommend this, is if you're looking to pick up some easy achievements - you can complete the entire game with just three button presses - but for everyone else, it's just not worth your time.","March 12","false","0.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

For the first 30 seconds. But then everything seems to loop over and over again. The “level design” is done extremely sloppy and lazy.\nSymbolism: Yeah, there is no. It might look like there were. But there isn’t. Only the same assets over and over again throwing its meaning right into your face.\n\nAtmosphere: the game really manages to create some atmosphere for the first few seconds. But the uninteresting art style, the dull gameplay (you can’t make an exploration game without exploration of things!) and the unnecessary nonsense you are supposed to read during the journey (yeah, I get that the messages along the way deliver somehow the cryptic information which, in conclusion, build up the meaning of the game. But as the conclusion is thrown right up into your face at the end of the game, why even bother?)\n\nGameplay: Well, walking simulators only work if there is a reason to walk: exploration or puzzle solving or just gathering bits of the story or anything: - none of this can be found here. Sharf delivers nothing, it stretches only the content of three sentences over 10 minutes of actually painful button pressing (five minutes to the right, five to the left).\n\nThis game is lazy, that is the problem. Despite how much energy and love went into making it (I am sure, it was a lot). There is nothing here to experience. The main problem is: This is nothing more than a 2D walking simulator. Which is in and by itself great. But: walking simulators are easy to make as a lot of “classic” game features aren’t used. But the rest of it, everything that makes up a walking simulator game must work properly. And nothing of it works here. There is no story to unfold, nothing that makes you think twice, nothing to explore, nothing open to interpretation. Nothing to see at all. No real message.\n\n\nSo – I have to ask: What was the real Idea behind this whole thing? Clearly, as much as I may understand the idea of creating a game as commemoration for a horrible horrible loss – steam is not the right place for that. There are other sides dedicated to the commemoration of lost ones; there are other game sites where a project like this might fit much better. I am honestly puzzled. So, this game is dedicated to a real murdered girl – okay- so , is it the best idea to SELL this game than? To SELL this memory, to put achievement in it, to make actual ♥♥♥♥ing trading cards? Just – why? Why doing something that looks so much like – a cash grab?","May 17","false","3.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The 10 minutes playtime in the discription are to be taken litteraly... you press 5 minutes on the right arrow, the next 5 minutes on the left arrow, and between that you read poorly translated English (I'm not perfect myself but c'mon... you're publishing a game here!). And even if you wanted to read the text (well... would be the only thing you can do), you won't even be able to because it does not fit in the bubble, gets cut off and thus unreadable.\n\nIn the end it says this game was made in honor of a ♥♥♥♥ and murder victim, and thanks to that I don't feel my 1€ was totally wasted... I don't know who she was but my condolences to the dependents.\n\nBut in all honesty, there are only two reasons to buy this game (no matter how much it costs):\n1) you want to pay respect to the dev and his/her cause\n2) you want a quick perfect game","March 11","false","4.5"," 17 of 42 people (40%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","40","17","42","4","0"
