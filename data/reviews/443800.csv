How there used to be a thing called local multiplayer, so very long ago? This game revives that forgotten relic in the most beautiful, modern way possible. I shouldn't even need to write a review. Do you like video games? Have you and your friends ever had fun? If so, buy Ruckus Ridge.\n\nRuckus Ridge is similar to the old Mario Party games, in that you have varying mini games with different objectives. Collect the most coins, blow up your fellow couch player, get to the VR player in the middle, etc. The VR twist makes this very fresh and exciting however. You'll hunt and be hunted. You'll talk smack on your deafened friend, and shout profanities at anyone around you while cut off from the outside world. And ultimately, you'll have fun.\n\nSo get this game. Unless you don't have any friends, in which case you should handle that first.","April 7","true","2.8"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","91","39","43","16","0"

It isn't perfect but it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good and the combination of hilarity, great presentation (the announcer is hilarious), and asymmetric play with the couch users is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ great.\n\nThe best part about it though? The HMD is a hot seat. Every player gets one chance in the HMD, and it makes sure everyone gets a brief, hilarious, and engaging time. If you have friends, and you're looking for a good time, grab this game up quick. So far the biggest surprise that has come out of my Vive for me.\n\nHere's a clip of the hilarity we all experienced: https://youtu.be/CpboeL7EVlU\n","April 21","true","1.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Still has a lot of un-capitalized potential as far as gameplay goes, but the fundamental concept is sound! Lot's of fun with this one :)","May 4","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Who says VR was isolating? Invite up to three friends, let em have a seat on your couch and play 1 VR player against couch players. So much fun!","April 24","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It kinda feels more like a "Guy in VR headset beats up his friends" type of game more than a fair and balanced set of mingiames.  I've had a lot of fun with it so far anyway, though.","May 11","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Games like this need to be made for vive, but with alot more content. Not worth the price.","May 9","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or something...awkward to explain to family in other room.\n\nCons:\n-Seems like the whole game was thrown together, could be attributed to the developers not being American/English\n-Not too many maps/game modes\n-I wish there were more customizable options\n\nI do recommend purchasing the game if you have a group of 3-4 friends coming over.","May 17","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
