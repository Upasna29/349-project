Or 'Defence Grid 2' (not released while writing this review)\nFor those who have done that (and only for those, every body else: play DG! It's really so much better) and are still looking for a tower defence game ... well I try to make it short.\n\nVery small selection of towers, enemy types don't have any special abilities (just more hit points), unspent ressources are not awarding interest (so no need to act economical), only very few in-game tower statistics and important stats like Kills or DPS of towers are missing, the 3 different targeting choices of towers work unreliable at best, towers are just placed next to the path the enemy takes (so no option to place towers on a free grid to influence paths etc.).\n\nOn the bright side: over 20 maps, even on medium difficulty some early maps are challenging (esp. if you are looking for a flawless win) and an interactive feature (> hellfire; activated manually) to increase DPS considerably. Hellfire charges with time for each upgraded tower and adds a nice real-time tactic effect to the game.\n\nConclusion: A tower defense game ... best suited on mobile platforms, rather less for PC.\n(I played it anyway while waiting for the release of DG2, so I should give it a recommendation I guess ... such a confusing world we live in ;-) )","July 20, 2014","false","46.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I have found it to be a simple and addictive tower defense game that surpassed my expectations. My game play experience is based on playing under Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit with nvidia graphics (mainly) and on Windows 7 Pro 64-bit also with nvidia graphics.\n\nIt runs very well in both Linux and Windows, with no noticeable lag or other issues of any kind. I am sure this will play even on older hardware as it has multiple resolution options from 640 x 480 – 1920 x 1080, and 6 graphic options as well ranging from Fastest – Fantastic.\n\nThe game has a progressive path, starting out simple and getting a little harder with each level you play. Each level has 3 difficulty settings, Easy-Medium-Hard, which would appear to correlate to how many Hit Points each of the enemy units have. There are 6 different types of Defensive structures that can be built, which can be seen in the games screen shots, and each one can be upgraded 4 times after being placed for money which you earn by killing the enemy units. The building upgrades are progressive in cost, each one doubling in price.\n\nYou can pause, speed up, and save the game play as needed. I personally found that saving the game on the Hard difficulty allowed for an easier less and time consuming way to get the Steam achievements.\n\nSome people have had problems getting past levels on the last wave or two. A tip I can suggest that works for me is to sell my structures the enemy unit/units have passed and rebuild further down the path as needed.\n\nI have read some negative reviews about the defensive towers AI not being the best and not targeting units correctly. While I agree they don't always target they way I want them to or think they should, you can predict how they will behave and build accordingly to overcome their shortcomings. I observed this during the first 5 or so maps and then built accordingly for other maps and no longer was bothered by this issue.\n\nIf your looking for a simple, fun tower defense challenge then this game is great and definitely worth the purchase!","August 9, 2014","true","137.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Too often towers will shoot at everything except the enemies who are right next to them and/or moving out of the zone. You've got three targeting options: attack nearest, attack strongest, attack weakest. As far as I can tell, these do absolutely nothing other than make your tower spaz out and waste time aquiring targets and not attacking at all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/recommended/312410/","shoggofu","YouTube shoggofu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/","257 products in account","First impressions:\n\nIt's a cheap tower defense game. I played almost until like the last round of the first stage (assuming there are more stages lol).\n\n(optional let’s play footage)\nhttp://youtu.be/Tfc35bl_Iz0\nHonestly I didn't really want to keep playing. It looks like something you could find on places like kongragate.com and play for free in your browser or a mobile device game ported to PC. It has pretty basic gameplay and graphics; really basic. You only have access to two types of turrets from the start which are pretty boring. Presumably you have to make it to later levels to access more turrets. So basically the game restricts your options from the start.\n\nThe only reason I would recommend this game is if you want a cheap tower defense game. But be warned that is exactly what you will be getting. I just played Radiant Defense the other day which is another recent tower defense game on steam and that's a much better colourful game. Radiant defense is actually the same price. The only reason Defense Zone is cheaper right now is because it is on special. Which is the better choice? You do the math lol\n\nSeriously click here for gameplay footage of Radiant Defence and my first impressions review to see for yourself\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 14, 2014","true","1.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I don't want a huge challenge. That being said, I bought this game because it was cheap and I like tower defense games. It has eighteen or nineteen maps. I have been playing them on "easy" difficulty, not really wanting a challenge.\nBut, I can't seem to beat the eigth map! Even on easy mode, I have tried it three times and seem to have made no progress in beating the last wave. So, I seriously doubt if I will ever see anything beyond the eight map, considering that the others are locked until I beat it. So, I would have to say the game is too difficult and probably wasn't play tested very much.\n\nUpdate: After playing it for a while, I have gotten farther. Now I'm stuck on level eighteen. LOL!\n\nIt is fun, but rather simplistic. It only has a few types of towers, which can be upgraded twice.","July 18, 2014","true","149.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
