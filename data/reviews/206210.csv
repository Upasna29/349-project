It's a game where you play as a fake Batman or Joker and battle others to the end. Thats right. You get to play as Cereal Killers (Serial and Cereal LOL). The real thing you should pay attention to is it's true sense of humor.\n\nGraphics:They are good as they can get. It can sometimes be blocky and empty in some areas.\n\nSound:The dialogue is funny and the voices are great. For example:At the start of a battle, a joker says "I'M SCARED OF CLOWNS!!! (Cries)" and when a bat is killed, the joker taunts "You drop like a sack of puppies, Cute." I could barely hear the music though.\n\nGameplay:One word:FUN!!! It delivers tight controls. It can be frustraiting at times but it's still fun. You can't pick the teams though. The other choices away from Team Deathmach aren't that interesting. You can customize your Bat or Joker with Costume Coins and Unlock Keys you earn throughout the game. You can can cusomize him or her with voice types, body types etc. There are lot of weapons. For example:A parrot cannon, a cannon that shoots out parrots. There are also missions to complete using different gadgets.\n\nOverall:I would't say that Gotham City Imposters is one of the best First Person shooters out there. But it is still a great game. Although there are a couple flaws, it's still awesome, creative, and hilarious. Recommended for those FPS fans out there.\n\nDOPE\nTrue Sense Of Humor\nLots Of Unlockables\nTight Controls\nNOPE\nChooses Teams For You\nUninteresting Choices\n\n8\nGreat","November 25, 2013","true","33.3"," 249 of 286 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","249","286","0","0"

With customization and improvisational strategy light years beyond TF2, it competes in the same space as Valve's champion WITHOUT a shred of developer support. That's right, this game is "Dead," in the sense kids who wonder what DSL was use the word about games. Every week, NO patch appears to incrementally increase the power of the loudest forum whiners. NO new cosmetic packages are released at $2.99 a pop. No season pass is up for sale, followed by DLC that is not included in it. In point of fact what Monolith did by "abandoning" GCI when it went F2P was give us the best of both worlds: A game that has neither a price tag nor active marketing/Pay to win tendencies. I wish more developers would abandon their games!\n\nAs to the actual gameplay, it's stellar in all the ways that are underrated today. The key thing is the custom loadouts: Any weapons, gadgets, support items, body types, and perks, can be combined. Any strategy can be supported. What pre-defined classes there are are totally optional and practically unused, as players are allowed to develop their own methods and build an improvisational, customized playstyle and support it fully with their gear. This would be like allowing the scout to carry the heavy's minigun in tf2, only it slows him down when it's equipped. Want to combine a sniper rifle with a shotgun and bear traps to defend your nest? No problem. Rather back your sniping up with a machine gun and some motion sensors? Equally good. Want to build your strategy around grappling above players' heads and then dropping your massive weight on them? Try it, let us know how it goes. Whatever you want to attempt is up to you.\n\nThe result has been a little bit of a vidication for me; people sometimes argue that balance in a pvp game can only be maintained by constant, active adjustment in the form of buffing and nerfing by patch. Well, GCI has had none of that, and yet the complaints about OP builds (such complaining is immortal and without limit) have largely migrated from one build to another another. No strategy is singularly overpowered; you can get in a GCI forum and listen to guys shout about how ten different things are completely broken and overpowered. In my book if there's ten ways to be overpowered, that's the same thing as ten balanced strategies, since no one of them asserts itself as standing above the others. When I first started playing GCI, divebombing mighties were considered impossibly cheap and unbalanced; now they're a footnote. And it hasn't happened through patches or "balancing"; it happened because players, lacking a mommy Monolith to rescue them, noticed the available ways to counter the scourge of the skies and used them. Liberty prevails!\n\nFree yourself from dependence on your next fix of DLC! Cast off the shackles of developer "support"! The next time a game company holds out to you some shiny trinket saying "With this microtransaction, you will gain the power to defeat all who would oppose you!" bite that tempter's hand. And then come play GCI, we could use more players.","January 15, 2014","true","505.4"," 102 of 118 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","102","118","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wisbi/recommended/206210/","wisbi","Wisbi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wisbi/","1109 products in account","I haven't played much of this game. I have liked (for the most part) what I HAVE played. But the developers dropped it a long time ago, and now it's sad to say, this game is pretty dead. It feels like the current community consists of about two or three dozen people, as you encounter the same ones every other match. There's only ever one or two matches going on at a time at that, so choices are very limited. Nobody plays anything but deathmatch, and you'll be stuck between alot of new players coming and going and the hardcore players who seem to never play anything else.\n\nThe gameplay overall is fun, while it has a very cartoony style, fighting isn't really a chip-battle like one would expect if coming in from something like TF2. While not perfect by any means, it holds up fairly well. Some key issues should have been addressed before the game was dropped though, like how the horrid lag compensation and lack of aim penalty while jumping actually makes bunny hoping a valid 'tactic', while most games it would only get you dead while looking stupid.\n\nEach weapon will kill someone as dead as the next, but due to all the variables to take into account, and the power of weapon to ease of usage ratio being so poorly handled with things like The Thunder Dragon, Persuader or Buccaneer, the game's fallen into a sloppily organized rock, paper, scissors of cookie cutter loadouts. Every match ends with a shot of the MvPs, and top player(s) will always be someone using said loadout, taking out the original feel of "skill matters" by making it less about chipping and more about aiming that the initial game seemed to go for, when you can just pop on a jetpack and rocketlauncher and rule any map. Or pick the fattest body type and dive into everyone with a glider for an easy kill. Or bunny hop with the one-shot-kill sniper rifle, or rollar skate around with the shotgun.\n\nRarely do you see a person running around healing team mates or for that matter, anything else team related. Infact the game does very little to reinforce the feel of being on a team, constantly mixing them up every round, giving you no option but to use voice chat or the terrible text system, text that displays for a moment and vanishes with no ability to go back and read it. (If you can't read it in the middle of a firefight, then too bad I guess!) and the lack of the ability to actually type while on ANY screen except for the actual match is another notion that shouldn't have gone through.\n\nI normally try to withhold judging a community in a game review, but since this is an online game, communty is indeed apart of it. To put it simply, avoid it. While not as toxic as some communities I've played in, it's not by any means a warm environment. If things like smack talking, name calling, trolling, and just general ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ry bothers you, it's probably not the game for you. (Really, what online game *is* by that point?)\n\nPerhaps I'm being too critical of this game for being what it exactly is. A fun, goofy little shooter to waste some time with. But if that's all it was meant to be, then why make a prestiege system? Why make so much of the game, unlocking, and achievements be about pure grinding? I look at this game, and see something meant to be a serious time-investment but lack the notion to be one. (What with the game being pretty much dead now..) And it suffers for it. Not just the lack of updates, but the fact it had POTENTIAL. The fact it WAS good.\n\nCommunity could be better and more lively.\nGame could've used some balancing before it died.\nOverall, I'd have to rate the actual game fairly okay with a 6 out of 10.\nBut I still won't recommend it DUE to it being dead.","April 13, 2015","false","30.4"," 121 of 166 people (73%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","73","121","166","18","0"

Here you can dress up as either a wannabe Joker or Batman, hence the "Impostors" title. The gameplay is immediately gripping and will keep you playing for hours despite the small selection of levels and the sad fact that noone is playing anything except team deathmatch. You can costumize your player character with a variety of clothing options which you can buy with ingame money or real $$$. The costume packs are definitely overpriced and it takes forever to earn enough costume coins in game which is not a big issue because the game is just plain fun. The learning curve is steep but you'll get into the game quite easily if you have literally played any fps since and including wolfenstein 3D, with enough nuances to keep you playing and improving your skills to annoy the hell out of the opposing team with your sniping skills. Slicing your way through enemies with a Katana while on rollerblades never gets old.\nWhat sets Gotham City Impostors apart from other games in the genre is the selection of gadgets and modifiable weapons inspired by the Comic Universe, anything can be improved by a jetpack and bouncing boots. Nothing here is entirely unique but it's different enough to have a distinct comedic flavor that you won't find in the fps circus of brown that insists on staying in town, drinking all the beer and farting in the elevator.\n\nWherever there's light there is shadow and while the roaches lurking in the darkness all wear silly hats they remain a nuisance. Most of the levels have the weakness of what can be referred to as clusterf*ck-points. Every player piles in on one place and it's far too easy for a team to overpower the other because players will keep spawning in that exact area. This happens quite often due to the design and small size of the maps. Their colourful charme helps to alleviate this problem most of the time, but expect to repeatedly get angry.\nThe main frustration comes with the limited nature of Gotham City Impostors. Few costume options, few levels, few useful weapons, only two factions. A lot of potential is left untapped. Imagine what this game could be with a sandbox approach, several different factions fighting for a piece of gotham city - think impostors of batman, joker, penguin, catwoman, twoface etc. each with their own unique traits, design, weapons and gadgets and you'd have an incredible game.\nWhat we have so far is definitely fun and I recommend playing it while it's still alive, but I see it more as a proof of concept than a finished game.","January 21, 2015","true","47.0"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","30","31","4","0"

It's a great multiplayer action game with great personality, a hilarious game with a great sense of humour and utter ridiculousness, endless customization options, and a very direct and intense gameplay that has charmed us. The great thing about this game is that it allows you to play it the way you want. Seriously.\n\nYou'll be able to unlock in-game items, edit characters and customization easily no need to pay for DLC's just play, level up and you are ready to unlock mods, weapons, characters and many more. There are few things which need to buy DLC but isn't necessary, you can play very well after unlocking items without paying a single cent.\n\nIt's a FPS game for people who are looking for and it's better to play Gotham City Impostors for free rather than to buy $$ for COD. I bet you'll forget COD, if you'll play this game for once. Theres a lot of fun to play with friends and make if you don't have.\n\nI don't know yet why this game is considering as dead which is not! People are still playing either they are old or newbies but play at particular time period. The matchmaking is a major drawback of this game because it's so freaking slow, but when you get into the actual the game is a blast and so much fun to play. Go ahead.. This game is free and worth to play. ENJOY!","August 27, 2015","true","31.3"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","81","34","42","7","0"

Sniping is incredibly fun and rewarding (Buccaneer is amazing.) and this is way less pay to win than you would think.\nNow, sit down.\nWhen you think of free to play, whats the first thing that comes to mind? If you answered microtransactions, you are right.\nWell, forget about those. This game balances that out. You can buy guns, but all the guns are balanced in their own way, and each gun is not so godly overpowered that nothing can stop it. You usually can find a strategy. Some things are overpowered, yes, like the thermal wallhack goggles, but they are useful. Back to pay2win, this game isn't that at all. You can buy some guns, you can buy calling cards and backgrounds, costume coins (currency used to buy outfits for your player) and thats pretty much it. No instant buy max rank, nothing like that. This game is far better than games like Blacklight Retribution, and this game actually sucks you in. You must complete that next challenge, that next achivement...\nThis game has a remarkable hit detection for a free2play shooter, I must mention.\nAlso, this is coming from a guy who HATES super heroes and the like, while this is literally the ONLY super hero related anything game I will play without being bored.\nBesides, who doesn't wanna shoot a few Joker clones?\nAlso, the wallhack goggles aren't THAT overpowered. Your teammates can see the enemies as well as you, but only for around 15 seconds, overpowered maybe a tiny bit.\nNow if you'll excuse me, I need to go shoot some more jokers in the face with a sniper rifle.","February 26","true","22.9"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","21","22","6","0"

I mean what FPS allows you to Fly, Grapple hook, jetpack, go Invisable, or jump across the map, and more! Also there is 5 different charactor types allowing you to either move quicker or have a higher max health. Then there is the Weapons: of course there is the semi/auto rifles, SMGs, Snipers and Shotguns, but also theres unique weapons such as the Electric ball shooting Witch Doctor, a Bow, a Sword, and even a freeze gun! of course theres more weapons such as the rocket launcher, but i wont list them all here. Gameplay gets a 10/10!\n\nDown sides to this game: no dedicated servers, its peer to peer hosted and when you get a bad host, its bad! Also there is no server browser so at times can be tough to find a match or even see that there is one because the're full. Has a decent player base but i wouldnt call this a popular game, so could use more players(altho haven't seen a game yet that was like "there's to many players!" lol). Would be nice to get some more maps ;)\n\nI see negitive reviews for "unbalanced matchmaking" and i'll assure you this isnt really true. it places players from previous match from how they did into teams for the next match, the exception is when players party up, then it tries to put partied players on the same team. Much rather have the option to play with friends than having even matching always.\n\nI play all the time, seems to be my favorite game right now. Definatly worth the cost of free! not sure i'd buy this game tho if it costed, really needs dedicated server support for that. it would be a 10/10 game if it had dedi support, more maps, and server browser imo.\nbut it dont so...\nI give it a 8/10.\nI definatly reccomend this game!","September 23, 2014","true","931.5"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","24","28","5","0"

It's a great game but in the early days it could be an occasional source of frustration.  Since it was patched and went F2P it's now stable.  Its not pay-to-win although if you're new and going up against vetererns with unlocked weapons you may feel otherrwise.  Don't rage and pound a few levels first.  Everyone has access to the same weapons but you have to either give it a few levels so you can unlock or buy a shortcut pack.  There have been a few tweaking tips that came out to increase the framerate and playability.\n\nYes some say this is abandonware, etc.  however it's F2P and the servers are up with no end in sight.  There is a vibrant community around this title and I have met some wonderful personalities.  This is a mjor reason why I find myself coming back to this time and time again.\n\nWith the recent humble bundle having the "GCI Pro Kit" in it there should be a ton of these kicking around.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfklebba/recommended/206210/","jfklebba","Ergaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfklebba/","247 products in account","Gotham City Impostors is a competitive multiplayer FPS by Monolith Games, which was enough of a selling point for me, despite admittedly not being much of a multiplayer person. Monolith has been responsible for several of my favorite shooters, from Blood to Shogo to F.E.A.R., and that pedigree certainly comes through in this game. Before I continue, let it be known that the most frequent comparison I've seen has been to Call of Duty, which I've never played multiplayer for any length of time.\n\nFirst off, the game looks great. The technical side of the graphics aren't phenomenal by 2015 standards, but they more than make up for that in aesthetic. The central conceit is that you are playing street gangs made up of groupies of Batman and the Joker, and as such, the character designs convey the appropriate sense of wackiness. This is met by terrific customization, from weapons skins to individual elements of your character's outfit and body type (The latter serves as the class system, with the chick being fast but fragile and the four male types are various grades ranging from slightly heavier to tank) to their voice pitch and speaking accent. The weapon design feels appropriately sloppy, with bottle rocket launchers and so on. The levels are well designed, and almost all based on trashed urban exteriors, so if that's not your thing look elsewhere. Overall, the maps are all terrific and leave a lot of room for different tactics. Overall, the aesthetic design is unparalleled. Between the psychotic character appearances to the terrific little quips that all of the characters throw out, the theme comes together beautifully. It might be silly for some, but it joins Team Fortress 2 as a great parody of the modern competitive FPS, as well as the Batman mythos.\n\nThe shooting feels nice, although the short time to kill doesn't leave much room for error and rewards ambushing tactics. The coolest thing this game does for gameplay is the gadgets. These are movement-oriented items that will serve as your movement technique. The characters move much slower than Quake or UT2K4, but with the gadgets, the speed of the game is increased drastically. I like the Rollerskates, which basically make your character move with the speed and floatiness of a older FPS, although with a little bit less control (It can also lead to ridiculous amounts of knife kills). There's the glider, which does exactly what it says on the tin and also allows you to dive bomb enemies. Another nice one is the grappling hook, which lets you latch on to any surface you can shoot with it. There are a number of these, and the levels are designed with loads of elements that allow you to use them to their fullest, like ramps for the skates or grates with updrafts for the glider. You can tell that this was the focus of the game design, and Monolith did it justice.\n\nThe free-to-play model is one of the better ones. The initial loadouts are great and levels come in quick. I haven't spent a dime and I've been competitive against people who are much higher levels than me. In fact, for my light character the starter FPS is fantastic and feels terrific. You'll get plenty of coins for ingame purchases just by playing the game with some small skill.\n\nThere are two big things that take away from the game, however. First is the ping. Now, at the time of this writing I currently reside in Hawaii, which is hell for connectivity. In Red Orchestra 2, I have between 150-400 ping. Even so, in Team Fortress 2 and Dirty Bomb, both of which I've been playing recently, I can find 60-90 ping servers pretty easily. In GCI, I couldn't tell you a number. The game rates ping with bars, like a cell phone. When I'm lucky, I get two bars, and most of the time, one. What makes this worse is that GCI there is no server browser that I can find. If the game wasn't so fun, the lack of a server browser would be fatal. It is fun, though, so let me move on.\n\nThe second big problem is that at this point GCI is functionally a Team Deathmatch game. There are a number of game types, but no one ever seems to be playing them. It's pretty easy to find a decent TDM game, but it can and will get repetitive for long play sessions and it can really screw over compulsive achievement hunters.\n\nAll in all, it's free to play and one of the good ones. The mechanics themselves are excellent, and the Team Deathmatch is always good for a laugh. I recommend it, just don't expect much variety in the modes.","August 4, 2015","true","12.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Follow your crazy.

If you're looking for a multiplayer shooter that you can jump into now and again for some quick fun. This is a great FPS, with many interesting concepts. It feels a lot like Call of Duty but with a lot more wackyness gameplaywise. Some places are a little wonky, but its loads of fun.\n","May 29, 2015","true","4.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

You want to know how I got ‘em? My father was a CoD fan, and a fiend. And one night he goes off crazier than usual. I gets the controller to defend myself. He doesn’t like that. Not-one-bit. So – me watching – he takes the power button to me, laughing while he does it! So now I use GCI.  Now see, I belive what doesn't kill you, simply makes you stranger. Take this game for example. See, the free to play market deserved a better class of F2P, the devs gave it to them. Now, the game is small but there's a lot of potential for... "Agressive" expansion. And that, is my completley serious review at this game.

The customization of the characters expresses yourself in ways you desire, including but not limited to how the voice of the character sounds. It's really fun when you get use to it and you don't usually rage quite as much as a COD game. Players are a lot more friendly than on COD and I think it's because no one takes the ranks very seriously. Honestly if you're looking for a free fun alternative to COD, this is the game for you. If you're going to buy any of the packs I would choose the ultimate pack for $29.99 it gives everything the game has to offer except the things you need to earn while playing. That's the best investment in this game, I wouldn't waste my money on the smaller packs.

There are 3 body types, Light, Medium, and Heavy, who are scaled with their body types. (I.E. Heavy has a lot of health, but is slow. Light has low health, but is fast. Medium is the balance.) There are 2 sides to "choose" from, Bats and Jokerz who are respectively representing their chosen Icon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jawsch/recommended/206210/","jawsch","Magical Unicorn of DEATH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jawsch/","64 products in account","Hands down, my most favorite game of all time on Steam!\n\nIt's not comparable to any other FPS game out there. You can't beat the fact that it's free but even if it cost $30, I would pay it. I've never enjoyed a game as much as I do GCI.\n\nIf you've never been big into FPS games, like myself, there's likely quite a bit of a learning curve. You'll probably die like crazy in the beginning, get teamed against a level 1000 and want to throw your mouse across the room while screaming profanities about how they had to be a hacker.\n\nPROS:\n- This game is fun!\nHands down, this is the most entertaining game I've played in YEARS. Especially considering it's a FPS. I literally play this around 20 hours a week (sometimes more, sometimes less) and it's always my go to game even after this long.\n\n- Customizing everything to fit your play style\nA lot of FPS games just give you the options of various weapons which really only fall into a few categories of long range (sniper), short range (shotgun, SMG) or medium range (assault, rpg/rockets, grenades)\nThis game lets you customize not only your Body Types (Each have different amounts of hit points, speed, agility, etc.) Outfits (which are purely cosmetic), Weapon types, support weapons and support "passive" abilities.\n\n- The weapons / support items are hilarious\nParrot Launcher: You literally shoot a parrot out of a gun and it gnaws on people's faces so they can't see anything\nIce Gun: You shoot beams of ice that can freeze people into a block of ice and upon taking any damage, EXPLODE!\nHatchet: Pretty straight forward axe but you can throw this damn thing across a map. With good accuracy or luck, insta-kill some noob just standing there. Fun to be had\nJetpack: Rain DEATH from above upon everyone\nInflatable Insoles: Beach ball shoes that let you double jump\nToxic Gas: A can of beans, when used you fart a stench cloud that impairs and hurts enemies. What more is there to say?\n\n- It's FREE!\nSeriously, there is no reason to at least give this game a try and play it for a few hours to get the hang of it. Sure you'll probably lose a bunch like I did and swear people are somehow cheating. There are spots you'd never think of hiding, there will be lag spikes and you learn how to play with them and still do decent. Overall, I LOVE this game and I seriously cannot suggest it more to people, even if you hate games like Call of Duty. This may be a FPS but it's nothing like CoD.\n\nCONS:\n- The game has basically been abandoned\nThere won't be any new maps, any updates, etc. This game is what it is and is likely staying that way. Makes me sad because I love it but doesn't have an affect on the game really, just makes me sad about it's future.\n\n- No dedicated servers\nThe game is peer to peer and of course, people will horrible connections don't lower their connection settings because they either A) Don't realize they need to or B) Think it will affect their performance (It won't). So there are times you'll get a crappy host and can't do much of anything. So if you know you have a bad connection, go into the settings and lower your connection settings to 1.5mb. It just makes you less likely to host a game.\n\n- Matchmaking\nI wouldn't exactly call this a CON but there are times when your opposing team can be a level 1000, 300, 200 and some lowbies and your team is all under level 50. It sucks but it's all part of the game. Honestly, getting my butt kicked when I was a low leveler helped to teach me some tricks. Sometimes I would just follow them around and watch what they were doing. It taught me some vantage points, hiding spots, etc. There are some groups of top levelers that get together and form a team. That's not really my style, I prefer to just play by myself and let the teams fall how they will.\n\n- Not a ton of players\nI've never really had any problems finding matches (US East Coast) unless it's like a monday morning or an odd time when post people are at work or school. Sucks because I tend to have days off from work that most everyone else doesn't but eh...that's life? If I log on in the afternoon or on a weekend, I rarely ever have a problem finding a match.\n\nThis game is FUN! Simple as this, this game is hilarious, fun and entertaining. I've played well over 600 hours of this game and don't see myself stopping any time soon. I recommend them game to pretty much all of my online friends. If you're new and don't know what you're doing or have questions, most of the top level guys (level 1000) aren't ♥♥♥♥♥ and will be more than willing to answer questions, give suggestions, etc. Many of us love this game and want to see more people get into it and play.\n\nThis game is free, there is no excuse why you don't have it in your library. ;D","September 29, 2014","true","663.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Phew. Bruh. Wait, oh yeah, Review,: so this game is about you play as a Fat, Skinny, Kinda Buff, Fake Batman, and also, a Fat, Skinny, Kinda Buff, Fake Joker. as you fight through cities, that Laughing Gas have been cover so you can't leave. Like Literally WTF, this game is like Batman but with guns.  As, you fight, I guess you have to take the place of an Old Bruce Wayne, and the Old Joker and become the Supreme Leader of a Gang. Also, don't mention the Grapples, Gliders, Roller Skates, and Jetpack, feels like a Normal Tuesday Afternoon. Its a Great Game. The Objective of the game is to kill enough to own the city, the Highest Level to get to is 1000. Which would take forever unless you are on some Serious Weed. Or just stay on your Computer, 420 weeks straight, and their you are MLGuel  that has Autism. The Graphics are actually better than Woodle Tree Adventures. This game would make you Lesbian just like Barbie Dreamhouse Party. Also, their is a Hack where you can become Barbie, wow. What is not better, than Coach Jacking Off to Batgirl. 10/10 would get blown up to Coach again.","March 27, 2015","true","5.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","7","11","7","0"

The playerbase has lost most of its skilled players and the game is now infested with witch doctor and thunder dragon users who abuse the broken mechanics of the game. It was truly a great game that didnt take itself too seriously. It could have been even better if the devs didnt leave before fixing many of the major problems with the game including broken weapon mechanics and terrible framerate lag/stuttering. I won't give the game a bad rating because it it still very much playable, it just isn't as good or as great as it could have been. I still come back to the game every once in a while, after taking long, long breaks to play other games. There is still something underneath all the games flaws that makes me come back to it time and time again.","March 15, 2014","true","655.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To succeed in this game you don't have to just run around and shoot people. This game has a good part in tactics and figuring out which loadaout is best to use in certain situations.\n\nThe customisation of the loadouts is almost limitless. You can be a fat 200+ HP dude or a thin 100 HP girl. Also the character's weight affects the speed.\nThe gamemodes are also fun. Fumigation and Bounty hunter are my favourites.\n\nAnd now for the bad things about the game. The game has no servers. It runs on P2P technology which means that one of the players hosts the game and if the host decides to quit all players get kicked out.\n\nNevertheless this game is extremeley fun and ultra-addictive.

Because it really isn't, while the game does offer you to pay for weapons or equipment so you can unlock the whole game at once, no bought piece is any better than the original version, something that makes the game even less F2P is the fact that you earn points for new items VERY fast, you don't even need 24 to have the majority of the huge available armory, the game simply gives you tokens and you choose what you want, you can unlock a certain playstyle or upgrades fast, also paying makes the game feel even more cheap, the fact that you bought all the items leaves you nothing to work for, i enjoyed earning tokens.\n\nGameplay:\nIts quite simple and sometimes basic, but the huge variety of customizable gameplay styles and upgrades make up for that, the smallest things like choosing one attachment over the over will have penalties and advantages.\nUnlike other free "basic" shooters, this one shines through chaos, because of the huge amount of gameplay styles and classes, you can prepared for something but not all, while the game encourages aggressive gameplay, things change when you realise that you often have to escape situations.\nAlso, the game has a relaxing factor, its nice to grab a beer and enjoy the chaos, no gameplay feels really predictable and you will find when starting the game getting a huge amount of surprise deaths and kills, this game rewards cunning over skill, the most ruthless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the map will usually have a much more dominating presence than the guy that is so skilled that he could headshot people that are using the kite or hook out of panic.\n\nCommunity and Developers:\nTerrible, the game has been abandoned by the developers, leaving the game often quite buggy and sometimes network problems (not so much present like other F2P games that have full support) and the Community itself mostly just focuses on Deathmatch despite multiple gameplay mode, none of them are really bad so i don't know how that happened.\n\nConclusion:\nIt is (or better was) a game with high potentional, the chaotic, hilarious style and gameplay makes it very enjoyable once you start getting used to the game, it does have alot of things other Developers should learn from, although the fact the Devs gave this game up does not make it as enjoyable as it could have been.","February 20, 2015","true","38.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The variety of weapons, mods, gadgets, perks, skins and challenges forces the player to launch the game over and over again. The classic levelling up system is responsible for discovering the various content of the game. When you kill, finish a map or complete a challenge, you gain experience. After you collected enough XP you gain a level and you can unlock new equipment or outfit for your character. The selectable gear is fixed, there are no random items, no pay2win items, so everyone can fight equally (mostly, when there are no Lvl 100+ players on the map).\n\nThe matchmaking system could be much better. The system automatically sorts the players into teams (Jokerz or Batmans), and there is no way to switch sides during in-game, so the teams are sometimes quite unbalanced. The time limit before starting the map is pretty annoying. You don't have enough time to review your gear, especially when you unlocked dozens of features, there is no time to see the new options and choose them. Also, besides Team Deathmatch the other game modes are mostly dead, but the TDM alone is enough for having a good time (for a while).\n\nVerdict:\nIf you like fun FPS, batman, gliding, grappling, skating, shooting, bows, katanas and parrots, this game is for you.\n\n7/10 [Recommended]","April 8, 2015","true","29.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was a bit torn at first, but eventullay i caved and got it. In the end its free to play so worst case senario you wasted time on an okay game. It isnt just an okay game though, it acceptional. the graphics are good, the guns a cool, and not unreasonably difficult to obtain. The gadgets work great and are fun to use, each one having its own advantages and disadvantages. No weapons, gadgets or suport items are TOO OP there is one weapon, the whitch doctor, that is a little unfair at times, but you can easily buy it without using real life money. The mascots are a bit OP as well, and the fact that you cant get them without paying real money makes me want to call BS but not a lot of people have them so its not a big deal. overall in terms of free to play shooters, Gotham City Imposters is right up there with TF2. The humor is good, the action is fast paced, there is no denying its a great game, and best of all its FREEEEEEEEE!!!!\n\nif I was to rate this game i would give a 9/10 in terms of free to play standards.","December 23, 2013","true","22.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The variety of weapons, mods, gadgets, perks, skins and challenges forces the player to launch the game over and over again. The classic levelling up system is responsible for discovering the various content of the game. When you kill, finish a map or complete a challenge, you gain experience. After you collected enough XP you gain a level and you can unlock new equipment or outfit for your character. The selectable gear is fixed, there are no random items, no pay2win items, so everyone can fight equally (mostly, when there are no Lvl 100+ players on the map).\n\nThe matchmaking system could be much better. The system automatically sorts the players into teams (Jokerz or Batmans), and there is no way to switch sides during in-game, so the teams are sometimes quite unbalanced. The time limit before starting the map is pretty annoying. You don't have enough time to review your gear, especially when you unlocked dozens of features, there is no time to see the new options and choose them. Also, besides Team Deathmatch the other game modes are mostly dead, but the TDM alone is enough for having a good time (for a while).\n\nVerdict:\nIf you like fun FPS, batman, gliding, grappling, skating, shooting, bows, katanas and parrots, this game is for you.\n\n7/10 [Recommended]","April 8, 2015","true","29.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unlikely.\n(But not due to lack of quality)\n\nI remember seeing this on Gametrailers before it came out, with me naming it "Call of Duty: Batman Warfare". At the time, it did seem like it was cashing in on the CoD craze, but not that it looked bad by any means - just that every company was doing it. Still, I was big into the Arkham series, and I eventually bought the game prior to it becoming F2P, but idiotically never played it during that time. I finally got to it, and I'm finding so far is what to be a very entertaining and competent spin on the Batman world. I was surprised I did so well in my first match with a shotgun. The game has tons of variety due to different weapon types, loadout potential, and gadgets that change the way you traverse the map, including be able to move faster with rollerskates and jump ramps, jump on trapolines, fly with jetpacks or use grapple hooks - it makes the game more interesting than a prototypical "Shoot 'em in the back" maze shooter. From the little I played, the game seems to have decent amount of content in terms of maps, weapons and cosmetic unlockables. Unfortunately, there are only four game types, and at the time of writing, players only play Team Deathmatch. This means there is a lack of players (since I often ran in the the same groups of people) and may potentially mean that there are issues with the other game types. It's a shame really, because except for the fact that more experienced players have access to some better gear (like every other modern multiplayer shooter), I didn't see any gameplay balance issues. I think it's purely due to the multitude of multiplayer alternatives, and that the most popular shooters are the "modern realistic" theme. While finding a game isn't too difficult, the lack of overall players makes this a hard suggestion since it's a multiplayer only title with a pretty small player base.\n\nIt is free however, so it definitely won't hurt to check it out if you're interested in the premise, and a handful of players are high ranked, so you may find enjoyment in this for the long run if you don't mind that you will only be playing TDM or you're able to muster up some group of people to play. I can't suggest you spend money on this as it may "die off" sometime unless you fall in love with the game.\n\nI see myself playing this more, but I can't say if that's one more launch or one more year.","January 7, 2014","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

People praised it for its creativity, but gave it bad scores, because the game was plagued with bugs and connection issues. Basically the game is a fast-pased, arcady shooter similar to a mix between Team Fortress 2 and Call of Duty, with its in-depth gear customization. There are plenty of weapons to choose from, fully customizable with skins and mods, different abilities and gadgets. You can also fully customize your character with different clothes, masks and body types, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. And this is probably the only game where 99% of the stuff can be unlocked FOR FREE... apart from some clothing DLC!\n\nHowever, Gotham City Impostors, even today, is still plagued by connection issues and over-all bad optimization! I don't remember having these issues before, but playing it again now, I get disconnected every second game I get into. And with the years the player base has really dropped. You can still have a good TD match, but forget the other game modes. Also the developers haven't been active for years, the last DLC dates back to 2012!\n\nIn the end I think that everyone should try this game at least once! This is a gem of a F2P game, and trust me, they don't make 'em like this anymore. Try it for yourself, bring awareness to its existance, it doesn't deserve to be left out to die, and it surely shouldn't over a few connection issues.","May 30","true","22.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The weapons are balanced, and it's impossible to pay2win. The game realy gets you hyped. But that's just the good part. Oh, game, ye're so great, yet so imperfect. The lag. The game can run very well, or doesn't work at all. There's a 50-50 chance that you won't be able to play. The matchmaking. Also, it gets you into a match instantly, or won't work at all.

It does have a lot of problems though. Mostly with balancing. Teams are automatically picked and it often puts strongest players together on the same team, giving the team an advantage. You can't make your own rooms and you can't pick which team you play on. You also can't pick the map to play on, you can vote to skip a map but no one else votes so it's pointless. More often than not, joining a game can take a while because it can't find a room for a long time. Weapons are not balanced at all. There are some weapons that are horribly overpowered and make the game really cheap... lookin' a'chu, Witchdoctor... but even with that, it's still a good game and I recommend it at least to try once.","January 25, 2014","true","71.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You level up in this game extremely quickly (I had the set of weapons I use the most within the first hour of gameplay)and it's to it's benefit. You spend most of your unlocks on character customization. This is the main appeal of Gotham City Imposters and what distinguishes it from other contemporary titles.\n\nOtherwise it is just Call of Duty with a stylistic flair to it. Wether that appeals to you or not.\n\nThe only downside that drags this title down is how sluggish the matchmaking system is. Regularly I have to wait several minutes to join a match (Just to join) and several more for the game to decide what server to host it on. I feel this game could have greatly benefited from Dedicated Servers as a result.","September 23, 2012","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphics are as good as it gets. I'm curious about one thing though, the first time I played, or rather, first match, I saw a level 1000. I'm not sure if that's a level cheat or a player that has played for a crap ton of time. Anyway , the humor of the game is the best feature. Other than that, I'd give it a .. uh... 3/5. If you really want to play a game that has good graphics and has to do with playing as joker's side or batman's side, I suggest getting Batman Arkham Origins and play that online.","April 3, 2014","true","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's good, really.\n- There are fun and somewhat balanced weapons [like i said, SOMEWHAT].\n- There are some very friendly users, who are willing to help with your doubts, at the forum, just be polite and reasonable, google your question before asking.\n- Not quite life-sucking addictive. You can still have a boyfriend\girlfriend and go on a date on weekends and such.\n- Not "next-gen" graphics, but, it's pretty good since it's free.\n- Light game. My rig isn't great and yet i can MAX it. [Phenom 1090T, 8GB RAM@1666mhz, GTX 650TI]\n\nCons:\n- Kinda abandoned, you can get some bunch of players, but, i think the devs abandoned the game [WarnerBros] -- For people who are unable to find matches or "rooms", there's a trick listed at the guide-section named: "For people who are unable to find matches" lol.\n- SOMETIMES it's laggy. They lack dedicated servers, the host goes to anyplayer who is in the queue for the match.  If his connection sucks, so the latency of "his" Room.  There's a guide here named: "Starting off Strong", which has a sort of black list for some laggy-hosts, i highly recommend it, so you can quit before rage-quit.\n- I've seen lots of bad players recently, they are probably growing in numbers, cyberbully-like people, cursing, threatening and such. I do not want to be racist or anything but just for statement, the biggest share of them, are Brazilians. But like i said, the majority of guys are nice people, even amongst Brazilians.\n\nThat's all folks. Thanks for the time reading and, voila, see you in game. :)\n\nP.S.\nI highly apologize for any misspelling\mistake, english isn't my main language, but, i rather use it since this is a international community.","December 19, 2014","true","34.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You must then hold it for time to give your team points.\n\nFumigate - a mode where you fight over 3 different Gasblasters on the map which you must capture by staying close to them for a short duration.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantomtissue/recommended/206210/","phantomtissue","PhantomTissue™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantomtissue/","176 products in account","Its a fun game and all, but the player base is way too small. There are 4 Gamemodes, Deathmatch, Fumigation, Psych Warfare, and Bounty Hunter. Fumigation is simply a form of multi-king-of-the-hill, with 3 points to caputure and hold. Psych Warfare is a similar game mode to 1 flag CTF, the only difference being that once the flag, or in this case, battery, is captured, you have to wait some time before the point counts. Within that time, the oposing team is able to steal it, and try  to get it to their base. When the time is up, the team that failed is disarmed, and has to survive for some time, but can still slap the opposing team. After some more time, the team is rearmed, and the battery resets.\n\nUnfourtantly, as it appears to me, the only active game mode is death match, and even then, its hard to get into a game. I have sat in the other game mode lobbies for hours, and not had a single person join. So, If, youre gonna download this game, expect to only play DeathMatch. Unfourtantly, sometimes even that is nearly empty, and youre lucky to get someone to join.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, this game is extremely fun. the gameplay is well balenced, with a plethora of loadout customization options. That, and you get to be low budget Batman.","March 6, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's good, really.\n- There are fun and somewhat balanced weapons [like i said, SOMEWHAT].\n- There are some very friendly users, who are willing to help with your doubts, at the forum, just be polite and reasonable, google your question before asking.\n- Not quite life-sucking addictive. You can still have a boyfriend\girlfriend and go on a date on weekends and such.\n- Not "next-gen" graphics, but, it's pretty good since it's free.\n- Light game. My rig isn't great and yet i can MAX it. [Phenom 1090T, 8GB RAM@1666mhz, GTX 650TI]\n\nCons:\n- Kinda abandoned, you can get some bunch of players, but, i think the devs abandoned the game [WarnerBros] -- For people who are unable to find matches or "rooms", there's a trick listed at the guide-section named: "For people who are unable to find matches" lol.\n- SOMETIMES it's laggy. They lack dedicated servers, the host goes to anyplayer who is in the queue for the match.  If his connection sucks, so the latency of "his" Room.  There's a guide here named: "Starting off Strong", which has a sort of black list for some laggy-hosts, i highly recommend it, so you can quit before rage-quit.\n- I've seen lots of bad players recently, they are probably growing in numbers, cyberbully-like people, cursing, threatening and such. I do not want to be racist or anything but just for statement, the biggest share of them, are Brazilians. But like i said, the majority of guys are nice people, even amongst Brazilians.\n\nThat's all folks. Thanks for the time reading and, voila, see you in game. :)\n\nP.S.\nI highly apologize for any misspelling\mistake, english isn't my main language, but, i rather use it since this is a international community.","December 19, 2014","true","34.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You must then hold it for time to give your team points.\n\nFumigate - a mode where you fight over 3 different Gasblasters on the map which you must capture by staying close to them for a short duration. The team that controls the most of these Gasblasters at any time will gain points, while the other one will lose theirs. The team that gets to 100 first wins.","November 1, 2012","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't know what to expect going into the game as far as the batman vs jokers thing but there are a lot of customization options for both sides which makes each player look individual and have their own personality. The voice selection and pitch selection of your voice further builds on your characters personality. Overall this game has good customization options even though it is free to play, it is addictive!, Lot's of interesting gadgets/support items, good variation of weapon types. Of course there are things that need to be improved but it seems that this game has almost been forgotten about by its creators so I wouldn't expect many changes any time soon.","November 16, 2014","true","32.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I believe I probably stopped in 2013, because I got into Dota around then. I have subsequently gone back to it several times, although I don't remember when the most recent was, and the servers were dead (awful latency when no one else was using my relatively good internet) and it took 10 minutes to find enough people to start a game. I don't know what the playerbase or servers are like now, it just popped up because of the Batman vs Superman sale, so I thought I would give it the thumbs up that the devs deserve. It was a fantastic game, and unless they have gone the way of star wars galaxies, and given everyone a lightsabre at the click of a button, it should still be brilliant.","March 23","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't know what to expect going into the game as far as the batman vs jokers thing but there are a lot of customization options for both sides which makes each player look individual and have their own personality. The voice selection and pitch selection of your voice further builds on your characters personality. Overall this game has good customization options even though it is free to play, it is addictive!, Lot's of interesting gadgets/support items, good variation of weapon types. Of course there are things that need to be improved but it seems that this game has almost been forgotten about by its creators so I wouldn't expect many changes any time soon.","November 16, 2014","true","32.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I believe I probably stopped in 2013, because I got into Dota around then. I have subsequently gone back to it several times, although I don't remember when the most recent was, and the servers were dead (awful latency when no one else was using my relatively good internet) and it took 10 minutes to find enough people to start a game. I don't know what the playerbase or servers are like now, it just popped up because of the Batman vs Superman sale, so I thought I would give it the thumbs up that the devs deserve.

Like most games if im playing solo I just listen to music and enjoy playing and with this game that is one of the most perfect things to do. You can relax and enjoy the comedy in the game and also recking people if you have the skill. Because tbh this game requires a little bit of skill, it isnt just spray and pray like in games such as CSGO. Basically what im trying to say its a fun game which doesnt make you rage (Well maybe sometimes) and you can just have enjoyable hours on it. Rate it 8/10 and suggest you get it.","May 25","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Was a great game while it lasted. Not a lot of people on PC nowadays, couldn't get past the slow matchmaking. Maybe there will be a re-release or a spiritual sequel someday. Give the game a go though. Think I spent more time on this on console than I did on anything else because of how fun and fresh it was at the time.

The tutorial is awful, just JOKING, the tutorial is great and the beginning cutscene is funny. The maps are diverse and well laid out so that they are not to cramped.\n\nI seriously wish there were some more customization instead of three male bodies on female, the spring shoe shoes could use an overhaul and the rocket launcher could use a serious nerf.\n\nThere is some bad to this game, The latency issues come to mind (When are they going to fix that), and the empty lobbies. However I did find a guide on empty lobbies and how to fix them so you don't sit through empty lobbies. (Note this is only on deathmatch that I experiance "full" lobbies. There is another way to fix empty lobbies and that IS YOU DOWNLOADING THE GAME. Seriously give this game a shot.","May 29","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't take itself too seriously. Free to Play. Still pretty strong in terms of numbers. Premise is that Batman has left Gotham to groups of mad vigliantes out to rid the city of crime (Batz) dressed up in clothes like him, and criminals the (jokerz) are out to rid havoc.\n\nPros: Good Selection of Weapons/Classes ranging from your typical shotguns, rifles, snipers to more elaborate ones like Bear Traps, Mr Freeze's Freeze Ray and even a Parrot Launcher. Pretty Well Balanced for Beginners.  Customisation is pretty good. lots of profile options, calling cards etc.   Gadgets are a nice alternative. Gliding, Springed shoes, roller blades, and jetpacks offer different ways of moving around maps.\n\nCons: Limited number of maps (only 6). Tendency to glitch/lag an awful lot and being kicked for no apparent reason. Only 6 people per game.  Some of the DLC stuff is pretty over-priced.\n\nLeveling is a mixed bag. Achievements can be reached by mixing around different weapons, set ups. Gun gameplays reacts fast enough, easy to pick up with exp of the genre. Only problem is it can take ages to build up a few decent custom load-outs, if you want a varied playstyle.\n\nTeam Deathmatch is the best mode, the rest are just variations of capture the flag etc. TM is the only one still really busy.","December 31, 2013","true","119.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

THESE are the heroes Gotham City deserves.\n\n\nThis is a bizarre game. There are two teams. One that pays homage to Batman, and another to the Joker. There are all sorts of gadgets that look like they were made in someones garage... and then they add firearms. It's completely absurd in all the best ways.\n\nAs you gain levels you get tokens you can use to unlock gear, and there are rotating builds everyone can pick from if you want to try out different equipment before buying it. Levels don't straight up add stats or anything, just you have more choices.\n\nI personally enjoy strapping on roller skates launching parrots into peoples faces while dropping gift wrapped explosives. Which you can do as a Batman imposter as well by the way. Same equipment. Just different costumes.\n\nCan be fun, but also frustrating as it takes awhile to master.

It's manic, to say the least.\n\nThe strongest asset of this title is its humor. There are several voices you can choose for your Bat and your Joker, and most of the things they say are absurd enough to elicit some chuckles. The visuals help, giving Gotham an appropriately comic look, with many jokes spread all over the environment. Of course, you'll likely be running and gunning too much to notice, but there are some very clever visual gags in the Amusement Mile and Crime Alley maps, including some great easter eggs for true Batman/DC fans.\n\nThe level of customization is impressive. The more you play, the more weapons, support items, costumes, skins, voices, and body types you'll unlock, with others available for purchase as part of specially themed sets. GCI is a free to play game, so there's no need to buy anything, but it's hard to pass up being a Pirate-themed Batman, am I right?\n\nOn the downside, the game being free to play means no server support from the studio, which can result in being kicked out of a match if the host quits or their computer has trouble running the scenario. There are also occasional graphical glitches that can disrupt the flow of a game. Renewed interest from the developer and an update or two would be great. Most of the time though, the challenge is just finding enough people playing to put a match together. The community is small, and certain modes such as Fumigation are never able to be played because the only people logged in will be doing Team Deathmatch and nothing else (compare this situation to Team Fortress 2, where you can always find a game in any mode, any time of day).\n\nIn the end though, Gotham City Impostors is a lighthearted, simple, and amusing game that's free to play and offers a few laughs. Can't ask for much more than that.","July 31, 2013","true","54.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's an incredibly fun game, but instead of having dedicated servers they've got a terribly constructed matchmaking system that uses Games For Windows Live, which makes the game barely playable.\nEven if you do manage to find a server, chances are the host of the server will not have a strong enough connection.\n\nWould not recommend. This game could have become something precious but right now it's a shoddy matchmaking simulator.","March 29, 2013","false","26.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

But it seriously gets 2 easy when you make a good loadout suiting you and play more than 10 hours of it. I seriously got 30-2 in a random game 7 hours into the game :B1: . Very TF2-esk and pretty nice weapons and character builds. Only problem I have with it is it's servers are too weak and if more than 3 people join with bad ping the server crashes. But I haven't played in a while I'm thinking they fixed it probably. Also it isn't P2W that much you can get really good with the game without spending a dime on it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ppnhzk/recommended/206210/","ppnhzk","ragequitmaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ppnhzk/","1364 products in account","GC Impostors is a multiplayer shooter developed by Monolith and became free-to-play after a year.\n\nPros:\nThere are not many levels, but those are well-designed, which is also true when it comes to the characters and weapons. Overally interesting and unique ideas in gameplay. Different gadgets and addons let you play in your own style. Good character progression with plenty to unlock and purchase, even on the 500th level. Visual customization options are nice, you can have your very own look on both sides. Challenges, achievements and feats are expanding the content range. Good humour and theme. I got a lot of packs after my purchase of the original.\n\nCons:\nTerrible lag, performance, server, and other issues making almost impossible to play the game. I cannot play the game even on the lowest settings. Worst game of all time optimization wise. Matchmaking is the same as before, so you might get onto a server where 80% of the players have bad ping. Also, there are server connection losses and other stuff to entertain you if you bored. Only a few game modes and a handful of maps. Some overpowered weapons and gear. With packs purchased through steam better equipment can be obtained early. Content which can only be unlocked via purchase. No actual expansions, maps, weapons, anything added for years. Not many players nowadays.\n\nOverall, after more than 2 years of my purchase I still cannot play the game smoothly. The performance only slightly improved. It is a shame that good ideas were ruined by incompetent optimization.\n\nMy Opinion:\nOVERALL: 6/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nGameplay: 9/10 (core gp without lag and perf issues)\nSound: 8/10\nContent: 7/10\nPlayerbase: 6/10\nPort: 3/10","October 29, 2014","false","7.5"," 27 of 54 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","27","54","5","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ppnhzk/recommended/206210/","ppnhzk","ragequitmaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ppnhzk/","1364 products in account","GC Impostors is a multiplayer shooter developed by Monolith and became free-to-play after a year.\n\nPros:\nThere are not many levels, but those are well-designed, which is also true when it comes to the characters and weapons. Overally interesting and unique ideas in gameplay. Different gadgets and addons let you play in your own style. Good character progression with plenty to unlock and purchase, even on the 500th level. Visual customization options are nice, you can have your very own look on both sides. Challenges, achievements and feats are expanding the content range. Good humour and theme. I got a lot of packs after my purchase of the original.\n\nCons:\nTerrible lag, performance, server, and other issues making almost impossible to play the game. I cannot play the game even on the lowest settings. Worst game of all time optimization wise. Matchmaking is the same as before, so you might get onto a server where 80% of the players have bad ping. Also, there are server connection losses and other stuff to entertain you if you bored. Only a few game modes and a handful of maps. Some overpowered weapons and gear. With packs purchased through steam better equipment can be obtained early. Content which can only be unlocked via purchase. No actual expansions, maps, weapons, anything added for years. Not many players nowadays.\n\nOverall, after more than 2 years of my purchase I still cannot play the game smoothly. The performance only slightly improved. It is a shame that good ideas were ruined by incompetent optimization.\n\nMy Opinion:\nOVERALL: 6/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nGameplay: 9/10 (core gp without lag and perf issues)\nSound: 8/10\nContent: 7/10\nPlayerbase: 6/10\nPort: 3/10","October 29, 2014","false","7.5"," 27 of 54 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","27","54","5","11"

Now I don't want to go in-depth with this review though since I don't want a long review so here's a simple pros/cons (Don't let my profile/username fool you, I tried this out way before I got into Batman/Joker)\nPros:\n-Very enjoyable\n-Lots of customization\n-Lots of different weapons/gadgets to mess around with\n-Moderately active community\n-Not pay to win (P2W)\n-Well-designed maps\n-Like TF2 and Arkham Origins Online had a baby, but it only inherited the Batman theme from Arkham Origins\n-Friendly community\n-Not very rage-inducing\n\nCons:\n-Few maps\n-Although not P2W, has a P2W model where you pay for weapons to unlock early on\n-Not all items can be bought with in-game currency\n-Older, more experienced players have an advantage over new players\n-Sniper rifles are OP and you have a slim chance to win in a fight against a speedy or bulky character with one\n-Jokerz seem to win more than the Bats (and I ironically end up on Bats, considering my name)\n-Prizes usually spawn in an area dominated by a certain team\n\nOverall score: 7/10\nI'd recommend this for any Batman fan who also likes TF2 or FPS games","March 11, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/icagel/recommended/206210/","icagel","Sôkar Was","http://steamcommunity.com/id/icagel/","152 products in account","Will try to make this short\n\nThe game:\nGCI is a team-based shooter just like others you've seen, It features a decent amount of game modes and customization (clothes, weapons, profile, etc.) and works on the basis that on particular levels you can unlock something.\nIt's kind-of like TF2 but with no set classes, and Batman V Joker based (don't play this if you hate either, as you'll be forced to play as them half of the time).\nTutorial teaches you some of basics, but proves insuficient once you start the real thing (it's mostly "stand and do this).\n\n\nPros:\n+ Fun, fast paced, game\n+ Good Customization Options\n+ Stupid enough to make you smile\n+ Decent amount of game modes (around 5)\n+ Doesn't seem Pay2Win, but you really have to know what you're doing with your first unlocks (or save them).\n+ Good balance of weapons, however as I mentioned you will need to level if you want access to any non-starting weapon.\n+ Cool movies, but weird ones, what did you expect?\n\nCons:\n- Only one game mode is playable (Team Deathmatch), seriously, I queued every other game mode 3-5 times with no success.\n- Matchmaking doesn't exist, first online game (level 1), level 120 or so on the other, not even kidding (there's no stat boost or anything, but he has access to a lot of equipment and has a lot of exp that a new player just doesn't). My side had a level 90, rest of us were 1-8.\n- Both things might be because of this, but not many people play this. (Dead game).\n- You can only play as Batman or Joker. No Robin, No Catwoman, No Riddler (I'd love to play as Riddler, so it was a huge letdown) or any character you'd like to play as.\n- Only 6 maps. Yup, that's right, 6. Each of the game modes can be played on any map as far as I know though.\n- You can't change video options in-game, so you won't know if the configuration you picked runs smoothly until it's too late.\n\nThe opinion:\nAs a light game or mod, this could be great, however as a full-blown game, with barely enough players that only allow for the simplest game mode, not worth the disk space.\nDon't get me wrong, it's fun, will keep you really entertained for a while, but you'll get bored sooner than later.\n\nThe rest:\nIf you want something stupid, go find another fun multiplayer game.\nIf you want something FPS team-based, go find another game.\nThis game has a correct balance between both, but doesn't excell in any for it to be truly destacable.\nNothing sticks out really, it's just a mixture of everything we've seen in MMOFPS., nothing original (apart from the funny disguises).\n\n\nRecommendations:\n* More promotion, no players kills this game instantly.\n* More maps.\n* More disguisable characters, only 2 makes it boring. (Just change the name to order v chaos or something).\n* Joker small part of the tutorial (maybe in-field to help you get the hang of it?)\n* Altough it has a great start, still needs a little "unique" thing for it to be a game on its own and not just "the same game, but stupid and with batman"\n* Maybe in-game option change? That only screws you the first couple times you play, but could potentially screw you up a lot...\n* Rest is really good.","October 18, 2015","false","1.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The setting is great, it just screams personality and style. With many kinds of methods for getting around and many kinds of weapons it really offers  varied gameplay. However, it lags terribly most if not all the time and it has terrible performance. It runs worse on my PC than Battlefield 4. And also small things that annoy me endlessly like how aiming down the sight works when it's on toggle and that you can't stop sprinting by pressing the sprint button again.\n\ntl;dr: If it didn't have optimalization problems and annoying controls and didn't lag all the time.

First off, I will say that I did not in any way enjoy the style of the menus and the UI. But of course the menu doesn't make the game. Upon starting into the tutorial I found immediatley that this was annoyingly detatched from the Batman and DC universe and tried to be funny. It just wasn't... oh god it was horribly un-funny. The actual gameplay was decent but there really aren't many people playing this game and I became bored very quickly. It's probably worth a little try, especially as it is free to play and it isn't a pay to win experience so you should definitley try it but its not quite for me.\n\nPositive\n+ Decent Graphics\n+ Decent Gameplay\n+ Not p2w\n\nNegative\n- Un-funny\n- Detached from universe\n- Lack of players\n\nConclusionNot particularly fun but a decent experience. Worth a little try if you have a spare hour or so but not that fun for me.","February 19, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doriftuh/recommended/206210/","Doriftuh","NISM0","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doriftuh/","33 products in account","This game is absolutely terrible. It's a clunky, sticky controlled CoD rip off, which is essentially what WB tried to cash out on. The servers are terrible, and you'll have a terrible time trying to find a match. There are cool aspects about the game but the negatives really put them shame because you'll empty an entire 25 round magazine at point blank, finding that only two rounds hit their mark.\n\nFurthermore, this game is highly biased level wise. What I mean by this is, is that the higher the level, the more you're going to ruin the game for other lower level players. Since there is no segregation (definition: the action or state of setting someone or something apart from other people or things or being set apart, so none of you racial SJWs ♥♥♥♥ over the moon) level wise so the kids with higher levels and amazing gear are going to stump your gameplay and you'll be stumbling to try and level so you can actually play instead of enjoying the game.\n\nThe servers or hosts are always ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. Good luck trying to land more than 3 bullets 75% of the time, because it isn't happening. You will fail to connect to a majority of the lobbies this game has to offer. And there are also a lot of kids on this game that can apparently "ddos" you and "disconnect" lobbies (trying to use the own games fault to lie about their IT knowledge. Great.)\n\nAll in all, download for a laugh. This game is a gigantic, worthless joke.

The graphics are great and very colorful. There is alot to customize and make your own in this game. There are 1000 ranks in this game, which is cool if your a die hard Call of Duty player and want to prestige 10 times to reach the max rank. The gun customization is awesome and alot of fun to try different things. The developers are constantly improving this game to make it a great experience for the players. Be careful when picking which DLC to buy for this game because most of them don't give you an advantage at all while playing except for the XP boosts.

It is a customizable-class based shooter with tons of unlockable weapons and apparel. It was pretty fun to play, though. I would put it at 6/10. It is not original or ground breaking by any means. It really adds nothing to the FPS genre, which is already super-saturated and filled with mostly garbage. The only thing special about this is BATMAN. Otherwise, it is completely run-of-the-mill.
