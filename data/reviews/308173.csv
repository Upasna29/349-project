I've played around 10 hours of the early access version, and I really enjoyed it. For those of you unfamiliar with the Hegemony series, supply plays a huge role in these games. Units and cities all need to be properly supplied in order to function, so raiding an enemy or being raided yourself can be a huge factor in the success or failure of your empire. You start small, and gradually complete objectives and start to expand. There is a bit of diplomacy, but nothing earth shattering in that department. Units have formations, can be flanked, upgraded with new skills and led by generals, further increasing their traits. Cities also can be upgraded, as well as resource producing landmarks, increasing their output or defense from raids.\n\nThe map is huge and can be zoomed out to get a "tabletop view of the battlefield". The graphics have been greatly improved upon, with markets having chickens running around, fish swimming the seas, birds flying overhead, people in the cities and birds of prey circling battlefields for fresh corpses. Really enjoyed just checking out the scenery. Also, when you upgrade a cities walls, you see the city grow on the map, which is pretty cool.\n\nThe #1 factor in a good strategy game is a competitive AI, and I found the AI in this game to be pretty good. Enemy units would try to flank me, and some of the scripted raids were really challenging to overcome. A big improvement from previous games.\n\nFinally, the potential of this game is huge. With Workshop enabled at launch who knows what some talented modder could come up with. Maybe a DLC of the Punic Wars, with Hannibal and his elephants crossing the alps. Really hoping this game does well and we see some good mods. Anyway, give it a try, you won't be dissapointed.\n\n\n\n\n","August 25, 2015","true","19.5"," 168 of 187 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","168","187","6","0"

For the player this means you will eventually have an interesting variety of units. For the AI this means someday they may get hoplites if they form a large enough (Huge) empire.\n\n-Rebels are the strongest faction you will face in the whole game which is really dumb. The AI does not seem to know when or what cities they should be building the upgrades that let you produce better units, whereas rebels seem to scale with time or with your civilization so they will put up a much better fight than the other factions will\n\n-The AI has no idea how to manage lots of cities. They almost only build warehouses in cities and they rarely colonize the cities, so that city with stone walls will probably only last for a few minutes vs 3 spearmen and 2 javelins. The AI will stupidly walk out of every city to engage you, instead of picking you off from inside.\n\n-This is all a major problem because the larger you get the easier everything gets, by a huge margin.\n\n-The missions are far from "dynamic." Random would be a better word. I get missions to hand cities or pay tribute to factions that no longer exist, I currently have 2 missions that have the exact same objective (to burn farms) for a faction that no longer exists. H1 had interesting missions that brought good rewards, I mostly ignore these missions because the reward is either literally nothing (great reward there) or like 100 gold. 100 gold is a pitiful amount by the time you have all of your faction under control, which is when you would get these missions. You also have a persistent mission to get a higher population for the fantastic bonus of nothing. What is the point of the population objective? Can someone please tell me in the comments. Obviously I am going to increase my population it is the most important aspect of city management I don't need a pointless objective telling me to do so.\n\n(To compare) In H1 you were surrounded by weaker factions and as you expanded the factions got harder and each faction also had different builds of armies. In H1 in the far north you have the nomads with huge horse armies that will decimate your javelins/archers if you are not careful, in the far south you have the Greeks and the terrifying Spartans that require huge amounts of archers to deal with and careful logistical planning, in the far east you have the Persians and there assortment of amazing units of all types to test your army with after you beat the game.\n\nIn H3 you have some slow moving easy to destroy hoplites if you are lucky and a faction conquered a territory with a lot of gold mines. Hoplites are a particularly garbage unit because unlike in Greece, Italy does not have mountains everywhere. It becomes particularly easy to circle around the hoplites and get 20+ slaves by flanking them. The battle AI has not improved since H1 or H2 because it is very easy to lure hoplites out of formation and take them out one at a time.\n\nI can recommend this game after the bugs are fixed despite all the flaws with battle mechanics and the AI. I really hope that a Gold release comes out for this game that fixes many of these issues.\n\n\n\nAddendum - Really sad that this review is sandwiched between 3 positive reviews only one of which has more playtime in the game than I do.","August 29, 2015","false","19.5"," 149 of 183 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","149","183","6","9"

Earlier I was into RTS more, first strategy game was Star Trek: Armada (and damn proud of it). Loved Celtic Kings, Rise of Nations, Age of Empires, and the like. Didn't get into star craft or command&comquor. Also really enjoyed the first Wargame pc game, Airland was okay, havent played china rising.\n\n\n\n>> You should buy this game if:\n\n- You are a fan of historical strategy games (duh) - specifically, you love the challenges that come with large scale strategy games.\n\n- You like the option of meticulously planning each move in turn-based games, yet find real-time to be a refreshing and different sort of challenge.\n\n>  For example, your a big fan of Total war, or perhaps even Endless Legend.\n\n\n\n\n>>  What I don't like about this game:\n\n-  There's a few graphical hicups, but it seems that the developers are on top of things with updates etc.\n\n- THE CAMERA:  One of the things that makes this game great is the scale, and how detailed gameplay-wise that scale is. One of the things that big scale entails, usually, is a large map - a big surface area for the tides of history to unfold on.  USUALLY, games with scale allow you to be able to SEE that scale by zooming out.  In Hegemony III, the 'graphical map' can only be viewed from what feels  claustrophobically close to the ground.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the seamless Strategic Map -> Graphical Map feature of this game is very lovable. But I wish.. no, its more than a wish.. it's really a NEED for this game in my opinion to be truely great instead of forgettable as soon as some other major title comes out... This game needs to allow the player to zoom out more - even just ONE or TWO more 'clicks' of the mouse wheel out would be PERFECT.\n\nI don't know anything about software or coding etc, but it seems like this would be a really simple change?\n\nPerhaps Modders can once again be our heroes and saviors. Rome II and Atilla suffered from constrained cameras, and with mods they became foundationally better experiences.\n\n\n### END ###\n_______________\n\nThe above is all of course an opinion - what do you think about some of these things?","October 2, 2015","true","30.1"," 53 of 59 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","53","59","2","0"

I am the leader of a greek city-state located in southern Italy (modern day Calabria), Rhegion, and I have been her most devoted servant for ten years now. As I sit back and relax in the cool shade of the arcades of the temple, listening to philosophers debate the nature of poetry while watching greased, naked men wrestle in the sun and sipping on a fresh pint of olive oil (as a greek, I enjoy doing greek things), I'm taking a moment to contemplate how far we have come.\n\nVictory is soon to be mine now. Rhegion rules over all of Calabria. I have sent my generals north and they have left a trail of crows and blood in their wake. The swift conquests of the first years, when our armies would wash over our foes and capture city after city like waves upon so much sand castles, are over. Our enemies have entrenched themselves in stone citadels and forced us to siege warfare. It's Troy all over again, and again we would prevail. After a year of careful preparations, obsolete troops have been retrained, siege engines and camps have been built, trade routes have been redesigned, and ungodly amounts of food have been stockpiled. An army marches on its belly, and I know now that woe betide the general that lets it go hungry.\n\nOnce everything was in place, I gave orders, and Periphraktes, my best general, began the siege. Bronze-gleaming lines of hoplites surrounded the walls of the citadel, while catapults rained a hail of death upon the defenders. Those were sitting on a big pile of food, but with me blockading all their trade routes, they eventually ran out. They fought with the furious, wild desperation of a trapped beast, but starvation eventually broke them, and the exhausted survivors raised the white flag and opened the door of the city to us, begging for mercy. We slayed the men and the old, enslaved the women and the children, razed the city to the ground, salted their fields and then sued them for peace in exchange for an obscene amount of money. Vae victis.\n\nAlthough not a man of war myself, I have not been idle at all. A learned man, I have spent the first part of my reign researching new technologies to give Rhegion an edge, and governing the capital city. The early years were a time of tireless campaigning which poured a lot of the kingdom's blood into War's gaping maw. Troops wavered and deserted. Cities experienced harsh winters and shortages of supplies, and as a consequence rebellions broke out, which I had to crush mercilessly for our new possessions to remain ours. We were victorious, but exhausted. We needed peace. The second part of my reign had begun.\n\nI set out across the kingdom, wandering from city to city, drawing new trade routes where old ones had become redundant, building bridges, fortifying the frontiers, and undertaking renovation projects on a large scale. The old days of constant war where a city was but barracks and a wall were long over. Slowly but steadily, the people we conquered had adopted the greek culture. The foes of old had become trusted friends, and garrisonning troops everywhere to prevent unrest was no longer necessary. Soldiers returned to civilian life as the barracks and stables of the early years were destroyed. In their stead, I built forums, markets, ports, sewers, warehouses, libraries, monuments. Rhegion soon achieved cultural hegemony : our cities are now a sight to behold, places of culture and learning, sprawling, bustling, glittering with gold ; twenty shiny gems dotting Italy's foot.\n\nMaritime hegemony was ours too. We had become rich and prosperous enough that buying more ships than the rest of our concurrents combined was but a trifle. And then, at long last, after years of peace and prosperity, economic hegemony came too. Our fields grow tall, our mines run deep, our vineyards are heavy with grapes rife with trapped sunlight. We are the envy of the world. Truly, Rhegion had blossomed into the most resplendent flower on this land of dust and gold and glory.\n\nNothing could stop us. Victory is mine. As a messenger brought news to me that I had unlocked a new Steam achievement, "Magna Magna Graecia", I finished my pint and gazed upon the sea with a satisfied heart. Victory has a sweet, sweet taste of olive oil.","April 19","true","50.4"," 46 of 56 people (82%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","82","46","56","41","3"

I do declare that this game is harder to play than Hegemony Rome.\n\nEDIT: So once you get a few hours under your belt, the game becomes pretty easy and you can steamroll across the map.  Which isn't a bad thing - that's how most RTS games work if you're good at it.  Many people are saying this game is very hard and there is no info on how to play. Well that is BS. There is a comprehensive in-game manual and when I was new to Hegemony Rome, it took but a few hours to get a hang of it. I don't know why people expect to be pros at a game right from the start.  End rant.\n\n\nQuick list of pros/cons:\n\nPROS:\n+Huge a** map. Like dayum.\n+Awesome attention to detail even on lowish settings.\n+Good faction diversity and unit diversity\n+Ability to assimilate populaces into your own. (In Heg Rome you could only recruit Roman Legionnaires in Roman cities.  This makes the long game a bit of a challenge if you're going for a master race. It's possible in this game! Yay!)\n+Tech Tree which is very extensive and will buff your economy and military in the long haul.\n+AI is much better. I figured I'd try a normal game at first (instead of Casual) and had to abandon for the easier setting until I get the hang of the game.  Currently playing an Expert game and its going well/smooth and the AI still attacks me fairly often and en force.  EDIT: Raiders have been tended to in the first patch, post-release. Seems okay.\n+Farms, Vineyards, Mines etc, can all be individually upgraded for more resource output - new feature.\n+City stances - Economic, Defensive, etc. Neat!\n+Starting General can be customized to give either city or combat bonuses.\n+Slave market\n\nCONS:\n-A bit slow performance-wise. Could just be the huge a** map kicking my PC's butt. I exceed the requirements by a little.  Mouse movement is a bit clunky at times forcing me to pause and give orders; I don't like pausing to give orders as I feel that is cheating.\n-Brigade size cannot be increased via officers like how you could in Heg Rome; at least the tooltips don't say they can. That's not cool. I liked massive brigades of soldiers.\n-I wish Sandbox's settings could be customized a smidge more: like turn off objectives or turn off sea raiders.  Maybe there will be future options via updates (barring the use of the map editor).\n\n(Raiders removed as a con - I see no issue with them thanks to the first patch)\n\nSo far, 9/10.\n\n(I gave Heg: Rome an 8.5/10)\n[Will update review if necessary]","August 25, 2015","true","36.0"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","37","43","2","4"

It has a lot of historical flavor elements that come into play, but you can pick your favorite obscure Italic tribe and try to see if you can do better than the Romans.\n\nThe game is semi-historical because it telescopes several hundred years of development into a few game years.  This is a good thing: if you've read Livy, you wouldn't want to fight the same war for one village year after year over and over again until you finally win.  And if you've read Livy you also know that armies weren't mobilized and kept in the field according to Hegemony mechanics.  You raised everything at the start of the year after you had finished planting your troops, and you didn't raise anything else unless there was a real emergency.  Emergency troops would usually stand down after the crisis was over, and in any case everybody would go home before the fall harvest season.  Nothing ever happened in late fall, winter, or before late spring.\n\nJust to be clear, Hegemony III takes place long before the First Punic War, so you won't be invading Sicily or encountering Carthaginians.  But if you've read Livy, the game is the perfect vehicle for refighting your own version of the Samnite Wars.\n\nThe only other game out there that makes a serious attempt (a very serious attempt) at presenting the Samnite Wars is Ageod's Birth of Rome expansion for Alea Jacta Est.\n\n\nI like the ceramic art-inspired graphics, but people who aren't familiar with the conventions of ancient vase painting may find it takes a little getting used to at first.\n\nI've been playing the game during the first week of release, so entirely without benefit of post-launch patches.  While I'm sure that there's a thing or two that will get tinkered with down the road, I haven't encountered any game-stopping major bugs.  I say that in the context of playing a couple of games (which will remain nameless) a year or two after release that are still riddled with bugs.  The core system was hammered out in the first two games, so all that is probably going to be needed here is some fine tuning.","August 27, 2015","true","43.1"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","30","35","0","1"

Lots of different factions to choose from and an amazing Map Editor. What's even better? You get upgrades, 3 different research trees and the battles are larger and more diverse than ever before. The challenging AI is also back and don't worry, even the casual AI will have you securing your borders or facing constant raids from all sides.\nHowever, the game needs a decent amount of polish before it is completely done. For example, there are quite a few textures that seem messed up, from the regular citizens in your cities to the generals of your armies. Also, the animations seem particularly disjointed in this iteration of Hegemony. I also notice that skirmishers charge while in formation whereas in previous games they would just lob spears/rocks/etc from a distance while allow other units in the formation to engage. This can prove incredibly frustrating as your units will suicide charge melee infantry if not ordered on an individual basis.\nIf these basic issues can be ironed out, I believe this might be the best Hegemony game of them all!

The graphics are nice although a sluggish at times. Game-play is OK but having attacking tribes constantly harrassing you as you are trying to gather supplies can be become bothersome.\n\nAlso, it seems that you are to be able to do battle against attackers in two or three or more (?) locations all at the same time. The only way to be effective and move your troops around is to pause the game, move to the other location to arrange your troops and so on. Then, when you un-pause the game, you can only view one battle while the other(s) are also taking place. This makes you play for a few seconds, pause the game again, move the camera to another battle to see how it is progressing and bounce around the map.\n\nI understand that this may be how things actually would happen in the real world but for the sake of game-play, the USER needs some downtime to grow, gather and assess his world and plans.\n\nPatience is required while playing. The best advise that I can give to a new player is go slow! Don't try and go to far to fast. Build yourself up with supplies, knowledge, upgrades to buildings and your military. Make sure that you add a general to one of you military units and give units upgrades after battles if they can receive them.\n\nUpgrades to your cities generates income. Operating a mine or winery generates income. You NEED to have food and lumber and these cost money to operate. Pause the map and look around.

You make all the key decisions as your little fiefdom sprawls out from your starting city.\n\nThe AI puts up a very competitive fight--especially in the beginning when you have few units and are struggling against bankruptcy. The AI factions often raid cities that you just sieged so you will need to maintain Quick Reactionary Forces at intervals, even well  within your front lines.\n\nUnits themselves gain XP and allow you to pick from an RPG-like ability tree, so you can customize each type of unit in your army. When a unit is destroyed it doesnt disappear from the game, it is crushed to 0/XX recruits and retreats back to its 'Home' city to be conscripted with new recruits. However, you get to keep all the upgrades you have made to the unit.\n\nI have not had any bugs or crashes -- I started playing after the first patch was released and fortunately it seems to have solved most/all of the issues that other reviewers have mentioned on their Day 1 reviews\n\nFantastic Game, Fantastic Series, Can't wait for more content and development!","August 30, 2015","true","51.9"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

It actually seems like AI is intelligent. It's not cheating or getting non-player bonuses, except that it starts with all native cities, regardless of whether the player does or not.\n-Raiders and enemies alike will mercilessly invade and pillage your lands, so there is a point to building defenses IE fortifying rivercrossing, border towns, camps and coastal ports.\n-There are limitations to resources, so you have to carefully decide how to spend your resources.\n-If you run out of a resource, then the consequences can be harsh. You get punished for overextending yourself or improperly investing what you have.\n-The UI is well thoughout and adds to the immersion of the game.\n-Very active developers. The dev team is currently doing a map-building tutorial series on the Greek peninsula. Once they are finished, they promise to release it as a mod campaign!\n\nCons\n-Only replayability is in starting as a different faction, but the campaign map is very open-worldish, so you can try different strategies the next time your play. It may get repetitive after you have won the campaign the first time. The game needs more scenarios. I don't care if it's DLC or playermade, but the game needs Scandanavian, Russian, Brittania, Iberian, North African, Middle East, Greece, Macedonian (think Alexander), Asia Minor, Mongols (think Gengis Khan), Far East Asia, and Native American scenarios complete with there own style of units, technology and buildings. I want more, haha!\n-Some issues with commanding and pathfinding the troops. Minor, but the game needs tools to adjust the width and length of formations, like in Total War. The player can move the individual units to change the formation, but it gets a little repetitive and tedious.\n-No multiplayer.\n-The game is merciless, so children are advised to stay away. :-)\n\nDefinitely worth the $15 winter sale price.","December 31, 2015","true","67.5"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","18","19","2","0"

Hegemony 3 is a better game than its predecessors in almost everything, better graphics, better battle system, big terrain and truly reflects the ancient time in Italian peninsula.\nStrategy and decision making are very important in this game, and all depends on the simple yet cool diplomacy system the game has, the weather and climate effect on economy and warfare and also the fortifying options on the terrain. The game give you sense of satisfaction and achievement once you beat a faction or expand further, yet at the same time it is not easy to maintain a larger empire.\nThe only con I have with Hegemony 3 is the camera zooming smoothness, it is not as good as the first game, but hope the developers can make it better.\nIf you like the previous games get this one immediately, but if you are new to the series, please download the demo of the first Hegemony game: Hegemony Gold, it has the same concept but with lower graphics and less contents.\n\n","November 1, 2015","true","22.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","17","19","3","0"

Turn based games are more my thing. But I've finally found an RTS I enjoy.\n\n(For summary see end)\n\nWhy I like it:\n1) Battles don't have loads of units and so are much easier to manage. You can't auto calculate combat (which I tend to do in other games) but it's so easy that it's not an issue.\n2) Attrition is what wins wars. Losses suffered by units are replaced from a pool of recruits from the unit's home city. So fight carefully, so ensure enemy loses more troops than you. Once they run out of recruits in the unit's home city, the unit will not be able to replenish losses and will quickly crumble.\n3) The city building aspect is very enjoyable. You have lots of things to choose from but a limited number of slots in which to place buildings (number of slots are based on a city's size).\n4) Diplomacy is simple but works well. It's essentially Peace (where one side pays the other) or War, where you can attack each other.\n5) I enjoy enslaving my enemies' defeated units and sending them to work in my mines. Capturing cities also give you slaves. You can even buy and sell slaves. Slavery is a key aspect to the economy. Who knew slavery was so much fun! (Well, at least for the slaver).\n\nIn short, if you like detailed war games then this isn't for you. But if you like the economic aspect of war, and city building, then I can definitely recommend this game for you.","March 5","true","14.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","12","12","3","0"

To be fair there are still a few things that need to be worked out, but the developers take everything into account, from supply lines, and logistics, to upkeep and maintenance of buildings, and of course feeding your growing army.\n+ A well thought out economic structure forces you to pay attention to the details of maintaing your army and the supply lines that feed your empire.\n+ Raiders and pirates frequently attack making it challenging to protect your resources, and the civilian population.\n- The Diplomacy is a bit enemic, but sufficient.\n+ The AI is smart enough to flank you, and the raiders have powerful units, forcing you to use tactics to defeat them.\n+ The 6 factions, Latin, Sebilic, Greek, Gaul, Etruscan and Illiryan have some similar units, and some unique units, offering diverse game play.\n( I have seen complaints about the units, but it's Italy, not Greece.  Just about everyone had some kind of spear units, and Hopplites were used by everyone, until Rome changed the way wars were fought.   There is a diversity of unit types and play styles.  Gaul has more calvary options, and archers.  Illiryans have srtong Infantry and Mounted Javelins, Greeks start being able to train Hopplites, while other factions need to have a Baracks upgrade first, Etruscan has axe men and so forth.  So enough about there not being a good mix of units)\n- The city building of the AI needs work, and the AI in general could use a bit of a tweek. But lets be honest, it's AI....if you want a real Challenge play another Person...which reminds me\n- No multiplayer...yet\n- Just out of Beta, but there are still numerous minor bugs and crashes.  I am sure there are patches to follow.\nOver all this is definitly worth the experience.  It still has some teathing problems, but it doesn't take away from the fine work and thought that went into this game.  Hegemony has to be one of the most under rated games I have ever seen.  If they could do this on a scale that covers the entire European theater in the time of Rome, that would be epic!\nGreat Game, passs it on!!\n","September 2, 2015","true","114.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

The game has a great amount of depth and i love the immersion of spreading your fledgling colony throughout the ancient world. Proper planning and preparation are key when you expand beyond your city area, you need to keep troops supplied with food, logistics really matter and add a level of tactical gameplay missing form the Total war/civ series. If you push too far into unexplored regions without decent supplies (making sure to protect your supply routes too!), it will usually end rather badly for your expedition forces.\n\nReally love the city building aspect of this game to, well maybe building is the wrong word...perhaps upgrading lol. All building types have numerous upgrades as do all unit types which add further layers of strategy and versatility to building your empire. Raiding is serious business maybe a little to serious as the raids from barbarians and other factions can become a full time job to deal with. Granted i made some major mistakes on my first playthrough by not setting up proper defenses on the exterior areas of my growing territory due to not building proper forts, more specifically proper upgrades to deal with constant raiding parties. If the raiders get through they do serious damage to your farms, mines, and other buildings which you need to maintain income and resources to fuel your further expansion and empire.\n\nThere's also a tactical well fleshed out combat system, quests, and many other things which i just have not played enough of the game yet to really grasp, I might make another review after ive played more of the game.\n\nSo my initial impressions of the Hegemony, if you like strategy games with a decent amount of depth and complexity, dont mind a pretty steep learning curve/proper tutorial, enjoy micromanaging... and a love for all things Classical antiquity, then i think i can safely recommend this game to you!!!\n\n\nP.S.  I also want to mention i think this game has alot of potential to be even better then what ive already seen like adding sicily, carthage and other areas to the map. The modding tools available will give modders alot of options to make even more improvements and new content as well!!!.","August 27, 2015","true","55.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

More factional diversity, we already have Latin, Gallic, Etruscan, Greek and something S like Sabelian or something.

Hegemony III is a nice change of pace from other RTS games I have played in the past, which usually require players to continually produce troops and throw them at the enemies base. This game requires much more planning and thought. Specifically, it takes a long to move troops around the map (this is a good thing). If you leave your boarders vulnerable for too long you will pay. Additionally, troops consume food. Having excess troops can become a burden, so players must manage their armies in both size and position. There is also a dynamic economic system composed of a vast network of trade routes connecting all the cities, camps, and resource buildings together of the empire together. As your empire expands you will capture resource buildings such as mines and farms. Workers must be stationed at any resource building to begin production. Also, that resource buildings must be included in the trade network via trade routes.

The campagin I am playing is the Italian Hegemony, you have a wonderful amount of choice between what faction you want to play from Celts in the north, Etruscans and the Romans in the centre, Illyrians to the east to the Greek colonies in the south.\n\nThis campagin starts with your faction split, as 1's Philip campagin did. In this one you control your capital and the rest of your cities are independant of your rule and your first obective is to bring them back into the fold.\n\nThe non-combat improvements in 2 are here, you can build buildings in cities to give you acess better/different troops, ships, siege equipment, for the city to produce more food, research points etc. However, an improvement over 2 is that each city grows over time if you keep the city supplied with food. Whereas in 2, certain cities would have arbitrary X amount of building slots  and there was no way to increase this, now your cities increase in size as they grow and you unlock more building slots and money generation as you do so, every city starts at level 1 and has no building slots (excluding the slot exlusive for walls).\n\nI have only played as Kroton as of this writing, Kroton is a Greek faction and is very familar to those who played Hedemony 1.\n\nOther then some graphical and minor glitches I have no complaints, and these glitches are so minor I can't be bothered to report them. One major complaint: No Syracuse wtf?\n\ntl:dr I wholeheartedly recomend this game, anyone who liked the first game but was dissapointed by certain aspects of the second game (myself inlcuded) this is the game we wanted when we heard "Hegemony Ceaser"","August 26, 2015","true","20.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

It's got the grand strategy feel of TW, but also the micro of the AoE battles. The AI is smart, and can punish you for overextending and making questionable decisions. The learning curve is there, but after a few games you should get the hang of it. Really enjoyable overall, has a fantastic feel especially with the strategic map.

To put it simple, its fun.\n\nThe downs:\nOn anything higher than casual, the raiders are a little unbalanced - way stronger than the player and the AI nations.\nIts very easy to farm enemies for slaves instead of having to pay your own workers, its almost unfair.

Essentially, in reality the movement of armies was dictated by three things; the season, terrain and supply logistics. This is one of the only RTS games to incorporate so vital a function in a War centered campaign game.\n\nIt's not as meaty or slow as Total War, but the combat is pretty comparable - but the over world planning adds an element of speed to the campaign of the game. Where you find yourself quickly snapping up objectives that are often just an inch away from you. But the real strategy of the game is balancing your want for rapid expansion - and managing your economy.\n\nI found this to be a very exciting challenge and it's a great way to spend an afternoon. Hegemony III outpaces and delivers far more in strategy than it's predecessors - which I'd say delivered a more cinematic experience. This can for certain players be almost a rogue-like in comparison. Which I personally found to be quite fun. As it adds real replayability.\n\n---\n\nThe only Negative thing I personally have found, would be just the camera's zoom levels and minor graphical glitches that happen every now and again.","March 21","true","9.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The game is challenging and very unique, I find, in its style as well as infinetely more open and intuitive compared to its predecessor Hegemony Rome: Rise of Caesar, which for me was nearly unplayable. It also brings logistics into the picture, forcing you to pay attention to your food and resource supplies in a way I have never encountered in anyother game and which I found very enjoyable. I also really liked the large map with the small scale focus on individual towns and cities as well as the unrestricted map movement compared with the previous Rise of Caesar game.\n\nThat being said there were many things I also didnt like about the game, chiefly the At-War-Unless-At-Peace mechanic of the game. Basically any factions you encounter you are automatically considered to be at war with you which means that right from the get go you are surrounded by hostile neighbors who will never cease to try and raid your territory. There are a few in game events that allow you to achieve a truce with one of your neighbors by completing a mission for them but this is ultimately left wanting since they can then break that truce with fairly little warning and with no real way to prevent it. The only other way to get a truce is to pay your neighbors hefty tributes which given the costly needs of your own defence and maintenance to face the rest of your neighbors are extorionately high but is never-the-less favorable to having to worry about them raiding one of your ill defended provinces, so long as you have the money to pay them of course. Additionally that is about the extent of the diplomacy aspect of the game and, at least for the duration of the game I have played so far, there is no option to form alliances, make trade agreements or perform any other acts of diplomacy to try and give yourself an edge. This constant state of war and very limited peace makes focusing on your own moves and plans exceedingly difficult because even if you are not fighting your neighbors you are likely fighting a rebel faction that cannot be negotiated with and which will make a beeline for you even when they are much closer to another faction's territory. Many of the in game screen shots posted on the store page show units of troops arrayed in military formation and gearing up for battle but. In my experience at least, this is virtually impossible because of the constant threat to your borders which necessitates having strong garrisons that are essentially able to fend off any enemy attack that comes their way becuase any reinforcements would likely be too late in arriving even if their redeployment did not interfere with your own attack plans. This dispersal of forces has made it virtually impossible to gather my forces in anything like expeditionary strength meaning that everywhere I am constantly fighting battles either on equal or disadvantageous terms. While good tactical maneuvering on my part helped to make up for this, it never-the-less gets frustrating, particularly when you are getting attacked in 2 or 3 places at the same time and in each of them you are at a disadvantage so that you are bound to lose eventually for lack of proper attention being paid one or the other of your critical battles. This is made all the worse by the limited manpower available which is used up quickly replacing your units and can make defeats very painful. Moreover, manpower is not pooled but instead is distributed based on the city a given unit was produced in which means that if I wanted to specialize one city to produce all of my best military units and focus my other cities on other areas I will find myself in a jam since if that city runs out of manpower then it doesnt matter how much manpower I have in other cities, I can't replace the losses to those units. This is made all the more complicated by the fact that manpower in captured cities formerly belonging to other factions is not compatible with your own faction's manpower so that if you ever want to disband a unit and regain its stored manpower, it can only be disbanded in a city of its faction of origin. This is where I feel that the game falls short compared to games like the total war series. Total war makes this aspect of the game very simple and logical using the standard At-Peace-Unless-At-War model for diplomacy which makes the diplomatic aspect of the game much more interesting as you forge alliances or try to negotiate peace with one of your enemies. It also makes it easier to engage in large set piece battles which you can then enjoy properly one at a time so that even if you are disadvantaged you at least have the ability to give it your full focus. As it is with this game it isnt really possible to have large set piece battles and the nature of the constant warfare of the game makes it difficult to enjoy the combat of the game which in any case is limitied by the necessarily small scale of the engagements that are likely to be encountered. If there were a way to have certain units auto-managed by a competent AI to defend parts of your borders so that you can put your focus where it's needed or, the easier way, if there just a broader and more rationalized system for diplomacy that would make the game infinetely better but unfortunately that is not a feature.\n\nI realize that I have spent a great deal on the negatives but thats because I find the negatives more important than the positives in the ultimate decision of whether to buy a game. Although I found the balance of positive and negative to be in the positive side's favor that does not mean that there wasn't a great deal that has detracted from my experience of playing the game. If these detractions sound like deal breakers for you then so be it and steer clear of this game but If you are swayed by the positives then that is also your decision.

I had never heard of the series before even though i have played similar titles. If i had to describe this game to fans of the genre I would say it feels like somewhat like Total War but everything is done in real time. The supply system reminds me of Rise of Nations where troops outside of your border had limited supply and would suffer attrition if they ran out.\n\nFor a Strategy gamer looking for something a bit different this game feels fresh. Although it is the 3rd in the series the formula seems to work well. There are many factions however unit variety is only apparent in the different cultures from what i've seen, I would have like to have seen maybe one unique unit for each faction just to make them stand out a bit more. Greeks , Etruscan , Latin and Gallic ,etc cultures have their own unit roosters but have several factions with different passive bonuses to things like resource collection or unit morale.\n\nThe good news is as of the writing of this review the development team is still adding new features as well as patching bugs. Some of the changes coming in patch 4 will definitely improve the game and i hope to see more feature patches in the future.","December 15, 2015","true","15.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've never played any Hegemony games but I love grand strategy (used to love the old civ games and Ceasar 2)    I've never played Total War or other games people sometimes compare it to so I don't have that reference either.  I like games that have empire/city management, and don't completely focus on war at the exlcusion of other strategic domains.  Given this, and my love for history, when I saw this game was coming out soon, it got my immediate attention.  At first I was concerned about buying it as it was brand new and it seems in the forums there were several important issues that needed to be resolved with a patch.  When I saw Longbow the developer being responsive in the forum and releasing their first patch quickly after release, it - along with an early available 10% off discount - gave me the confidence to go ahead and take a chance, so I purchased it.\n\nI have found this game to be quite enjoyable.  I don't care as much about graphics as much as I do about the game mechanics, the sense of challenge, and the strategic thinking involved.  It has been engrossing which is a great sign for me and worth the price I paid, though note I purchased it just before the early 10% off discount expired (people nowadays pay $15 to see a movie at the theater, so if i get like 20 hours or more of good enjoyment out of it, it was worth it.  Does it have some bugs still?  Yes even after the patch, but I'm confident they're working on them.  If the developers are reading this - I also think this game has a lot of potential and would love it if they crowfunded a multiplayer version.\n\nBeing a lover of history, including ancient history may bias me a bit.  Also given that some of my ancestors  lived in the middle of Italy for likely centuries, I can only wonder if this was one of my few chances to every play my ancestors (Etruscans or Umbrians) in a game lol\n\nAnyway this is a fun game for a grand strategy lover and my ancestors would be proud. I recommend it.","September 4, 2015","true","33.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It somewhat reminds of classic Age of Empires but then when you go deeper into it, you feel the elements of other games that are more focused on combat. It is a RTS game and you to be all the time on your toes trying to understand what is happening in the world.\n\nSo, basically, once you start it, you will need to choose a faction. You are playing on map of Italy, trying to unify the tribes there. It is a big map indeed. This is the age when Rome was just a small settlement and will take a long time to become the ROME you can see in Rome 2 TW for example. Once you have chosen a faction, the race for resources will begin.  Other factions might like you, however rebels will not. Seasons will force you to constantly adopt strategy. That is really good thing. Why? Because it will not matter how much gold you have, if you food reserves are depleted.\n\nMap has unusual setup, if you zoom out a bit you can see "basic map" which is really questionable if it helps in anyway.\nDevelopers are constantly updating the game and listening players feedback. For now, at least.\n\nSo, is it for you?\nIf you like Paradox titles and grand strategy games, probably not. It will feel light on calories if you know what I mean.\nIf you like RTS games, this is title you should have in your game library. If you like turn based strategy games, then this could be interesting change for a bit. Real minus is that there is no multiplayer and you cannot kick ♥♥♥ of human opponent.\n\n\n","January 23","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hegemoney III mixes the best things of Gold with the improves features of Rome in to a very solid strategy game. I need more play time to really say this game is better then Gold, but after my short playthourgh I can say this game has all the potential to grow in to one of the best strategy games of all time. If you are a fan of strategy games I would say this is a must buy.\n\nIt is good to see that the developper has learned from there mistakes of the Hegemoney Rome with this game. I really like that they listen to their customers and try to improver the game in anyway they can.\n\nEDIT:\nAfter 10+ hours of this game I must say I really enjoy it. But is the original one is still far better. The whole managing of supply's is easier as ever. With the upgrading of farms, the buying of slaves and the possibility to have as many supply lines to every city there is not much managing going on. In the first Hegemoney food was sometimes tight. In longer campaigns you had slaves and workers carrying food. On the borders of your realm you really needed to upgrade supply lines to get enough food for the winter. In this one, mid autumn my farms stop working because all my stocks are full. I am never out of recruit because I can upgrade cities when I want.\n\nThe AI is better though, but still their attacks are nothing more then raids. Never you get a full blown attack (I dont care if they script this in). There has not been a single moment in the game I felt threatened to loose a city or part of my realm.\n\nI would like to see that Longbowgames brings back the maximum nods from city to city, and farm to city. No longer constructing forts for easy conquering/bringing food where you want it. But let te slaves/worker carry it. Remove or nerf the upgrading of farms/woodcutters and mines. There are just to much resources going round. No longer upgradiging soldiers who are not of your native factions (this is very OP). And the most important thing: Let the AI launch a full blown attack one in a while.\n\nEdit2:\n\nAfter the 3.1 update is is a must buy for every strategy gamer!","December 13, 2015","true","43.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm a big RTS fan and even though the game overall is a bit cruder in looks than the Total War series the RTS approach gives this game a more realistic feel than TW which is a bit clunky with its turn approach.\nThe AI is evolving and does have issues and the limitation on single player only prevents further exploration of the series but I still highly recommend this as a means of exploring strategies and tactics for fans of this era of warfare.

I was surprised therefore that there wasn't very much hype about this one. It might be me being ignorant but i only heard about this a couple of weeks ago and when i did I eagerly googled the crap out of it and didn't find too much out!\n\nI am pleased therefore that (despite my apprehension) this game is easily the best in the series yet. It still has all the mechanics you're familiar with if you've played Hegemony before, for instance supply still plays a massive role, but a few noticable tweaks have been made.\n\nIts easily the hardest in the series too. I started on normal at first with a misplaced confidence bred from playing the previous ones and i soon regretted it. Easy is by no means a walkover either and im currently enjoying reasonable success whilst still being challenged on all fronts by incessant raider spawns (which i think you should be able to change in the options).\n\nIts not perfect yet. There's still a few bugs and annoyances here and there and for some reason its giving my rig a bit of a beating, even though it far exceeds the requirements. None of these are massively game changing however and i'm sure Longbow will address them in time with future updates. It will only get better with its much welcome Workshop support too where hopefully the programming geeks can make some decent mods!\n\nOverall i give it 8/10 and highly recommend it to any RTS fan who, like me, doesn't like the idea of Warhammer coming to Total War.... *sob* *sob*.","August 28, 2015","true","10.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Just to get it out of the way; Yes, you should buy it if you're into strategy. It has a couple of flaws, but overall it's a great game.\n\n+ The map is huge.\n\n+ The starting situation variety is great. There are, off the top of my head, 27 factions. Each having their own benefits, like +15% mining output and/or +25% combat experience. Then there's the starting general to add to that, which you can fully customize with 3 points. You can make it a frontline general, with for example, 2 points in Defence and 1 point in Morale, which gives it extra % for the unit it is attached too. Or you can make an economic leader to govern your city and get more % tax, etc etc.\n\n+Resource management. There are a variety of resources to be exploited. Like gold, wheat, wood, etc. Food you obviously need to feed your army and workers. Wood to upgrade buildings, resources, siege weaponry and ships. Gold to maintain your army, city/camp upgrades and bridges. Make sure you have a stockpile for the winter!!\n\n+Zooming from the strategical map to the tactical map.\n\n+Strategic map looks great. Seeing your realm rise slowly from 1 city with a couple of resources to an entire empire completely interconnected is awesome.\n\n+Lots of fronts with lots of wars. You can't have your troops everywhere, so you'll have to make some decisions where to place them strategically. Don't forget about the invaders from sea!\n\n+ Upgrading cities/camps/resources. Putting up stone walls is expensive, but luckily can be countered by having level 2 markets in your cities. Mixing and matching upgrades to certain cities is fun.\n\n+ Tech tree. Good decision's can be made there.\n\n+ Indie made and it's only the beginning!\n\nBesides the good points, I don't really have anything to complain besides bad sound effects.","August 27, 2015","true","45.6"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

It's incomplete, with several bugs which don't break the game, but make it significantly more excrusiating to play. Player troop pathfinding is terrible. Raiders appear quickly and are quite abundant; forcing you run circles chasing and them, 'less they raid your resources and halt expansion. Then you must command your troops to a controlled area to resupply so you can go attack a city. This doesn't sound too bad, until you repeat it for EVERY encounter and EVERY assault. On top of needing to micromanage your trade routes, workers/slaves (often killed off and needing of replenishment), manage how many resources are going to which areas, manage upgrades for troops, generals, and skills to improve units/cities/navy.\n\nConcerning combat: I played for a little over an hour, and was faced with significantly higher experienced RAIDERS over a course of 10 mins. Single units were wiping out 4 or 5 of my units at a time, mainly because only 1 or 2 of my units would attack at any one time. Bringing up another point: Flanking seems to mean absolutely nothing, which kind of takes a big chunk out of the *strategy* part of the game.\n\nIf you aren't interested in micromanaging every little game, give this one a pass. Age of Empires had better animations, which would have made this at least fun to watch.\n\n3/10","August 27, 2015","false","7.3"," 13 of 34 people (38%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","38","13","34","3","2"

There are two big things about it that i don't like much though. The first is the lack of a separate battle level/ tactical level, separate from the strategic map. This is really just about the kind of game it is, so is the more minor complaint.\n\nMy bigger problem with the game is the amount of micromanagement. You need to send troops to capture logging camps, farms and mines - then you need to recruit units of peasants and send them to man those buildings. On top of that the troops themselves need to carry food with them, or else set up a camp and a supply line, or else starve. Putting in logistics and food supply is a reasonable enough idea - it was important in ancient warfare. But it could be done far more simply and automatically - e.g by having an automatic supply line between an army and the nearest friendly city, cut if enemy troops or fortifications cross it.\n\nI was hoping to like this game because Rome II Total War is such a half-cut disappointment, but the level of micromanagement is just too much for me.

I see many posts about bugs, crashes and the unfinished nature of the game too, it's all symptomatic of a job half done.\n\nThe developers need to realise that the world is populated primarily by people who have never heard of a Hegemony game, if they insist on catering only for those who already know everything about the games mechanics this series is doomed to die in relative obscurity.\n\nedit refund recieved.","August 26, 2015","false","0.2"," 12 of 53 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","12","53","0","3"

So i'll give it that. If anything.\nFog of War, Money and the likes are irrelevant or the AI factions. They know where you are at all times and have an inifinite amount of money and troops for you to deal with.\n\n\n\nImagine if there was a Real-Time Total War game with a fancy camera feature, made the speed of everyhting slow as anything possible in the universe.\n\nCombat is arcade RNG-ish. i dont even know and care to be honest.

Even calvary will just mosh pit around the spot; into the enemy, screwing up any strat you had in mind\n\nAfter a couple of hours of grinding my way out of Rome. I thought "Is this really it?

After getting really bored with Rome II really fast I was looking for another good strategy game. This was more like work than fun to me. My mouse was choppy, I had to go to the strategic map to move it properly. The entire interface is just not put together well. Nothing is easy to use or do. You basically have to read the entire manual to figure anything out and even then there is so much left out. Why should I ahve to connect every resource node to my city? Well It's becuase if it's over a river or something the game can't connect them when you tell it to and you have to go through some tedious process of trying to make waypoints to connect it yourself, which never really work nor will the game tell you why they don't work.

I heavily enjoyed playing it, enough to give it a positive review, but I felt the gameplay was a bit bare. For example diplomacy is extremely simplistic and it seemed useless to me to even bother trying to get treaties because it would cost me money and the AI always came to me paying me that same diplomacy fee for the same treaty. So was really no point in me even using the diplomacy menu. The AI also feel way too easy to beat because I can easily just start out as Greek, buy 1 Hoplite army, and then it lasts entire early game soloing literally everything the AI throws at me by itself. To me that's not really a fair fight and the AI doesn't start using anything strong like that until mid to late game. If the developers were to add more unit diversity, more diplomatic options and flavor, smarter AI that utilizes the units and base improvements properly, A MULTIPLAYER FEATURE, and more depth to the generals I would say this game is the top grand strategy game around due to its real time strategy map with total war like formation battles.\n\nRegardless it is certainly worth a buy if it is on sale for 50% or more off, I can't see paying 30$ for it.","April 2","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, I'd originally considered returning it, but decided to stick with it- and I'm really pleased that I did.
