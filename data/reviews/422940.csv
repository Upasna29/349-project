Because  came into this game as a SWG vet which was sold to me as the " unoffical swg 2.0" I really wanted to love this game and go back to my gaming home as I and many others have very fond memories of that time.\nThis game takes those feelings and slaps them across your face there is barely anything put into the game.\n\n\nThe biggest reason I can't recommend this game to anyone is the devs. Ethan will laugh and make fun of you in game and on the forums for asking for any help as well as his rude comments on the steam forums. I have been playing games a long time and in m many years I have never had to deal with a more rude and unprofessional dev. It truly makes me sad that such a game that had so much promise being ruined by buggy gameplay and rude devs.\n\nDo yourself a favor and pass on this one.","January 12","false","1.0"," 127 of 176 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","127","176","4","50"

I snapped it up, eager to hop in an see how it played.  Keep in mind this is a review on the first day of release.\n\nDivergent has a ton of potential and is clearly made with love, but it's early. It provides no direction for the beginner, the character creation is buggy (All characters vanish if you click a certain race and you have to restart)  Buildings vanish at certain angles, the only moving things were other newbs and one large mech.  Despite being a MASSIVE Swg fan I don't expect to play with the same level of graphics that I had back then either.  My character looks like she had some pretty bad plastic surgery after being run over by a herd of Bantha.\n\nOverall, Divergent is buggy and I didn't find it playable at all.  The price tag is high for the current content offered and I'd say it'll be worth giving a go in a few months, but not now.","January 7","false","0.9"," 85 of 130 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","85","130","4","8"

I was a big fan of the game that this one seeks to mimic.  But this game is nothing like SWG, and it is deeply flawed on a conceptual level.\n\nDivergence has all the things needed to make it a fun game, in the future. It looks great, but it clearly isn't finished. It is kind of a a 'builder' type game, so you are encouraged to scavenge materials and build everything from your personal gear to the buildings in the game world. It has much of the complexity that made crafting in that other game so enjoyable.\n\nWhat is the problem? I am "not the targetted audience of this game". There is no option to not have to fight other players. No option to simply play a PvE game. This is hardcore, bend you over the stump PvP. Everything that you build can, and will be destroyed or taken from you. There is no persistance, and as such, there is no incentive to actually build anything, except weapons and armor. That to me is the biggest problem with Divergence. I can play, and enjoy a pure PvP game, like GTA Online. But in that sort of game, I don't have to build anything. I don't have to rebuild from scratch when I'm killed.","February 17","false","16.1"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","33","42","0","0"

First off they stole assets from Star Wars Galaxies (audio, and some graphics). Second off, nothing is really implemented in the game, besides endless material grinding. You look at the trailer, but half that stuff isn't even in the game, also pretty sure he doesn't have permission to use that song, but he doesn't care.\n\nAlso just go check out the forums. The developer of this game (of which there are 2) does not take kindly to suggestions, or criticism. He will insult people, tell them how they are so wrong, and completely ignore their point. I've seen some childish devs before, but this guy might take the cake. Most people like when the devs are active in the community, this might be the exception where it'd be better if he wasn't.\n\nAlso performance. This game brings my i7 to its knees.

I wanted to like this game so much and I did, for a while, but at the current stage you won't enjoy this that much you would recommend this to anybody.\n\nMy 44 hours of gameplay mostly was playing running simulator, clickfest when using a gadget to find resources and sight seeing an empty world. There are professions, I was artisan which is pretty much a must, because you can't buy stuff (at the moment that is), you have to make it yourself. Artisan needs resources to build stuff, and leveling artisan makes you able to craft better stuff. This is cool and if this works it would be awesome. I like things going slow and not too easy.\n\nToo bad it doesn't work. It's too difficult to find all resources you need and because you can't even buy them from npc trader, you spent your time running here and running there and start clickfesting in a hope to find the resource you need. Too boring, I'm out. I just couldn't find them, and after 44 hours I won't give a duck. Games should be fun, not working simulators.\n\nThere are other professions, but when there is no other players or fauna to be found, I don't know how would you enjoy being a medic, a scout etc.\n\nI saw one npc trader, two shuttleports which I accidentally found while running. I saw no other players, I know there was 7 according to Steam Charts. I don't know how many plays non-Steam client.\n\nThere is no map, no wiki, no tutorials. You should watch some youtube videos made by developer.\n\nAnd for some reason some stuff you make won't even work. I made few weapons, managed to load the magazines and tried to shoot in the air, nothing happened. WTF!!! Tried to imagine a scenario where the other player magically finds you and you can't even shoot him. Roflmao.\n\nYou should read other reviews as well and visit the homepage\n\n\nWould I recommend at this stage = NO\nbut, there is a promised huge patch coming (when, nobody knows, not even a year) which propably would change my vote to recommended.","May 6","false","47.4"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","1"

The community around the game seems pretty good as well. The game DOES NOT HOLD YOUR HAND. To understand how to play it, you might have to watch some videos, in fact, I encourage you to do so.\n\nThe game is very, very grindy, don't expect to do anything significant in your first 10hrs in the game, it took me (a noob) about 2 hours to make some pants. The game runs well almost always 60fps, but given time I think a busy server will change that. Divergence, in general, is unbelievably boring ( in MY opinion) I would say 80% of the time you're just standing still clicking buttons in the menu. Like I said, it's very grindy and very slow paced, and the 40 dollar price tag for an EA game at the stage it's at now is unreal. Which is why I can't recommend this game, some people may love it more power to you, but I do not.\n\nIf you're curious about the game I did make a video on it, give it a watch if you want.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/white-glint/recommended/422940/","white-glint","White-Glint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/white-glint/","266 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR: THIS GAME IS NOT FOR THE LIGHT OF HEART OR THE IMPATIENT\nIF YOU WANT A FEATURE COMPLETE EXPERIENCE, THIS GAME IS NOT IT RIGHT NOW, THAT IS WHAT EARLY ACCESS IS FOR.\nALSO, PVP IS ENABLED EVERYWHERE AT ALL TIMES, SO BE CAREFUL. HOWEVER, PERMA-DEATH IS NOT AN ISSUE AT THIS TIME\nDivergence Online aims to be an MMORPG in the vein of traditional games, most especially Star Wars Galaxies (Especially Star Wars Galaxies). The game, as it advertises, takes a lot of inspiration for mechanics and assets from the game prior to the New Game Experience Update. The game bases its skill system around a single skill window which is divided into numerous professions. For example,  the Artisan Profession is the builder and crafter profession of the game, and Medics are the healers.\n\nSo far, the game is limited to its barest essentials, this being:\nResource Gathering (With varying qualities and having to scan for resources), Crafting (Influenced by the resource qualities), basic combat (Punching, Handguns, Assault Rifles, Shotguns and Sniper RIfles) and the ability to build structures. Basically, only the Artisan Profession is functional as of writing this review, I could be wrong.\n\nThere are a wide selection of races (Species) in the game right now, divided between the different societies they come from. At the time of wiriting this review, the races currently have no differences statistically whatsoever, and are only aesthetic, apart from Synthetics, which can transfer their conciousness between any bodies they come across that are unoccupied. There is a video about customisation created by Ethan Casner if you wish to know more about the lore of each race in the setting.\n\nWhen it comes to resource gathering and crafting, you will first need to train in the Artisan profession. You will be given a Resouce Scanning Tool and your basic Crafting Tool. First, so that you know what you're looking for, you look at the crafting tool to find your first clothes. Yes, you start in your underwear right now if you aren't a synthetic. Once you find what you want to make, you will need to go to your resource scanner tool and search for what you want in the lift, click it, click scan and follow the percentages. Once you get far enough, you will start to be able to make personal harvesters which will actually collecte resources from the ground for you over time as long as you power it. This system is also used for creating the things you need for building structures.\n\nYou can build structures either from prefab materials in the crafting system or (If you subscribe to the game at $10 US a month) you will be given access to a voxel building tool which is much more complex than the likes of Minecraft. There are even a few premade structures (such as a Cantina and a City Hall). All structures in the game world are destructible. This includes harvesters, generators and the buildings and hoppers necessary for building.\n\nThe way that combat works in Divergence is through an over the shoulder shooter system. You must aim and fire to hit and kill your target. In combat, there are a few options. Guns are implemented and combat is very raw right now. It works fine, but needs expansion. There are a variety of firearms of the typical niches, such as shotguns, assault rifles, handguns and sniper rifles, but not much else. There aren't any NPCs fully functional in the game at the time of writing, but they will be implemented VERY soon. So at the moment, combat is exclusively between players.\n\nVisually speaking, the style is the game is amazing in my opinion. It stands out very well and the world is very well made. It is also fairly large. I have roamed quite a large area and haven't explored the whole available play space. Though, at the moment there is not much reason to explore out there apart from in the desert at the time of writing, as there are valuable resources there.\n\nDivergence Online, as you can see, is a one time purchase game. However, the game does offer an optional subscription that offers a few benefits. The subscription rate is $10 US every month.\n\nAt the moment, buying the game will give you a single character slot. This may change in the future, however, at this point in time, you only have one. Subscribing will allow you multiple character slots and will allow you access to the ferrocrete tool, a voxel based building tool. Think of it like Minecraft but with the ability to save out surfaces from existing blocks. This system does not give you any inherent advantage in gameplay, it simply is another way to build. Another system you gain access to when subscribing is terraforming (Which I am not sure if it is in the game right now). This will allow you to mould the land to a degree.\n\nIt may also be noted that there are special packages available on the website for purchase right now that give special perks. Starting at $120 US, you will be given access in each one to special benefits. Such as special races, these include:\nThe one time creation of an uncloneable Vindicator or Verrator character of the Veli race\nThe Ennie, a species of small humanoid lizards.\n\nOther options include the ability to get a head start with a synthetic character, givign you access to a combat chassis from the get go, or a military chassis (Basically a mech body). These two items will be able to be earnt in game however, they are just a head start through this means.\n\nAnother benefit available from these packs is access to a special account bound PERMANENT ferrocrete tool, which you will not need subscription to use. Essentially you get a lifetime subscription.\n\nThe last most expensive option is to pay for your own custom land mass in the game, this being $1000 US. They will build your island in accordance to your specifications. This option I personally do not recommend unless you are feeling generous (Or are some crazy millionaire).\n\nIf you purchase any of these packages, you will need to speak to Ethan Casner through any of the possible means and he will help you redeem your purchase. The island thing will most likely take a while, if you're crazy enough for that.\n\n\nOverall, Divergence Online is in the very, very, VERY EARLY STAGES of development. If you are interested in the game like I am, and have been since I discovered it being tried to be built years ago, I can only recommend you buy the game. The community is very friendly and we all commune on the official teamspeak server, which can be found on the official facebook page and numerous other places. However, you will be understood if you do not want to buy the game yet. Just do understand that Early Access is for unfinished products, and this game is a good example of this.\n\nDO NOT go in expecting a remotely finished game and you will be pleased with the game and its steady progress. THe game is patched on a pretty much daily basis and we are getting more features and bugfixes daily.\n\nUltimately:\n\nI do recommend the game for those who wish to support a potential SWG successor and are willing to wait for the game to be built up, and don't mind helping to fund the developers.\n\nIf you do not have the patience to wait for the game to be built up around you, it is not recommended. If what I have said hasn't convinced you, you should definitely come look back regularly to see if you change your mind.\n\nLike with all things, if you want this game to be good, patience is key.","January 9","true","46.1"," 64 of 110 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","64","110","5","10"

Seemingly the product of two friends who thought it would be cool to download the Unity (Personal) engine and make some quick cash.  Developer interactions with customers is rude, condescending, and dismissive.\n\nUnoriginal.  Other than what you can buy in the unity store, the mechanics and interface are primarily oncepts and assets taken from SWG, 95% of which are not implemented yet.  The race and class content the developers have added themselves is seemingly a mish-mash of concepts from other games and IPs, added in a sloppy and juvenile manner which does not fit well with those from original SWG.\n\nUnlimited, open PVP.    There is no faction system, notoriety, or flagging.   You can kill/be killed and looted by anyone, anytime, anywhere (except right next to spawn areas).  The developers show no intention of implementing any sort of consensual pvp systems and show verbal disdain on the forums towards anyone who suggests or advocates for those features in their PVP.\n\nBarely Tech Demo.

However, I am not sure WHY the dev decided to release at this point in time. This is game is in pre-pre-alpha at best. I may have an hour on this game, at best, simply because there is nothing. Here are things that make the game too frustrating to play at this time.\n\n- The UI is broken. Some of the UI textures do not fully render. That is, the elements seem like lattuce in that every few blocks of pixels are transparent or missing. It looks as though someone tried to print on a window screen.\n\nAlso, it is very difficult to get the selection reticles to truly activate. It took me 10 or more attempts just to open my survey tool. And when I was able to click "Use", nothing happened. After a few more attempts it finally opened.\n\n- I didn't find a single resource to harvest the entire time I played. I spent the whole time surveying with no results. Surveying is very time consuming. You must navigate through the menu of resources to select a single resource to look for. I spent a lot of time simply running around looking for metal and polymer so I could try to craft a pair of pants.\n\n- There are no waypoints, no map or minimap, and no compass. You have to constantly type "/loc" in the chat window to get any sense of bearing. Someone told me a location to find polymer and it took me forever to get there because I had to keep stopping to find my location in chat just to see if I was heading in the right direction. Make sure you have pen and paper handy. You will need it to keep track of anything.\n\n- I did not see a single animal, creature, or moving thing other than a single player. Just a few empty buildings and abandoned harvesters.\n\n- It is early access, not even alpha ready and they want $120 to try things like voxel building. Also a $10 monthly sub for other benefits.\n\n- It will take you many many many hours to make any progress. Unless you are someone who can dedicated 40+ hours a  week to a single game, then this game might not be for you. I might be able to give 8 hours - 12 hours a week, so I don't forsee this as being a viable game for me.\n\nI really hope this game turns out and becomes something great. But at this time, it is not not ready for play. I would advise anyone looking to buy this game to wait at least a year to 18 months. Summer 2017 or New years 2018. Check in then to see if the game is ready.","March 26","false","14.4"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","22","33","0","5"

The game is not problem free and in large parts is broken. That said the game is a lot of fun for those of you that like hardcore pvp games. Especially those that enjoy things like Rust, H1Z1, ARK, and so on. Do not misunderstand me though as this game is not a SURVIVAL game.\n\nThe game uses REDEVELOPED assests from Star Wars Galaxies. Mind you I said REDEVELOPED. Meaning not stolen. They upscaled textures, reworked models, and obviously had to reprogram. So anyone out there thinking lawsuit is incoming you are very wrong.  What all those old assets does do ? Give a lot of nostalgia to old SWG players. It makes me feel at home.\n\nAs this game is further developed we will see a indepth skill based profession system. Indepth crafting, factions, race limitations, pve and so much more that isn't in the game just yet.\n\nI have managed to have fun stalking and killing people in the game.  Mind you this game has a social aspect to it where the hunters become the hunted rather quickly. Most cases the community will band together to hunt down people committing mass murder.\n\nIt will soon be a 29.99 game. It is worth that and then some. Even more so as the game is developed further.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChibiFae/recommended/422940/","ChibiFae","Glitchy Girl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChibiFae/","193 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL:DR version -\nPositive aspects:\n+ beautiful game environment\n+ robust crafting/mining system\n+ robust base/home building system with the ability to use voxel tools\n+ consistent updates ( in my experience since starting the game)\n+real time/non turn based combat , healing\n+ good in game community/active devs, GMs\n+ original race concepts (synths for example)\n+ Solid performance, 60 FPS on highest settings with medium draw distance.  Drops a bit when entering populated cities (my cpu is a bottle neck in this case >.<)\n\nNegative aspects\n- feature incomplete (this is not unexpected-it is an EA after all!)\n- steam community/forums for the game semi-toxic\n- PvE - mobs are currently bugged out, and are to be fixed\n\nPoints to take note of:\n~ Recreated SWG assets. (not ripped from the game, but modeled after and used in the game)\n~ Similar skill system to SWG\n~ Real time, third person view combat.\n~ Mining/Crafting Similar to SWG\n~ Full PVP world\n\nLong version\nThis review on the game is based on having played the game after 54 or so hours based upon steam's estimation.\n\nI will start by saying that the term SWG 2.0 is a bit misleading.  Because to say this implies to me that this game and it's price tag are just a product of a few people trying to cash in on graphically prettier version of Star Wars Galaxies, and call it a day.   The more fitting term that I would go with, as coined by those who described Repopulation would be a, "Spiritual successor" to SWG.\n\nNow granted, the initial experience of the game resembles SWG, down to the familiar UI and clicking noises for typing.  This may lead to the impression t that this game tries to be SWG. What with a UI that is very similar to what you'd have seen in SWG, the skill trees, and even how some of the classes are named.   The next point of similarity is the mining and crafting system which seems to be almost lifted out of SWG, which is not a bad thing mind you because of the complexity that this mechanic afforded.  After harvesting/mining though it is pretty much at this point where the similarities end.\n\nThe races are at this point are as follows. A little lizard race that weren't intended to be playable and yet ended up as such due to player demand (which in my opinion reminds me slightly of the Geico Gecko) . A robotic race (the synthetics) which lack the ability to use armor but rather instead are intended to focus around the ability to a) modify your body to provide you more armor upgrade stats, or b) allow you to transfer into a new body , whether it be into a larger combat mech, another synthetic chassis that was just built, or the fallen body of an enemy sythetic that was killed (or a friend who died o,O) while leaving the old body lying there.  Your typical human race which is composed of different sub types of human with different backstories and appearances (genetic lineages?).  The Lokri, another human looking race that look a bit differently and are more adept and "psychic abilities" which will have some advantages for the magic like abilities and skills available in the game.  (not yet implimented).  Another psionic based race called the D-Tanix that are going to be some sort of energy looking guys (not in game yet).  And finally you have the Veli which I would say are akin to space ninjas, and a PVP required, "alpha race" who pretty much have the ability to teleport, and slowly lose energy over time and who are required to kill on of their opposing faction (Vindicator kills Verrator, or Verrator kill Vindicator) to extend their life, which are purposely going to be made to be in low numbers.\n\nCombat, and healing are done in third person/over the shouldver view akin to games like Firefall, Definace, Day Z TPV, H1Z1 TPV, etc etc.  And is real time combat as opposed to the turn based combat seen in SWG.  Same goes for combat healing of other players which requires the use of a medic gun for healing others, or stim packs to heal yourself.\n\nHousing is pretty fun, and comes in the form of either house parts that you craft and plop down yourself, prefabbed housing, or housing that you build using a voxel tool, all of which are tied to a hopper.  In this game a hopper being a central terminal that you can use to tie all your items to in an area which can then be packed up and moved with little issue if you want to find a new spot.\n\nPvE at the moment is broken with the presence of a few of the planned mobs in the game with an AI and attributes that does require  tweaking if you want to avoid a horrible death.  More mobs to be added once these issues are fixed.\n\nAs far as work being done, it must be said that this game is far from feature complete and is most definitely a game you could call an "Early Access" title, despite the fact that the game the main guys working on this project started according to some sources as far back as 2012-2013?   Despite this fact, it's not unusual to see the content constantly being updated and nearly daily patches in an attempt to work towards bringing the game towards a more complete state. With an emphasis on *more* given that an MMO is truly never complete given the addition and tweaking of content as time goes on.\n\nThe community is a mixed bag as you may have seen on the forums, or even in the reviews, or on the reddit page.  The forums seem to be more toxic in the way of community with people on both ends spewing vitriol at one another.  Whilst in game, things are a lot more sociable in my opinion especially for a PVP enabled world.  This being that as opposed to having players only interested in killing other players (you do have quite a few of those), you have those players more interested in working with each other to build things up and who just wish to craft, mine, and socialize.  Add to this, active staff who are on nearly at all times who are always happy to socialize and talk, and who jump in to make sure that nothing which has broken stays broken.\n\nThe game's graphics are quite nice looking,but  the client itself does appear to suffer from lack of optimization.  An issue most noticeable with the Nvidia cards.  (Using a 980TI here, and having some performance issues, whilst better performance is being reported with those using ATI cards). As of this review a patch was done adding the ability to turn on and off some of the visual effects, I've yet to find out if this affects the game's performance in any way at this time.\n\nAnother issue that I want to bring up is the use of assets.  This has been mentioned and will probably continue to be a bone of contention for some.  As it is now, the assets are *not* ripped from the SWG client or from SWG Emu.  They are in fact modeled after these SWG assets at a higher poly-count, and skinned from scratch.  And quite honestly, in my opinion (for whatever it is worth) I feel that it was a good choice, because the harvesters, and the assets used in the game fit in with the world/terrain.\n\nAll in all, as you can see by the time I put into this game, I am still continuing to enjoy it and if things keep progressing as they are, it is one that I will hope to enjoy for years to come.\n\n*edit* Updated review because client is far more optimized than when I wrote the initial review.","January 16","true","227.5"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","16","30","0","5"

Divergence Online and SGL are trying to recreate one of the most advanced MMO's of all time..  Anyone that has play SWG knows how much resources was actually in that game to try and re create..  Currently the devs are dropping patch's left and right, sometimes 2 a day..  Coming from games like 7D2D, getting a patch maybe every couple months if that..  Not to mention no one from the Fun Pimps has ever, spent time in game with me shooting the ♥♥♥♥ and exploring around as I have with Ethan..  Most people that have problems with Ethan, have no sense of humor and are obviously taking ♥♥♥♥ way to seriously..  To be honest he is a really down to earth dev, but if you come off like a troll or someone fresh from WoW asking stupid questions because the only MMO youve played your whole life is WoW clones and dumbed down versions that literally hold your hand all the way to max level on your quest for Epic Loots..  Then DO is most likely not your game, this game forces you to interact with other players to try and survive, the same way SWG forced you to interact with other players to make a living or even function on effective level..\n\nThat said, the current state of this game is very playable..  They have a good portion of Artisan complete allowing to craft and survey a vast range of structures/harvesters/weapons/armor and survey for all materials you will need to build these things..  Currency has just been added adding yet another SWG inspired element to the game, have to pay for your buildings and harvesters etc upkeep.  Medic has a bit of work done to it allowing you to craft meds and also heal yourself and other people..  There is still a ton of work that does need to be done on Scout but they do have some basic functions at this time like building log homes and setting up a campfire, it has been announced they do plan to add more soon!!  Marksmen and Brawler are implemented but dont have any skills yet that come with them, and you can only level unarmed at this point for brawler..  Sounds as tho even some elite professions like Architect are going to make there way into the game soon as well..\n\nSo all and all currently you have a open world pvp third person shooter with full loot and tons of crafting options..  Everything in the world that is crafted and collected by players is lootable/destroyable by other players, this game is pretty cutthroat and I think that is bad ♥♥♥..  Like the old Jedi grind when they had perma-death..  If you are looking for a game that throws content at you and holds your hand all the way through the game then I would not recommend this game for you, but if you want to be apart of what could be the best game of all time then I highly recommend you support this game.  The more support SGL gets the more this game become a reality, if everyone just sits there and goes oh lets just wait to see if this game launches.. Then it might never will..  Come be apart of the future in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ming and join our community today!!  SEEYA ON ROOK!","January 24","true","34.2"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","20","39","0","0"

When I experienced a major issue with personal resources disappearing due to bad code I raised the issue privately and was told I was out of luck. When I subsequently raised the issue publicly I was told it was told they could fix it but it was my fault for playing too intensely and gathering more resources than the server could support etc. etc. I was also publicly shamed by the developer himself for making the issue public. Ironically he also pointed out I had given important information to a group of marauders harassing the server. News flash - my alt was one of those four marauders. Yes, the server population is so low 4 people essentially own the server. Up until this time I have been a fierce defender of all things DO. Now I feel I judged those who came to these conclusions much more quickly much too harshly.\n\nAnd subsequent to updating this review the developer blocked me from the public facebook page.\n\nAnf on Feb 8th the developer banned me from the steam forum and published my RL name.

Can't wait to see where the development of this game goes!\nIt's fair to say there is a lot still to do but there is plently of stuff implimented! Worth supporting in my view.\n\n**UPDATE 2** I've updated to a 'Buy' again.. please read below:\n\nSo, if you are really serious about supporting the development of a truely free roaming sandbox game then I recomend you stump up the money and help out by getting stuck in. However even this might leave you a little frustrated at the moment as there aren't any road maps or dev logs to see what is being worked on. Having said that the main developer 'Ethen' is constantly in game and working hard on stuff like NPC's new crafting stuff etc. The game feels like SWG day 1, completely free roaming and sandbox, all items are unique and can be dropped in the world so have a 3d model. The scenery is lovely and varied and you can walk for hours and hours across current land mass (others being added).\nI belive the game has HUGE potential but the dev team needs to work quickly to get some basics in place e.g. groups, maps, trading, professions, private messaging, and some story/quest content. From on old SWG explorer and resource gatherer point of view Divergence is everything you want it to be but that's only going to last so long without the other elements of a sandbox mmo. It could also use a combat flag option even though I have to say I am finding the risk element of potentially getting killed and my inventory looted quick exciting !\nIt's got a long way to go but maybe it can succeed where others have failed, the dev approach is unorthodox but maybe that's what's needed, less corporate 'Build a game to make money' and a bit more 'build a game that is someone's passion'......\nlet me know if you want more details :)\n\n**UPDATE 1**\nI still recomend this game however.... DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME if you can not deal with constant PvP deaths and the risk of losing all you have collected in your inventory. Currently there are no banks and no really safe ways to protect the resources you have collect. So if you get frustated by others killing you for your stuff or simpy killing you (you body is almost impossible to find so you lose your stuff anyway) wait until a few more game mechanics are implimented.","January 7","true","58.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","1"

I began walking out of spawn and I was greeted by a small little lizard called Loky. He promised me fame and fortune as long as I helped him kill all humans so I did what any rational robot would do. I terminated him with 30-40 punches and went on my quest. After spending what seemed 1 hour in-game (Was actually 5 hours) I figured out everything basic like how to Survey, Sample, Craft, Not to drag item past inventory screen (Because said item will be lost to the void and take up inventory space), Not dropping medium power cells (Because you won't be able to pick them up) and to prone in bushes to avoid the suicidal human death hunts and the kill bots roaming the land. At the end of the day I have 5 personal harvesters and I'm bush hopping. I haven't died yet and I've killed about 9 humans so far. With just 1 working skill in-game I've put 8+ hours and I haven't even gotten to base building yet! So try the game out. The UI and controls are CLUNKY. But the game has TONS of potential. Its swaying in the right direction. It could become your next favorite game. Only time will tell and if you want to see the development progress and the drama you should definitely pick it up. But remember to KILL ALL ENNIES in-game and join the robot federation if you join. Because I hate damn lizards and you should too.","January 10","true","121.5"," 15 of 33 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","15","33","3","1"

It's like SWG but not. The dude making it has been working on it since they upgraded to the CU/NGE pretty much by himself.\n\nIt's good it has some quirky things about it I'm sure that will get fixed when He gets the time. It's not game breaking or anything just some functionality and cosmetic things. Hardly noticable in most cases.\n\nI think this game could become the next EVE online and might bring a huge breath of fresh air into this stale ♥♥♥ MMO genre. I think it's worth buying this game if nothing else but to support developers who design games we like, not like WOW.\n\nIt's a solid game tho, Looks good and is pretty groundbreaking in it's terrain modification building style. With SWG's already amazing and truly awesome's crafting/resource system.\n\nThis type of sandbox is what people want next after WOW has gotten old.\n\nOr\n\nDon't, I've already wasted too much of my time telling ya ♥♥♥♥ you could've googled yourself. Actually, probably not, because you're stupid and I'd kick your ♥♥♥ in this game anyhow! Then you'd cry on the forums. This would inspire people to come at you and say "ha ha newb let me get you a whamublance" and then they would come acrossed me in game and I'd kick their ♥♥♥ too. Then they would cry on the forums. This keeps cycling until a combat upgrade happens... then a starwarsy and iconic game enchancement.....\n\nYou shouldn't buy this game I like it. I don't want it changed from your crying that your pistoleer dancer couldn't do enough damage to make me stop emoting.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRicklowdis","January 21","true","25.3"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

This is an early access game, so posting reviews about nothing works blah blah blah is pointless as well. OK enough ranting about morons and there crappy reviews.\n\nMy review is as follows:\n\nCrafting in game is amazing, and extremely dumbed down right now, what i mean by that is you only need basic stuff to craft high end items, I believe this will change in future.\n\nGame World is absolutely stunning, i cannot believe the amount of detail, even if its unfinished, it look like a highly polished product if you can see past the minor code in work stuff happening.\n\nMovement and mechanics are working well but i think a few things could be done to place items in world, the camera seems too close for my personal taste but i was able to make it work within 15 minutes of loggin on the first time, then i got killed lol which leads me to next review.\n\nOpen world PVP, hell yeah, ♥♥♥♥ing amazing bring it on ♥♥♥♥ing crybabies, I am a girl and i will kill you if you start something thats all I am going to say!\n\nVendors and currency, i have not experienced the vendors yet or the monies (lol) but i will get there, I am understanding the only way to get credits is going to be going to these vendors and getting credits and or buying other peoples stuff, neat concept, but I personally believe this will change just by reading some of the dev notes and updates.\n\nSo amazing, look at this I have played the game under an hour and have given a review of what i believe the game is right now, i read up on the forums before purchasing, read every single review and posted my honest opinion, please stop the bashing because you cant do this or that because you want to the game is an open world pvp sandbox, you dont like it go away and let the ones who have been waiting for a game like this to come out for years....\n\n","January 24","true","33.8"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","12","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darklance/recommended/422940/","darklance","Vulkan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darklance/","185 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've been following the development of Divergence: Online for some time, and believed in the concept enough that I backed it prior to its availability on Steam. So, how does it stack up now that we all have access to it? First, some definitions.\n\nEarly Access Does Not Mean Finished Game\nThe game is in Early Access. Valve intended this program to be a kind of crowdfunding where people who liked the concept of a game enough could throw money into a development pot so that the developers could finish the game. In return, they gained access before the game was ready for a general audience. As such, reviews can't be made on the state of the game, but rather on the pace and quality of development. This is particularly true when the game has only been in Early Access for two weeks, as is the case here.\n\nWith that in mind, here's my review.\n\nPace of Development\nSince the game launched in Early Access, we have seen almost daily updates to the game, and each one is substantial. Major bugs are fixed or mitigated, new features are added, and feedback from the community is addressed. The pace of development is very rapid. This inevitably means that new bugs are also being introduced daily, but at this point in the game's life, a plethora of bugs is to be expected.\n\nQuality of Development\nSo how about the quality of development? Well, I can't see the code or the server performance graphs, so I have to judge this based on the rate of improvement, not just the rate of development. Visually, the game is not progressing very much. It looks better than SWG did, but it has a long way to go to be complete. A lot of the graphics are placeholders pulled from or based on SWG assets. That does nothing to solidify the game's own feel, and this is an issue the developers have promised to address. I believe they're sincere. Whether they can deliver or not remains to be seen. From a systems perspective, the game is improving by leaps and bounds on a very rapid basis. In the past few days, we gained full-loot for PvP, a lot system, new mobs, a ton of new craftable interior modules, bigger harvesters, and others. Network performance has improved, though not as much as systems have.\n\nThe Community\nThe community growing up around this game is fantastic. Almost everyone is willing to help each other. It being a full-loot open world PvP game, I imagine you'll start to see the usual roving gangs common to games of this type, but for now at least most people are cooperating. Interestingly, the community on the Steam forums seems much more toxic than the community actually in the game or on the Facebook group.\n\nIs it SWG?\nNot exactly. It borrows a lot of the features, yes. Crafting and harvesting are extremely reminiscent of pre-CU SWG. Combat is nothing like pre-CU, CU, or NGE combat, however. D:O combat is unique, and twitch-based. A lot of supporting systems from SWG are not yet in the game, such as missions or image design. However, this is probably the closest thing we're going to get to a SWG 2 in our lifetimes. It's certainly closer than The Repopulation was.\n\nA Lack of PR\nThe one area where this game really falls down is in public relations. The developers need to improve how they deal with the public. I understand they're under a lot of stress, but the image they present is somewhat less than professional. Sometimes this is reflected in the game itself, with game text being just a little too snarky or even immersion-breaking. Thankfully, this is nothing that can't be fixed fairly easily. If they can bring on even a part-time community manager, a lot of this will be solved.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThe game is very rough, with many key systems partially implemented, buggy, or outright missing. But we're two weeks into Early Access, and the game is already vastly superior to where it was at launch. The developers know what they're doing, but are in need of a community manager. The community for the game is the reason you should buy into Early Access right now rather than waiting. This game is going to be amazing six months down the road, but the community is amazing now.","January 19","true","5.5"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"

Harvestors? Crafting? Exploration? Then I started reading the reviews, and  there seemed to be a trend of people upset that the game was not a 100% polished title. When like everything thing the Devs have stated about this game states that "This is early access". I read more of these reviews, and I came to the conclusion that pretty much most of the people posting them clearly had not even read so much as the opening splash-screen.\n\nOriginally posted by Divergence Dev team:Important Notice The world you are about to enter is the creation of two friends.

When we made gameizle, a community site to help catalog the game info and help new players understand, we realized the sheer size and scope of this game. So let our crew have a chance to bring light to our new game of passion.\nFirst out of the gate, lets touch on what is Alpha? Alpha stage in itself is a treat for any heavy gaming enthusiast, you have the pleasure of watching the game grow from nothing into something, to provide crucial feedback to help everything keep going forward.\n\nThat being stated, lets look at the crucial elements we have all come to expect from mmo's, the community itself and at large is outstanding. It offers direct lines of communication with the games creator Ethan, lead programmer Ava and game master DeathFyre, at no time has any complaint gone un answered, no matter how tiny the matter might be.\nAs for character customization, everyone likes to change it up, this game yet again does not fail to set the bar for customization to another level. Being able to command every aspect of your character from eye color, down to the shape of their leg muscles, it brings what I was looking for in a large way.  With different species of humans, aliens, elementals to cyborgs, this game takes the standards for diversity to a new standard we hope stays with the game through to release, if not more! In a game with minimal HUD and no name plate 24/7 it gives the user the ability to stand out even more.\n\nLets look at crafting, crafting and more crafting, not in the typical uselessness that most games have dumbed it down to either. It is all for a purpose, its for experience, custom designed structures ( that's right, design your heart out! ), upgraded weapons, armor and more! For those of you out there who miss the old star wars galaxy, this game has grand slammed this aspect far out of the park with recreating it in stunningly accurate detail and gone above for a third time in making it encompass even the resistances/conditions of materials.\n\nWhich brings us to collection of resources, surveying, with the scenery that this game engine generates, with no instancing, is stunning and breathtaking. You will find yourself losing track of what your doing climbing mountains, walking rivers, exploring jungles and marshes. All on the hunt to find the best resources currently available, with the resources on a randomization system it ensures for hours of gameplay and community emersion.\n\nOur last area was player vs player, this game draws the sandbox genre with a 24/7 pvp is always active aspect, which lands on a mixed playing field. They have done stupendous with balancing it in recent patch's and plans in the future for more, it is promising to make it to launch a very well polished system which we eagerly await. This does however put your structures in danger 24/7 as well, so it challenges you to a level of lurking in the shadows squirling away your gotten gains.\n\nAll things considered, with the modest price tag of 30 dollars, we could not have been more pleased, they offer exactly what they sell. With the activity in development, the patch's being released, constant contact with game staff, we expect to see nothing but outstanding things from this game on its journey to release!\n\nCome help us make a better community for the game that has already given its players so much, http://www.gamizle.com/steam-review/","February 6","true","229.6"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","8","21","0","0"

At the time of writing this I have over 110 hours played in this game. First a little info about my feelings on the previous versions of the game I have played.\n\n\nPRE-ALPHA:\n\nI got Access to Pre-Alpha about 3 days after it was available. I mostly hung out in the teamspeak talking to the other backers as well as Ethan; just to get as much info on the game and the people as I could. In Pre-Alpha there was terraforming and a few models available for building, but not much more than that. I played around with the terraforming and built a few things, but ultimately didn't play much as there were no real features in game to test or play with other then terraforming.\n\n\nALPHA:\n\nFast forward about a year or so and I'm in alpha. Now we are on an all new game engine with better graphics, and a much more streamlined pipeline for development. Many bug fixes at a pace of about 4 patches a week some times more. Multiple new assets to play with, and now we have the survey tool, and general crafting tool to play with. I walked around the bare world looking for resources, and even crafted myself a set of cloths, a hopper, and one harvester just to check things out. At this time there wasn't many people playing, and the world was so empty I just lost interest after a few hours each day, and would go to another game to get my gaming fix on. A few months later Ethan did the ferrocrete tool stream on youtube, and I joined in to see the new features in game, and all the fixes. I wasn't able to get a tool at the time because I forgot to ask for one xD so after that stream I didn't play much more.\n\n\nWEEK TO STEAM LAUNCH:\n\nSo it's about a week before the steam launch and I logged in to see some improvements to the world and bug fixes yata yata, but really not much had changed; so I waited in anticipation of what the launch would bring. Also at this point we stopped being allowed to log in because they where transitioning the game over to steam preparing for the launch.\n\n\nSTEAM EARLY ACCESS LAUNCH:\n\nI started playing day two after the launch and in the week I had been away from game, let me tell you.\n•	COMBAT BABY OH YEAH.\n•	Many guns and ammo types\n•	the quality of resources you use have a HUGE impact on the quality of the item you make. Meaning more health for you walls, better capacity on your harvesters, bigger rang on your power grids and so on.\n•	All human sub species have been made available and working.\n•	Synthetics are working and not glitching out at all.\n•	Skill trees working(not all, but in Alpha there were none really).\n•	The entire world had been revamped and beautified with plants, trees, grass,  a few mobs(glitchy but they were there) and even entire terrain revamps.\n•	hundreds of bug fixes.\n•	at least a hundred new things to craft.\n\nNeedless to say I was excited to test things out.\n\n\nNOW FOR THE GOOD PART:\n\nIt has now been about one week from the launch of Divergence Online Early Access. I have never been more proud to say; that the work done in the last week is above and beyond anyone's expectations.\n•	They have added hundreds of new blue prints to the crafting trees and almost all of the artisan skill tree is working.\n•	 As well as medic and some parts of marksman and they are working on more as I write this.\n•	 They have added 3 new synthetic chassis to the game.\n•	Another hundred or so blue prints to make new items.\n•	 Finished creating all the differences between the races (although some mechanics aren't in game so really health is the big one you can see right now).\n•	At least a hundred or more bug fixes.\n•	An average of about 8 patches a day.\n•	An entire new area of the game has been added.\n•	As well as finishing the rest of the world in terms of adding more resources, trees, rocks, revamped terrain, more mobs(mobs still aren't fully working though), just an all around face lift.\n•	resistances have been added to certain things and more are coming fast.\n\n\nNOW THE BAD:\n\nYou can't have a good review without telling the bad stuff too.  This is beta and as such there are certain things that can be exploited and certain things that bug out and glitch on occasion causing you to have to re-log.\n\n•	Personal factories are a great example of something that take extreme skill to use because you have to do things in the right order and perfectly in order to get it to work(re-logging is almost always required).\n•	Walls do not have resistances yet, and apart from people not being able to damage them by punching; they do take full damage from bullets. This means it take 12 shots from the best gun to destroy you solid steel wall. This makes it difficult to protect your stuff because if someone gets in your base (Rory) and destroys your hopper EVERYTHING goes with it.\n•	Certain commands from Alpha are still in game making it way to easy for people to get around who know about them. This gives an unfair advantage to the people who know about them and are willing to use them. I know them, but choose not to use them because I enjoy exploring to find my resources and not just teleporting to certain areas that have some already.\n•	THIS DOES NOT FALL ON THE GAME DEVS PLATE BUT: Certain people in the current community go around destroying hoppers because they find it funny, and also placing hoppers on resources they don't plan on harvesting, but do it just so other people cannot place their own harvesters.\n•	No way to reset your spawn point and cloners cannot be made yet so when you die you start back in the "Spawn zone" like everyone else and have to make the walk all the way back to where ever you where. This can be good and bad; bad for you, good when you kill an enemy.\n•	The complexity of the game and current lack of tutorials (in game tutorials, there are many on YouTube and the steam forums) make it kind of overwhelming for certain people who don't want to take the hour or so it takes to fully figure everything out.\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nYes there are some bugs, and yes there are some a** hats in game that will try to make you life a living h311. My advice, is to solder on and figure the game out before quitting. Move out of the starting zone and focus on gathering the resources you need for a gun, ammo, hopper, and walls. Use these to build a base and protect your ♥♥♥♥, the more walls the better, make them work to get to your hopper. The hoper only takes three damage from the strongest gun, forcing them to punch it for  over 4,700 times to destroy it. So make the ammo cost unreal with your walls, and you will be safe. Don't like being grifed? Make that gun, and kill the griefer! You can fight back in this game; don't just lay down and take it. I have personally formed a small patrolling alliance of neighbors to protect our area, and its working great. You can also subscribe if you want, for $10.00/month giving you access to the ferrocrete tool as well as an additional 2 play slots. This gives you the ability to play three different characters. Find the resources with one, and then bring the others to the area. If you get killed, log in with one of your other guys and finish the fight ;) . Over all, this game Is very fun, very in-depth, and very, VERY addicting. I would recommend anyone who is not a pixel hugger to buy this game immediately, and get a head start on what is sure to be the greatest MMO of this generation. I hope my review has assisted in your consideration of buying this game, and I hope to see you in game very soon.\n\n\nEDIT: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PEOPLE STOP LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE REVIEWING THIS GAME THAT DONT EVEN HAVE 5 HOURS PLAYED, GOOD OR BAD YOU DONT KNOW ♥♥♥♥ AFTER 1-3 HOURS OF PLAYING A GAME THIS IN-DEPTH. Thank you.\n\n-Sentius Nox, Co-founder of the Tusken Raiders.","January 14","true","172.1"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","8","22","0","2"

For 2 days I was gathering resources to get what I needed to build a weapon, armor and hoppers to then get killed by 2 players which then can loot all my stuff and so my two days I played are wasted just to have to start over again. I wasn’t able to get into building structures or hoppers so I can't say anything about that, but from what I have seen it's cool looking. The Unity game engine looks great too.\n\nI'm sure as the game progresses it will get better with more features then killing each other, but for now after trying the game I would not recommend this game to anyone who wants to get into it for artisans reason unless you like getting killed a lot and losing everything except for your underwear.","January 14","true","69.8"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Micknasty/recommended/422940/","Micknasty","BOOM HEADSHOT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Micknasty/","26 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet me first start by explaining much of the negative feedback I've seen. If you notice, much of the negative feedback comes from players who spent far less than an hour even playing the game. Why does that make the negative reviews unreliable? Because you can't even delve into the game at that point. Chances are those players aren't the archetype required for a Sandbox MMO, and would quit in the first 30 mins of playing a game like EvE Online. They're used to having their hand held through games with maps and directions, and seldom read anything. This game will route out those players fast, but it will reward players who want to experience a true Sandbox, where you make the rules, and you dictate the communties' actions.  So here's a quality review: This game in its infancy has some really nice elements. The crafting tool is great, and starting from scratch makes you humble in the sense that you have to watch your back as you establish XP in your professions. Combat, when you get to that point, feels fluid. However, there are many bugs that can turn away new players, but if you read - it isn't the final product. These guys need backing. I do sometimes feel that combat is seriously out-done by the amount of grinding you have to do when surveying and gathering materials, It sometimes feels like the resources themselves are very far spread out, you will spend a lot of time walking to find the right areas, and even more time clicking "get sample" for a small amount of XP and resource gain. So far that's about 80% of my gameplay. When you do get your first gun, things start getting more spicy. The game needs a good grouping social tool, and some of the crafting and combat bugs can get frustrating, but that's all to be expected within the first weeks of release. The best part, is that the GMs are right there in the game with you, and are willing to talk to you in their Teamspeak. They do, however, encourage you to read the attached guides before asking them questions about how the game works, because the more time they spend explaining how to play the game, the less time theyre focused on server concerns. All in all, I think this has great potential, and thankfully there is a developer out there that knows what a sandbox is all about. If you want your hand held, this game will not be for you.

However, i simply asked in game if theres any advice someone can give a noob and i received plenty of help from other players and mainly the Dev himself who always seems to be online! (or at least a GM). There is now a player guide here on steam to help get you started and some youtube tutorials, i strongly recommend you give them a quick look before leaping in!\n\nOnce you're past the learning curve and come to learn the controls it becomes apparent that this is a world full of potential, you can envisage the NPC's, player built settlements, vehicles, guilds and all the other professions coming into play. But in it's current state Crafting is really the only option open to us, so if you're looking for a MMORPG where you can dance in a cantina for money, or skin animals for hide then check back on this game in a few months and see whats going on. But if you like the Artisan route it's a good laugh mining for resources, building bases and seeing the results of your labours (if you handle the grind), plenty of people always seem up for teaming together to try and build a home of epic proportions.\n\nThis leads me to the community of the game, so far from the people i've met and interacted with i've found a solid base here. No doubt you'll always gets "those few" on games that seem like their only purpose in life is to troll but so far everyone seems helpful and reasonably friendly...  PvP is currently on with no opting out!, so at any time you could be shot or punched, which is worrying sometimes!. But so far i've had ZERO firefights, everyone i've met seems to wanna trade or team up to explore the world.\n\nI've had no problems running this at all with 60 fps and the one week i've been playing i've seen plenty of updates fixing bugs, unlocking new items and skills. To watch a game being worked on as you play it is awesome! (in my humble opinion at least)\n\nAs with any Alpha game, it's a work in progress!. So if you want a fully polished, bug free, complete game with all the trimmings then please wait until release and never buy any alpha!!. Because it is an Alpha i can be forgiving for the lack of beasts to hunt and wildlife in the world, there are many many features yet to be implemented into Divergence but i have complete faith this project will come to full fruition as i see it being worked on everyday i play, and from an outsiders point of view i see very passionate people behind it who want nothing more than to make a fun game that takes the crafting and complexity of SWG and turning it into something new.\n\nI can't wait to watch this game grow and evolve over time!!","January 14","true","45.0"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","5","17","0","0"

I really enjoy it and feel like everyone who's looking for a game that resembles Star Wars Galaxies should definitely give this a shot.\n\nI think the skill system is on point and I like the slow progression that it presents to the players. It's a game that takes dedication and planning on how you want your character to be build due to the limited number of skill points you get in order to level up skills available in different profession trees.\n\nAlso, the surveying and crafting system is amazing. There are a couple of problems here and there with the menus bugging out periodically, but its Alpha. The PvP combat is also very good as well and I like the way the gun system works. I am hoping to see more weapons in the future and can't wait for the mechs to be released into the game.\n\nThe graphics are also very well done, and look good even on the lowest settings which really surprised me. As of right now the options menu isn't really that filled with choices of things to mess with, but of course that will also change in the future so it isn't that bad of a thing.\n\nI think the only thing I really did wish was present in the current state of the game was npcs so training professions involving weapons would be easier to level due to pvp being the only way right now to do that at all.\n\nIn the end, this game is amazing and if your anywhere near the fence on playing this game or thinking about it at all just go for it. It's worth the investment and you will sink many hours of your life into it and love every moment!","January 8","true","46.4"," 12 of 32 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","12","32","0","0"

Having play tested many games reaching back to the EQ days, and having enjoyed SWG immensely, I was drawn to the idea of something similar being developed on an Indie basis.  No small undertaking!\n\nFirst things first...  this is an early access game, and as such, things are not what they will be in the finished game.  If anyone recently went through the early access testing for EQNext, you'll understand.  What is MOST important at this stage is the devs communicating what is being worked on, what features are in the queue and their responsiveness to all of the bits of advice and complaints and wish lists that constantly stream in from the test group.  This is not an easy thing to do but these folks have been marvelous in such things, which brings comfort since it is much more likely they will run the race to the finish and get this thing production ready.\n\nNext, community support is key, and by this, I mean folks in game helping one another as we set out into this "brave new World".  In this, there has been good feedback from the devs and from other players (who actually play!) and help internally from players.  I personally was helped a graet deal and I'm a nobody.  Now, it might be that I just happened to catch a constructive fellow player when I did and I moght not catch one at 5am EST, but then again, I might.  For myself, I have been onm early evening EST and after midnite EST and in all such cases, folks in the game have been responsive.\n\nNext, yes it is true... parts of the game are not developed yet.  So what?  That's what early access to these games means.  Consider yourself a pioneer, blazing new trails, and you can say to some noob later on after launch... "I remember then that whole office complex wa sjust a field"... LOL.  And, to have the access to provide feedback, to help shape the game, to POSITIVELY influence gameplay is priceless.  But, it is also easy to kvetch and moan and groan about things that don't work yet.  Frankly, I can't understand why people would come into early access to complain.  Perhaps they don't understand what it means.  Maybe they think... oh, I can get into this 'early' anbd get a jump on everyone else  and not understand that this is a game in development.\n\nI thought about going off on the negative nellies but decided that it wasn't worth my time.  Instead, I'll point out that developing a game such as this is a HUGE undertaking and the devs put in long hours, and spend a ton of emotional and creative energy to pull something like this together.  Negative BS does nothing to foster the creative process.  On the other hand, positive conmstructive criticism is exactly what is needed, and feedback on what isnt working, ideas on how to make something work well, and things to improve.  Remember, there was plenty to love about the game for which this is a "spiritual successor" and so there is a good template to test up against.  Frankly, the devs ought to know that their work is appreciated and we notice the time invested; after all, WE are investing time too, and while we are not coding, we all who have early access to this game can help shape this world...\n\nSo, I would recommend this game with the clear statement that this is an early access game that is currently under development and the potential is IMMENSE and I can't WAIT to see this in it's finished form...  and guess what, as an early access player, I have a front-row seat, and you can have one too.","February 17","true","10.2"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","3","13","0","0"

This game like it's predecessor SWG is a time sink that takes a large amount of time and dedication. You start off very small and you grow your skill level. It will be extremely hard and sometimes boring in the beginning if you are somebody who needs non stop action.\n\nThe good thing about this game is that it's a new game that is trying to adhere to a lot of standards set by an amazing game. If you want to be part of something amazing and join a great community then this is the place for you. It seems that a lot of people want to try and pick apart the fact that the game is a shell without a lot of content. That's completely true and this should be considered a pre alpha beta. If you think you are buying a complete game then stop and don't purchase. If you want to help have input in this project going forward please consider giving your time, money, and energy to help this project move forward. Also, join the divergence online group on Facebook to hear around the clock feedback from players and developers!

You look at your hands, you're trembling, the sound of gunshots in the distance give you the impression that you probably didn't arrive in paradise.\nThis is the world of Rook, and the essence it captures seems unforgivable at first.\nDivergence Online is definitely what  could be described as a "true sandbox". Your role as a  player, whether you may be Ennie, Terran, or Synthetic, is what defines the experience for not only you, but the rest of the community.\nHere are some highlights that have helped me come to this conclusion.\nVoxel based building brings the opportunity to create custom structures anywhere.\nDestructible environments and open pvp make diplomacy important, but not necessary.\nCrafting is complex, the quality of your materials determine the quality of your product, no more cookie cutter stats.\nAll of these factors have made this game incredibly immersive.\nI would recommend this game to someone who would like to become a part of the foundation of this completely player-run universe by playing Early Access.\n\n\n","January 10","true","86.8"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","5","18","0","0"

The only downside of this game at its current state is that the tutorials have not been programmed into it yet. Search "Ethan Casner" in youtube and you'll find all the basic stuff you need to know about getting started.\n\nThis review is written on the day of the release!\n\nFirst off - Unity. It could look so much better, but for now it's manageable for the eye. FPS is just great, maybe it's due to not too many people being online. Other then that the game is amazing. The potential it has. It's not your regular mine, craft, die loop, but has a very interesting touch to the survival genre. No zombies, no dinosaurs and no medieval scumbags running around.\nThis game has a different approach. You have to scan the ground you stand on to find resources and then pick these up. You carry on to get your basic gear and finally evolve into a massive city if you like that has industrial, residential and other buildings going for you.\n\nI have noticed several bugs in the game, but these are not gamebreakers so far. Also I went off to grab a coffe and a sandwitch and by the time I got back to the game 4 updates were released already. Thats 4 patches in 30 minutes so ... I seriously hope this pace will keep up and this wouldn't be another ditched project.\n\nThe second downside to this is the price. I picked it up on sale for 27 euros, the original price is 37 which is an obvious overkill. If you guys want people to invest their money into even seeing what this game is about, then lower the tag definitely since for 40 quid you can pick up many triple A releases from 2014. Less is more as they say...the lower the price the more people will pay it :)\n\nOther then that, if you have the money BUY the game. Make sure you visit the Youtube channel before that to get the ropes of it since without the tutorials you are literally lost in this world and woul dprobably log off to issue a refund. I assure you this would be a decision you'd regret :)\n\n\nPeace!","January 7","true","23.2"," 39 of 91 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","39","91","2","2"
