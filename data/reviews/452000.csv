The firefly tank looks good when you are sitting on the back, the tracks rotate but they leave no ground marks.Go somewhere where the game doesn\'t want you to go and the tank falls over on its side,it is good natured about it ,lets you back out but its kind of silly.It looks 5 bucks all right visually and its not hard to control or get into the game, not the tank...                                     Its clearly a phone game,foolish  really , but ok if you want to have a  quick 10 minute play before tea or something,everything seems to work but it sure aint a sim....if that doesnt worry you  might like it...\nI often hope  the latest el chepo I have brought will turn out to be another  Alpha Centuri or  Half life alas  this one wont do that..","June 1","false","0.8"," 145 of 162 people (90%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","90","145","162","17","0"
