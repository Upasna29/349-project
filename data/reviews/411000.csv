"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamesear/recommended/411000/","gamesear","Gamesear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamesear/","31 products in account","Sorcery! is a faithful adaptation of Steve Jackson's Fighting Fantasy gamebooks of the same name and much like them it features an astoundingly well realized world filled with plenty of choices to make, monsters to bedazzle, werewolves to duel and mysteries to solve.\n\nThe size of world you get to explore is on first glance rather unimpressive but its actually so chock-full of locations you can potentially visit that there is almost no chance you'll be able to see them all even after a couple of playthroughs, there is just so many of them.\n\nIn a stark contrast to many games out there where NPCs can't wait to backstab you the people you meet in Sorcery! will usually respond to you in kind.\nThe fact that so many people are honest individuals trying to make their living in a harsh world makes the betrayals you experience all the more painful. Would you care if a random bandit you met alongside a road betrayed you? Probably not. On the other hand what would you feel if a poor peasant you helped before sold you out for enough money to keep his family fed for an entire year? Not so easy this time.\n\nIt also helps that the writing in Sorcery! is rather excellent. I don't know if it was lifted from the gamebooks or written by the developers themselves but each character has a unique "voice and tone" despite never speaking a single word and the locations are so well described I couldn't help but to get myself immersed in all of it.\n\nBesides simply talking your way through problems you can always ignore them and walk away or perhaps use your sword arm or even magic to solve them. And speaking of magic, the spell system in Sorcery! is rather tricky, giving you full access to 50 or so incantations each of which have their own specific uses and limitations. Its completely up to you when, how and which spell you will use though be careful not to cause some disastrous effect in the process.\n\nBut once your words fail you and your spells fizzle out you're going to have to rely on good ol' fashioned combat to save the day. As far as presentation goes the combat in Sorcery! is very reminiscent of an excellent DnD session with your DM (or in this case the game) giving you vivid and detailed descriptions of what's going on.\n\nHowever, while the combat presentation is stellar the actual mechanics themselves leave a lot to desire for. The moves your enemies do are almost completely scripted and repeat constantly so all it takes is one death & reload and you will be able to cheese your way through the fight without taking much damage rendering something that should be scary in to a joke.\n\nLuckily you can almost always avoid combat by simply being either charismatic, clever or just downright paranoid and avoiding areas that might look like a trap, which is usually a good idea. It is in these choices that Sorcery! truly excels as a lot of them have far reaching consequences and can drastically alter the very path you take so two playthroughs might look nothing alike.\n\n*** Verdict ***\n\nSorcery! Parts 1 & 2 contain an incredibly well fleshed out world full of realistic characters, interesting locations and plenty of difficult choices to make which come with actual consequences. The combat system might be lackluster but the writing is absolutely top notch and the few issues Sorcery! has can be easily dismissed once you're immersed in to the world.\n\nSo if you're in to narrative focused games and don't mind having very little "real" gameplay then give Sorcery! a try, I for one enjoyed it.\n\nIf you would like a more detailed review of Sorcery! with some pretty pictures to back it up I welcome you to take a look at the video I've done on the topic:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7O7TqUnmas","February 2","true","9.1"," 88 of 96 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","88","96","0","5"

Sure they remind me of my childhood, and therein have a certain weighty sentimental appeal, but they ultimately frustrate me on account of how appallingly arbitrary and ruthlessly trial-and-error they can be.  In spite of this, I got just the tiniest bit excited when I saw this particular product, because, well...ahem...let's try to justify ourselves here...\n\nFirstly, the Sorcery! books were never Fantasy Fantasy books, strictly speaking.  They were more of an off-shoot series authored exclusively by just one of the two FF founders - Mr Steve Jackson - and were an attempt to do something a bit more ambitious and immersive than the FF books.  Secondly, while Tin Man Games have actually done a very good job of faithfully adapting a number of FF books, the fact that this series was being tackled by a completely different company, in a slightly LESS faithful manner, made me think...hmmm, perhaps inkle Ltd have actually eradicated some of the aspects of the ye-olde gamebooks which I've never been so keen on.  So...have they?  Well, kind of.  A little.  But not a whole HECK of a lot, no...\n\nThis is definitely more of a "video game" than the Tin Man adaptations.  It has lovingly-rendered maps, around which you can move a figurine of your adventurer, and combat this time isn't so strictly governed by virtual die-rolls.  The combat system employed by this game is...well, different.  Possibly even a bit more strategic than sheer-and-utter RNG antics, but...not by much.  It still felt pretty random and luck-driven to me; though in all fairness, it's entirely possible that I just didn't "get it" (but hey, at least the illustrations were nice).  Oh, and the spell-casting system is actually pretty nifty, and handled in an atmospheric manner which helps to deliver the player from the potentially "stuffy" realms of interactive fiction, and into the decidedly more "spiffy" realms of modern video-gaming.\n\nThe Sorcery! books were also a tad less guilty of the ultra-linear, anti-backtracking style of FF gamebooking, in which you'd better hope that you fluke the right direction at the three-way T-junction or it's GAME OVER for you, buddy-boy.  Add to this a "rewind" button kindly provided by the devs of this adaptation, allowing you to go back one, two, maybe even three decisions, and I actually managed to get through Part 1 on the FIRST ♥♥♥♥ING TRY.  Perhaps miracles CAN happen, after all?  Alas, by Part 2, we were back to old tricks again, and I managed to die in a spot in which hitting the rewind button just threw me back to the same no-win predicament, not just once, but TWO PLAYTHROUGHS IN A ROW.  The exact same frigging spot, despite me attempting to handle the situation in a different manner both times.  So for the time being, a third attempt is just gonna have to wait...'cause I really don't have the heart to do it all over again so soon.  Nice while it lasted, though, and at least having a number of different "paths" to follow gives it all acceptable replayability (even if all roads do, ultimately, lead to Rome).\n\nSo would I at least recommend this more than the Tin Man adaptations?  Yes.  Slightly.  The Sorcery! books were in all honesty never my favourites when I was young - I was always a tiny bit more partial to Ian Livingstone as a writer, and more "refined" illustrators like Ian McCaig - but this game at least TRIES to rectify some of the shortcomings which these books have always suffered from.  Or, in other words, your chances of actually completing the game are SLIGHTLY improved this time around, and the experience is a tad more digitally immersive.  It's also better value than the Tin Man products, on account of this purchase netting you not one but TWO gamebooks, for the exact same price; and what's more, it's a four-part epic (the last two parts soon to come) in which you can carry on the same character and inventory from one Part to the next.\n\nAn absolute must-buy for all you "gamebook" freaks out there, but I'm not quite sure about everyone else.  Still, a good enough place to start, should one be curious...\n\nVerdict: 8/10.","May 6","true","5.5"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","0"

If you want to experience everything blind (which I highly recommend), stop reading now. If you're not convinced yet, I hope I will be able to change that.\n\nFirst of all, as I already said, all of your choices either matter, or it does a great job to seem like they do. Also, don't be stupid or an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. That's the best advice I can give you. If, let's say, it says the ground is all made out of rock, you can be sure you won't do much by trying to stab your sword into it... Just saying... Not like I tried or anything... Ok, I did, I thought it would have been cool.\n\nSecondly, the combat system is quite unique in the fact that you must try to guess what your enemy's next move will be by reading the description of what you see. Perhaps he looks enraged, or starts moving backwards. It's all essential to determine how much strength you will put in your blow: the more you put, the higher the damage and the higher chance that you will overpower the enemy, meaning you win the round and do the damage. Now, the thing is, the more strength you use, the less you'll have the next round, and you can only replenish it by trying a weak blow or just blocking. This is where the system shines: blocking takes no strength whatsoever and it reduces the damage taken to a minimum. That means that if you don't pay attention to the text when it hints at the enemy trying to block and you use your full strength, not only will you do a small amount of damage, but the low strength next round makes you more exposed to the enemy overpowering you.\n\nNow, you may be wondering: what about the spells? It's called "Sorcery!" for a reason, right? A lot of times during interactions with the world or NPCs you will have the option of "Cast a spell!". How does it work? Well, it's as simple as uniting the stars! No, really, each star has a name and areas where it can be seen and thus used, so you won't be able to cast any spell ever even if you have the materials. Now, you don't need to worry about remembering the full name of the star, just the inital. Using a combination of 3 stars in a specific order, if you have the required stamina/materials, and the stars are available at your current position, you can cast things like ZAP (Lightning bolt), HOT (Fire Ball), FOF (Force Field) and so on. Depending on your situation, especially because stamina is a very important resource (It acts as your health, mana pool, general-being-aliveness), the casting or not of a spell could mean doom or salvation for your brave adventurer.\n\nAlso, yeah, the art style is charming and the writing pretty good, the unique choices allowing you to create your own very awesome story you will get lost in... Untill you run out of that damn stamina and die, of course!\n\nIf I still haven't convinced you, read other reviews better written and which explore other cool parts of this game, I would hate to see you pass out such a wonderful experience.","February 2","true","16.8"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","30","34","0","1"

While I liked 80 Days I think I might have actually preferred Sorcery!\n\nWhat makes Sorcery! a good game is that the story is engaging. The characters, creatures and locales you find in the game are interesting. Sorcery is pretty much a choose your own adventure game. Most of the game involves reading through the story and then making a decision on how you want to proceed. This presents a branching storyline which means you can play through the game a couple times without the game changing each time based on the decision you make.\n\nWhile most of the game involves reading and making choices on how you want to proceed, the game also includes combat and magic. At first I thought the combat was a little slow but it starts to grow on you and it works well with the story telling aspect of the game. The magic elements are pretty good and I really liked that the magic element of the game is really useful in the story elements of the game since it can help you make the right choices in the game.\nSorcery! is not the type of game that is going to be for everyone though. If you don't like to do a lot of reading in your games, Sorcery won't be for you. The game is also on the slower side so if you only like action packed games it is not going to be for you.\n\nIf you are looking for a good interactive choose your own adventure game though I think you will really enjoy Sorcery! Parts One and Two.\n\nNote: I received a review copy of the game from the developer but no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","February 2","true","12.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smat/recommended/411000/","smat","TOG | Optimus BoxCrate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smat/","113 products in account","Product received for free\n\nDisclosure: I tend to play games offline on steam, number of hours does not reflect hours spent.\n\nThere is a particular melancholy to the game, which is inherent in the source. Something particularly british, particularly dark and brooding, and unkind. You could consider the original books better, in a way, because of the pure immersion of imagination via the absence of interface. On the other hand, there is also much mechanical nonsense in the original form that this dispenses with and improves upon, so it is hard to say either is the clear winner.\n\nFor starters, I can't say the Inkle engine, what they're using to deliver this experience, is good. There's no way that a largely 2D, stationary text-based adventure game should consume 100% of every core on your CPU (Check using windows task manager - not a joke!). Sorry guys, but I can't imagine what this thing does to mobile battery life, and there's no way anyone gives a damn whether or not a text-based adventure game is running at a smooth 60 frames per second!\n\nThis is surely a budget production, but in that category it holds up pretty well, with some flaws.\nPros:\n* The fighting mechanics are much better than in the books - it's still a little random, but you can predict or guess at your enemy's attack patterns and play accordingly, to an extent.\n* The rewind functionality is much better than keeping a sticky finger or two on previous pages as per was common practice back in the day with the books. The fact that it is unlimited makes it even better.\n* Swindlestones is a surprisingly interesting and clever game. Mastering it is not hard at all, but figuring out the 'psychology' of your opponents is key.\n* High-resolution delivery of the original artwork is great, and having your character's location on the overworld map makes a lot of sense.\n* Not having to write down everything, being able to refer to notes - fantastic. No one has time for that stuff anymore.\n* Having the map in vague 3D game a nice feeling of immersion to the game.\n\nCons:\n* The difficulty of delivering vertical-form art on a horizontal screen is apparent, and results in the art being not as large or as immersive as it could be. But they didn't have to have the interface get in the way of viewing it!\n* Clunky interface. The way that the text smooth-scrolls upwards and fades in gets nauseous after a while, and simple things like long delays before getting your selection options interfere with fluidity of play, particularly for swindlestones.\n* Poor soundwork. Overall I rate this a C-, as it's infrequent, doesn't really add anything to the game, and in many cases (like the loud 'boom' that happens everytime you cast a spell) is badly balanced. More music would've been appreciated.\n* Poorly-defined mechanics - things are never explained to you properly and you have to figure them out for yourself. There is never Any indication that the arrow keys need to be used for swindlestones, which makes no sense since the rest of the game uses the mouse. When you reload a game, there's no indication that you need to click on your character to continue the journey. The in-fight mechanics weren't explained well and didn't make any sense until I played around with them for a while.\n\nOn the whole, this is a good wrapper around excellent source material, not to seem ungrateful to the developers, because there are many innovations here, and the points which it fails miserably at would be easy to fix. But when it's good, it's good, you can get lost in it for hours without realising it.\n\nAs for the source material, it's interesting to come back to this after ~30 years. It's good if you like dark, dystopic fantasy realms, which seemed to prevail in 1980's england. This is certainly not my cup of tea, mood-wise and nowadays, but the art makes up for it. What makes it a bit pointless, for me, is that every character- even the ones which appear to help you - are in it for themselves and incredibly selfish. It's almost hard to imagine the mindset of the writers. It's just so dark. Part 1 is fine, but short. Not much happens, and you move along, but as far as introductions go, it's good. Part 2 is.. good the first playthrough, and the way it repeats is genius, but after the second playthrough it becomes a little boring. By the third, you're wondering why you have to sit through all the drudgery again. I ended up using a walkthrough, because it's really hard to keep track of all the names and plot points to simply figure out what you're meant to do, and many of the things you're meant to do are almost impossible to just stumble across unless you're incredibly lucky. That's not a good thing, and it's very apparent that by modern standards, the Fighting Fantasy series fails in almost every respect of modern game theory.","May 17","true","0.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

In a brilliant development choice by inkle you can rewind to any previous decision to try out another option without starting the whole book again. Some might say that this renders decisions meaningless, and that's a valid view, although there's nothing stopping you from never using the rewind feature. Personally I think this makes it even more like a true CYOA experience, speaking as someone who kept his thumb in the previous page...\n\nThe presentation is beautiful, laid out like a hand painted boardgame, and the sounds are great, adding to the atmosphere without overpowering or distracting from the text which is obviously the focus.\n\nIf you're a fan of story driven gameplay where decisions have consequences then you should definitely pick this up.\n","February 2","true","5.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game (esp. after Part 1) expands the gamebooks *radically* so that by Part 2 you really sense that it has escaped any of the limits of a paper gamebook and become something truly its own, both in how and what it does for RPGs.\n\nHighly recommended -- a big win for Inkle here -- so happy to see this finally make it to PC.

This is obviously inspired by the original Dungeons and Dragons tabletop game; as someone who has only played D&D once (unsuccessfully) I really enjoyed this game.  The art and story are beautiful.\n\nPros:Incredible art style.  Beautiful hand drawn maps and intriguing drawings throughout\nThe premise is weak, but the journey becomes a captivating tale\nYou set the game’s pace - you can blaze through or meander onwards\nMore on pace, you wait for the game very little.  Menus, dialogues, and transitions are nearly instantaneous\nGreat save system.  I love being able to rewind at any time.  It allows me to be very curious in my decisions.\nCons:The music is far too loud and cannot be adjusted\nThe spell system, it's very difficult for me to find spells that I can actually cast, let alone one that will do some good\nSorcery!'s value proposition is limited.  While the game certainly could be replayed several times there isn’t a lot of content.  This isn’t even the whole game.  At the moment Part 3 costs as much as parts 1&2.  Each part is probably 1-3 hours of play.","June 6","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's interesting to see how situations play out based on your choices, the spell casting is very interesting and can lead to some really cool outcomes.  Unfortunately, to get to the meat of those situations, you frequently have to play a paper/rock/scissors combat minigame that is uninteresting and frustrating.  There's also a lot of inventory and resource management, which is a pain and wastes your time.  Personally, after two hours, I think I'm not willing to continue, and would dissuade people in general from trying this game.  I'd recommend just sitting down with a good book instead, maybe something by Joe Abercrombie.","June 6","false","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you do something foolish or want to change your mind, you can rewind the game to any of your previous decisions.\n\nCombat is simple but satisfying. You and your enemies have an energy bar that you bet on each round. Whoever uses the most points overpowers the enemy for that round and deals damage. If you bet 0, you defend yourself and reduce the damage taken to -1. Each move is described by the narration and each battle feels unique.\n\nKeep in mind this game is mostly text.

I heard a scared "hello" from a small cage in the corner of the room. The owner of the house was in it and explained that she had been locked in by mischievous elves. I agreed to help her out, in the process I tried to use my sword to break the lock and instead bent my sword. I decided to use an unlock spell which did the trick. She jumped out and hugged me excited to be finally free. She gave me a ring that helped me fight better. I asked her if she had any food I could have, she replied, "I'm poor and have nothing to give" as well as gave me a stale look. I said, "okay" and began to leave. However before I exited she decided to turn into a super ugly witch and turn a chair into a large strong goblin. I mercilessly killed the goblin which reverted into wooden fragments. I swiftly left the small house while the witch sobbed over her chipped creation. 10/10","June 3","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a neat concept, and I really like the combat system, actually, which is simple but strategic, but it doesn't feel terribly deep. There are many legitimate choices involved in the game, but it doesn't feel like they ultimately amount to much beyond tools with which to approach later challenges. The ability to replay events that go poorly is nice so as to avoid the need to replay the whole game when something goes wrong, but it takes much of the suspense out of things. The large number of spells (48!) whose names you want to learn in order to use them in battle are ... annoying, at best. I'd rather pull from a simple list than have to choose random letters.\n\nI had a bad taste in my mouth from King of Dragon Pass and this reminds me of it too closely for me to enjoy playing it.

The combat is at least better than dice rolls.  There are issues with writing being either really bad or really good with no in-between. Has a lack of resolution options, control options, and no way to customize font size. Would be the perfect for my 10in windows tablet but font is so small on the flags i'll go blind trying to read them.\n\nLong version - Sometimes the writing is really good and sometimes it's really bad. There is no in-between. Particularly the choice of encounters. Many of them feel incredibly forced as if thrown in for the sake of having something happen but without much thought about the implications or logic of the situation. For example, being accosted by someone who is suspicious of you for having the audacity to travel through his village. A village that's situated on a main road! Not only are they are on a main road and are going to have people passing through their village all the time, but they even have an inn! Obviously there's enough traffic to keep the inn in business. What kind of idiot lives on a main road that has enough travelers to keep an inn in business and then gets super suspicious when a lone traveler passes along the road? Seriously? It's not a natural reaction at all. But just feels forced by the author for the sake of having an encounter when he couldn't come up with anything better. Luckily when the writing is good it's really good, so it balances out somewhat.\n\nThe magic system is okay. Somewhat cheesy in its implementation although it looks nice. The combat is better than dice rolls, so props to them for that, but it doesn't take much skill since there is an optimum technique and once you find it you'll only ever use that which limits variety.\n\nIt would be the perfect thing for my 10 inch windows touch screen tablet, since it would feel even more like reading a book, but since they have no touch screen support (all it would take would be an on screen zoom in and out button since everything else works perfectly) i was forced to play it with a mouse plugged in. There are no graphics options and no way to scale the size of the font, so if you have a small screen then you're going to go blind trying to read the text on the flags. Mainly because of the lack of options and poor choice of encounters I'm giving a thumbs down.  However it has a lot of good points. The presentation is just superb, the art is lovely, and the ambient sounds really help to draw you into the story.","February 5","false","7.0"," 10 of 28 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","10","28","0","0"

The game is really nicely written and reactive. The combat’s all right but you’re best off getting as many magical items you can find to cast spells. There is no manual saves, but it allows to rewind the game back. As I said the game all fell apart for me though on Act 2 at the very end because it actively and permanently punishes you for not doing things that you most likely don't know how to do your first time through without a guide and you're forced to lose health permanently, which you don’t have a lot of. The game doesn’t let you backtrack in the town and there’s so few means to get money that I couldn’t do much of anything, especially as someone trying to be heroic. It’s really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design that really soured me on an otherwise fun experience. I hope they patch it because it’s just unreasonably punishing and unneeded and pretty much forces you to use a walkthrough which is no fun.","February 2","false","4.9"," 25 of 67 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","25","67","0","10"

Combat was meh... story was boring, no sense of exploration, can only cast spells when given the option to. You can rewind the choices you make...sort of...if you come to an area that has multiple paths, you can only choose one, you can rewind, but you cant make a choice, then backtrack to  explore other paths. The reason I have over 12hrs play time is because I couldn't find a way to exit the game, and left it running when I was done playing, eventually had to alt+F4 to quit the game. I really wanted to experience the magic system, since they put alot of work into it, but alot of the spells needed other items to cast, and could not explore to find more.

The battle part of the game seems simple, but there is actually some skill involved which can allow you to win battles you wouldnt think you could. The fly in the ointment, for me anyway, lies in the fact that A) there is no save function in conjunction with B) you get a one step rewind function so you can replay choices that lead to your death or the end of the game. The problem with this is, at times a one step rewind doesnt get you out of the death loop. As an example, at one point, my character ends up in jail. He hadnt done the thing he needed to do to get out, and so the rewind always leads to him being in jail and the game ends no matter what choices I make. This happened several times in different ways, and it is frustrating to have to completely start over for such an arbitrary reason. I really enjoyed the game, but I have no urge to pick it up again because of this isue.\n\nI am going to recommend it, but only if you understand ahead of time that this is an issue. It is truly a tossup whether I recommend, but it is too cool a game not to ...\n\nEDIT: Thanks to a comment below, I noq know that you can rewind further by dragging across the rewind bar...while I wish something in the game would have spelled it out more clearly,  that removes any doubt I had about this game.  Definitely worth owning!","February 19","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Initially I was dissapointed because alot of cool stuff from the book is absent. Although there is a lot of missing content, it turns out that might not be such a bad thing. This game actually expands on Jackson's work, adding MUCH more story, dialouge, encounters, characters, locations, etc. Overall, it is a net gain. There are even more things to see and do in the game version, to the point where you could probably play 3-4 times and not see it all. It is astounding how much content there is.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the story is more fleshed out. There were strange gaps in the original where it seemed like there should be some more plot connecting some of the lore/events. There was also a few issues of choice and consequence, where essentially what you did usually didn't matter too much. Both of these issues were fixed in the game version. Overall, the world feels more real and engaging.\n\nAnother important thing to note is that this game did an excellent job translating the book mechanics to a video game. Instead of the die roll system that was based purely on RNG, the combat system has more to do with skill. It's reasonably realistic, fun, and challenging. It can be kind of easy to cheese, but anything is better than the RNG system from the books.\n\nThe visuals are also stunning. The combat and spellcasting have good animations that are backed up by vivid descriptions. The in game art, such as the world map, is beautiful to look at and occasionally borrows from the books, which old fans like me will appreciate.\n\nThere are also a lot of little details they added which make this game come to life. And in my experience, the little things can make or break a game. In this case, they make it. Here's a quick list:\n-in game inventory system\n-you can choose gender now\n-miniature based on your gender\n-"rewind" system\n-sound affects\n-in game gambling system\n-some of the super punishing and arbitrary sections of the books removed\n\nFinal words:\nThis game basically feels like playing D&D solo with a really good DM. The world of Sorcery! is vibrant, interesting, and full of realistic characters (as Steve Jackson imagined it). I reccomend it for newcomers, as well as for fans of the original books because this version is different enough that the two mediums provide totally different experiences. At the reasonable price of this game, especially on sale, it's a steal. The developers clearly put a lot of love into recreating and improving Sorcery!.","February 8","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am to say the least a little dissapointed of how late it ended up being, and how I was uninformed of it's release despite being subscribed to their emails.\n\nFor a port over to the PC it functions well, but there are no new features different to the mobile version. I am sure I will be playing this on PC despite having several hours on the mobile versions. If you want to play this game casually, I really recommend you get the game on mobile instead of PC, as it is a great passtime for when you are bored, and it is identical to the PC version, if not better.\n\nOverall, I really would recommend this game to anyone, as I am a huge fan of the Sorcery series. They are increadibly fun with the main mechanic of this game being how you can rewind the progress you made in the story to the desired time and experiment which is the best way to go about the situation (getting more items and clues) which is really rewarding. I am absolutely desperate for Sorcery 4 to release (and for sorcery 3 to come to PC), and I have no idea how long that will be.\n\nKeep it up inkle.","February 7","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't expect high end graphics but do expect a great story. Everything you do is a major decision to how the game will progress. Who you talk to, the sequence in which you talk to people, which path you take, how you talk to people, it all matters. The fighting mechanics is interesting, you have to gauge what your opponent will do and figure out how to counter. You're given hints on what to do from the text, which brings me to the text.....theres a lot. Don't get me wrong I'm not complaining; it's really well written, I just didn't expect to read so much. The game has no voice actors instead it's all text, but more graphically active than other text based games like zork. It's crucial to read and understand. This game is actually great for helping people develop critical reading skills. My only problem is that the game is too short, I get that it's based off a book series by Steve Jackson so it probably has limited source material. I actually want to read the books. Anyways, a great game I recommend.","June 3","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I play a game, I feel that for it to be a success, it should be an enjoyable experience rather than a tedious task. Upon playing through Part 2 of this series, it began to feel like the latter. No win scenarios too numerous to keep track of, repetitious backtracking just to grind your way to the next part of the story, and a healthy dosage of vaguery to keep you from figuring out where to head or what to do next.
