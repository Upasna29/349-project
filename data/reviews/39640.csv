"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Curunauth/recommended/39640/","Curunauth","Curunauth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Curunauth/","701 products in account","*Note: this review is based on the GOG version, and is shortened; go there for the full review.*\n\nUnique and Fun: 4/5\n\nAquanox 2 is a strict improvement on the first game, reducing or eliminating most of the irritations of its predecessor, as well as offering more overall polish.\n\n\nVISUALS:\nI thought Aquanox 1 had aged well, thanks in great part to good use of textures; Aquanox 2 is a definite visual upgrade, with everything using more polygons, crisp textures, nicer lighting, and much cleaner effects. The improved sharpness solves the issue of vision being obscured by weapon flare in crowded combats, but clearly seeing torpedoes and weapon trails from 20 ships preserves that great hectic feel. The strong styling of each faction is preserved, and the upgraded models look excellent.\nOne thing I didn't really notice until I returned briefly to the original is that the HUD is *tremendously* improved. Not only is it sharper and more attractive (as the game is designed for higher resolutions), but it is also far more useful.\n\n\nCONTROLS:\nAs before, you have an odd set of 5 degrees of freedom: three axes of linear movement, pitch up and down, and banking (instead of simply yawing [turning] left and right, you roll and pull upward to turn, with a tunable degree of automatic leveling). I guess the rolls make it feel more simulator-y, but the implementation is rough and it interferes with aiming. Aquanox 2 adds an "FPS mode" toggle, but that didn't seem to make circle-strafing more possible. The problematic vertical axis through which you can't rotate (you can never roll or flip so far that the floor is "above" you) is much better here than in the first game - aiming at a moving target above or below you is still a bit rough because the auto-leveler will swing you around, but tracking a target as it passes over or under you is much cleaner than before.\nThe control scheme does take some getting used to, even if you're a veteran of 6DOF games like Descent. As the game progresses, you may find that maneuvering skills adequate for one enemy type are insufficient to defend against new enemies, and you will of course benefit from tuning your movement style to the strengths of your current ship. This means that there is a continuous learning curve to the game, at least on your first playthrough. Due to this, I wouldn't recommend the game to someone looking for quick lightweight simulator fun. That said, the ships generally feel more responsive than those in Aquanox 1, with the caveat that there is more noticeable handling difference between the heavy and light ships than before.\nAlthough there is still a sometimes disappointingly low ceiling, more vertical space is available than before, and vertical positioning has a much stronger tactical role in combat. I found myself using both terrain features and the bodies of capital ships significantly more in this than in it its predecessor, and that really improved the feel of underwater freedom of motion.\n\n\nSTORY/ACTING:\nThis was possibly the biggest downfall of Aquanox 1: the grating voice acting that made me want to murder several wingmen and made me fear their talking more than the wasted effort when I had to replay a level. Thankfully, that has been completely fixed. There is still radio banter between the skipper and your wingmen, but it is always related to the current action, no one has a fingernails-on-chalkboard voice, and the delivery is generally decent. This alone is the single most important improvement in the game.\nThe story is odd but somewhat interesting, and in another vast improvement over Aq1, there are no more droning plot summaries by the protagonist as you travel from area to area. If you want, you can quick-skip any conversation and just jump from battle to battle.\nAll that said, there are still a couple problems. First, the long opening and ending videos, while interesting, seem to have extremely little relation to the plot of the game, but this is a very minor issue. Second, there is a romance sub-plot that will railroad you along a path that has obvious bad consequences.\n\n\nDIFFICULTY:\nAs with Aquanox 1, the unusual controls and wobbly turning may be an issue, but they're acceptable once you get used to them. Again, those used to flight sims will lament the lack of a lead indicator.\nBonus objectives make for an interesting twist on gameplay: although many are merely "find a hidden freighter", a few are rewards for showing extra skill or doing more dangerous things in combat. It is irritating that you are not told what the objectives are, but you are often given hints in radio chatter.\nAs with the previous game, difficulty can vary extensively and there are a few really hard missions. The harder "boss fights" are generally either standalone duels or are front-loaded so that you don't have to repeatedly replay tedious sections only to die at the end. There are a fair number of "protect the Harvester" missions, but even on high difficulty she's a sturdy ship and will generally survive as long as you don't wander away from combat for too long. Sometimes there are critical targets that need to be destroyed in small time windows to achieve protection, but once you get the hang of this, it's not too bad, just challenging. Huge battles can happen without being overwhelming, and the final big battle is a both a great set-piece and a lot of fun.\n\n\nLEVELS, STRATEGY, and OTHER ELEMENTS:\nCompleting bonus objectives will net you some nice loot including some unique upgrades that can really make a difference in some missions, but you can do without them and will have acquired a pretty full complement of weapons by the end of the game no matter what. EMP weapons are more widely used this time (and feel less forced), although don't believe the manual or Fuzzyhead about being able to salvage anything you disable - only specific bonus targets will grant salvage (there are, however, over a dozen such goodie bags). Sparing the lives of several major characters will not only give you a bonus but result in bonus missions later in the game, which I thought was a very nice touch. Early on, EMP may be your strongest weapon against a few high-armor targets, and the second-generation EMP missiles available in the late game can one-shot most enemies.\nI actually used almost every weapon in the game at least several times, as each has a useful tactical role to play, making gun and upgrade load out a nice tactical consideration in addition to your torpedo selection. You only have access to 4 ships in the game, all provided by the plot, but they feel better differentiated than the options in Aq1, and your newest ship is not always the best choice.\nFinally, the replay value is significantly enhanced by a vastly improved "instant action" selection including every game mission (unlocked as you beat them), as well as the provision of 40 save slots.\n\n\nTHE VERDICT:\nAquanox 2 fixed or at least improved on all the aspects that forced me to give its predecessor a 3, and has certainly earned its 4. It could use more work (particularly in tightening up the controls), but it has no glaring flaws left, and it's quite fun once you learn to play well. Different classes of enemy move and behave differently, and thus require different tactics to come out on top (as do large battles vs small dogfights); this really makes the game much richer and keeps you on your toes as the game progresses. I was particularly impressed with the execution of protection missions (so often a source of pain) and the great feel of large-scale battles, and the "boss fights" were never gimmicky find-the-weak-spot puzzle bosses, just extra-tough ships with good pilots and escorts. If you like space combat sims, it would be worth giving a spin for its unique feel.","May 31, 2015","true","0.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","1"

В общем игра неплоха - но к сожалению она не дотягивает до уровня 2 части потому что:\n1) Управляемость и маневренность лодок значительно ухудшилась\n2) Броня ЗНАЧИТЕЛЬНО ухудшена - иногда миссия выигрывается чудом\n3) Океан стал слишком мутным - понятно что вода имеет разные оттенки на разных глубинах - но это разработчики упустили\n4) САМОЕ УЖАСТНОЕ - количество лодок - в 1 части мы видели более 10 разновидностей со своими нюансами, здесь лодок всего 4 - получаются все строго по сюжету и ничем они не отличаются кроме скорости и времени смерти (+ 0.9 сек под мощным огнём)\n5) слишком много скрытых объектов в миссиях и плохая балансировка - иногда проигрываешь только потому что пропустил кого-то мелкого а тот расковырял защищаемый объект\n6) слишком мало торпед с собой и плохая наводимость некоторых спец-пушек ("Гидра")\n7) Мало боссов и они не к месту - не ждите эпической драки в конце эпизода\n8) некоторые типы пушек крайне бесполезны для игрока но почему-то для АI они самое оно - выгребаете вы просто жутко больно\nВ общем если вам понравился AquaNox берите и эту часть. Игра довольно долгая - но диалоги теперь имеют титровку так что читать удобно. Лодка теперь поменялась - у нас теперь есть броня разного борта как в Privateer так что если вам почти пробили лоб - готовтесь отступать (если есть хороший рем.бот) или переигрывать миссию (если это начало). Значительно улучшили города - теперь диалоги более живые - так видно обстановку где Вильям Дрейк разговаривает.\nНо боевая модель значительно пострадала - теперь бои крайне сложны из-за плохой управляемости и малой прочности + некоторые пушки по эффекту хороши - но практике косят так что смешно. Так что перед заданием Обязательно сохранитесь.\n\nВердикт - игра хороша но многое из хорошего 1 части было вырезано и миссии так и не поправили.\n\nSo we have continue of AquaNox's underwater sub-fighter simulator. In general - good, but it isn't so good as AquaNox 2 must be, because:\n1) Maneuvering and controls of subs become very bad\n2) Armor significantly REDUCED - sometimes win in mission are miracle itself\n3) Ocean became very foggy - i understand that water isn't same colour in different depths - but devs ignored that\n4) BADDEST THING - number of subs - in AquaNox we have more then 10 different types (and they aren't similar) - here only 4 strictly by storyline and only difference is speed of movement and death (max armored + 0.9 sec under heavy fire)\n5) too many hidden objects in missions and balance of missions is bad - sometimes loose because you didn't noticed some small enemy in hard fight and it destroyed clue object\n6) very few torpedos in sub and bad locking of some special guns\n7) Few bosses and they aren't in good story points - so don't expect of boss at the end of episode\n8) some guns are pretty useless for player - but EXTREMELY good for AI - it drops rain of fire to you nad it's really dangerous\nIn general if you liked AquaNox better to take AquaNox 2. The game is long - but dialogs now have subtitles so now it is easy and good to read them. Sub has been changed now we have 4 sided armor like in Privateer - so if enemy almost penetrate your front armor plating get ready to retreat (if you have good repair module) or restart mission (the beggining). Cities were updated very good - dialogues now more meeting like - cause now you see atmosphere when William Drake is talking. But combat model become awful because to control sub now is very hard and it has very low survivalibility + some guns have very good effects but they are missing to hit targets oftenly (very annoying). So before mission - SAVE.\n\nVerdict - game is good but too much good from AquaNox were cutted and misions weren't fixed properly.\n","December 21, 2014","true","0.2"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","14","24","2","0"

If Aquanox didn't ♥♥♥♥ you off with the terrible control, high difficulty and terrible combat controls, congrats! that’s improved...a little.  What you get in exchange for that small improvement is a terrible story on a level which is hard to convey, including being stuck with a pirate crew who talks in nothing but innuendo and vague side stepping.  You play a protagonist so stupid and naive that he is attacked by one of his own crew because he would not have sex with her, despite her telling him that’s what she wanted with language that even a child would really is something "naughty".  So enjoy your trip to nowhere with an insane crew searching for a McGuffin so absurd that it can't exist even in the game world!  And to think the most sane member of the crew is the cannibal...\n\nSend this game to your enemies and relatives you hate.","February 4, 2014","false","7.9"," 8 of 38 people (21%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","21","8","38","2","0"

The first installment of the series is just phenomenal.\n\nThis one tho did not took my attention. The gameplay mechanics are improved aswell as the graphics.\n\nThe storyline is not so compelling, the story is somehow blurred within the situation with the first game. I did not finish the game yet...\n\nIt brings me back to my young years\nStill worth it.","February 26, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also the HUD is not in your face like a lot of space games have.\nControls perfectly with the mouse and keyboard however I did need to screw around in the options menu to get certain things working properly.\nThe main character is nowhere as good when compared to the charismatic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from the first game. Later on, his character does improve. Just like the first game you will meet a "colorful" cast of people which throw in a blade runner feel underwater.\nThe screenshots on the steam page don't do this game justice, the graphics are decent for an aged game and you explore everything from underwater volcanos to vast cities.\n\n\nGreatly recommended for the story and gameplay.","May 29","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
