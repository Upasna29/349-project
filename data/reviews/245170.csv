You have not been misinformed. Just go ahead and buy it now if that's what you're here for. I'll be here, making disapproving faces at my computer and pretending you can see me.\n\nI've been told Skullgirls is one of the most technical fighting games to exist. A goodly few of the mechanics were designed in part by fighter champion Mike "Mike Z" Zaimont. As a salty casual who can't beat the tutorial but still makes a ham-fisted attempt at playing anyway, I know I've only scratched the surface of what can be done with this game (a process akin to scratching the surface of the moon). I've seen videos of high-level play, and it is astonishing. So if you're somebody who can decipher the phrase "qc.P+P -> a.HK -> dp" you'll find a lot to love here. If you can't, that's no reason not to buy this game. The combat is fun and engaging even if you can't explain to your friends what's happening in absurdly small acronyms.\n\nSkullgirls has 13 playable characters, each with their own engrossing story modes and unique playstyles (up from 9 in the wake of a devastatingly successful Indiegogo campaign). At least 2 more characters are still on the way. If you grab them fresh out of the oven, they're free, too! But don't burn your hand. Then you won't be able to play Skullgirls, and that would be unfortunate.","October 25, 2014","true","14.3"," 644 of 690 people (93%) found this review helpful 127 people found this review funny","93","644","690","127","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Panda_Waifu/recommended/245170/","Panda_Waifu","Panda Waifu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Panda_Waifu/","1167 products in account","Review For Skullgirls PC Review by : Panda Waifu & Meguca 2.0\n\nPros : - Great animations\n- Incredible artstyle\n- Lovely music\n- Very good value for the money\n- Mechanically impressive\n\nCons : - Weak keyboard controls (Gamepad recommended)\n- Multiplayer is unforgiving for newcomers\n- Really hard to master\n\nReview :Skullgirls is a game full of things to love, which can all be appreciated on their own, which all come together to make a unique experience.\n\nFirst, the visuals:\nSkullgirls is easily one of the most visually impressive games you'll ever play. Every single animation is drawn in incredible detail, everything looking extremely smooth and natural. It is worth playing almost for the visuals alone.\n\nNext, the controls: Keyboard controls are done well, but a controller is highly recommended for anyone who wants to fully explore this game, and the abundant movelists, combos, and other features. The tutorials are also far better suited for preparing a player using a controller, rather than a keyboard.\n\nIf you're a veteran at fighting games, you'll be pleased at how 'technically' impressive Skullgirls is, allowing for a ton of ways to chain attacks, get massive combos and feel in control. Players who are newer to fighters don't have to worry, there is a tutorial covering a massive amount of game mechanics, and the movelists are easy to understand. As always with fighter games, it can be quite relentless to try and get to high skill levels and pull off every move and mechanic with ease, it does take a lot of practice.\n\nFor casual players and veterans alike, there's a ton to enjoy. Story mode covers a pretty cool plot, each character's story really helps to flesh them out and make them feel a bit more alive. You fight your way through a series of matches, a few adding a bit to the story through pre-fight dialog, until you reach a pretty challening final boss where you conclude that character's story. There is a variety of difficulty options available, making it accessible to both beginner and hardcore players.\n\nThe character roster is relatively limited, with 8 Fighters being available in the base game, and 4 added DLC fighters (and a Hidden one) available through DLC. It is worth mentioning that if you own the base game upon a DLC's release, it is available for free for a significantly long time. Otherwise, you have to buy the DLCs separately. This can be quite a turn-off for some players, but given the depth of each character it is more than enough to get a ton of enjoyment out of Skullgirls.\n\nGameplay wise, every character has a variety of moves. There are light, medium and heavy punches and kicks (varying in range, damage, speed, etc on each character) as well as specials, crouched attacks, jumping attacks, and all the other things common to all fighters. Every character has varying difficulties, making them better or worse for less skilled players. A newcomer can likely buttonmash their way through a few PVP matches or the story mode, but on higher difficulties or vs someone who is skilled at fighters will be a brick wall to that strategy.\n\nFor many players, the multiplayer is the most important part. From a technical standpoint, the multiplayer was done well and can provide a lag-free environment to anyone who wants to get into it. The community isn't HUGE, but there's always players to face, but as a word of warning, most players you encounter online are very skilled. It can be near impossible to get into as a newcomer to fighters or to Skullgirls. For this reason I do recommend playing this game locally if possible.\n\nIn conclusion :Every moment is enjoyable with the beautiful animation and artstyle, there's a challenge to be found if you're looking for one, and there's a casual, enjoyable experience for those who just want to appreciate the art, voice acting and story.\nAnd for those reaons I'm giving this game a recommendation!\n\nPlatforms : PC, Xbox360, Playstation 3.\nDeveloper: Lab Zero Games.\nGenre: Action, Indie\nPublisher: MarvelousAQL.\nRelease Date: 22 Aug, 2013.\nWebsite : http://skullgirls.com/\n\nFollow my Curator page : http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/\nAlways do more research than just reading a review, to ensure that you get the right product.\nThanks for reading!","January 24, 2015","true","38.5"," 564 of 608 people (93%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","93","564","608","29","13"

To put it shortly, despite the lack in numbers every character feels different from one another.\n\nThis game has best tutorial I've ever seen in a fighting game. It doesn't just show you which buttons do what, this tutorial will explain you every little thing about how this game works and how each character plays and when you're done, there's still a lot of space for creativity and improvement.\n\nStory mode is... fine. I'm honestly not a big fan of it, story itself is quite predictable and largely based on one or two standard tropes that many fighting games use. Final boss felt a bit disappointing for me but it's kind of a hit or miss situation. Some will like that there's a special character that is very different from anyone else in a very fundamental way but I personally prefer when at the end you face just a character from the roster like everyone else you've been fighting before. Also at the time I was beating the game it seemed like the only way to beat the boss on higher difficulties was to just cheese her out and that's not really fun in my opinion but it was some time ago and by now people probably got much better at the game and found out other, more interesting ways to beat the boss.\n\nMultiplayer... I wish I could say something about it but I only managed to play it once with some guy from Australia (and I live on the edge between Europe and Asia) with both of us having ping over 150 or something like that... not exactly enjoyable expirience (though i have to say lag compensation was rather nice even in that dire situation) but it was the only expirience avaliable at the time. I recommend you check out something like steam charts if you buy this game for multiplayer, and check if you have some sort of community for this game in your area.\n\nVisuals and sound are very good. Background music is not distracting and yet very charming, reminds me of something Yoko Kanno would've composed but it still sound quite unique and recognisable. Animation and art is beautiful and smooth, yeah there are boobs and butts but they offend as much as Switzerland. There are plently of stages and all of them look amazing. Game looks and sounds very good, period.\n\nAnd to finish it off, gameplay and controls. They are both very, very solid. I use a fight stick and it works like a charm, as it should,  obviously. Keyboard is also fine though, it's much harder for me to play on keyboard, but I don't see why you wouldn't be able to get good results with it after some practice, though I have to say fight stick is real sweet. Game mechanics are way beyond what you would expect from an indie dev, gameplay feels very polished and refined, every time I lost I knew that it was my fault and what that fault was and that's a big deal in any game.\n\nSo yeah, this game is good, I liked it, pros overwhelm cons and I wish this game sells even better so there would be more people to play with.","April 23, 2014","true","7.3"," 289 of 302 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","289","302","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/245170/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Every now and then, a game comes along that truly deserves to be called capital-g Great. I don’t mean a game that’s merely fun, or entertaining, or even aesthetically beautiful – all great things, but no single aspect of which would nudge a title beyond the level of “good”. I’m talking about a game that manages to mix a creative, imaginative world filled with original, memorable characters, equipped with polished gameplay, and to pull it all off with an expert craftsman’s level of skill and attention to detail – including literally thousands of frames of character animation. Skullgirls is a traditional close-combat fighting game that manages to bring all of this to the table. If you are a fan of 2D fighting games who has yet to add Skullgirls to your library, you owe it to yourself to rectify this situation as soon as possible. It would be a deal at twice the price.\n\nNow, I’ve enjoyed fighting games since the days of King of Fighters and Street Fighter II – but outside of casually decking friends in Soul Calibur, the fact is I’ve never been particularly enamored with the genre for the gameplay’s sake, or even very good at the games. What’s always drawn me in, believe it or not, is the story and the personalities. Sure, the actual plots are typically paper-thin, cotton candy fluff – the Heihachi family’s internal squabbles in Tekken, the Orochi power in King of Fighters… it’s all silly stuff even (perhaps especially) when it tries to be serious, and it mostly serves as a backdrop to create fun, creative characters and personalities.\n\nThe setting of Skullgirls stands out even alongside the crazier, Guilty Gear variety of bizarre worlds, setting itself in the fictional Canopy Kingdom – a cartoony environment most reminiscent of the art deco designed 1940s, dominated by crime, strange creatures, and hybrids of technology and magic. Even before you get to the actual character storylines in Skullgirls, the visuals it presents you with – a mix of black, gold, neon and film reel decorations – is enough to make it incredibly distinct, as if someone took the setting of the original Bioshock and decided to make it all ten times more cartoony, and about a quarter as serious.\n\nAs for the plot itself, Skullgirls provides a situation reminiscent of most fighting game contexts: every seven years, a living artifact known as the Skull Heart offers to grant the wish of one woman. But if the wisher has an impure soul, she’ll instead be transformed into a powerful, monstrous Skullgirl – leading her to terrorize and wreak havoc over the world. A young girl named Marie has made her wish and apparently been found unworthy, leading various characters to set their sights on her, each with their own motives – some seeking to simply bring her assault to an end, while others are after the power of the Skull Heart for themselves. In Story mode, you’ll select one of these eight characters (with five more either available or on the way via DLC) and follow their journey, learning about their histories and their motivations along the way via beautifully drawn cutscenes and dialogue – but mostly, you’ll spend your time kicking ♥♥♥ in straight up frantic combo-chaining, guard-breaking style.\n\nBut before you even throw punch one, you’d do well to encounter the first feature that really makes Skullgirls shine – the tutorial mode. While it may sound odd to heap praise on what sounds like the most bog-standard addition to any game, let me emphasize: what sets Skullgirls apart on this front is the sheer depth of the tutorials. Let’s face it – fighting games are complicated, and despite having played many of them for so many years, I’d be lying if said I understood half of the fundamental mechanics that were at work in more serious matches. Here, things are different. Rather than simply cutting the player loose to understand the mechanics of the game on their own, or hunt details up online, the tutorials walk you through everything from the most basic low-medium-high punch/kink button layout, right down to throws, combo chaining, cancels, and even the ins and outs of each of the individual characters’ styles and moves.\n\nBut what really makes Skullgirls shine above all else is the sheer effort that has gone into the polishing of all of its audio-visual aspects. The soundtrack is actually something to stand up and take notice of, being a collection of largely-jazzy tunes that do a good job of fitting the fantasy-1940s setting of the Canopy Kingdom. Character voices are crisp, clear and distinctive, adding a whole lot of personality to the Skullgirls themselves. But it’s the art and animation that is truly breath-taking, in more ways than one.\n\nSo here’s where we’re at when all is said and done: a fighting game set in a gloriously original world, racked out with unique characters whose hand drawn animations are stunningly detailed and comprehensive. The soundtrack of the game is – at least for jazz fans – beautiful enough to warrant an OST purchase all on its own. The graphical presentation is phenomenal, the story mode is entertaining, the characters are unique and engaging as a whole. There’s a comprehensive in-game tutorial available for the game’s mechanics in general, and each character in particular. There’s DLC coming, there’s online and local matchups available, there are achievements and alt colors to unlock… and on top of all of this, the whole package is available for $14.99, or even less if you buy a multi-pack with a friend or three.\n\nThe only real downsides to speak of is some highlights of sex appeal that may turn off some players, the frank necessity to own a controller to truly enjoy the game, and the fierce competition players will face in online versus play. Those are some incredible positives, and very forgivable negatives.\n\nAs it stands, this very likely is the best PC fighting game available, period – and doubly so for the money. And not only that, but buying the game gives you access to the Skullgirls Beta, so you can test out changes in advance of their going live in the game proper. If you’re a fighting game fan, what more do you want?","April 24, 2014","true","322.0"," 250 of 269 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","250","269","0","0"

Apologies as it's mediocre and I'm not good at reviews)\n\nPLEASE READ!!!\nI'm a Christian mom and I found my son playing this game and was extremely disappointed in him :(((. He was kicking, hitting, and doing all sorts of devilish nonsense. There was even a character with the F-word as her name (Which he was playing as)!\n\nSo I did the right thing any normal mother would do. I grounded him and told him why he's not allowed to play Fukua: because she is a ♥♥♥♥ing OP character who needs to be nerfed. Skullgirls is the dankest ♥♥♥♥ ever and he's sitting here being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ playing bad characters that don't require skill. That little ♥♥♥♥♥ needs to catch up on his combo skills because I own his ♥♥♥ everytime as Filia (The REAL Filia, not that stupid green thing). Please spread this around and do the right thing by teaching your kids to play real Skullgirls that require skill and don't rely on BS. 1 like = 1 prayer.\n\nthis is a satire review, im not actually a christian mom. im some nerd who plays vidya gaims. serious review below\n\nFirst Impressions\nSo I've never played a fighting game that uses 6 buttons and a stick (I don't know what that's called) or any fighting game so I was going into Skullgirls blind. I didn't have any interest in this game or genre before I saw my friends playing it. I was facisnated by the animations, graphics, and how smooth it looked. The first time I played it I chose Valentine and mashed buttons on a PS3 controller not caring for blockbusters, blocking, or combos; I was having too much fun even without knowing a lot of the game's functions.\n\nGameplay\nAs I mentioned before, I don't own a controller or 6 button gamepad, so I play with a keyboard.\nWhile the game may play a lot better on a controller, I found it very easy to play with a keyboard. The learning curve isn't that hard making it very easy for a newbie like me to get into. Any newcomers to a fighting game scene could learn how to play this game very easily, every move and blockbuster is just as easy to do on a keyboard as it is as controller. Skullgirls doesn't have a lot of characters to choose from, but all of those characters have unique playstyles that can go from fast light-hitting, quick aerial combat, to slow but powerful heavy-damaging. But all characters have light, medium, and heavy attacks but some characters are more attuned to a certain playstyle. And every character has unique blockbusters that can turn the tides of a fight when used properly along with combos. Combos can go on for quite some time, but they aren't infinite. Infinity breakers come in to play from what I could tell when the combo gets sloppy or slows down, giving you time to breath. Blocking, parrying, grabbing, armor, etc. are all also in the game can be used to your advantage but can be countered to an extent. Overall the game has very solid gameplay and I would recommened it to both newcomers and veterans to this genre.\n\nGraphics\nThe game looks great with an anime-esque draw style where every frame is edited perfectly to make it look as smooth as possible. The game also runs great, there's no drops in framerate anywhere to be seen and it looks amazing. All the characters look great, in both a sexy and badass way. The designs of the characters influence how they fight and look. Filia has a parasite on her head (Samson) and uses him as a way of combat. Big Band uses a variety of instruments, Valentine a bunch of medical things, and etc. It's worth playing a character just for their aesthetic. it's also nice to look at their boobs\n\nOverall\nThe game is great, it's a solid fighting game with a great diverse cast that can do different things. The addition of more characters is really great. The price tag of 15 bucks is really fair and on sale it's a must buy. Anyone can get into this game no matter how they view the genre. Skullgirls is an amazing game, and you should get it and play it.","September 30, 2014","true","46.9"," 476 of 647 people (74%) found this review helpful 75 people found this review funny","74","476","647","75","24"

Also there might be a game somewhere, whatever buy it anyways.\n\n(Ok seriously serious review)\n\nSkullgirls is fun. Characters are all generally easy to learn, hard to master. Control are really well optimized for any kind of controller such as keyboards, SNES controllers, Sega Genesis controllers, Power Glove, and even a NERF gun! Tutorials are verywell fleshed out, but it's easy to say some are pretty darn hard, (Looking at air combos) but once you try one of every lesson (even if you fail miserably) you'll learn something, and that's ok.\n\nThe most negativity comes with the multiplayer in Skullgirls. Casul players CAN have fun, but quick matches quikly lead to 100 hit combo's with resets, or someone who has no idea how to play, just like you (or if you're a pro, cannon fodder). Most bad reviews come from salty players who didn't get 999 hit combos the first time they played. Multiplayer can be fun with friends, and lobbies are sometimes fun if trolls don't join casual lobbies and eat you.\n\nStory, art style, and technical stuff in this game is very very well done. Controls are tight and responsive, and the community probably won't skin you alive when you eat questions (but seriously people are really cool here, I swear!). Overall, if you're a filthy casual like me, join me in the glorious ocean of salt and Fukua. If you're a pro  stop playing ♥♥♥♥ing Fukua or I will find where you live  buy this game as well, I can assure you it's fun and easy to get into  PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS GAME FUKUA HAS ALREADY TAKEN MY CHILDREN and I would reccomend it for all people who are fans of fighting games and/or fanservice.\n\nAlso Fukua likes to eat your salty tears in online if you didn't know.\n\n9/10 -IGN         (Minus one for salt)","December 28, 2014","true","47.8"," 167 of 211 people (79%) found this review helpful 178 people found this review funny","79","167","211","178","2"

It's a must buy if you're interested in getting more serious about fighting games and a blast for playing casually with friends.\n\nDespite never having played a 2d fighter beyond a really casual level, (although I do have a small competitive Smash Bros. background) it was very easy getting into the deeper parts of fighting games. The in-game tutorial gives a very good starting point. It explains basic and more advanced fighting game concepts and beyond that, there are brilliant guides and helpful individuals at skullheart.com, the dedicated forums.\n\nThe cast, albeit small, is intriguing and diverse, ranging from an amnesiac schoolgirl and her hairy parasite to a little girl-turned-cyborg wielding weaponry inspired by old cartoons. and soon, a saxophone man, dropping the beat on his opponents. The currently 9 characters have more than enough charm to make up for their lack in numbers, but there are 4 more characters (the sax-man Big Band, the egyptian songstress Eliza, the wrestler Beowulf and his trusty chair, and the enigmatic robotic version of Ms. Fortune) to be released over the following year that each have a free-to-download period thanks to the Indiegogo campain. And even after that, there is a sheer limitless character pool of astounding variety in the mind of the universe's creator.\n\nThe gameplay is fast and offers a vast amount of tools to be creative with your combos. No character plays like the other while the roster in it's entirety is incredibly well balanced. You can choose between fighting as one strong, two medium or three weak characters, allowing you to employ a variety of tactics and easing you into a team-based fighting style, should you be interested in such. The community and the developers have a great deal of interaction. This, along with the often updated beta version allow for fine-tuning and steady improvement of the already great underlying systems.\n\nNo matter how much you are interested in fighting game, Skullgirls is a great place to start, and a great place to stay!","November 16, 2013","true","951.9"," 92 of 104 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","92","104","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/245170/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Skullgirls is a 2D arcade action fighting game released on the PC in August 2013. The game was originally released on the consoles in 2012 and had great success.\n\nSkullgirls differs from the fighting games that we have lately, in that you can actually fight in teams of two or three, as well as the single sided matches.  All of the rules are the same as usual, however in team matches, the team which has the most health when adding them all together wins in the event of the time running out.  Each of the characters have a wide array of move sets to learn, and combos. Some of the special attacks are just amazing to watch. The animations on all of the characters is absolutely flawless.\n\nSince Skullgirls focuses a lot on the team matches, that means you are going to get plenty of double teams and dirty tricks being played by "non active" characters, and even hyper combos.\n\nAll of the environments that you fight in are absolutely stunning as well. Even though they are pre-rendered, they are presented in a stunning art style which fits right in with the game. I would of liked to have seen maybe a little environment interactivity, but I guess you can't ask for everything.\n\nThe story mode in Skullgirls isn't all that brilliant. It is extremely short, and you can blast through the story mode on any character in under 20 minutes if you try.  Yes you get the story and plot out of it, but all of the battles are the same each time you play and there is no varying. This is easily the shortest fighting game story mode I have played.\n\nSound effects and sound track really are done well in Skullgirls. They are certainly way above par in the fighting genre.  You can actually. The sound track is amazing - you can purchase it separately here https://skullgirls.com/media/music/ if you are into that kind of thing as well.\n\nSkullgirls has varying levels of difficulty in the regular, normal, easy and hard modes. Certainly steer clear from easy mode as it offers no challenge at all. I really couldn't keep up hard mode even on the story mode. There is also a couple of other modes to play in too - the normal arcade mode and versus mode. This game also has a very good tutorial which introduces all of the elements and some of the combos for your characters.\n\nLike I said, you can finish the story mode on a single player mode in under twenty minutes. Of course you can replay it with all of the characters which is about seven or eight (not including the DLC), which is in my opinion a bit low. Where you are going to get your mileage out of Skullgirls is in the arcade mode and in the multiplayer mode.  I have spent about 6 hours playing online (mostly getting my self owned over and over again), and I am having a blast playing. This is easily the best multiplayer fighter I've played in a while.\n\nI really strongly recommend Skullgirls, just off the pure fact that it is highly addictive to play, and you can pick up and play so easily. The inclusion of a well put together tutorial and combo system makes this game head and shoulders above most other fighting games of this type.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It has one of the most interesting styles ever, while you might initially be turned off by the idea of an "all girl roster fighting game" (Hint: Its not! There are, surprisingly, male characters! And they are totally playable! As DLC. In the future. But it'll be free!). Yes, there are some use of sexuality in terms of presenting some of the characters, but that's only some of the characters. They are, more or less, inspired by other games, shows, and animes while giving its own unique little touch that makes them different.\n\nEg. Double, who is a shapeless blob that devours other characters to gain their abilities. If you ever wanted to play all of the characters at once, she(?) will be your go to gal!\n\nPeacock, who takes all of our lovable American (COUGH I'M A CANADIAN SPY) cartoons and rolls them up into her own merry band of comedy inducing friends and throws out destruction.\n\nDid I mention they all actually play differently? TAKE THAT, RYU, KEN, DAN, EVIL RYU, AKUMA, ONI, SAKURA,  ETC ETC ETC. HOLY CRAP, MORE HADOUKENS!!!\n\nThe animation and art for each character is beautiful and smooth, as if it has its own life. The stage is brimming with life with its background characters doing their own thing. The gameplay is deep, and the tutorial is really well done. You can select your team format for a 1v1, 1v2, 1v3, 2v1, 2v2, 2v3, etc. The soundtrack is awesome. Each character has their own little quips for different characters, so you won't hear Injustice's Batman only say "STAY DOWN" as his only victory line in here. Did I mention the soundtrack is awesome? Cuz if I didn't, its awesome. That, and the animation. I think I mentioned that too.\n\nThe only thing I'd say thats bad is that if you don't have a controller or fightstick, you'll have a hard time playing this on only a keyboard. So if you have a fightstick or a 360 controller, you'll have a grand time. If you have a PS3 controller, I recommend using an emulation program, such as MotionJoy, to emulate a 360 controller.","August 23, 2013","true","5.1"," 123 of 152 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","123","152","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CereVersa/recommended/245170/","CereVersa","d4m3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CereVersa/","325 products in account","This is a review, that you should take to heart and shall help you to either decide to buy the game or not.\nI love this game, if you couldn't tell. I play this game on a daily basis for 2 up to 5 hours a day and I will not get sick of it. I enjoy every second of it. From the music and stages, characters and their stories, up to the developers and voiceactors themselves; I just say, that I fell in love with this game. Of course, there are some flaws in this game, that I want to say in this review, so please, if you are not sure if this game is for you, then I hope, that I'll be able to help you.\n\nThe Game:\nThe game itself is basically what you get, when you throw Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and your favorite anime waifu in a pot and mix it all together. It's a 2D Fighting Game with it's own certain mechanics and finally; Smooth 60 FPS. It is usually played with a Fighting/Arcade Stick, (Depends of how you call it) but on steam, you can play it with the Keyboard, XBox or Playstation controller... The choices are yours and yours only. If you prefer the Keyboard over the controller, go ahead.\n\nThe Characters\nThe Game has a selection of 14 characters, everyone of them with their own unique playstyle. As the title says, there are mostly only female characters. I repeat; mostly. With the exception of two characters, who are male, (Three, if you count Robo-Fortune as genderless) the rest of them are all female, but that does not matter. They all also have their own individual stories, which I like to tell you now.\n\nThe Story/Stories\nThe Story goes like this;\nA mystic artifact known as the Skullheart has been created since multiple decades. It's power was to grant any girl's wish, if they were pure in the heart, but most of them weren't. If they were not, they turned into a creature, called the "Skullgirl", who brought chaos, death and armageddon to a teaparty to wreck her surroundings. If the Skullheart got destroyed however, it will come back 7 years later to find a new victim and the cycle goes on and on and on... Until year HellIfIKnow, where the new Skullgirls "Bloody Marie" has risen and brings havoc to New Meridian.\n\nThe character's stories are fixed and cannot be changed, whether you like it or not. Why am I telling you this? The stories of many characters end dramatically, sometimes death is included, which can be hard hitting for you, if you have a strong bound to your favorite character. I'm sorry, Squigly :c I will not tell how their story goes onward from that point, you will either have to watch a walkthrough on youtube or play the game by yourself.\n\nGameplay\nNow, the gameplay is depending of what you play with. For me; I currently play with the keyboard and I improved with time. It however is definitely best played with the Fighting/Arcade Stick, so if you have one, you probably have it easy.\n\nMultiplayer\nThis is where you have to admit; Multiplayer in this game sucks ONLY if you play with people, that you don't know. Joining a random lobby in Skullgirls will be the bane of your life, eventually making you stop playing the game even. Believe me, when I say this; You will not like the random lobbies in Skullgirls. You will get literally ♥♥♥♥ed over and over, if you started playing the game. It is recommended to get a few friends to play this game and you probably get better in it. I still stuck at it tho.\n\nMy Judgement of "Skullgirls"This game is considered in my eyes a great game, that I refuse to actually let go from. I am a Skullgirls-Addict with 150 Hours, but the hours will rise higher and higher the more often I boot it up. It is funny, you get in the mood to play it more and more, you want to learn to become better in it until you want to become the best in Skullgirls.\n\nSkullgirls gets a 8 out of 10\n\nTL;DR: Good Game, stay away from multiplayer, if you have no friends.\n\nThanks to To LabZeroGames for Skullgirls and MikeZ for keeping the community uplightened and for that awesome Soviet Announcer <3","November 13, 2015","true","202.0"," 79 of 91 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","79","91","6","2"

While I'm far from a 'hardcore' fighting game fan, I enjoy to play these types of games rather casually, and enjoy facing off against friends. The 8-girl cast is a bit small at the moment, but over the next couple month, another 5 will be added to the list, including, for some reason, two dudes. The netcode in Skullgirls uses GGPO, and has been lagless against everyone I've played, and, unlike the console version, the PC version has a lobby system for facing people. This is certainly one of my favorite fighting games recently.","November 25, 2013","true","11.3"," 105 of 134 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","105","134","0","2"

The tutorials that come with the game are just fantastic. There are 16 tutorials plus one for each individual character. These tutorials will teach you what mix-ups are, what "Hit confirming" is, how to punish opponents, etc, while the character-specific tutorials teach you all the moves of the character and how to use them. There's plenty of information here that'll be very useful to beginners.\nThere are 2 different single player modes, multiplayer lobbies and quick matches, and a training room for you to mess around with.\nThe two single player modes include story and arcade.\n\nThere is a different story for each character. Story mode follows your character and their mission to get the "Skull Heart", something that will give you one wish in exchange for becoming the "Skullgirl", who is basically evil. Story consists of a bit of text, then a couple matches, then more text, then a boss, and ocassionally another match after the boss. I wish these were a little longer. You don't fight every character in the roster in these story modes, only a few. The boss isn't too enjoyable, for me; she uses lots of cheap tactics and isn't really a "Fight", as I always find myself spamming one attack until she dies, because you can't use any combos. I would've much prefered a normal fight but with a stronger enemy. The little stories the characters go through are quite interesting sometimes. I liked learning the backstories, and some are nicely done, like Squigly and Painwheel, although with other characters you don't get too much information about them.\n\nArcade mode is a randomly generated challenge where you fight lots of different characters in different numbers (You can have up to 3 people on your team, which I'll get to later), and it is more fun then the 1v1 fights you get in story mode. This mode is also a lot longer then a character's story mode because any 1v1 fights have 2 rounds. At the end of Arcade you fight the boss from story mode. Something I really liked about arcade is that even if you don't have the DLC characters, you can still fight them. This adds quite a bit of variety and lets you see the DLC character's movesets.\n\nThere are 6 difficulty settings, from Sleepwalk to Nightmare. Nightmare isn't as hard as I'd like it to be, although it makes the final boss unfair, and a really frustrating difficulty spike.\n\nTraining is where you'll try out different combos and characters and things. This is the best training mode you'll ever see in a fighting game, including hitboxes, icons that show you what you are pressing, grids, hitstun bars, slow-motion, recording, and settings like how much meter you start with, among other things.\nSomething I really felt was missing from Single Player was a straight up single match mode. This would've been nice but it isn't too major of a problem I have with the game.\n\n\nAs for multiplayer, there's a tournament mode, ranked play, lobbies, and local play.\n\nLocal play is playing with someone you're physically next to on the same computer. For this you'll need another controller for the other person to play with.\n\nLobbies is where you'll usually go when you want to play with a friend from different computers, or play unranked.\nThen, most importantly, is ranked quick match. Quick match has a nice feature that lets you choose if you want to fight people from the same country as you. Sadly, there aren't really enough players to make this useful.\nCharacters are also very balanced, as well.\n\nWhile ranked online does have a leaderboard and (If I'm correct, this is what I've heard) a matchmaking system, the central problem of there not being enough players will have the game pair you up with people way above your skill level.\nAnd when I say that online isn't very populated, I don't mean it is impossible to find a match. It's still possible to find a match without waiting, but there just aren't enough people for some of the features in ranked online to really be useful. There's also hardly any lag online. GGPO works wonders online, and you'll barely ever get any lag, no matter where your opponent is located.\n\nThere are eight characters, two of which are locked in story mode in the beginning, with 5 DLC characters.\nAll of the characters have different playstyles. Each one feels very unique, and none are similar.\n\nThe game looks fanatstic. The backgrounds for each stage are beautiful, the soundtrack is mostly jazz and is enjoyable to listen to, and the characters all look very interesting and different.\nThe art style for the game is probably one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game. It strays away from the generic anime style that is so common now into a more cartoonishly-exaggerated style.\n\nAnd yes, the characters in this game have hips and breasts as wide as trains, if you're turned off (or on) the game by that.\n\nThere is also an art gallery if you like collecting everything.\n\nFighting is very fluent in this game. It always feels rewarding to hit someone and pull off combos.\nEach character has 3 punches and 3 kicks, with crouching, jumping, and sometimes forward/back variations to these, along with an array of special moves. Characters also have at least one grab, and their own Blockbuster attacks. Blockbuster attacks use meter that builds up after hitting opponents or being hit. Blockbusters use 1 to 5 meter, 5 being the limit.\nThe way the anti-infinite combo system works in this is that you can break out of an opponent's combo after they have repeated a sequence of attacks in a combo twice.\nThen there are resets, which is where you end your combo so that you can instantly start it again. This is combated by the "drama" value, which, if you're hit too much in a sequence of time, you can burst out of the combo even if you were reset. Of course, there are burst baits, but these require you to be smart about bursting.\n\nYou can have up to 3 fighters in one match you can tag to and use assists from. The more characters you have, the weaker they get, so you're more evenly matched fighting 1 character with 3. This is nice if you want to practice with just one character, or if you don't want to juggle 3 at a time.\n\nOverall I'd really recommend this game. It's great to play with your friends, online, or even alone. I definitely think it is worth its money, considering it's a ton of fun, and there's lots to play to last you a while. Definitely pick this up.","November 15, 2014","true","370.7"," 48 of 58 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","48","58","0","0"

Trying a more traditional 2D fighter in usf4 was just not for me.\n\nI decided to try skullgirls instead, and the "fluidity" that I spoke of with smash was largely present in this game.  The combo system is easy to understand, everything makes sense.  Each characters moveset is very diverse and different from other characters (even filia/fukua).  Being allowed to choose a team of 1-3 characters is very fun, and the assists and custom assists are very cool.\n\nPresentation wise, the game is gorgeous.  The menus all have this 1920's feel to it, black and white with a tinge of sepia about it.  The menu scrolls in the way an old movie reel might.\nCharacter designs are diverse, pretty, and well done.  There are only 12 or so characters in this game, and each character is largely different from the others in terms of aesthetic (except filia/fukua, but there are some differences ofc).\n\nThanks to the large tutorial, I would say the game is somewhat easy to pick up and understand, from either the perspective of a casual player or a competitive player.\n\nThe storyline is very fun to go through and play for each character, as each has their own story.\n\nLastly is the price. for 14.99 you get all the current characters and all 25 alternate colors.\npretty tight.","July 2, 2015","true","212.2"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","30","31","0","0"

Every character is strong, you can change the size of your team to your liking (from Solo to Three characters). Deep mechanics that have no obvious "best option" for every situation, the capacity for involved spacing & mindgames. The online scene is growing, as long as you get in contact with the steam groups you should have no problem getting matches.. (If you live in Australia, I moderate the Skullgirls Oceanic steam group, join us & play, we like helping newbies learn the ropes)\n\nThough be warned, you know that period of sucking at DotA because you don't know how to play it? Well fighting games are way harder than dota, and you need to learn way more in order to get good at them. If you're the kind of player that likes to blame the game and other players on your loss, you're out of luck - all of your mistakes are yours alone, and it's completely up to you to fix your mistakes. However, if you're willing to put in time and effort into learning this game then arguably the most rewarding gaming experience of your life awaits you.","November 27, 2013","true","908.0"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","34","39","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nuuance/recommended/245170/","nuuance","Nuuance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nuuance/","160 products in account","When I was a kid, I never dreamt about nightmares from bad movies like my other kid frineds. Instead in the middle of the night, my dad would wake me up and play maortal kombat 1 with me. It got to the point where it was the only thing I thought about before I went to bed.\n\nNow I'm substantially older and despite thinking about other things a little more, fighting games wtill hold a special place in my heart. Well...GOOD fighting games rather. Mortal Kombat 9 has popped up with the old flair it once had, but I still feel like something's missing, Blazblue is SUPER fun, but not available for PC, so of course I was just in the dust because I've never particularly liked Street Fighter.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nSo then Skullgirls pops onto PC, a port I've literally waited/anticipated years for. The port is WONDERFUL. The effort everyone puts into it is phenominal. Honestly. Coming from a crowdfunding IndieGoGo campaign raising almost a million dollars and NOT being Street Fighter, it's kind of a big deal.\n\nHand-drawn visuals are the only thing to grace this game and it never gets old seeing each frame of animation play out...unless you're losing probably lol. While playing BlazBlue I used to occasionally play in Mike Z's lobby when he got on, but I didn't really know who he was at the time. Apparently he was like a fighting god who was a real force in gaming & I held my own against his Tager, winning and losing equally. But little did I know HE would be the guy to give input on Skullgirls and help make it, basically making it his new way to live.\n\nSYSTEM:\n\nSkullgirls takes out a lot of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and just includes what's "necessary" for hardcore 2D fighters. Although there are 1 or 2 features/mechanics I wish were in the game (and might be on their way in the future), I've been pretty happy with what we have so far. everything is very straightforward and no 1-frame link ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t unless you want to make a custom combo yourself with unusual timing. And THAT'S another t hing. YOU can make combos the way you want. Implemented is something called IPS (Infinite Prevention System) that keeps people from performing infinites. Now this doesnt mean you won't get your ♥♥♥ whipped or long combos are out the game....quite the opposite, but it DOES mean everything is FAIR. If someone resets a combo, you'll know because of visual cues. If you keep getting hit before your attack comes out, the game will let you know with a red flash over your character, telling you you were just a biiiiit too slow and got counterhit. The system is simple, yet has depth for hardcore gamers as well.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nTo bring something new to fighting games, skullgirls combines the 6-button gameplay of something like street fighter, but mixes it with the combo-heavy nature of games like a BlazBlue. And also a really cool team-system is used. If you like playing solo with one character, you can use a REALLY strong character who has incredible damage, or trade a little bit of that for a team of 2, with regeneration when tagged out, invaluable tag assists, and Delayed Hyper combos. Things like make fighting games. It plays like BUTTER and the sense of impact is PERFECT. When you hit someone with a strong attack, you will definitely feel it. And I really like that. Wonderful sound design, everything.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nAnd speaking of hardcore gamers, the general pool of people who play this is one of quality. You will definitely be facing some good competition. And I'm very happy about that. So if you want to play this game, I definitely recommened it. The people are GREAT and will help you if you need it, and with nothing but more good features coming to it, it'd be best to hop on now while it's still early!\n\nGame on :D","August 26, 2013","true","808.3"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","30","33","0","3"

It’s a one-of-a-kind, action-packed competition complete with awesome combos and an intriguing backstory. Unlike other assorted fighting games, the game has a more feminine take on storyline and characters which is quite a relief considering most fighting games these days tend to become a full out sausage fest with all male characters who have the exact same personality and character development. The game is indeedly challenging and is very recommended to all fighting game coniseurs.

I put it on sleepwalk difficulty to help with my lack of skill, yes I still lost a few fights near the end! The artwork is nice and each character has a unique story.  Two new characters have been added since I got the game and it seems that more will be coming, as there is an active community.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/recommended/245170/","gamerrubrix","Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/","300 products in account","Skullgirls is a 2D Fighter. The game centers around the "Dark Daco" world, but more specifically, the Canopy Kingdom. There is a mysterious item called the "Skull Heart" that can grant any woman's wish. But, if the wish is at all impure and not for good intention, she transforms into the Skullgirl, an evil being that wants nothing more than to bring hell to the world. There are a total of 14 characters that each have their own unique story relating to them and their reasons for pursuing the Skull Heart.\n\nThis game is amazingly spectacular both artistic and gameplay wise. For the art side, the game has a very immersive story with well-written dialog, making all characters extremely memorable and likable. Each of their unique stories puts their lives and purpose for chasing the Skull Heart in perspective, and gives an opportunity to explore different areas of the Canopy Kingdom; to the night-light city of New Meridian to the mysterious and desolate Final Atrium. There's bound to be a character you'll really like, the cast is very diverse, and their personalities truly shine through every little move they do, especially in gameplay. No stone is left unturned. Even if you don't like fighting games, I think you'd appreciate what this game has to offer with it's world.\n\nThe theme and soundtrack of the game, while having nothing to do with the world itself, it very pleasing to me. The theme is something like an old classical film theme, with terms like "Ensemble", "Drama", and "Outtake" being replaced as fighting game terms, and having film reels be a core part of the main menu and round introductions with a very monotone, original color scheme. The soundtrack is pretty old fashioned too with a spice of new variety, fitting with the theme of sounding classical and very jazzy at times. It truly is unique music if I ever heard it, and it's something you should give a listen too.\n\nNow as for gameplay itself, it's an incredibly solid fighting game. I'm no expert, but I can tell you it's amazing fast paced, non-stop action from start to finish. You got your basic Super Moves, block, many types of attacks, character specific specials, and more. The flow is very natural and fast paced, letting you create your  own combos and seeing what you can come up with. There is no combo list, so you just try to make your own and see what works. There's no exploitable "Infinite Combos" either as the game is under protection of the IPS (Infinite Protection System) which lets the victim get out of a sticky situation if the game notices combos being repeated. The game is also playable online obviously, and you can duke it out with anybody around the world, even if you're playing with someone from another country, the game still runs very smooth with little to no input lag.\n\nA player can have up to 3 fighters on their team, and the character selection is actually pretty free reign. For example, one player can have 2 fighters on his team, but the other fighter can have just 1 on his team. But it's balanced out because the 2-fighter player has less health and does weaker attacks, while the 1-fighter player has the exact opposite. It's not 100% balanced of course since any player with 2 or 3 fighters have use of team assists and attacks, but the game tries it's best with it\n\nAnother thing I really love is that this game is for both new and veteran players to fighting games. The game's tutorial system is very in depth, and explains every little bit of how fighting games work, and even showing advanced techniques, with a easygoing learning curve, training you to become an expert. Experts are also greeted with many advanced moves like Combo Resets and quick mix-up moves, plus other things. The training room has many, many options that the biggest of fighting geeks would love. It gives lots of room for practice if you're having trouble with anything\n\nThere's only a few issues with the game. As with all fighting games, if you're no veteran, you're likely to lose horribly online. It's no doubt that this genre of video games probably has the biggest skill difference, so you need to be dedicated if you want to have fun playing online, unless you got friends of your same skill level. Another problem is that the game just lacks content in general. It has the bare basics of what fighting games have to offer. No extra modes, no mini-games, no nothing. Just single player Arcade/Story, Online Mode, and an Art Gallery. It's a shame too because other popular titles like Super Smash Bros or Mortal Kombat really excel with their additional modes aside from just the vanilla fighting. Even toying with the vanilla game itself isn't possible. If you've seen Injustice: Gods Among Us or Mortal Kombat X, you'll see there's a lot of different arcade options, with certain handicaps and what-not. And finally, the roster is just pretty small in general compared to most fighting games. Originally, the game only had 8 fighters. It's now grown to 14 thanks to funding from Kickstarter, but it's still relatively small with not too many options.\n\nOverall, Skullgirls is a very, very well polished and incredibly well-done game with lots of attention to detail of the world it sets itself in, and makes perfectly natural, free flowing combat with little to no errors up it's sleeve. What it does, it does well, it just has minor issues and lacks content here and there.\n\n8/10","May 25, 2015","true","102.7"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","4"

Graphics, the game looks beautiful, all characters well done with details on every corner, the sprites are great, and the sprite of a fallen character can even be different depending on what kind of attack the character received before going down, the backgrounds are also well done, with lots of details everywhere, and the artwork is completely hand-drawn, and it's really not bad. Sound, the voice acting is very well selected for each character, there was one which I personally found kinda off before, Painwheel's, but now I see why it was chosen, the music very well done, each one sounding unique. Gameplay, the game runs 60 frames per second, completely smooth, all characters have different playstyles and feel pretty unique (Fukua is a clone character, she was made as an Aprill fools joke, as a parody of Decapre from Ultra Super Street Fighter IV, she was avaible only at the endless beta, but now she's a hidden character by she side of Big Band in the final game.). The game has almost no delay when the player presses a button, and it even has an anti infinite combo system. The game has local and online multiplayer, and the online multiplayer is very good, with a great connection, the player can create lobbies, with the maximum of 6 players, but the game itself might not be the easiest game for a begginer at fighting games, but the game has a very good tutorial mode, with even tutorials for learning how to use the characters, and the final boss is.... Very cheap to say the least, but certainly a challenge, and this game also has a gigantic number of references on it. At the moment all the DLC characters are not out yet, which when they are, they stay free for a limited number of time, so the player can decide if it's worth to buy the DLC or not, so when a new character is out, I'll test them, and if necessary, mention any change of anything at all, I will edit this review. I give this game a 9.5/10.0 a must-buy for fighting game fans.","May 17, 2014","true","130.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","2"

In addition to that, it has great tutorial which explains you the basics and hints as to how combo your moves/defend/pushblock etc.\n\nYou also have choice of either playing solo character or creating a team up to 3 fighters (which may have less health but can chain their strikes and cover each other).\n\nNice artstyle and music.\n\nBest if you have people at hand who you know will not abandon it in case they find it hard. While the game itself is pretty fun, actually finding a match is very problematic if you're not playing Quick Match, sometimes you have wait very long for anybody to join your Beginner lobby. QM itself is pretty bad if you're new to the game, because of skill difference between newcomers and veterans.","November 4, 2014","true","613.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

When I play Skullgirls, I still kinda suck! However, I think this game is pretty fantastic.\n\nI was originally drawn in by the cartoony style artwork, but then after going through the tutorials and slowly getting the hang of how to play, this game has become one of my favorites.\n\nWhen you're starting out, go through the tutorial, pick a character, and learn a few basic combos for him/her. After that, though it may seem daunting, go play some online matches! Yes, playing with other people is scary, especially when you think everyone else is better than you. You'll probably lose a bunch of times, but that's when you start to improve and learn more about the game's mechanics and whatnot. Soon you'll start to get a lot less worse then you were when you started! You can then invest hundreds of hours into this game (all of those two-minute matches really add up)! Wow, isn't that cool?\n\nAlso the online community's great; everybody's really friendly! Don't be afraid to ask the person who handed your booty to you for tips, he or she will most likely be willing to help you out and improve your game. The Skullheart forums are very sexy too.

REBIND ALL KEYS! This game is extremely hard with the default setting on, i highly recommend playing with a controller since it could be easier to use.\n\nAs for the rest of the game? The game's unqiue art style, and characters plus the jazz music really makes the game stand out amongst a lot of the fighting games we are use to.\n\nThe tutorial itself isn't all that great sadly because in a game like this , especially with these controls, you better give us the actual on screen button to push instead of saying "Press Macro (or whatever) to do this" the tutorial needs to be really more specific. Otherwise, instead of raging against the opponents or another player. Lol, might as well be raging at the controls.\n\nThe characters themselves are unique, each one with their own persona, and attack patterns, both normal and special. Like what i said before, the levels themselves are unqiue and very pretty to look at. I give 10 for the artistic and visual styles of the game, but sadly give it a flat D or an F for the controls.\n\nShould you get this game? If you like this sort of art style and what the game has to offer. By all means, I recommend it, I think it's pretty refreshing from the regular fighting games we have seen in recent memory, however. I recommend getting a controller first for this game, DO NOT play this game with a keyboard alone, might as well playing a Souls game with it rather than a fighting game that has sadly little to no explantion with their tutorial.","June 2, 2015","true","0.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","3"

Players can pick between fighting with one, two or three characters, giving the players a lot of different options to play with. The combat is fast and free flowing, which keeps the game very intense and fun. The free-flowing gameplay makes it really fun to experiment with different comobs. The gameplay is very technical for fighting game veterans to master, but can be picked up and played by anyone, so its good for both newcomers to fighting games and veterans. Furthermore, the tutorial is one of the best tutorials I have seen in any game of any genre. It literally goes over every aspect of the game in great detail so if you don't understand fighting games you can understand the more complicated mechanics with ease. There are also tutorials for every individual character giving guidelines on how to play and teaches you their special moves, which is great for helping choose which characters to main.\n\nThe artwork is amazing and beautiful to look at, as well as incredibly detailed, everything from the fluid character animations to the backgrounds is truly stunning, even breathtaking at moments. The soundtrack also fits the world and the fighting very well with some very cool theme stages.\n\nSkulgirls probably has one of the strongest storymodes of any fighting game. The storyline is very engaging, the dialgoue is executed perfectly by the voice actors and the characters are all unique and interesting. What really makes the game stand out is the sense of humour, this game is one of the funniest games I've played, with very funny dialogue, even the announcers are memorable and produce some great lines. On the downside, the storymode is a little on the short side. Some people would complain about a lack of characters, since there were only eight on launch, however, they have since added six new player characters to the game and all the characters are unique and interesting and I would much rather have a small cast of characters that are all unique instead of a large cast with some duplicates and less interesting or fun characters.\n\nMultiplayer in this game works very well, especially compared to some other PC fighting games' netplay *cough* Accent Core *cough*, you can almost always have a great match with little to no input delay. One of its faults is that there isn't a challenge mode or many extra modes like in other fighting games.\n\nHighly recommended for both fighting game veterans and new players alike! Can't wait for what Lab Zero comes up with next!","October 10, 2015","true","48.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

The game comes with an amazing tutorial going over all the basics that help one get started. There is a total of 30 lessons, and each character has a lesson specifically for them, which teaches all their special moves. If you're planning on buying this game, I recommend having a controller or an arcade stick.\n\nCharacters\nThere are currently ten characters, or eleven if counting fukua (Fukua is a variant of Filia with a different set of moves). More DLC characters are currently in the works aswell. The current roster is smaller compared to other fighting games. However, The qaulity of each character is worth a small roster. Each character has a unique playstyle. For example Cerebella is a grappler, who specializes in throwing her opponents. There is also a lot of synergy between characters, since one can create a team of multiple characters. Before a match one can choose to roll with a team of one super-powered character, two high-powered characters, or three normal-powered characters.\n\nAnother thing cool about the characters are the various palettes. Each character has about 20 unique color palettes. Some are original, but others are based off other fictional characters. For example there are four palettes based of the anime Madoka Magica and a palette of fionna from Adventure Time. The palettes just add a lot more fun to the game, though simple things.\n\nCommunity\nThe story mode is pretty short, and like most 2d fighters the focus is the multiplayer. Playing with people can be challenging for begginers, since people who aren't the same skill level will show drastically. When I first joined a quickmatch my opponent was a lot more expirenced than I, and he didn't pull any punches. Luckily there are lobbies for beggingers, and there are tons of people willing to play with somone on their skill level. I'm not sure how many tournaments are hosted for skullgirls, but I did find a group, which holds a newbie night tournament. There was also a side tournament that happened at evo 2014, and I imagine it will be there in the upcoming years as well. I believe there was a $5,000 cash pot, so there definatly is a reward for mastering this game.\n\nFeatures\nThis game comes with a variety of ways to play. Singleplayer comes with a story mode, where one can choose any of the characters on the roster and learn their backstory inbetween about three fights and the finally a fight with the skullgirl herself. It also features an arcade mode, which features competent AI bots to fight. When wanting to train, The traing room has a lot of options that can be turned on and off, so you can setup the perfect envimorent to train any skill. Finally the multiplayer has quick matches, lobby play, an a local tournament function. The lobbies in skullgirls can be created to hold a max ammount of 8 people, and you can either spectate or fight someone in the lobby.\n\nConclusion\nSkullgirls is definatly worth the purchase. It's a really stylized 2d fighter that looks and feels great. It's easy to get into for begginers, but hard to master. You'll be having fun playing this for hours upon hours, if you aim to harness you're full potentintal at this game.","July 15, 2014","true","209.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/245170/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Did not think in a million years I would be into a game such as this. I picked this game up on extreme sale (under $3) and for the first time ever, picked up a DLC within a few days. Do not let the hand drawn animations fool you, this is one exciting game.\n\nSkullgirls is about a mystical skull that appears every 7 years. It's power can be held by a soul but the soul can easily be manipulated and cursed if not careful. Here's the issue though, as soon as the skull re-appears, the whole city goes nuts. Skullgirls by it's game play definition is a fighting game. Upon playing the game, I noticed a few similarities between Street Fighter IV and this game. The move schemes are slightly similar but I feel they are lot more effective and simpler. Meaning, more moves that seem extremely challenging to do in SF IV, can be done with a bit less intensity and damage to your controller. The combos are insanely ridiculous though. Unlike SF IV, you're not stuck with one fighter.\n\nYou can have up to three in your party. This means when doing special moves, you may have another character come jumping in randomly. Although this is a really cool feature and an awesome offense, you'll have to be double careful as if they miss they can get damaged as well. 1 character vs 3 should be strong enough as they seemed to have gone to great lengths to balance it all out. The moves are pretty smooth and combos up to 30 or more hits can be executed. I feel this game is a lot more "free" in the sense that you're not scripted to press this button after you've pressed this button. Okay, maybe there is a little button mashing involved but it seems like control chaos. I feel a lot more immersed in this game than I do in SF IV as I feel I can string more successful combos together. There is your basic light, medium and hard punch and kick but there are also buttons to call in for support (if available). There are a few modes available in game such as career, versus and extras (where you can view the gallery or even fight the main boss but at 300%). The campaign was actually well done. It follows a comic strip sort of dialogue where characters expressions and backgrounds will change accordingly.\n\nObviously, there will be breaks in between where you have to fight another character. I really like how the campaign was done as you only have to fight each person once. Some may argue (and have) that it's made the game slightly short. With all the characters available though, you should have at least 4-5 hours geared towards this particular mode. Each character has a different story that is being told. Some characters will need you to beat the campaign before you can move on and use them. The DLC characters even have stories but I found one or two sort of are gimmicky.\n\nThe visuals in this game are absolutely fantastic. It's hard to believe that it was hand drawn. I personally don't find any lack in this sort of animation style but some have brought to my attention it seems to "jumpy" for them. This shouldn't be an issue for you as the game play will certainly pull you in. The animations done for certain moves are absolutely insane. Big Band for example or Double have some crazy animations regarding their attacks or when they get hit. The sounds are actually really good and you'll hear characters chime in before and after matches with a quick insult.\n\nOverall, this is a great game. I would highly highly recommend buying it on sale but if your a fighting fan, you may want to get it full price.\n\n\nRATING : 7.35/10\n\n\nScreenShots :\nAbout to use a special\n\nThis is not a pornographic game\n\nWhat a cut-scene looks like\n\nOne of the specials in action\n\nAnother special in action\n\n...Another insanely absurd special attack\n\nThis is just a regular grab attack. Quite the creativity\n\nAnother clip from the campaign\n\nBig Band (DLC) is one of my absolute favorite characters. Fighting against him sucks.

Any small flaws in the game I feel I can forgive since (don't quote me on this) when it launched in beta on steam the company wanted it pulled off of steam and it turned into some kind of battle with suing involved, I didn't follow the story. All I know is that's why you also get a copy of "Skullgirls-Endless Beta" with your copy of the real Skullgirls. That being said this game has an amazing art style, amazing plot *wink wink nudge nudge*, And is a really solid well made fighter game.\n\nBUT before you buy it there are things you need to be aware of. First off, You cannot play this game with a keyboard. You can try but you wont get far. Even with a controller It is still somewhat hard because this game was made to be played with an Arcade Controller (Ik there is a better term, I just have a bad memory.)\nNext you need to be aware is if you are going to buy this game you need to put time into it to learn everything. I personally didn't have the patience and fighters are not my favorite type of games. I still like 'em though.\n\nBut overall this is a solid, well made game. The gameplay is almost perfect and the art style is very unique. I would give this game a 8.25/10 and recommend anyone who is a experienced in fighting games to buy this game.

Very fluent animation, amazing art, characters are interesting, maps are neato, fast paced, everything about this game is beautiful.\n\nHowever, if you're a fan of fighters and haven't a decent amount of experience with them, you might want to avoid this game. It has the "Tekken" problem, where there is no way to break an enemy combo save for a few minor ways. If you're opponent is good enough, the entire game is about who locks the other into a combo first. Then it's just waiting and watching to see if they mess up their sequence of buttons (which they won't) and then it's over. There is a break in each match when the first health bar goes down, but it's not enough.\n\nBecause of that reason, don't expect to get much out of online play. That's pretty much all it is, the same endless combos over and over.\n\nIf you just want this game to play with friends who aren't that great at fighters, however, this game is amazing, knock yourself out.","October 4, 2015","false","2.7"," 38 of 67 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","38","67","4","0"

While keeping true to its 2D-fighting game roots, LabZero recognizes some of the flaws and annoyances from other fighting games and seeks to correct them.\n\nFaulty netcode? Nope, we've got GGPO.\nUnexplained mechanics? Nope, pretty much everything you could want is given to you in the tutorials. More than that, it's done in a way that will challenge newcomers without overwhelming them.\nUnblockable setups? Handled.\nUnbalanced metagame? Not here. Game design is lead by MikeZ, who has been a part of the fighting game scene for a long while now. In addition to that, balance testing is regularly handled in conjunction with the playerbase itself in the form of the Endless Beta.\n\nThe community is currently not too big, so the players you'll find on quick match are generally somewhat skilled and experienced. Because of this, the game might be difficult to get into for a newcomer. But it truly is worthwhile to keep practicing and improve your skills.\n","June 28, 2014","true","720.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Amazing soundtrack, fantastic animation, and fast-paced gameplay make this one of the best fighting games on the market.\n\nNow, this game is not for everyone. Compared to games like Street Fighter, it's much faster and seemingly more random until you get the hang of it. People often say that this is one of the best games to pick up as your first fighting game, but I don't necessarily agree. Yes, it has one of the best tutorials in fighting game history. Yes, combo'ing from normal to normal (normal=punch/kick) is easy. However, the mix up and reset-heavy nature of the game can make it seem like you're just being hit until you die.\n\nI 100% recommend this game, but I do think the barrier to competency is extremely high...but that's not a bad thing. And if you're just looking for a fighting game for you and a friend to play for fun, then Skullgirls is perfect. Just don't expect to put even 50 hours into it and expect to win very much. If want to sink some time in this game to "git gud," then it's very rewarding.\n\nIt's also updated fairly often with very reasonable balance changes (I'll miss you, Filia's j.lk j.hk overhead crossup), new characters (Beowulf hype), and game features (the new replay system will make it very easy to see just how much of a scrub we all really are.  This is MikeZ's baby and he pays attention to it.\n\nSummary: Great game. High barrier to competency, but can also be played casually with friends who aren't too familiar with the genre. 9.5/10","November 30, 2014","true","751.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I wanted to like it, but ultimately regret the purchase.\n\nThe art style and animation is a strong point, and the characters are enjoyable if you don't mind heavy fanservice. But, the actual gameplay is pretty terrible towards newer players. The tutorials establish fighting game rules pretty well, but they really don't help when playing against other actual people. The matchmaking prioritizes internet connection over skill/ranking, leading to a ton of matches where you will literally put down your controller while someone lands a 50-hit combo on you.\n\nThis leads to a game that is extremely off-putting to casual players, as it doesnt allow you to gradually improve by playing others of your own skill level. Learning the basics through the fantastic tutorials will not help when getting regularly matched against veterans that only need to land one hit to win the match.\n\nPerhaps it's better if you stick with a small group of friends. But, with the emphasis on overly-long combos and inability to consistently play strangers of your own skill level, I would recommend SSFIV or KOF over this fighter for casual players. Only buy if it's on a really good sale or you are otherwise accustomed to combo-based fighting systems. It's really a game for veterans, which unfortunately I was not.","November 16, 2013","false","13.5"," 288 of 546 people (53%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","53","288","546","9","26"

Trying to get at something but in reality; only one will prevail in the end! It was a good ride, very comicy & cartoony; definitely helps if you're feeling lonesome or down. Although you must play all characters to fully understand the story behind Skullgirls.\n\nCharacters:\nMy favorite character is Peacock, she is a 13 year old-smoking-badass-cartoonloving-robot-kid thing! (Just kidding about that last part ^^;) But she is very well badass, I admire her design so much, it's very much original & suave. Her personality is abit jerkish, but hey; what badass isn't a jerk?!\n\nSoundtrack:\nI definitely love the soundtrack as well. Makes you think you're in one of those old timey theatre with abunch of people trying to cut in-front of you to see that badass movie. My favorite track so far is "Streets Of New Meridian Stage."\n\nAttacks/Movement:\nConsidering I'm not a fan of fighting games, this is rare in my case I enjoy fighting games. There was just something about this game that I liked! Probably it's unique attacks~ I do like the attack system, although I personally think some attacks should be limited & the specials should be raised 1 up, for instance; you get hit, you get tension. Tension can unlock special attacks your character can use. And honestly, they have crazy attacks on just a Level 1 Tension.\n\nAll in all:\nVery beautiful & creative game, definitely worth the buy!\n10/10. <3","January 4, 2014","true","8.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

It is, for all intents and purposes, the true sequel to Marvel Vs Capcom 2. While it does have ideas and a style of it's own, it stays true to the fundamental "logic" and ideas on what makes a competitive fighting game fun and smart that fueled MVC2.\n\nThe game allows you to select a team of 1 to 3 characters to fight 1 on 1 and switch out with the next character when defeated or low on health. Health and damage are balanced based on how many characters you have on your team, and much like Mvc2, you are also able to pick an "assist", that is you'll be able to call one of your other team mates from off screen to perform a move, after which they recharge this ability briefly. It's pretty much the same system as Mvc2, except you can choose to have 2 or 1 characters on your team. Also unlike Mvc2, you can choose your assist move from any of your characters abilities and moves.\n\nThe cast might seem small compared to some fighters which are running 13 installments and have over 50 characters, but the design of each of these characters is where the game really shines. Each character is masterfully designed, smart, and creative to play. Each of them plays and feels completely different, but none of them are one dimensional, and can be played with a variety of play styles and gameplans. Combine this with the team ratio's and vast selection of assist types, and you have a game that gives you a wealth of options in creating your own fighting style.\n\nThe brilliance of the move set design also makes moment to moment combat feel perfect. The pacing of the game is excellent, with quick moves and both players being presented with new risk/reward decisions every moment. Unlike some fighters (that shall remain nameless), the game never clogs down with block stun or makes you feel like your waiting for your next chance to move. With the low amount of block stun and the negative frames on most blocked attacks, the game is constantly thrusting the chance to act upon each player. The choices are not shallow either, as every single option in the game feels perfectly unsafe and counterable, making every decision count.\n\nIf you have any interest in fighting games or competitive games whatsoever, please buy Skullgirls!","August 1, 2013","true","220.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

(Why the ♥♥♥♥ would you not like that anyway?)\n\nLong Review:\n\nSkullgirls is a fighting game about having a stupid plot, it's absolutely ridiculous, the gameplay on the other hand is absolutely fantastic, being a Marvel-like fighter without the ridiculously broken characters that the community would curse at you for using, having a anti-infinite combo system that checks if people are using the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over in a single combo and tells them to ♥♥♥♥ off if they are, and allowing to choose between one, two or three characters on your team, allowing you to play the way you like and not punishing you for not being able to get your ♥♥♥♥ right with the other characters.\n\nThe graphic style is anime-ish, and looks nice, the game also uses actual drawings as sprites and not models or...sprites, which looks even nicer when you notice that the game actually pays attention to lighting, darkening the characters when they get closer to darker places.\n\nThe soundtrack ♥♥♥♥ing rocks, tell your kids to stay away from this game, there is too much SAXual content, your kids will end up JAZZing unintentionally all over the place due to this.\n\nOverall I give this game a Stylish/Fancy.\n\n(Refer to the game's combo names.)\n\n","February 13, 2015","true","58.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","4","4","4","0"

The game is fast paced, easy to combo, has a fluent gameplay and also has an anti-loops system. New players will find funny to mess arround with Fortune's Head (#Meow) or just hit multiple keys and make some awesome tricks they never seen before.

How does everyone think Undertale is the secend coming ♥♥♥♥ing Jesus mario cool-cat christ, when this game has done EVERYTHING better? Don't get me wrong, Undertale is SO good, but this? This is one of the best fighting games EVER! SCREW YOU ANITA, THIS GAME IS FEMENINE POWAH! But all jokes aside, I usually don't like over sexualization in games, but here? The game is so frantic, I am not paying attention to the boobs... LOL. I also like the concept, the hand drawn art style, the lovely gameplay, and SO MUCH MORE! Also, relating back to U.T, that game has multiple endings and charecter perspectives on EVERY main character, and will make you SIMPATHIZE with the villan! In this game, The story may be shorter, but it has the same effect. That should be commemerated! It will also make you outright LIKE the villan in such a short time! Also, I love the hand drawn MOE art style. The music is also classy. Jazz? In a fighting game? It oddly fits! It is so freaking classy!\n\nThe story is told in little bits and peices. There is this clan called "Medeci mafia" Who wants to take over the world. They asasinate Marie, and squigly. Marie uses the power of the "Skull heart" to take revenge. Now all others must stop her and reclaim the skull for their desires.\n\nNow, let's go over the characters:\n\nFilia: A girl with sentient hair who must restore her friend with the skull heart.\n\nFukua: A girl with sentient hair who takes over Filia's body. Her story is the "Survival" Mode of the game. Also, THEY GAVE A JOKE CHARACTER A UNIQUE AND INTREGUING STORY!\n\nSquigly: A girl with sentient hair who... wait... this is familiar... Also, THEY GAVE A JOKE CHARACTER A UNIQUE AND INTREGUING STORY!\n\nEliza: A ♥♥♥♥♥. That is all you need to know. Don't play as her. She is OP, though.\n\nPeacock: A little kid hybrid who takes his hybrid friends on a trip... OF PAIN! He is awesome. He reminds me a lot of an Engineer in TF2, he will let his stuff do the work for him and rarely fights.\n\nCerebela: The hard, fast, and agile hitter of the group. Very hard to master. She is a main circus act.\n\nMiss. Fortune: She works at a food place and is a cat. With detatchible limbs. Did I tell you this is very japaneese? Well, it is.\n\nBeowolf: HULK HOGAN, BRRROOTHEEERRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nValentine: Anita's main target. Marie's main target. She is still going good. She is awesome. Oh, did I tell you she is a ninja medic?\n\nDouble: The "Rival Battle" for this game... and she is a nun who turns into a demon. This is what we, in the industry, like to call ♥♥♥♥ING HAAARDCOOOOORE!\n\nRobo-fortune: A cat with lazors. She still wants to aquire a cheezburger\n\nBig band: One of two male characters (The other being beowolf). He is a cop who got beat up, and then reprogrammed as... well... a jazz singer. Music jotes FTW!\n\nParasoul: I think that Mr. Hispanic at disco summed her up very well: You can play as Jessica Rabbit if she was Hitler, but like, a Lawful Good Hitler. With a heir.\n\nPainwheel: A mind controlled beast who wants revenge. She has a wheel on her back that is made out of blades.\n\nMarie: She wants revenge on everyone by using the skull heart. It is quite sad, really. Also, conterary to popular beliefe, you can beat her 300% form with any character on the hardest difficulty.\n\nSo, in conclusion, buy this game, screw anita, and knock yourself out. Also, I feel like the only person every who didn't buy this game for the boobs, and especially didn't fap to it. This fandom is great, too. If it werent for all the perverts on this game, It would be easily in the top ten\n\n10/10.

There is very little room for error in an SG match.\n\nFirst off, the combat is very fast paced and relies on 50+ hit combos that leave you with roughly 50% HP left. That doesn't sound so bad, but it doesn't end there.\n\nMetagame relies a lot on resets. This means that getting hit by combos leaves you in a defensive position just right beside your opponent. And from there you have a split second to guess his next move or else you get hit by another combo again.\n\nDid I mention almost anything starts a combo? Overhead moves, instant airdash overheads, special moves, and even normal grabs can lead to combos that shave off roughly half your life. So after losing half your life from the first combo, you have only 1 or 2 chances to properly avoid his next move or else you get hit again by another combo effectively killing you or leaving you with roughly 10% HP in just a couple seconds since the start of the match. Skullgirls seriously needs a better combo break mechanic and/or more HP on it's characters as there is very little breathing room if you're on the losing end of the match.\n\nAnother frustrating thing about SG's online play is that you spend more time waiting for an opponent rather than actually playing against him. Keyword there is PLAYING. Because spending the match sitting there while watching your opponent use your character as a combo training dummy does NOT count as playing (again, little room for error).\n\nSkullgirls' visuals and sounds are amazing however. The HD hand drawn high frame sprites are impressive. And the overall character and background design along with the music fits well with the Gatsby era theme.","March 9, 2014","false","58.1"," 148 of 284 people (52%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","52","148","284","12","7"

It's got some really great art and animation, some character designs that I personally really dig, a really cool jazzy soundtrack, really fun gameplay, some surprisingly alright writing, and probably the best, most clear and concise tutorial in any fighting game I've ever played.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is the art gallery. Skullgirls has some genuinely stellar stuff, and the art gallery lets you look at stuff ranging from animation key frames to concept art and arena backgrounds. It also lets you look at several pieces of guest art, quite a few pieces of which are pretty awesome alone. If you enjoy looking at concept art and all that jazz, you'll find plenty of it.\n\nI've never been a huge fighting games dude, but Skullgirls' tutorial taught me just enough to start really enjoying them, and it's a really awesome game in it's own right. If you're looking to get into fighting games, this is a good one to start with.","January 12, 2015","true","12.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game plays sort of like Marvel vs Capcom 2 but is still very different. One thing that makes this game stand out from other fighting games is it's tutorial, most tutorials just have you placed against a dummy and displays some moves on screen however Skullgirls gives you a real introduction to the game. It teaches you basic fighting game mechanics which is beneficial for teaching beginners and can still be refreshing for experts. Despite all of this the game can be very challenging due to it's incredibly high skill cap. All in all this game is amazing and is worth every penny it's especially a steal when on sale. If you've ever wanted to begin to play fighting games or are looking for a new one Skullgirls is a must buy.","November 30, 2013","true","208.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Solid tutorial and relatively simple mechanics and specials inputs make it really acessible but complex enough to be enjoyable. The art is amazing and each frame is hand-drawn, which makes it stand out among others, few characters but each feels very different and are hard to master. Amazing music and the best netcode I've seen in a fighting game(PC Fighting games are often notorious for having bad online modes, which just kills the game). Story mode is kinda weak aside from the DLC characters, but that's about the only problem I have with it. Just really great overall, if you want to get into fighting games, this is your best bet.\n\nPlus it has waifus.","September 23, 2014","true","45.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

I'm one of those people that pauses fighting games in the middle of a match to look up moves and combos, and having a place where I was taught, not only how to use them, but when to use them, was incredible for me. I mean, yeah, it has great art, an awesome soundtrack, unforgettable characters and awesome mechanics, but the fact that it actually taught me, in-depth, how to play the game, was what sold it for me. If you too are a fighting game noob, this is probably one of the better ones to pick up. Word of advice, though: Don't go online unless you're actually good at the game.

This is a six button fighter that can be played with normal powered teams, a strong tag team, or an overpowered single character. The option to be able to choose how many chatacters you want to bring into a match allows you to play the game in a numerous of ways, and brings different learning curves.\n\nThe in-game tutorial is the best I have seen in a fighting game, to date. This is a good place to start with fighters, just for the simple fact that it tries to teach newcomers the nuances of the genre, and not just combos. Although, there are plenty of advanced combos that require precise execution and memory, that put games like MvC and Blaz Blue to shame, if you are interested in high-level play.\n\nControls are fluid and responsive, any time my fighter did something I didn't intend for her to do, I knew I was at fault and that it wasn't due to bad mechanics. Combos are easily to learn and execute but like all fighters, require some time to learn. I have tried playing with a Keyboard, Gamepad, and Arcade stick, and can say you will probably need a pad or stick to play this game. Don't get me wrong it is very possible to play with a keyboard, (and from personal experience, actually kinda fun) but it will be hard to play characters who rely on Z motions.\n\nThe 2-D sprites are detailed and animated fluidly. The developers did a good job incorporating each characters personality into their fighting styles, if you can appreciate such things. Each character even has their own animation and properties for their tag ins and outs. (something I wish Marvel had)\n\nEven though most people probably don't go into fighters looking for a story, the game does feature a story mode, that has suprisingly good lore, and interesting characters, with a final boss that may well rival Shao Kahn. So even if you are looking for a single player fighter, there is something to be found here.","February 9, 2014","true","52.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Someone bought it for me, and i wasn't expecting to really get much out of it, but now it's quickly become one of my favourites. I've purchased the game 3 times now (once on xbox, and twice for other people), as well as some merch.\n\nThe characters may not seem like much upon first impression, and there isn't a huge roster to choose from (There are still a good few choices), but you'll grow to like them a lot. Each character is unique, and you can tell that the developers really put their heart into giving each character a distinct playstyle, as well as an interesting personality. There's something for everyone. The game itself just feels very smooth and comfortable, and the art style, and animations are GREAT. I've never seen a game that looks as nice as this one.\n\nThis is also a great game for beginners to the genre. I am one myself (And by god was i bad when i first started.), only just getting into them recently, and the tutorials in this game were very clear and in depth, and will teach you enough to get started. Of course if you want to be decent at the game you will need to put in more time, and really learn the game. Veterans will love it too. There is plenty of depth, and it doesnt cut corners.\n\nThe developers really put a lot of love into this game too, with frequent updates, often featuring new content, and even more characters are on the way. Also, each new character DLC is free for a few months, to thank those that chose to support the game early, so if you buy it now it will pay off.\n\nThis is the kind of game that if you put some time into it, you will really grow to love it. If you think you will enjoy this game, you probably will and even if you don't expect to get too much out of it, it might suprise you. In short, if you think you may enjoy it, then buy it. It's well worth the price.","October 19, 2014","true","279.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's a little bit dark too, with a tremendous amount of fanservice, so this is not quite fit for your child play. The animation sprite is jaw dropping: very detail, a lot of works put into it, it's simply GREAT. Meanwhile the cut-scene and background seems like very rough, in some point feels not finished and looks like made in a very rushy work.\n\nYou want to take air domination in the game? use Filia. Wanna troll your enemy with projectile spam from down and above? use Peacock . Wanna play music while fighting? use Big Band (I'm dead serious). Every single character is very unique, in a way that some char feels specifically designed to be some 'specialist' in a particular playing style. The roster is small, but it speaks quality, that's quite amazing, not to mention that developer doing a very good job to make sure all the char is well balanced.\n\nEspecially for a newcomer, it will be very worth it to finish the tutorial stage. It's explaining all the things you need to know in the world of 2D fighting game, as simple as possible. I found out that learn from Skullgirls tutorial is way more fun than learning from other more complicated game like Blazblue.\n\nSo you buy the game and jump into it, and feels sucks as combo doesn't connect, you got humiliated in the online play, or feels that Marie is too god damn broken? Fighting genre isn't like other major genre in video games, it puts you directly into the stage with your true skill, so you must be sucks in your early hours. Most people do.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlexOfSpades/recommended/245170/","AlexOfSpades","AlexOfSpades","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlexOfSpades/","97 products in account","Skullgirls is an indie, 2d fighting game with the most lovely animations and characters ever, plus great gameplay. Some people came for nostalgia, some people came for the girls, but everyone stayed thanks to the amazing fighting gameplay it offers.\n\n- Characters and Story\n\nBelieve it or not, this is a big part of the game actually - i have never played a fighting game with such likeable roster and interesting story. I expected the classic cutscenes where the character just "wants to be the best fighter ever!" and boy, i was wrong.  I started the game playing mostly with Valentine (the sexy nurse ninja) and Cerebella (Circus superstar with Vice-Versa, a hat with two superstrong arms) and their stories are already engaging (at least for a fighting game), but the most fun i've had was with Peacock. Her story mode was an emotional roller-coaster, oscillating between hilarious scenes that had me laughing out loud and moments that had me almost crying. While other fighting games have a bland roster with no personality (sometimes characters are just a recolor of others), in Skullgirls i can see that every character had a lot of love put on them during development. They're fleshed out, they're lovely, they're great.\n\nMy only complaint: The roster could be bigger. But hey, it's an indie game, so i'll let that pass.\n\n- Gameplay (The Part that Really Matters)\n\nIt's perfect. That's just how i can sum this up. Responsive, fast-paced, varied and very fun. If you like fighting games, this is right up your alley - it reminded me a lot of Guilty Gear and Marvel VS Capcom games, with aerial combos, several flashy ultra attacks for every character, insane combos and switching between characters of your team mid-fight. With a twist - you don't necessarily have to play a team, you can play with a single character or two high-powered characters instead of a crew of 3, if you want to sacrifice versatility in exchange for more power for your favorite character. Oh, and another fun addition - You know in Marvel vs Capcom when you were about to defeat one of the enemy's teammates and he switched? So, in Skullgirls you can punch out one of his characters and force another one to come back, at the cost of 1 level of your Blockbuster (special moves). Neat idea right? Another thing i loved is how several of the characters play in a really interesting way. I expected fighting game tropes (the ryu clone, the combo guy, etc) that every fighting game is plagued with, but every character in Skullgirls fights in their unique way. Some of them may remind you of someone else (Like Parasoul reminds me of Testament from GG), but they always have their own, original traits and twists.\n\n- Audio and Visuals\n\nFlawless! I love it! The soundtrack does not disappoint, fitting the stage and gameplay (i especially love the  Training Room tune ), and the character's voices really impressed me. There is a very wide array of lines for every character, making sure they don't repeat the same sentence even when you repeat the same attack, and they call each other's names when switching teammates mid-fight, they have several unique lines to greet every specific character AND for their victory animations. Usually in fighting games the audio gets a bit repetitive after a while, but this is not the case. I actually still hear new lines whenever i play.\n\nAnd the visuals? Oh man. Maybe this games' biggest selling point? The hand-drawn, high-framerate animations are absolutely amazing. Reminds me of Darkstalkers actually - the likeable characters and excellent animations. Again, when i played with Valentine and Cerebella i was already impressed, but the highest point so far was Peacock ; she's downright hilarious when fighting, following that classic Disney animation style, very cartoony and fun. I think the visuals, together with the gameplay, are the best parts of this game - and they should be, that's exactly what matters in a fighting game.\n\nMy only complaint: Every character has just one victory animation. (and one for time-out). Although they're not sooo repetitive since they have several lines to say, i wouldn't complain if we got more.\n\n- So, Should i Buy this Game? (TL;DR)\n\nDo you like fighting games? If you do, YES. Buy Skullgirls and you will not be disappointed.\n\nYou don't like fighting games? Well, you're about to. Skullgirls will get you in the genre, guaranteed. I actually suck at fighting games (my specialty is shooters), and this game entertained me a lot. It's worth your money and more - I actually regret buying it on a sale, they deserved more money from me.","March 30, 2014","true","151.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"

You get\nready for the day and are about to go out\nthe door when you notice a note at the foot\nof your front door. Entitled 'Starboy', you\nturn it over and see a silver wax seal from a\ngame you recognize.\n\nSKULLGIRLS.\n\nYour mind wanders a bit to the premise of\nSkullgirls, where a gaggle of different girls\nfight each other in a barely-fleshed (literally)\nbackground world over the Skullheart, a\ntalisman of immense power able to grant any\nwish for any girl who possesses it.\n\nThe Skullheart, the macguffin and entire\nreason why the game Skullgirls even takes\nplace, stares back at you, the seal on the\nletter. It seems that Summer-Rain left in a\nhurry but took the time to prepare you such\na letter. But the reading of it would have to\nwait- you want to be early for today's\nSociology class.\n\nYou are out the door when you see a sight\nyou'd never thought you would. With hair\naccented green and looking like a 50's\npin-up girl, the now-Mrs. Novocaine looks\nat you expectantly.\n\n"...Mrs. Novocaine." You manage a rasp.\n\n"Starboy." She responds, looking just like\nhow you remembered. Lovely. Radiant.\nBeautiful. "It's... Coldheart. Formalities,\nlike you wanted, Ma'am." She fidgets ever\nso slightly, putting her hand on her arm\nbefore walking towards you. "I wanted to\ncheck how you were doing." Your memories\nof Ms. Novocaine match up with Filia, one\nof the primary mascots and popular girls\nof Skullgirls, but now, she looks like the\nhaughty and evil Eliza from the game.\n\n"Fine, thanks. I'm on my way to school.\nSome people have futures to prepare for,\nyou know? Other than creating trouble,\nfinding issues with police and thinking\nbeing a vegan makes you superior to\nother people." You finish the mouthful\nof a sentence, eyes narrowing, mindful\nof how much you resemble Novocaine\nherself in your own mind's eye.\n\n"Starboy... I..." You deign to allow her\nthe oppurtunity to finish, rushing past\nher and going to school. When you enter\nSociology class, you find Summer-Rain\nlooking out the window before her entire\ndemeanor changes. "Starboy...! Did you\nget my-" You sit next to Summer-Rain,\ntelling her that Mrs. Novocaine arrived\nat the house.\n\n"What are you gonna do?" Summer-Rain\nlooks worried, but a familiar voice answers\non her behalf. "I'll tell you what he- and\nyou'll- do!" The entire classroom becomes\npetrified stone and Mrs. Novocaine stands\nat the class doorway, holding up the\nSkullheart itself. Summer-Rain gets up,\nfurious. "NOVOCAINE!" You are about to\nreact when your legs turn to stone, rooting\nyou to the floor. "STARBOY!" Summer-Rain\nexclaims, trying to pull you free.\n\n"He'll be fine darling." Mrs. Novocaine starts,\nbefore telling both you and Summer-Rain\nthat she made a mistake in stealing you\naway from her and now she will retake you\nback from the thieving hands of the very\n♥♥♥♥♥♥-off-looking Summer-Rain. "In case\nyou forgot, you left him and got married to\none of the worst people in the entire town!"\n\nMrs. Novocaine uses the power of the stolen\nSkullheart she ripped from Skullgirls to take\nthe form of Eliza, egyptian go-go girl and\nsultry fighter, flaunting her sexuality. She\nflings the almost-drained Skullheart away\nto Summer-Rain, who uses the talisman to\ntake on Filia's form, with her symbiote\nSamson's ebon power snapping wildly around\nyou, trying to defend you against your ex.\n\n"Give my boyfriend back. I'll leave that loser\nHollywood and his hunchbacked friend to get\nback what is rightfully mine!" Mrs. Novocaine\nshouts, attacking Summer-Rain with a flurry\nof staff strikes while purposely flaunting her\ntoned body.\n\n"Make me, Novocaine! He's mine now, I've\nwaited years to be with him after the way\nyou treated him... and left him!" Samson's\nsymbiote powers counter almost all of\nMrs. Novocaine's attacks, before allowing\nan opening for Summer-Rain to hit her with\na flying kick to the jaw. Mrs. Novocaine lies\nsprawled across the classroom floor, and\neverything returns to normal, students and\nteachers blinking it all away like a dream.\n\nThe Skullheart rolls to your restored feet\nand you pick it up, turning round to see\nSummer-Rain looking at you with a terse\nsmile. You take a look at the talisman\nbefore handing it over to her, whereupon\nshe throws it to the floor, crushing it. You\nare dumbstruck, asking Summer-Rain why\nshe would do that when it would have\ngranted her anything she wanted.\n\nSummer-Rain smiles her signature smile\nnow, before taking your hands and pressing\nherself close to you. "Starboy... I already\nhave what I want, and could ever wish for."\nYou are about to lean in for a kiss when\nMrs. Novocaine shoves you away from\nSummer-Rain, and the letter falls out of\nyour hoodie pocket. Before anyone can\nreact, Mrs. Novocaine seizes the letter,\nbounding out of the classroom window\nlaughing daggers at both of you.\n\n"That bitc-" You shush Summer-Rain, as\nRavemeister, The Fatman and your other\nclassmates enter your class to find out\nwhat the hubbub is. "You didn't read it."\nSummer-Rain pouts, rubbing her arm.\n"I'm sorry. I meant to. I'll get it back."\n\nSummer-Rain looks back at you, with\nSamson's shadow and eyes set in her\nhair. You know you can't let your girl\ndown- that's right... your girlfriend.\n"I will, Summer. I promise." The Skullgirl\nbeams back at you, winking as her hair\nsnaps back from symbiote tendrils to\nher current shade of black-purple,\nhumming your favourite song,\n'Clocks and Timepieces' as she walks\nback to her desk and the day carries on\nas if nothing happened.\n\nSKULLGIRLS.\n\nThe ultimate match-up between old\nloves and new loves.","January 11","true","5.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","6","9","5","0"

It takes elements from my favorite fighting games like a ratio system, team matches, assists, etc, and manages to improve them further with things like custom assists, an infinite prevention system, automatch round scaling for 1v1 fights, etc. In addition, the dev team has been incredibly involved with the community in tuning and balancing the game as much as they can. I feel like it's the first fighting game to have what is essentially a "living design" that is present in so many MMO's and expandable/collectible tabletop games.\n\nThe character art and animation is among the best in hand-drawn games, hearkening back to Darkstalkers and really only rivaled by vanillaware titles.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/devlkore/recommended/245170/","devlkore","devlkore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/devlkore/","433 products in account","My review is going to focus on the mechanics of the game but let me say this game has everything:\n\n- The story, presentation, graphics and audio create a wonderful universe.\n- The interactive tutorials teach you about the characters, game systems and fighting games as a whole (mix ups, hit confirms, etc.)\n- Best tools in practice mode of any fighting game I know of (I've played A LOT), including hitbox and hitstun display, slow motion, 'as reversal' dummy playback, savestates and more.\n- GGPO netcode.\n\nOn to the actual fighting. Skullgirls can be played with mixed solo characters and teams of 2 or 3. Health, damage and defense are scaled so it's balanced. I prefer teams of 2 and occasionally 3, but a solo character can overwhelm a team if they get the momentum. Teams have assists and tagging similar to Marvel, though you can use any normal/special/throw attack as an assistant and all characters have unique tag in attacks.\n\nI really like the amount you can customise your team. It definitely helps offset what some might see as a limited roster of characters.\n\nSpeaking of characters current cast of 12 (eventually to be 14) are all very unique and represent a wide variety of styles. My favourites are Big Band, the slow armour character that can actually play music (also he can parry), Cerebella, the grappler that also glides and can reflect projectiles, Valentine, because she's a ninja and can move wherever she wants and Eliza, the "stand" character. There's also a Scorpion/Angel hybrid stance character, a John Talbain pro wrestler, a dismembered cat girl with rekkas (and is also a doll character) and Fukua, the joke character that has a dragon kick so win all round.\n\nAll characters have special moves and supers, for the most part very much like Street Fighter moves. Supers use 2 buttons rather than double motions. If playing with a team you can tag mid super into the next characters super. There is however no ability to perform multiple simultaneous super moves.\n\nCombos are largely formed out of chains, going in traditional "magic series", though there are links and plenty of unique chains. The combo system is very free form, the limiting factors are the infinite prevention system (IPS) and drama/undizzy bar. These limits are a good thing, they keep you from repeating the same thing over and over, keeping combos interesting and stopping any single combo from going on for too long. There are still high damage combos but you can't just loop something until timeout or death.\n\nIf a combo starts to loop the player getting hit can burst out for free. This means you have to either end your combo or try to reset the other player into another combo, or even bait the burst and attack after.\n\nThere are many unique character specific systems that make the game interesting and give the characters more depth. Big Band can parry attacks, Squigly can cancel normal attacks and move the screen around, Valentine can inflict 3 status effects and resurrect dead teammates, Painwheel can fly and absorb then reflect damage, and so many others.\n\nCharacter diversity is definitely one of the games strong points.\n\nSo in summary, I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves 2D fighting games or would like to start playing them and to anyone who likes fighting games and appreciates the story and art. If I had to put a number on it I'd say 5/5, it's "perfect", everything it sets out to do it does beyond expected of a fighting game.","February 8, 2015","true","17.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The characters are all hilarious. (Yes even double) the gameplay is simplistic but can be deeper if you want but once you know the basics with this game unlike other fighting games you can stand a chance when fighting people better than you, HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS TOO. Once you miss a block, get ready for a 36 second 48 combo. seriously that's just really annoying... Another thing is the zoning in this game is HIGHLY exploitable for people who don't know how to counter it, I picked peacock and double/big band and I would have the assist knock them to the edge of the screen and spam perjectiles then slightly mix things up. It would grant me a win more times then I should have... And it's not even that I was more skilled then them or anything like that.. At first I thought this was fun but after being kicked countless times and then being kicked from a livestream. I thought maybe the kickers had a point... Am I going to stop being a spammer online if I'm fighting a n00b? NO. because it's an easy win. A skilled player would not lose to such shinanagins...","July 1, 2014","true","97.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's more in line with Marvel vs Capcom, but slowed down a little bit in a  good way. New players of the fighting game genre should find solace in this title as it has a solid tutorial that nudges you and gives you raw facts about how fighting games work, even going so far as to mention and explain a multitude of fighting game jargon most wouldn't understand. The game is slowed down in a way that positively makes it feel different from other titles which also lends itself to being easier to read, something most games fail to deliver on. Combos are intentional, opportunity windows are fruitful for engaging in a back and forth bout every fight, character balance is spot on, and every character feels unique. They hit many of the generic character archetpes found in Capcom fighters so if that's your main jam, you can bet your but you'll gind a character to like here. There was a lot of care put into this hand drawn game and you can tell it's made by people who truly love the fighting game community and fighting games. If you like Capcom fighters or MVC, pick it up, it's worth the money!","May 1, 2015","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had some expectations for this game since I've first heard about it years ago and so far it has surpassed them.\nFirst thing first ~ The Art:\n\nBeleive me when I say this is a beautiful game. All sprites were hand drawn with a combination of western and eastern styles and have a high number of animation frames, making them move quite smoothly. The use of 2D characters in a 3D engine works well in making the characters feel like they belong in the enviroment. Honestly, it's better if you just take a look at the game to see what I mean.\n\nAnd if you're into them: Boobs.\n\nFight! ~ Gameplay:\n\nThe game has a six button lay out for three punches and three kicks, allowing for a large variation of combos and tricks. Each character has unique mechanics that seperates them from the rest of the cast. The game does a good job of being accessible for both veteran fighting game players and those looking for a fun time with friends. The game also includes an in-depth tutorial for basic fighting mechanics and for specific charaters you want to play. Do note: Like any other fighting game, you'll have to invest a lot of time into this game if you want to play competitive, espacially if you rarely touch a fighting game before. Seeking help is not a bad idea, which brings me to...\n\nSaved by the Fans ~ The Community:\n\nI've had very little interactions with the Skullgirls community. However, it has been very welcoming and it has a lively following, which has kept the game alive for this long. Go look at the Indiegogo campaing for more information.\n\nAll there in the Manual ~ The Story:\n\nWhat you expect from a fighting game story: people beat up people, roll credits. It starts of slow, and not much is even reveal during the actual game, forcing you to look up the lore on the internet. But it doesn't fail at giving each character their own personanilty. It isn't until the DLC Characters where the story actually gets exciting.\n\nIn A Moment's Time ~ The Music:\n\nThe soundtrack does its job of setting the atmosphere in both fights and story segments. However, the tracks don't really stand out too much from each other and are forgettable if you're not crazy about music. This is, of course, more of a personal opinion.Overall: is worth picking up along with the DLC characters. If you are even a little interested in this game, it won't dissapoint.\n\nTHAT'S A WRAP!","June 13, 2015","true","130.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you don't like arcade fighting games, well, you probably won't like Skullgirls.\n\nThat being said, if you do like the arcade fighting genre in the slightest this is a must-buy game.  Mechanically the game is among the best as far as fighters go but it's the memorable characters, beautiful artstyle and the imaginitive world on top of the extremely polished gameplay that take this game from being 'great' to being 'absolutely amazing.'\n\nSkullgirls is great for beginners looking to get into the genre as well, offering an extensive tutorial mode that covers the basics all the way up to mechanically-demanding mixups. (Combos that are unpredictable) Sure, tutorials are common in fighting games, however, the sheer depth of Skullgirls' tutorial is what makes it deserving of praise.\n\nMechanically each of the characters are as diverse as their personalities. Through the tutorial you'll learn each character's role and weaknesses and as new characters are added they're given lessons in the tutorial as well, giving all the more reason to endlessly praise Skullgirls' tutorial.\n\nThe roster, although seemingly tiny, is being rounded out by additionally characters being added in future patches. At the time of writing this, three of those characters have been released with the remaining two being actively developed which round out the diverse roster of characters beautifully.\n\nThat being said, the game is constantly being updated and patched with no sign of the developer stopping any time soon.\n\nThe game is fanservice-y, yes. Is it tasteful? Honestly, yes, it's appropriate in the context of the game and the characters\nwithin it. If you can't handle female characters in sexualized outfits/poses then I don't know how you've played any other fighting game to be honest. The problem isn't that the characters are designed this way, it's that you have overly selective eyes and an extremely closed mind.\n\nSo here’s where we’re at when all is said and done: we have a fighting game set in a gloriously original world, racked out with unique characters whose hand drawn animations are stunningly detailed. The soundtrack of the game is – at least for jazz fans – beautiful enough to warrant an OST purchase all on its own. The graphical presentation is phenomenal, the story mode is entertaining, the characters are unique and engaging as a whole. For fans of this genre do yourself a favor and purchase this game. At the $14.99 price point it's a steal as it's worth double that at the very least.","October 3, 2014","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The input system is awesome aswell. It has a 6 button map, like SF4 with SF4 motions(DP,360, qcf,qcb etc) with a cancell system like most anime games. The game has a versatile option for teams aswell, you can choose to rock solo, duo or a 3 man team(like MVC-series) and all 3 are balanced( solo=more health/damage etc). Not to mention it has the best netcode(from europe to US no lag) and training mode I've ever experienced in a fighting game.\n\nOne of the best decisions I made is to buy it, really fun, competitive and balanced game.\n","June 5, 2015","true","84.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is one of my favorite fighting games of all times! If you like actual fighting games then pick up this title! It's so awesome, with the team options there is so much diversity! Each character is so different to and when I saw that I mean VERY different, not the classic street fighter style of you have a different punch but you're basically Ryu. Every character is balanced to, sure there are always exploits like all fighting games but against a decent enough player cheesing won't work. My favorite thing about the game, aside from the handdrawn art and the company itself, is that if you don't want a 'team' you don't have to. You get to choose between 1-3 characters, the less characters the more HP they have. The story mode is nice as well, especially with the DLC characters in it. It's very fluent and writing is pretty good, unlike this review.. writing isn't my strongest suit. With the announcement of 2nd Encore I even recommend this game even more, because us steam folk will be getting that as well: with more story, more gameplay modes, and I think more characters!\n\nSo yes buy this, the only fighter I ever liked more than Skullgirls has been the Guilty Gear series and that alone should be enough of a reason to buy it :P\n","June 3, 2015","true","27.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It’s an incredibly fun,addictive game that draws you in without you even noticing, feeling like a triple a title instead of an indie game. It’s fantastically creative art style is refreshing and the soundtrack is wonderful (especially Skull Heart Arrhythmia - get's you pumped!), providing a really nice, comfortable fighter experience. The only other fighting games I have played are MK v DC, Street Fighter and Smash Brothers (does that class as a fighter?) but skullgirls completely blows these games away, sustaining a feel of fresh gameplay every time I play it, where I’m constantly learning new things even after the extremely helpful and noob-friendly tutorial that helped me out a lot!\nSo overall:\n\nPros:\n- Fresh art style\n- Fantastically well designed characters, makes you want to experience the story and find out more details.\n- Multiplayer (versus) is fast and fluid.\n- Tutorial is one of the most informative I’ve seen in a fighter.\n- The gameplay is smooth allowing you to mix up your combos quickly, tons of fun!\n- Playing with friends is a breeze.\n\nCons:\n- The only real criticism I could give Skullgirls is its matchmaking system. If it was based on skill level instead of pairing you quickly in a match/joining a randomly titled ‘Beginners welcome’ match and getting locked in a 90000 hit combo, I believe the game would have a bigger online community. However, having said that I learn more from fighting tougher opponents than those on the same level as me.","November 29, 2013","true","41.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It takes elements from my favorite fighting games like a ratio system, team matches, assists, etc, and manages to improve them further with things like custom assists, an infinite prevention system, automatch round scaling for 1v1 fights, etc. In addition, the dev team has been incredibly involved with the community in tuning and balancing the game as much as they can. I feel like it's the first fighting game to have what is essentially a "living design" that is present in so many MMO's and expandable/collectible tabletop games.\n\nThe character art and animation is among the best in hand-drawn games, hearkening back to Darkstalkers and really only rivaled by vanillaware titles. Despite the intial stigma as an "anime cutsey-fighter," Skullgirls is one of the best fighting experiences I've had in recent memory; if you're a fan of fighting games or looking to get into them, I hands-down recommend it.","August 24, 2013","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I love the animation, the fighting, the soundtrack (even if you don't like anything else, you can't say no to the soundtrack) and even the developers. I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME. I think the only reason it took me this long to write a review was because i didn't know how to explain all of it's awesomness.\n\nYou can tell these developers love their fanbase and they're treating us oh so nicely... other companies, here's a great example of awesome developers. They're letting their fans vote on which DLC characters get in, as well as said DLC characters being FREE for download up to 3 months after their release. And sure the DLC list may be pretty small at the time of this review, but as long as the developers are being supported, there's more coming our way!\n\nBut enough of that...\n\nThe Good:\n- The animation\n- The characters\n- The soundtrack\n- The backgrounds\n- The voice acting\n- The DLC (on that note, before Big Band's release, we even got Fukua. Although meant to be an april fool's joke, the developers kept her in due to her being a fan favorite. So you may or may not count Fukua as an extra DLC character)\n- The story (especially the DLC characters Squiggly, Big Band and Eliza, at the time of reviewing)\n- Unique feel to the characters\n- The multitude of popculture refernces (have fun finding them all)\n- The narrator (COME ON DRUNK NARRATOR VOICE PACK! GET RELEASED ALREADY!)\n- The game play\n- Training Mode\n- ABSOFRUKLY EVERYTHING!\n\nI honestly can't think of anything bad to say about this game. And trying to think of bad stuff to say about it brings up little annoyances but nothing that breaks the game entirely or would bother anyone to the point of a rage quit (with maybe one exception).\n\nThe little annoyances or 'the bad' if you will are very minor things that you learn to deal with eventually or can just avoid at your leissure. Maybe it'll bother you, maybe it won't, but that depends on your play style and tolerance to fighting games.\n\n- Peacock is a keep-away  character and will spam her bombs and other cartoony antics at you until you've been his so many times by little 8-ball bombs that you get a little frustrated or own her via block buster moves. First time playing, she annoyed me at first but you get used to fighting her own time and will develop ways around her multitude of bombs and planes flying at you constantly. (and for a 90's kid like me, the fact she makes so many refferences to well-loved cartoons is also a plus. i giggle everytime she says 'Hellooooooooo Nurse!')\n- Fukua, a character added through a patch as an April Fool's joke (to poke fun at SF's Decapre). Her story mode seems somewhat random compared to the rest but you fight all of the characters in your roster with Filia as the final boss. AND OMG FILIA AS A BOSS IN FUKUA'S STORY MODE WAS SO FRIGGIN DIFFICULT I RAGE QUIT MULTIPLE TIMES. I eventually figured out how to beat her or at least keep her down long enough to attack so i beat Fukua's story mode... But fighting Filia as a final boss in that storymode... you'd think the game was hacked or on Nightmare mode even when you have it on Easy difficulty. I promptly gave her the nickname 'cracklia' because she moved so fast and rapid that i didnt have time to make Fukua react... You will get your ♥♥♥ pummeled mutliple times over before you beat Fukua's story mode (the ending though... is fanfic worthy...)\n- Some moves that require you to move the analog stick or directional buttons diagonally and in a certain pattern really confused me (could be because i never grew up playing XBOX though, so it may just be me still adjusting to the controller). These moves are a challenge to pull off in training mode, often resulting in my skipping training\n- Big Band is overpowered compared to a lot of the cast, which might make you rage quit your first few times fighting him but you can find ways around it similar to fighting Peacock. I'd still prefer fighting Peacock to Big Band though\n- Without the DLC characters the original roster was 8 characters. Fukua is now included through a patch so you may say there are 9 characters in the base game now?\n\nThat's all i can really say about the so called 'bad'...\n\nBut before i end this review, i need to say something serious (and i don't mean to sound feminist)\n\nI feel it's ok to have your waifus and fanservice girls in anime, manga and games. I don't say boo to a female character with a large chest, butt or anything else for that matter. In fact sometimes these characters are enjoyable because they can bring comedy or light-heartedness into a story. To me even the 'fanservicey' characters in Skullgirls feel really balanced and don't let their ♥♥♥ or assests define them entirely. I feel these characters are a perfect harmony between actually having a personality with depth and also not being afraid to show some leg ;3\n\nBut one thing that annoys me about Skullgirls isn't anything that's the developers fault.\n\nIt's the people who assume this game is soley for fanservice and gawking at oppai all day.\n\n>:( and i'm NOT bashing either gender, BOTH genders are equally guilty for this rant\n\nOften these monsters never even play the actual game and just look at it and say 'oh, all those characters are ♥♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥♥s because their chests are a certain size and they have lots of panty shots' That honestly breaks me down as a female gamer... I'm not a feminist or trying to sound that way, but those people need to fruk off. These are the same people who think even awesome and powerful Bayonetta is solely a sex symbol and that if a girl is in a game, she's a sex symbol or for fanservice or any other number of dumb, stupid, uneducated reasons.\n\nSkullgirls makes me happy to be a gamer (who just so happens to be a lady).\n\nIt's giving the gaming industry some more strong female characters without having 'FEMINISM' written on the cover art. It's bringing together MALE AND FEMALE gamers who can play together in peace and not have an argument over sexism and equal rights for women. All the girls in this game kick-♥♥♥ and are awesome to play as. They're strong, powerful and confident girls who i love to accompany on their adventures to get the Skull Heart.

I like my fighter a bit more clean. That and all the negative things I've heard about the game (mind you this was when they game was brand new).\n\nBut recently I decided to give this game a try, mainly because I really like MikeZ and wanted to support him, and I'm really glad I did. This game is great!\n\nYou can tell that MikeZ has put a lot of thought into this game and if you play other figthers you wish that some features that SG has was the standard.  Like what's key for a good fighter nowadays? Good N E T C O D E, period.\n\nToo many developers overlook this or simply doesn't care because they know that their game will sell anyway (NRS etc) and that's just sad. I haven't played Killer Instinc online (heard great things about that netcode) but the GGPO rollback netcode for this game is by far the best netcode I've come across. Thank you based MikeZ!\n\nEverything else about the game is just fantastic! Great visuals has it's own style which gives this game it's own identity and it also has excellent music to accompany that. But the thing I like the most about this game is the character designs and their respective playstyle. They're so cool and fun to play and for the most part really easy to pick up and play. I don't care if some ideas are borrowed elsewhere because I think it's cool as long as you build and further exploring the possibilities of that borrowed idea. And clearly this is the case here.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is that there are too many clone characters in the game (sure they play very differently but they're still clones) and I'm also aware that some of them are in there as a joke but that doesn't change the fact they're clones, jokes on you I'm afraid.\n\nI do like fighters with small character lineups but not when many of them are clones.\nI'd love to see MikeZ add a few original characters to the DLC lineup. But he's done with this game, right? :'( :'(\n\nAnyways I give this 8.5/10 I highly recommend this game.\nAnd thanks MikeZ and Cowboy for the PS4 drivers <3, you guys are godlike!","August 5, 2015","true","21.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Each character have their own personalities, motives, and implication in the series lore. Their personalities come out in the gameplay, with their moveset or quotes. The story mode, while not very long like Blazblue, are interesting and added more personalities to the characters. Each characters has their own story yet none was stated canon, which open many more narrative possibilities.\n\nThe setting of the game is unique to the fighting because of the jazzy feeling they give. The soundtracks are great, especially the theme song.\n\nThe developer also done good jobs on fleshing the characters while listening to the feedback from the player. Their blogs are interesting and informative. With more of DLC characters come up, I can't wait to see what they are up to.\n\nEven though I'm still getting beaten up in online play, I still enjoy the game, especially playing with friends.\nGet the game!\nGet the DLC!

A good majority of the characters are female, 2. every character has her (or his) own individual personality and moveset, 3.

Mastering the characters is quite difficult, but also extremely rewarding, so the game makes does repay the time you spend on it. Plenty of fun in single player, terrific on multiplayer with friends (online it's kind of difficult). Roster is awesome, with really balanced, unique and charismatic characters.

Veterans of other fighting game can pick this up and feel at home immediately. Considering this is my first serious Fighting Game, all moveset, combos are well illustrated and easy to perform even for newbies like me.\n\nThe graphics and animations are top notch as well, love the jazzy BGM and art style too. Its a pity this game doesnt have much characters. There is so much satisfaction in pulling off a well executed combos and defeating the opponent (i.e. friends next to you or online). My only concern is that if Skullgirls have at least 15 characters to pick from, this would be a must own for any fighting game enthusiasts (current one is more than good enough, but more characters is always better ;) ). Not to mention, a little fanservice is always healthy especially for male players. I know im not complaining. :P Frankly, if youre going to complain about that aspect, you wouldnt even buy nor play this in the first place.\n\nSingle-player wise, the storyline is interesting enough for you to complete and a little extra background story for the characters are sweet additions. Marie is quite a cheap boss though, lots of time the only way to defeat her is to mash the same move again and again and repeat certain "procedures" to force her into using easily defendable and predictable  attack moves. Considering that your combos are useless against her and she cant be stunned from hits, fighting Marie on Nightmare difficulty is downright near impossible especially during 3rd Phase. (or thats just me not gitting gud enough)\n\nOverall, i give it a 9/10, must own. As of this time this review is written, there are several more characters soon to be introduced (should be Beowulf and Robo-Fortune)\n\nPS: Squigly's hopping/Leviathan-skipping are extremely adorable :3","December 22, 2014","true","48.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Skullgirls is probably hands down my favorite fighting game. While more technical fighters certainly exist, this game nails exactly what it's going for. If you're looking for a fighting game that can ease you into the genre, I'd suggest this hands down, the tutorial teaches you everything basic you need to know from walking to more technical play, to a character by character breakdown! With a diverse cast of different afflicted women (and now a few men) with strange powers, there's certainly no lack of variety. The game has an amalgation of mechanics from several fighting games such as Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future, Guilty Gear and so on, not to mention a range of subtle to not so subtle references to comics, anime and media in general. It's easy to spread the basics you learn here to other fighters and pick those up as well!","June 2, 2015","true","42.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The story mode provides a unique story depending on the character you choose, the lentgh of the story (for each character) can range from 15 minutes to an hour depending on the difficulty you are playing on (The Fukua story mode is a ♥♥♥♥♥!) which welcomes a good amount of play time. These characters are also charming in their own right as their personalities each differ and make for some pretty good story telling.\n\nSpeaking of characters there are a total of 14 characters however 5 of them are DLC (1.99 Each) these characters each have their own unique playstyle which will be the preference to the player wheter they like grappling characters, combo characters, or characters that require stratagetic placement of their moves. This was a very welcoming feeling as I hardly felt that any to characters were the same(Besides Filia and Fukua).\n\nEach character also has 25 unique color palettes to choose from which really showed how much these devs cared about the culture nowadays and their product. Every time there was a color pallete based on another game and I was able to recognize that I immeadiatly said to myself "Yeah these devs get me"\n\nThe multi player is solid as all hell and I rarely ever saw the framrate dip because either me or the other player has a bad connection. Although the quick matches for some odd reason don't work all the time for me, the lobby matches worked perfectly. However if you dont practice enough with your prefered characters and deside to jump into a lets say a quick match you are going to get your ♥♥♥ beaten ALOT. As your opponent will rack up combos and combos and combos against you which is my only real issue with this game. Even though their is a built in mechanic where infinite combos aren't allowed I still found at times people were able to do such things (or I just suck)\n\nThe biggest praise i have for this game is its extensive tutorials, these tutorials cover everything to standard movements, blocking, advanced techniques, mix ups, and even diving into specific characters with their movesets and how they play best. This tutorial is the very reason why this is the first game i recommend to anyone who wants to get into the genre.\n\nStages are varied and are mesmerizing to look at, music is also funky to listen too even outside of the game, and frame rate is always consistent.\n\nThis game is one of the best indie and best fighting game I have ever played. This game overall rightfully deserves a 9/10 from me.\n\nThanks for reading","April 10","true","99.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The formula that it only uses female characters (with the exception of future DLC characters) makes it a sort of "Waifu Fighter" in essence that it has a weird mode to turn up or turn down the "drama" in Training mode. The combos are amazing, and the best part is, you can easily learn it (if you have the proper equipment like a gamepad and not a keyboard) instead of just mashing buttons and praying that you win. The story is very unique in a way where some answers can be said with outside research (but who has time for that?). I haven't had any complaints about the roster size because what I've seen through the story is that each character posseses a unique trait to them in a way where they aren't just clones of each other (even with Double).\n\nI'll give this a 9.4/10 would play with friends locally","June 3, 2014","true","42.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nightingaleella/recommended/245170/","Nightingaleella","ArtistNightingale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nightingaleella/","7 products in account","Skullgirls is a 2D fighting game that pays homage to the classic arcade games that came before it, while updating what needs to changed in order to keep up with today's standards. If you grew up playing 2D fighters, then you will feel right at home here. If you didn't, then it's still a great game to get you introduced to the genre; with a cast of characters small enough to be balanced and simple enough comands that aren't exactly as complecated as other fighting games.\n\nEasily one of the best parts of Skullgirls is the presentation of the game. With many recent indie games like Shovel Knight favoring using 8-bit graphics in order to induce nostalgia on those who grew up in the NES era, I am more than glad that this game didn't do something similar. In my opinion, Skullgirls has the best graphics of any game in its genre. The sprites for the characters are all handrawn, and it really shows (in a good way). Not only that, but the world that the game takes place in is very unique and stylized. You get a sort of "futuristic 1940s" vibe from the Canopy Kingdom, and I love every second of it. The music fits the setting and style of the game perfectly as well, with a laid back jazzy feel to it.  Although I will admit, I am very biased towards jazz music and you may not like it personally.\n\nThe actual gameplay is very much what you would expect. It is a 2D fighter, very much modeled after MvC2. In fact, the two feel eerily similar. And seeing that MvC2 is still considered one of the great tournament fighters 15 years after it's release, that's not necessarily a bad thing. So if you're a pro at that game, you'll pick up Skullgirls pretty quickly.\n\nMost of the negatives to the game are very nitpicky and I won't dwell into most of them that much. Some elements of the story (especially the lore) aren't really explained that well; but it's a fighting game, so the story isn't really the focus. The game is much more balanced than something like MvC2, but only for it's vastly smaller roster. There are a few characters who are a little unbalanced.\n\nAnd speaking of characters...\n\nThere is one major complaint that I will dwell on into a bit of detail: is Skullgirls sexist? Most fighting games are...er...bouncy, but Skullgirls in particular has gotten a fair bit of attention for it's main cast of characters being entirely female (the only two playable men in the game are DLC characters), and some of these females being very...well...yeah, they got big boobs. I'm not avoiding it. People are getting all wound up because of the sexualization of most of the characters. As a straight young woman myself, I feel like my opinion is welcome in this debate: I think it's fine. What makes a character sexualized or not is how they show off their assets, not ther assets alone. And even though there is a character who is literally a sexy nurse, the detail and effort that went into how they move and attack is really something to behold. So are the characters sexualized? Yes, but it could have been much worse. Not every character is sexualized, and all of the designs and ideas behind them are very well done (even the sexy nurse).\n\nAll and all, Skullgirls is a fantastic game that delievers everything it promises and more. If the sexualization of the character turns you off a bit (or maybe uncomfortably turns you on ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)), I can't really say I can recommend it to you; but if you're looking for some classic 2D fighting with some style, then this game is perfect for you.\n\n8.5/10","January 3","true","49.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Stayed for an excellent game. Skullgirls is an impressive piece of software - for starters, it really helps you get into the game, while not explaining the base fundamentals of fighting games itself, it does a good job of showing and explaining its own systems and mechanics. Inputs are mostly quarter-circle motions, so if you have ever thrown a fireball in Street Fighter you are good to go - the rest is down to timing the various attack buttons to unleash all kinds of devastating combos. Skullgirls is probably the closest thing we have to "MAHVEL" on Steam, but it takes inspiration from so many other fighting games and adds its own spin on things thus feeling pretty unique. Pick up to three characters and duke it out in a tag-team super battle!\n\nThanks to the indepth tutorial and the limited amount of characters (10, if you include the two DLC characters) it is far less overwhelming than the competition - however, if you want to "git gud" prepare for some brutal encounters online and spending time in the various training and sparring modes to practice combos and different situations.\n\nSkullgirls is nicely flashy too, with gorgeous artwork, excellent animation for a small studio and some really outlandish designs that rival some of the craziest stuff other fighting games throw at you (this is coming from a Darkstalkers-fan). The jazzy soundtrack feels like a nod to Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and complements the action nicely. There are a lot of nods and references to other games like that - from color palettes (I have spotted various Street Fighter, Soul Calibur and even Killer Instinct outfits) to various characters appearing in the background (that training-block from WakuWaku, OMFG!), even Wolverines Berserker Barrage made it in - it is great fun discovering all the little things. But there is more than just fanservice, Skullgirls features a lot of niffty comfort-functions too, like it tells you when you are in the life-lead or lets you switch a versus match to sparring mode on the fly to test stuff out.\n\nOnline is very solid thanks to GGPO, however - I haven't found a way to fight people on my level and as mentioned before online WILL make you humble, so many beastly killers around that will combo you to death with ease. Still, I think Skullgirls is worth a look, since chaining hits together and making combos on the fly just feels so good and the rush of stringing it all together and not dropping it is pure bliss. Thanks to very unqiue characters and special move sets characters feel very different to what you might be used to coming from Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. It takes a bit to get into the groove if you are used to DPs and chucking fireballs all day long.\n\nThe only real issue I have with the game is the art design itself, particularly the characters - while very well done technically they all went to the Mai Shiraniu school of bouncing boobies(tm) and passed with flying colors. They even slapped boobs on the Akira-esque blob of meat and bones that is Double for crying out loud! The game is otherwise so carefully put together that I find these design choices highly questionable - because you can easily dismiss Skullgirls as waifu anime crap and miss out on a really well done fighting game. It is just so unnecessary, because the rest of Skullgirls top-notch and well worth your time.","July 24, 2014","true","10.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/barrogh/recommended/245170/","barrogh","Barrogh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/barrogh/","66 products in account","Skullgirls is a team-based fighting game set in its rather original world full of colourful characters, dark stories and general weirdness.\n\nUsing general premise of games like MvC, SG has rather conservative (in terms of numbers, at least) roster of rather diverse characters with quite a bit of options. Development team constantly works on the game, regularly patching bugs and other issues and - what's, perhaps, the most important part - constantly experimenting with existing characters in BETA build every SG player has access to. New characters are added every now and then and as of now, at least two are yet to be released in addition to a dozen of existing ones. If you have the game when those are released, you'll have them for free btw.\n\nThe game can be fast and complex enough for FG veterans to feel at home, while keeping basic inputs as simple as possible. Combined with very decent tutorials, it makes SG pretty welcoming to new players, including those not very familliar with competitive fighting games (even if it's probably not the simpliest FG to become average or better at, but it's understandable given it's premise). It can be pretty fun to play casually too, and it helps that visual style, while possibly repulsive at first glance to some people, is pretty creative and occasionally funny, can be pretty decent party game.\n\nBasic idea (teams) of the game can be describled somewhat like this:\n- You pick a team of 1-3 different characters, smaller team has more HP and damage per character;\n- You control one of them while you can call others to assist you or to replace your "point character";\n- Assist move is chosen before the game starts, it can be any of normal or special moves available to the character, plus every character has one move that is used specifically when she's called to make an entrance and stay.\n- Fight until only one team has someone left standing.\n\nIt's simple, but can lead to rather deep gameplay - if you choose to go there, of course!\n\nWould definitely recommend for gameplay, artstyle and for the fact that this game has developers' support that every fighting game should have in my humble opinion.","January 10, 2015","true","17.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I switch over to online, you have people playing that are even more pathetically easy to beat, or they're the complete opposite and you are going against some ridiculously skilled opponent or spammer where you will not even be able to move a single bit the entire round due to being constantly attacked.\n\nOther than that, it's fun if you enjoy a challenge, and clean looking, and I've had no problems with frame rate or anything of the sort. Also boobs, if that really seems to be a key selling point for you.\nAnd Lab Zero still puts out DLC, so there's some great things to still look forward to.","December 24, 2014","true","26.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's great, but complicated. Online play will see you crushed by a 50x combo, but the singleplayer is just as good, and if you keep upping the difficulty, you may have an actual chance in multiplayer. This game is also better with a controller because of crazy 360 joystick combos. But with practice(A LOT OF PRACTICE), you may pull off a 360 combo with your arrow keys. The constant patches and the new upcoming DLC characters(Which will be free if you buy the game before they're released)are more reasons to buy this game. And even if you don't buy the game in time, I think you should still get at least 1 DLC. I bought Squigly for 5 bucks, and that'll probably be the price for future DLC characters. ( You know, after they're FREE) This was a long review, but in short, this is a cheap Indie game that's worth the 15 dollars. 10/10.","March 12, 2014","true","25.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrewHarrison/recommended/245170/","DrewHarrison","I Like Dogs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrewHarrison/","42 products in account","Probably my favorite fighter currently on steam (though it seems ASW has added some titles recently).  Overall a fantastic game that I would highly recommend.\n\nThe gameplay itself is great, with the only real issue being the limited roster (hopefully to be fixed with the addition of more dlc characters which are free for a short time).  Each character has a number of combos they can preform and no two players will likely play a character the same way.  Additionally, the ability to control 1,2, or 3 characters in a match adds more depth by adding the options for assists and comboing with meter attacks (meter being known as "dramatic tension" in skullgirls or something like that).\n\nThe gameplay can be a bit complicated (not unusual  for a fighter) and new players can be quickly overwhelmed if they jump into an online match right away (most opponents will be better than the AI opponents on nightmare difficulty).  Thankfully, skullgirls has an indepth tutorial system that is probably the best I've seen in a fighting game.  It covers every major gameplay element and serves as a wonderful introduction to the basic principles of 2d fighters.  Seeing as many aspects such as blocking and mix-ups are done similarly in Skullgirls as they are in many other fighters, the tutorial system makes Skullgirls an excellent place to start for those wishing to break into the genre.\n\nThe soundtrack of the game is excellent and does a good job at setting the mood of the game.  It isn't the most memorable, but it is certaintly better than average and a few tracks in particular stick out.\n\nVisually the game excells.  The character models are drawn beautifully as well as the backgrounds and attacking frames.  The character design is excellent and left me with no misgivings as to the success of the game in the male demographic.\n\nOverall, I'd put this at about an 8.8/10 making it my favorite fighter currently on Steam.  Would highly recommend.","February 14, 2014","true","154.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I expected just another 2D fighting game, decent multiplayer, and lots of super-pointlessly sexualized women. That's not what I got at all! Sure three or four of the main eight were rather big-boobed and little-clothing'ed but honestly this game isn't even about that. This game's storyline is great, and if you look more into it online it only gets better. I actually cried over the ending of the DLC Character Squigly's campaign. I've never cried over a video game let alone one with a storyline it took me 30 minutes to beat. So if you're thinking about picking this up but are wondering if it's really worth it. It is. The multiplayer is fun and rather intense so it's good to play with friends. The story modes are totally replayable, and all the characters are unique and have diverse and incredibally interesting backstories. So I leave you with a good luck because the vanilla controls are really hard to get so I'd suggest re-mapping them to your perfered setup.

The artstyle is a eyegasm, the characters are lovable and unique, and the smooth as water flow of the combat is just..perfect! The soundtrack is just a treat for the ears, and the menus are easy and function quite well. Heck, this game even's got DLC down to a T! For the first day a character is released, they're FREE?

I've played games like MvC3, Ki, and Mk9, which are all good but eventually got stale to me. So why in the holy f**k do I love Skullgirls so much?!?!  Skullgirls is an interesting one. It's like any normal fighting game, but with waifus. I'm not too sure what more of an explenation you would want but I think that's a good place to start. So what makes skullgirls so amazing? Well that would be everything, which currently includes intuitive gameplay, beautiful hand drawn visuals, an increadible and catchy soundtrack, it's easy to play but is complex enough to be mastered, brief, but interesting story modes for each character, a very in depth tutorial , TONS of lore, multiple clever references to memes and other games, fanservice, flashy and awe inspireing supermoves, the big middle finger to physics, and last but certainly not least, a cast of increadibly interesting and likeable characters. Seriously there is not one character in this game that I dont like to some extent, and while you could argue that this is because the roster is rather small (8 characters normally) this is more or less because it features DLC that adds in an extra 4 characters, with more constantly being made. Sooo yeah, Skullgirls. It's a great game with great developers, and a great fanbase. And it's only 15$, what more could you ask for?

Easy enough to get in but hard to master.  Characters are unique and operate smoothly. Even though the character count is relatively small (yeah I know there are coming more as I write) the characters still include the needed fighter stereotypes: The grappler, the one with not so many special attacks but who comboes like crazy, the annoying ranged one etc. while still adding interesting new techniques, for example take miss fortune and her head.\nAnd seriously don't ever, EVER get me started about the soundtrack (or overall atmosphere I guess). Whoever decided to add jazz to a fighting game is a pure genius 'nuff said.\nWith all that said, I must add that I didn't like the last-boss of story/arcade mode.

The rooster consists of (at the moment) an all female cast that are unique fighters in their own way. No one character feels like a clone of each other and has a very distinct, over the top fighting style. The best feature of this game by far is the in game tutorial which teaches the player literally EVERYTHING about the game mechanics and character abilities. I have not seen a tutorial that thorough since DBZBT3 for the ps2. The combat is very fluid and responsive and as far as I can tell all the characters feel balanced. There isn't one overpowered character that just gets mained for the sake of winning ( looking at you UMVC3 cough wesker cough) so its entirely possible to play competitively with your favorite character ( my case squigly, fillia and peacock).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mrs_Sprinklebottom/recommended/245170/","Mrs_Sprinklebottom","♡.:Trixie:.♡","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mrs_Sprinklebottom/","83 products in account","-General-\nNot for the prudes or someone that doesn't have a computer gaming controller. There's alot of boobs that will be flying around in your face regularly. Big bouncy boobs. And playing this with a keyboard is very frustrating and fills you with a sense of it not being worthwhile to try.\n\n-Combat-\nThe fighting is what you'd expect from any 2d arena fighter, maybe being a little bit more faster pace than KoF or Mortal Kombat. Super attacks, combo resets, etc. Some characters excel in a particular style like Parasoul and Peacock being very annoying rangers, or Squigly and Fortune being good at chaining and resetting combos, or disrupting their opponents. But i dont feel as though their is a reliable blocking system personally.\n\n-Art & Music-\nThe art style i must say is absolutely stellar. It's really something that you would love to see as a full fledged tv series. The music I dont feel is too outstanding and gets repetitive rather quickly, but its still good, i find myself humming some tunes from the game now and then.\n\n-Story-\nEach character has their own story and every story is it's own story for that particular character. The foundation is the same in that the Skullgirl focus and final boss, with a pair of designated recurring antagonists, but that aside, every character's story is non-canon to anothers with maybe one or two overlapping continuities. [X] will kill [Y] in [X]'s story, but [Y]'s story has little to do with [X]. Some stories are more interesting than others. Not saying thats a bad thing, thats just how it goes.\n\n-Verdict-\n6.5 Now i give it a middle score not because i think its not a good game. I think its a great game but not too outstanding aside from its artstyle and i am a sucker for beautiful detailed artwork. It's definitely unique with its universe and its certainly worth a try.","February 10, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Original 2D Fighting Games were hard to come by. And Announced Late 2011 Skullgirls was being developed. And in Late Spring 2012 Skullgirls arrived with art from ~Oh8~ [Alex Ahad] and Street Fighter Vetran [Mike Zaimont]. With a fresh art style and a someone familiar with the pros and cons of 2D fighter of the past, I have good feels about this game.\n\nGameplay:\nThe launch in 2012 was fantastic but with Mike "Z" at the helm the game is constantly evolving. And if you're part of the Beta on Steam the power is in your hands. The infamous 6-button layout returns in the Indie Fighter with 3 punches and 3 kicks. Each button with various damage and speeds. Did you like the 3 vs 3 with the Versus series from Capcom? Think you're badass 3 vs 1? You can with this title!! With very responsive controls and easy to pick up layout you'll be mashing away with your friends until you learn those special moves. Speaking of special moves, The creators have poured there hearts and souls into their training mode. From AI controlled comupters to programable dummies. The gameplay feels wonderful and the visuals are a breath of fresh air compared to the other titles you've been juggling since 2000.\n\nArt/Music:\nAs I've said before Alex Ahad brought a new style and beautiful visuals to this title. Some characters are pretty "eww" (Looking at the character Double) but the rest are eye popping with detail and so many vivid frames. And courtasy of the Fundraising campaign, the roster has been bumped from 8 to 14. Each character more interesting than the last. From Zombie Opra Singers to Pharroh's with Blood Magic. The character designs do nothing but amaze me everytime I play a round. And what's a great art style without a great soundtrack? Michiru Yamane and the music team gave a good blend of tunes that should increase the enjoyment of story mode and all the stages. Good feels from both Art and Music.\n\nAccessability:\nWhen folks see Mike "Z" as a seasoned vetran of Fighting Games some may be scared to try this game. I say "Nay!" Skullgirls has a tutorial mode to make even the novice of players be able to block like the pros. It may not happen overnight but the tutorial mode will tell you what to look for and it will even help you learn a character. Online gameplay is well thought out with GGPO and the players online are fierce with vigor. (Trust me I'm 0-12 still) But the story mode for each character is fun and well written. Speaking of characters, since launch Skullgirls is adding a total of 6 new characters!! Add those to the original 8 and you have 14 possible character to choose from. Each with unique animations and playstyles.\n\nVerdict:\nI like this game a lot! The User feedback, the crowd-funded characters, and the evolving gameplay! I think this game should be in any 2D Fighters library! Heck, gift it to a friend on the next steam sale. Because their lobby system involves everyone! No more boring "round robin" style lobbies! (Thank god!!) My only issues with the game is once their funding goes away, will there be a second one? Either way this title has earned its stripes with me.\n\nConclusion:\nThanks for reading this lame review I typed on a whim. But I hope you consider this title when and if you're looking for that NON-Mainstream title. Because I have purchase it for 2 platforms now. And I dont regret a thing!!\n\n\n~DrKrazy~","February 5, 2015","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I expected just another 2D fighting game, decent multiplayer, and lots of super-pointlessly sexualized women. That's not what I got at all! Sure three or four of the main eight were rather big-boobed and little-clothing'ed but honestly this game isn't even about that. This game's storyline is great, and if you look more into it online it only gets better. I actually cried over the ending of the DLC Character Squigly's campaign. I've never cried over a video game let alone one with a storyline it took me 30 minutes to beat. So if you're thinking about picking this up but are wondering if it's really worth it. It is. The multiplayer is fun and rather intense so it's good to play with friends. The story modes are totally replayable, and all the characters are unique and have diverse and incredibally interesting backstories. So I leave you with a good luck because the vanilla controls are really hard to get so I'd suggest re-mapping them to your perfered setup.

It's a very traditional SF-style fighter with better movement mechanics (air dashes for example). The Tutorial Mode really helped me understand what I was doing and how the whole system of traditional 2d fighters works. It also gives you the lessons you need to pull off combos yourself, which is great for someone who used to just button mash.

I've played games like MvC3, Ki, and Mk9, which are all good but eventually got stale to me. So why in the holy f**k do I love Skullgirls so much?!?!  Skullgirls is an interesting one. It's like any normal fighting game, but with waifus. I'm not too sure what more of an explenation you would want but I think that's a good place to start. So what makes skullgirls so amazing? Well that would be everything, which currently includes intuitive gameplay, beautiful hand drawn visuals, an increadible and catchy soundtrack, it's easy to play but is complex enough to be mastered, brief, but interesting story modes for each character, a very in depth tutorial , TONS of lore, multiple clever references to memes and other games, fanservice, flashy and awe inspireing supermoves, the big middle finger to physics, and last but certainly not least, a cast of increadibly interesting and likeable characters. Seriously there is not one character in this game that I dont like to some extent, and while you could argue that this is because the roster is rather small (8 characters normally) this is more or less because it features DLC that adds in an extra 4 characters, with more constantly being made. Sooo yeah, Skullgirls. It's a great game with great developers, and a great fanbase. And it's only 15$, what more could you ask for?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/barrogh/recommended/245170/","barrogh","Barrogh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/barrogh/","66 products in account","Skullgirls is a team-based fighting game set in its rather original world full of colourful characters, dark stories and general weirdness.\n\nUsing general premise of games like MvC, SG has rather conservative (in terms of numbers, at least) roster of rather diverse characters with quite a bit of options. Development team constantly works on the game, regularly patching bugs and other issues and - what's, perhaps, the most important part - constantly experimenting with existing characters in BETA build every SG player has access to. New characters are added every now and then and as of now, at least two are yet to be released in addition to a dozen of existing ones. If you have the game when those are released, you'll have them for free btw.\n\nThe game can be fast and complex enough for FG veterans to feel at home, while keeping basic inputs as simple as possible. Combined with very decent tutorials, it makes SG pretty welcoming to new players, including those not very familliar with competitive fighting games (even if it's probably not the simpliest FG to become average or better at, but it's understandable given it's premise). It can be pretty fun to play casually too, and it helps that visual style, while possibly repulsive at first glance to some people, is pretty creative and occasionally funny, can be pretty decent party game.\n\nBasic idea (teams) of the game can be describled somewhat like this:\n- You pick a team of 1-3 different characters, smaller team has more HP and damage per character;\n- You control one of them while you can call others to assist you or to replace your "point character";\n- Assist move is chosen before the game starts, it can be any of normal or special moves available to the character, plus every character has one move that is used specifically when she's called to make an entrance and stay.\n- Fight until only one team has someone left standing.\n\nIt's simple, but can lead to rather deep gameplay - if you choose to go there, of course!\n\nWould definitely recommend for gameplay, artstyle and for the fact that this game has developers' support that every fighting game should have in my humble opinion.","January 10, 2015","true","17.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I never really played a fighting game on my computer, I did play some well-known fighting games on consoles, but if I had to be fair these experiences were sort of easy to forget. Skullgirls just had the charm that the other fighting games I played hadn't.\n\nIn terms of mechanics, Skullgirls is very fluid. I'm not really a good-enough player to be launching precise strikes and combos on my opponent, but I truly felt that the game had a good sense of collision, and this is hard to pull off with a 2D game. The combat also does well with its fighters; every fighter is unique and has their own unique style of fighting. You'll find that playing Peacock, as her tutorial suggests, is truly better to play with ranged attacks, while Ms. Fortune's speciality is being able to detach her head and use it to make special attacks while her body is in an entirely different location. I don't have the hang of all the fighters just yet, but I managed to beat Marie on the first try with Ms. Fortune and on the second try with Peacock on Normal difficulty, in my book I think these two characters I've gotten more familiar with. My point is, all characters are different and suit different players, which is definitely a good thing. No character plays the same, and rarely would they have similar types of attacks.\n\nBut to admit, the game caught my attention more through its characters, stories, appearances, and the blend of emotions I get to feel; one character's story is going to be full of humorous points, while the other could be just tearjerking, sometimes the two even blend into one. Interestingly enough, there's a lot of story that's hard to find out through playing the game alone, which is something I aim to expand my knowledge on past the writing of this review.\n\nWhat makes Skullgirls, in my opinion, better than any fighting game I've played so far?\n\nThe combat is fluid, but at the same time it's unique. It's loose! There are a lot of various attacks (And don't get me started on how various Peacock's are), and it's playable. The game itself doesn't try to be edgy or anything, rather it has different fighters that give different sorts of feelings. Sexiness? Go for Valentine. Goofiness? Use Peacock. Adorableness? Squigly's the one for you. Anger? Painwheel. Horrible? That would be Double. There aren't many fighters just yet (As there is always potential and room for more), but that compensates for their good variability, appearance, and absolutely great voice acting.\n\nAnd who could forget about the game's non-mechanical aspects? The game is very visually beautiful, it's drawn well and animated with skill, the soundtrack is something I've already put on my MP3 playlist, and the character designs make the game remarkable in that aspect.\n\n\nI'll conclude by saying that as much as I lack experience, I love this game.","June 22, 2015","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It takes you by the hand and painstakingly teaches you everything you need to know in order to master the game. It is so simple. The level of detail that has been put into the tutorial has almost made it a little game of its own. Huge kudos to the developers for this feat. I barely consider myself a fan of the genre and to tell you the truth I did not expect much when I installed it (as part of a midweek madness limited free-play). Nonetheless, when I got to run it and take it for a test-drive, I felt that I actually liked the experience. I can safely say it was all because of the tutorial section. No excuses anymore to start mashing all the keys in order to come up with some random powerful attack/combo.\n\nThe colors are vivid and backgrounds are strongly thematic and diverse. The characters are funny, freaky or/and sexy (leggy and busty ladies with interesting attires/appendages) and the dialogues (lines really not real dialogues since most of the story is given as text) are funny as well.\n\nControl by keyboard is responsive enough that a single player should face no problem at all. Also actions are remappable. However, since this is the classic "keyboard-destroying" game genre, I think that a controller (or a really sturdy gaming keyboard) is more appropriate than a simple keyboard for the long run.\n\nThe concept (from a male's perspective) is also really enticing: endless catfights between powerful, cartoonish (anime style) female characters. You want to let some steam off and are tired of shooting people with shotguns and rifles? Well, this epic fight between some freaky-sexy looking women who occasionally flash their panties, is great for a change!\n\nOne thing that detracts somewhat from the gameplay are the animations that are somewhat poor. Don't get me wrong: the art and character design per se is masterful. I think that the limited number of actually drawn sprites per action has been done by design rather than accident. That said, it is my own opinion that a few more intermediate sprites would greatly contribute to a smoother and more immersive experience.\n\nAlso the base roster of contestants (disregarding DLC characters) could be somewhat richer. But I guess this is no real sin since, nowadays, it is a generally accepted practice to provide a barebones title and enhance on it little by little over time.\n\nAll in all, the game "Skullgirls" was a pleasant experience and I think that if you get it at a bargain price (MIDWEEK MADNESS offer is 3€ for the basic title - without DLC) is a real must-have for any decent gamer's collection.","June 3, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caniterrae/recommended/245170/","caniterrae","Cani Terrae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caniterrae/","245 products in account","-- Skullgirls 2nd Encore Review --\n\n// Summary //\n\nThis is my favorite fighter available on Steam at present.  All of the graphics are hand-drawn, beautiful art; all of the fighters are fine-tuned and sexy.  The developers have supported this game long after its release:  The 2nd Encore Version is a free upgrade which represents the second major free-DLC pack for the game.   Three new characters are given to the player free of charge.   Fukua, a clone of Filia, Beowulf, an unfogettable epic, and R. Fortune....a robotic Ms. Fortune.  There are also three pay-for DLC characters available.  Squigly, a host to Leviathan, Big Band, a cyborg cop with an instrument for every situation, and Eliza, ancient and divine host of Sehkmet, the Egyptian Goddess of BLOOD!  Whether you pay for the three or not, you will see them in the story, and fight them in Arcade mode.  The free-LC also comes with a slew of new stages.\n\n// Gameplay //\n\nSolid Marvel vs. Capcom style mayhem!  You get to choose your team in arcade and vs. mode, you can choose one super-strong hero, two strong heroes, or three normal heroes.   The game's fighting mechanics are MUCH deeper than I initially believed, and they are completely covered in the game's Training - Tutorial mode.  Are you alone against three heroes and they're switching in and out to regenerate their health?  Perform an 'Out-take' (a move that knocks the current fighter off stage and forces a new one in) and you will remove all that fighter's red health, and restore your own!\n\nBack up against the wall while you get pounded?  Block low, and prepare to do a technical counter.  They call it something else, I forget.  Essentially, you hit two punch buttons while you block at the moment of impact and you force the opponent back, it bounces him away.  Another reviewer has complained about hit-stun recovery times being too long, allowing one hit to win the match if the fighter follows up with a good enough combo.  This is pretty untrue.  A perfect, top notch combo ended in a 'Blockbuster move' (Think Hyper, or Ultra combo) will take a third to a half of health off of you, if you're both single fighters and not teams.  Every move in this game has an adequate defense or counter.  The hit-stuns and recovery times are well calculated, and are explained in the Tutorial.  In fact, it explains that only certain moves can be cancelled into other moves before the opponent recovers.  Meaning, you can't just button mash after your poke lands.  You have to know what combos work and which ones don't.\n\nMy very favorite element so far, is that combos (called chains) are adaptable.  A combo that goes, LP, MP, MK, HP can just as easily go LP, MP, HP.  You can remove one or more moves from a chain and it still works as a chain.  Further, Standing LP, crouching MP, standing MK, crouching HP will also be a chain, if the original was true.   The combos are adaptable.  Once you know the 'rhythm' of the chain, you can adapt it to jumping, standing, or crouching.  You can edit it for when you need a shorter chain, for example; the medium kick may not be in range, and if you attempt it, and miss, the opponent may have enough time to recover from hit-stun, so you leave it out and proceed directly to the Heavy Punch.\n\nThis is a game of pokes, like a lot of fighters.  You poke until you land a hit, then you build a combo off of the poke that lands.  You don't just rush in with your heavy moves, you'll get eviscerated by an opponent that is defending waiting for you to do a move that has x frames of recovery, so that he can poke you safely, and then take off with his combo.\n\n// Style //\n\nNo fighting game I've played has more style than this game.  I've been playing fighters since Super Street Fighter II was new.  From the music, to the announcer(s) [4 available options], the theme of showbiz, the stylized art (all of which is available in the in-game Art Gallery, plus guest art), the zany characters, the whole package.   It's never boring, and it doesn't disappoint.\n\nFinally, it has story.  It's not like it's a novel you'll be unravelling for years, but it has a story that is compelling.  Much more compelling, in my humble opinion, than Soul Caliber or Street Fighter.  Mortal Kombat and Skullgirls are among my favorite for stories.   At least they're epic.  Save the world or change it's fate, and all that.\n\nFighting Shadaloo just isn't as...rewarding as taking over the world as a giant Goddess of Destruction named Sehkmet...\n\n// Synopsis //\n\nI imagine it will be a very long time before I get bored of Skullgirls.  Of course, I still play Marvel vs. Capcom.  This game is similar to that fighting style.","July 23, 2015","true","90.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters are all play very differently, which makes choosing a character to learn fun (for a bit), but more on that in a sec. This game is fun to play with friends, however, I find that playing competetively is beyond accessible and is a minefield of infinite combos, which just makes you feel like you're really not that great, even though you beat the (really ♥♥♥♥ing hard on any difficulty that isn't easy) final boss with every character. I'm all for learning characters, hell, that's how fighting games work, but with this it just felt like that would take too long.\n\nI recently bought Street Fighter 4 and feel that I'm already having a better time and have learnt my main (Cammy) better than I could have learnt Ms. Fortune in this by playing this game nonstop for months.\n\nBut yeah, I'll be happy to play this game with any of my friends, just don't expect to win against someone experienced, like, ever. Also, I do feel that making the free character updates paid after a month is NOT COOL though, as the roster is small without them.\n\nHowever, this game does have a really nice feel that I absolutely adore, which I think is from a combination of the music, style, character/environment designs, and punchiness of it all.","December 26, 2013","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

There's alot of boobs that will be flying around in your face regularly. Big bouncy boobs. And playing this with a keyboard is very frustrating and fills you with a sense of it not being worthwhile to try.\n\n-Combat-\nThe fighting is what you'd expect from any 2d arena fighter, maybe being a little bit more faster pace than KoF or Mortal Kombat. Super attacks, combo resets, etc. Some characters excel in a particular style like Parasoul and Peacock being very annoying rangers, or Squigly and Fortune being good at chaining and resetting combos, or disrupting their opponents. But i dont feel as though their is a reliable blocking system personally.\n\n-Art & Music-\nThe art style i must say is absolutely stellar. It's really something that you would love to see as a full fledged tv series. The music I dont feel is too outstanding and gets repetitive rather quickly, but its still good, i find myself humming some tunes from the game now and then.\n\n-Story-\nEach character has their own story and every story is it's own story for that particular character. The foundation is the same in that the Skullgirl focus and final boss, with a pair of designated recurring antagonists, but that aside, every character's story is non-canon to anothers with maybe one or two overlapping continuities. [X] will kill [Y] in [X]'s story, but [Y]'s story has little to do with [X]. Some stories are more interesting than others. Not saying thats a bad thing, thats just how it goes.\n\n-Verdict-\n6.5 Now i give it a middle score not because i think its not a good game. I think its a great game but not too outstanding aside from its artstyle and i am a sucker for beautiful detailed artwork. It's definitely unique with its universe and its certainly worth a try.","February 10, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It runs fantastically, the combo list is simple (which is great for beginners), but ti's insanely difficult to master, which is what gives this game a competitive edge. There are essentially no bugs whatsoever. The character list is small, but the game developers plan on expanding it, along with the selectrion of maps itself, so the majority of my complaints ends there. The only issue I have is that this games' online system needs some work. Otherwise, it's an amazing 2D side-scrolling fighting game-- it rivals Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, Street Fighter 2, etc... At the price, there is no reason to not get it. And also, it's a local multiplayer game as well, which essentially means endless fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuguriChan/recommended/245170/","FuguriChan","[A$$] Kamen Sunder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuguriChan/","14 products in account","For $15, this is one game you can't skimp out, even if you suck at fighting games like me.\nAs a standalone title, Skullgirls (Encore) is simply one of the most complete titles in the Steam library, and while a sequel/expansion (Skullgirls Second Encore, AKA Skullgirls Endless Beta) is on the way, this current edition is still quite worth picking up.\nArtistically speaking, the game looks gorgeous with its steady frame rate and reportedly hand-drawn characters that are both smooth in frame transition and movement. The backgrounds and the character designs all bring in a very early 20th century look that I wholesomely appreciate. Furthermore, character designs also have plenty of references built into them, such as the most widely advertised character of Filia sporting the Japanese "Futakuchi Onna".\nGameplay is also very solid. The game responds very well to button inputs, and the slight lag experienced during online matches are excusable as a common problem. However, the control really requires a joystick or some sort of analog equivalent. Moves like Beowulf's "Wulfamania" just love having the player a joystick 270 degrees, a move that is very difficult to replicate on a keyboard. Other than that, the game works great.\nThe game does have some drawbacks though. At an initial of only 8 characters, its a very small roster to start off with. The presence DLC is also slightly irritating, as 3 more characters are restricted to DLC, such as Squigly, Big Band, and Eliza. PC users get Beowulf and Fukua right off the bat, but its still rather weak for a competitive roster. Online play doesn't help either, as Lobby matches require a HUGE amount of wait time and quick-matches are paired without any consideration to the skill levels of the players. Finally, the tutorial works as a great teaching tool for fighting game beginners, but some of the instructions are a bit vague, especially when it comes to pulling off expected combos and reacting to the CPU's blocks.\nWhile the game has its downsides, the overall value greatly justifies the game. I do not regret picking the game up whatsoever I sincerely hope that more will come out for this sprouting franchise. Maybe figurines?","June 18, 2015","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now after I got my hands on it and finished Filla's story, I can say that this game really didn't let me down.\n\nFrom my point of view, this is a great fighting game. It's not easy, it requires technique and practice. And this is a great 2D game, the graphic, the awesome music, cristal clear sound effect, I just can't see any flaws in the game design. And most importantly (about a fighting game) - it has the perfect feeling of hitting impact. This game is definitely not something that you purchased then throw away for it's bad control - the control is perfect.\n\nIf I really need to find something I'm not so satisfied about this game, is that the story mode is way too short. There are some cut scenes between fights but some of them doesn't even have any transition - I've just completed only Filia's story, and there's no cut scene, not even dialogs between the first fight with Parasoul and second fight with Cerebella - I mean, the first fight happend on the street and it was night time, the second fight happened in the day time in a park. How did I get there? If this is the story mode, then where are the stories?\n\n9/10","December 29, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.\n\nMix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract.

Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes (check at 50 minutes) at 350°F (175°C), or until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean.\n\nRemove from oven and cool completely on a rack. Remove the banana bread from the pan. Slice and serve.

Movimientos muy fluidos y con ligeras historias que enlazan curiosamente a sus personajes para darle un extra como cualquier tipico videojuego de pelea. Lo mas interesante es que aqui no veremos brazos con esteroides, sino mucha feminidad y algunas minifaldas mostrando mas de lo debido.\n\nBuen juego de peleas para salir de la rutina de los tipicos machos esteroides peleadores y jugar con algo mas agradable a la vista (sobretodo para los chicos).

Every frame in the game is hand-drawn and there are a lot of frames for each character.\n\nSpeaking of characters, there are about 9, counting 12 with DLC. Doesn't seem like much, but each character has a unique set of moves, and you are able to play with up to 3 character to get insane combos. If you are looking to get a DLC character, but don't know if you will like their fighting style, then play the Endless Beta version that comes with purchasing this game. It has all the characters unlocked and even in progress stuff for future updates.\n\nIt is also a great introduction to fighting games in general, as the tutorial is really in-depth, and goes over everything you need to know, even individual characters.\n\nThe developers are very generous, as when they ever introduce a DLC character, they always make them free for a short time so you don't have to pay.\n\nThe artstyle is very appealing to me personally, as I mentioned before everything in the game is handrawn.\n\nAnd the music is very impressive, it made me buy the soundtrack on Google Play.\n\nThe online has almost never any issues, as you can adjust levels for various ping of the other players, so lag is zero. Finding a game for a lower skill level may be a bit tough ( at least last time I checked ) but it helps you learn the ropes a bit to face tougher players.\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nOverall Skullgirls is a very great fighting game, with sweet music and a very appealing art style that also is good for professional players and great for beginners alike. If you are interested in fighting games or are trying to find a opening into the genre, then Skullgirls is what you are looking for.","November 18, 2014","true","37.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great characters. Great gameplay. Skullgirls is my favourite 2D fighting game and one of my favourite games of all time. There are 2 main ways that the player will play this game, single player and versus.\n\nIn single player, there are three modes, story, arcade and CPU quick match. In story mode, players will select a character and play through their story. Each character has vastly different stories, so this mode is great to get new players hooked. Arcade mode is  a mode where the player will select a character or a team of characters and fight against randomly selected characters until they reach the boss. CPU quick match is pretty self-explanatory, the player selects a character or team of characters and fights against a computer opponent for one match.\n\nIn versus, players can fight against opponents from all around the world. in versus, there are a few modes to select from. Tournament will allow you to fight against many people in a tournament style fight with eliminations. In local mode, two people sitting in the same room can fight against each other. Quick match will allow you to search for a fight against one person and will only last one match. Finally, there is lobby play. In this mode players can enter a lobby with up to 9 other players. This is essentially a free-for-all with no rankings or eliminations. Players can choose to fight whoever they want and multiple fights can take place at the same time.\n\nThere is one other mode that people might play. That's the tutorial and training mode. This is the best tutorial for a fighting game I have ever seen. It is incredibly in-depth, but also simple enough for new players to understand.","September 24, 2013","true","77.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CyberBinary/recommended/245170/","CyberBinary","CyberBinary","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CyberBinary/","174 products in account","I have previously written a review for this game but I think it's time to make a new one. My goal is to make this easy to understand at a glance.\n\nGraphics\nThis one is super opinion heavy and it's best to just judge for yourself.\n\n+ Character sprites	- The characters are all well drawn and stand out from everything on the screen. There are a ton of colors to choose from (over 20 per character) and many are references to other characters. The fanservice in this game can be seen as excessive, but I don't care about it or notice it much.\n+ Stages	- The stages, for the most part, look great. The stages are somewhat 3D (which can be changed in the options) but it isn't super noticeable. They all look like they were designed with a purpose; they don't look like they were just thrown in. Another good thing about the stages is that they never distract me from the game.\n+ Animation	- Everything is super well animated in this game. The attacks always look smooth and there are no animation-hitbox oddities such as the super large Street Fighter II Shoryuken hitbox.\n\nGameplay\n+ Team size selection - Skullgirls allows you to select the number of characters are on your team. Single character teams are viable in this game because each character in a multiple character team is weakened based on the team size.\n+ Overall game feel - Everything in this game feels crisp and responsive. This is personal opinion, but it is one of the best feeling fighting games I've ever played.\n+ Infinite Combo Prevention System - This game has a mechanic where it detects when the opponent is doing an infinite combo and allows the other player to break free. Because of this, one combo doesn't mean a immediate loss.\n+ Assist selection - When selecting your characters, you can input normals and specials as assist moves. Since these aren't new moves, you will immediately know how they work. It also provides for options that are fun to test out.\n\nTools for New Players\n+ Great tutorial - The tutorial teaches you mechanics that are used in many other fighting games. There is also a section that teaches about each character individually.\n+ Team selection makes the game easy to get into - You don't have to learn more than one character to start playing this game.\n+ Great training room - Things like slow motion and showing hitboxes make it easy to understand the game's mechanics.\n+ 360 Detection  - When doing a 360 motion, the game will prevent you from jumping during it.\n\nConcluding Statements\nThis is one of the best fighting games I have ever played. I know that it won't be to everyone's tastes, but I find it very hard to think of places where this game is lacking. Many of the problems that people had were ironed out by the developers who continue to work on this game.  If you like games such as Marvel vs Capcom you are going to want to check this one out.  If you are new to the fighting game genre and are interested in getting better, BUY THIS GAME!  Just keep your expections high because this game is sure to surpass them.","October 18, 2015","true","39.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PotatoBorn/recommended/245170/","PotatoBorn","Ruby Rose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PotatoBorn/","94 products in account","Great fighting game for everyone, Its challanging at first, but when you learn a character's moves, and practise them until you can incorporate them into a combo, you feel like a super badass. Each character has different moves, different ways to do said moves, and have a different story. The characters are all memorable and well made.\n\nThe game has a large list of ingame tutorials, not just on game mechanics, etc, but also each character has a tutorial. This is one of the ONLY games where i would reccomend a controller, just because doing the combos, in my opinion, is easier using an analog stick rather than the arrow keys, although you can rebind the controls if you wanted.\n\nI highly reccomend this game if you like fighting games like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter. This game is great for beginners and veterans alike.","October 30, 2015","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not necessarily a huge fighting game person but this game is pretty easy to get into. The artwork is fun and very well done, the animiations are great, the music is quite good and interesting. The characters (unusually for a fighting game almost all female) are very cool and interesting and quite varied. The story modes are fun but kinda short and not always easy to follow necessarily. But each character has a story so... there is a lot to watch in total, I suppose.\n\nAnother thing about this game, it runs well on pretty much everything. My Zotac CI320 runs this game smoothly -- that's a super cheap-o celeron box I use to run XBMC and occasionally stream games, But this game runs great on that tiny machine.\n\nIf you like fighting games at all, get this, its a lot of fun. Especially if you are a Linux gamer -- this and Kings of Kung Fu are the only two fighters we have at the time of this review and they are wildly different styles of gameplay.","November 1, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Simply amazing. Everything about the game makes it look pretty. To sum it all up the developers took little tidbits from alot of diffrent fighting games ranging from BlazBlue to Marvel vs Capcom. Controls are nice and tight. Online can be here and there but for most part its wonderful. Versus is always fun to play with friends. The game is still coming out with new characters. Each time a new character is realeased they are free for 2-3 months so how can you go wrong with that? There is a story mode for each character and there point of view on the main quest for each of them. Storys are all unique so it not a drag to go through each one. I highly reccomend this game for people new to the fighting game community especially since the turtorial gives you a grasp on how fighting game mechanics work.
