"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cigrits/recommended/232770/","cigrits","KillaRobot KingKong Jesus SteeZ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cigrits/","104 products in account","First off, do not buy this if you intend to see the funny moments and gruesome humor that was POSTAL 2. The humor in here is minimal and not nearly as frequent as even just standing still on P2.\nThis game is VERY serious and dark, but in a good way. For 1997, it was pretty realistic as well.\nIt was made from 95 percent brutality and shock factor and 5 percent humor.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThis game is very dark in contrast to the sequel, the art is grimy looking, you really get a feel that the guy you're playing as is VERY psychotic (mainly from the daily Journal entries on the loading screen before each level) partially from one of the few spoken lines of the Postal Dude; "I regret nothing." before shooting himself in the head (after killing hundreds of innocents!!!)\n***NOTE: There is a suicide key (K) which acts as a way to restart the level.***\nThis is one of those games that was highly controversial. One of the reasons was how it executed its "violence" within the game. Reason being; it was as realistic as the dev team could make it for the time. Adding on to that, children can also be killed, and executed while incapacitated.\n\nPros:\n+ The gameplay is amazing fun (isometric shoot em up, with some decent strategy needed)\n+ Has the 'Special Deliery' add-on included which adds 5 new levels\n+ Lots of features for a game that's simple and from 1997\n+ Very unique and nice hand-drawn art style\n+ Gives an unsettling, horror vibe (see below for details)\n+ Quite a nice arsenal of weapons for an old mass-murder game, all weapons feel different and some explosive weapons have varieties of ammunition\n\nCons:\n- Controls may be hard to get used to for some players\n- Not quite a straight-forward, linear story, but the Postal Dude's inner-thoughts are expressed clearly through the Journal entries (loading screens), and throughout the game he mutters lines, as well the last level shows just how mentally unstable he is (it is a cutscene)\n\nThe game truly takes you on a trip through the mind of a mentally ill man who feels the need to purge the world of every living human. It might shock some, sure, but it really is an amazing game for how simple it is, yet allows you to have so much fun killing time AND people. The story may not be heavy in terms of spoken dialogue and many pages worth of text, but there is an underlying surreal feeling while playing the game that makes it clear that the story is just how psychotic the "Postal Dude" has become.\n\nYou can easily get used the controls, create your own cozy setup, master the controls in 10 minutes, and have a BLAST playing this. Disregard my Steam playtime as I have played at least 30+ hours before the Steam release.\n\n9/10   //   4.5 out of 5","November 5, 2014","true","7.7"," 286 of 293 people (98%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","98","286","293","10","23"

But I've been taking a higher dosage of Risperidone, so the voices don't tell me many things anymore.\n\nAt first, the controls on this game made me want to stab someone in the eye repeatedly and tell them to stop staring at me, but once you get the hang of it, it's fairly easy to play. The variety of weapons doesn't really matter to me, many of them are too impractical to use. If you played Postal 2 first, don't expect to take a leak on people or beat them with a shovel.\n\nWhen it comes to the setting and the atmosphere, this game makes Postal 2 look like Secret of the Magic Crystals. The soundtrack is very unsettling, and it doesn't help that it keeps playing in my head after I close the game. I even tried restarting the computer, but it just won't stop.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/THPPFT/recommended/232770/","THPPFT","JakkelR4psc4llion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/THPPFT/","82 products in account","Having played this games series to completion (well, almost: what, you mean to tell me that you actually got all the way through  Postal 3?!), I feel that reviewing them all is necessary. This game, however, is going to be difficult to review. It's not that it's a badly made game or that I hate it (on the contrary). The problem is that it's such a disturbing game that I may end up on a watchlist for recommending it. Whatever! Here it goes.\n\nThe first installment of the Postal series is of humble origins, provided that your definition of "humble origins" involves being banned in 14 countries, being blacklisted by most major retailers and being mentioned by Senator Joe Lieberman to the Senate as one of the "three worst things in American society" (the other two being Marilyn Manson and Calvin Klein underwear ads). Postal is a game about a guy (the Postal Dude) being bombarded with demonic mental images and voices convincing him to murder society as a whole. Each level is a neighborhood, truckstop, air force base, shopping mart, etc. of innocent people and hostile people ("hostile" being cops, government agents, well-armed vigilantes and other people who are merely trying to stop a madman with weapons from murdering everybody). You are instructed to kill at least 80-90% of the hostile people before progressing to the next level. Unlike the succeeding two games, the only morality choice you're really given is whether you want to kill only the people trying to kill you or kill everybody.\nThe gameplay is a third person isometric, much like the first couple Army Men games that 3DO had, only with much more gore, suffering and people pleading for their lives. The weapons in this game are strictly military grade, unlike the succeeding two, and you don't have animals to help you, like the feral cats or your dog, Champ (although his doghouse is in the first level).\nNow, let's talk about the content. At the beginning of each level, you are treated with disturbing artwork of screaming people, corpses and evil humanoid entities with the soundtrack of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" kinds of experimental percussion raging in the background. At the bottom of each of these loading screens is a diary entry of the Postal Dude, which usually reads like "The city is a refuse pile, and I come to exterminate the bugs. Clean the wound with more blood!" Afterwards, you start the level, where you murder people. While you can definitely perform much more sadistic and demented acts of cruelty in the sequels, they give it to you in a very zany, silly and whimsical manner. Whereas, with the first game, you're told to shoot and kill everything in a very serious manner. While the Postal Dude does give an occasional quip, there's very little hilarity in the game. Also like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the game is a very demented piece of work, that although goes far out of its way to make you uncomfortable, is strangely appealing.\nAnyway, the game is entertaining and worth a playthrough in my opinion, but be very careful as to who you play the game in front of.","July 1, 2014","true","26.4"," 64 of 66 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","64","66","0","0"

(You will know what I mean when you play it).\n+ Arcade Style.\n\n- No Plot.\n- Got stuck on 1st Level because i didn't know where to go. (You have to press F1 when the objective is complete)\n- Always the same objective. (Kill XX% of enemies).\n- It's annoying when you don't want to kill civilians and yet they just "suicide" running to you while you are trying to shoot enemies xD (Just not killing civilians for achievement...)\n- Rocket Launcher dudes super annoying when you get hit once and while getting up get hit again and again... till you die. (You can crouch but only after you get up).\n\nThe presence of a moving van on the first level suggests that the character has been evicted from his home and is "going postal", but there is no story evolution during the game, you just kill as much as you want... However there are some quotes from some kind of diary.\n\nDon't think it's conected to Postal 2, but I had fun playing.\n\nAnyway...

Most of you will probably be here because of Postal 2 but will be completely disappointed when playing. This is NOT anything like POSTAL 2, in the sense of it's humor and stupidity.\n\nThis game is very dark, with the title screen opening up to a screaming mouth and some twisted music, you know you are going to have a wonderful experience (you sick f***).\n\nThe gameplay is not an open world exploration, it is set levels based around the town of Paradise. The objective is to kill all of the population. Nothing complicated. Simple and to the point. There isn't really a humor, apart from your sick mind, laughing at all the deaths. The civilians screaming and begging for their lives brings a deep sense of sickness, and to top it off, you can excecute them.\n\nThe controls and aiming are kind of awkward, but are easy to get use to. You use tank controls, and to fire your weapon you press Left CTRL. You select your weapons with the numbers as well. The use of a mouse is not needed, as it is ALL controlled from the keyboard. A downside so to speak, but worth the fun time.\n\nWould I suggest this? Yes. If you are wanting a game where you can let your inner darkness out, and where you can kill civilians and cops relentlessly, then this is perfect for you. As for fans of POSTAL 2, I would still suggest this to them, but you won't get the humor from the second.\n\nAll in all, I'd give this game a 7.5 out of 10.","November 27, 2014","true","0.5"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","28","31","3","0"

Great stress relief, can be played easily in short doses or just finished in one night. Yes, it is not very long, the only drawback of the game.\n\nThe re-release is surpisingly well done, supports Steam Overlay, card drops and achievements.

Becuse ;) You have to check for yourself.\nWell, one of them is comment full of surprise that you actually hit F1 to progress to the next stage. F1 is shown nowhere in the controlls. Screen doesn't tell you to hit it. You just walk around the map wondering "WTF am I doing wrong?". Well, that's the little thing that took me about 30 seconds to remember, thankfully I did ;)\n\nOther than that, no issues. Game is dirt cheap, rerelease is great.

Make no mistake: I do not mind having played this classic from the end of the '90s I just know that once Postal Redux is released it'll be an immediate purchase for me.\n\n"Let's blow something up."\n\nThis is the original game with it's simplistic (and by today's standards: ugly) graphics. And while the pixelated characters certainly look aged the game's hand drawn levels still look good. In the roughly 2 dozen levels (in various locales such as farm, factory, shopping center, industrial complex, airport etc.) we control the so-called Postal Dude (do note that this Dude appeared before Lebowsky - they are not the same) who causes mayhem and destruction. We can kill everyone - all bystanders and even ostriches (?), but taking innocent lives is not mandatory in order to complete a level. Getting rid of at least 80-90% of the hostile cops is a must, though.\n\n"I regret nothing."\n\nAnd this is Postal for you. An isometric shooter with constant action which now has full controller support. Without this I would have definitely given it a thumbs-down. I do not know how its "remake", the so-called "Hatred" fares but I do know this game's content is not that extremely violent by default. Also, the Postal Dude's one-liners certainly create a funny atmosphere.

Released in 1997, this game spiked immense controversy with its dark and gruesome style. Its a 3/4s isometric view style of game with prerendered backgrounds. One of my problems with the game is that the controls take some time to get used to. You can either use just your mouse to move and shoot, just your keyboard, or use the two together. Also with the angle, it can be tough to tell where your bullets are going to go and how you can hit enemies well. The graphics are pretty standard and use 3-d characters on top of prerendered backgrounds. It works quite well for a game like this. The game is about averagely long for a five dollar game, which is another thing I'd like to bring up; the price tag. While others may disagree with me, and you're free to, I believe a five-dollar price tag for this game is a bit much. It goes on sale often however, so I'd buy it when it's around one dollar, maybe slightly more.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is an alright game. It knew exactly what it wanted to do and did it well. It's not the best in the Postal series, and may not be too long, but its an okay ride. Take it for what it's worth.   7.5/10","June 20, 2015","true","15.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

It's a game where you can actually immerse yourself in playing a psychotic shooter.\n\nAnd that's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed in-human feat in todays market.\n\nTo make a long story short, Postal is a isometric shooter. The goal of each level is to kill a certain % of "hostile" npcs to continue to the next level (Press F1 you ♥♥♥♥ing new kids).\n\nThat's the only goal. Kill. Did I mention you can also kill civilians? Because you can do that too. The eerie journal entries at the start of each level, the atmosphere, the ambience.\n\nIt's all ♥♥♥♥ing psychotic.\n\nAnd it's one hell of a blast to play.\n\nIn a non-serious point of view, this is RWS's first game, and as RWS is based on the ideology that games should be fun and challenging, that's what this game is. It's fun, over the top violence simply for the sake of it. There isn't a moral lesson to be taken out of this game, it's all fictional, but if you are pretty easily disturbed, it's probably safe for you to not play this game.\n\nThis is also a easy cure for stress.","July 10, 2013","true","10.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The story goes is that the Dude ( main protagonist ) has been kicked out of his home and decides to go postal ( hence the title ).

Fella by the name of Postal Dude. At least that was the handle his loving parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. Mr. Postal Dude, he called himself "The Dude". Now, "Dude" - that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from. But then there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense. And a lot about where he lived, likewise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place so darned interestin'. They call Arizona the "City Of Paradise." I didn't find it to be that, exactly. But I'll allow there are some nice folks there. 'Course I can't say I've seen London, and I ain't never been to France. And I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after seeing Arizona, and this here story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess I seen somethin' every bit as stupefyin' as you'd see in any of them other places. And in English, too. So I can die with a smile on my face, without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me. Now this here story I'm about to unfold took place back in the late '90s - just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the I-raqis. I only mention it because sometimes there's a man... I won't say a hero, 'cause, what's a hero? But sometimes, there's a man. And I'm talkin' about the Dude here. Sometimes, there's a man, well, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's the Dude, in Arizona. And even if he's a lazy man - and the Dude was most certainly that. Quite possibly the laziest in Arizona's County, which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide. But sometimes there's a man, sometimes, there's a man. Aw. I lost my train of thought here. But... aw, hell. I've done introduced him enough.","July 17, 2015","true","5.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","6","6","5","0"

In this game you can kill innocents but really aside from that it is pretty tame compared to modern games. The actual gameplay is alright. Just your standard topdown twin stick (controller recommended, the keyboard controls are dated) shooter with various weapons and equipment. The game is pretty hard because it feels like everyone takes half a mag to down and the controls make it awkward to aim sometimes.

And yes, it's the term "going postal" that is giving this game it's title. The USPS Incidents in the mid 80s shocked the public, the term "Workplace Rage" was also stamped out in that time.\n\nThis game was over a long time an inside tip. Sometimes it was hard to even get this game, in some countries it was even on an index. This of course led to the popularity that the game still holds.\n\nOf course, this game isn't exactly rocket science, it's a simple isometric shooter, with the only objective to shoot enough antagonists, to open up the next area. Do your qouta and all is well. Your own weapons can hurt you too, so be carefull if you use rocketlaunchers, grenades, molotov cocktails - they can harm you too.\n\nHumor, real black humor of course, is a rarity in this game. There are some moments, when the developers let it shine, but they are quite real in this game. It's sinister on purpose, but that is exactly what is creating this "hidden" charm. Even though it's not a rich game at all. But for a game that was developed in 1997 it is an ok game, and there were back at that time already games that were even far more gory than Postal.\n\nAnd no, the programmers didn't glorify killing sprees, they wrote a programm about a person who went on one, and if you think why someone would do such a thing, you are half on your way to your own answer. Why would anybody play Rambo? Or The Hobbit? Or even try to be an ancient god (Populous, Black & White)? Or try to be a starship captain?\n\nCan I recomend the game? Yes. Is it the best game I ever had? Definitly not, but it also isn't among the worst for that matter. The graphics are dated, some people might get problems with the isometric view, others might be disgusted by the "story" of the game, or the gore. The Sound might annoy some people too. But still it is a playable and easy game. And it's worth the 5 €.","December 10, 2014","true","6.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So, not really getting enough words how to describe my present feeling about this game. To write a review, first taking the help of Wikipedia: Very little is known about Postal Dude from Postal. The character “goes postal”, and decides to kill everyone in the town for mostly unknown reasons (although the manual explains that the Postal Dude believes the town's populace to be stricken with a madness plague, and that it's up to him to stop it). Postal Dude has a diary which allows the player to know a bit about the character's paranoid psychosis. This diary is displayed between levels, and contains phrases such as "The earth is hungry. Its heart throbs and demands cleansing. The earth is also thirsty”.\n\nSo, obviously the Postal Dude is a murderer, and kind of a ♥♥♥♥ all in all, but one thing remains the same: no matter the twisted acts he performs, he regrets nothing.\n\nSo, when you will play the game you will be obviously role-player! Keep a new keyboard and mouse in backup and start to play. I cannot say you will like it or not. I am rating this game for no-story insanity!\n\nOh! Yes, there is no point to think yourself as psycho because you will just kill some colour pixels! And violence? All those will be on your keyboard and mouse….

One thing that irks me are the controls, it really feels awkard to play on all-fronts control speaking. Postal reminds me a lot of that new game "Hatred", from the fundamentals, dark-disturbing atmospheres and an excessive amount of violence/gore inflicted upon normal, everyday people.

At the time this was made, I'm sure they were just fine though. You can customize the controls, and controller support is available. I play on an Xbox One controller, and it's a lot easier to play.\n\nMoving on from the controls, the game is badass. It's extremely violent and gruesome, the scenery is really neat (most of it was handpainted even), and the soundtrack is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing creepy. The game revolves on what seems to be pointless murder: you have to kill a certain number of "hostilities" to pass each level, plus there's quite a few civilians that are hard to avoid killing (no, not because they get in the way constantly - but because they scream like little SISSIES. They practically beg to get killed!). To add on to the brutality, not everyone dies from getting shot at. They'll start crawling, and you can either wait for them to bleed out, or preform an execution on them (you step on them and shot the crap out of them), and they shriek in pain.\n\nIn addition to the Steam version, I also bought it on Amazon's app store, Amazon Underground (for Android), since I enjoy it so much and wanted to show extra support to RWS. It's only $1, so if you have an Android phone, it's worth checking out! Honestly, the controls are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get used to, but it's still definitely worth it!\n\nEdit: A remake, named Postal Redux, is being released very, very soon.

Only problem is the controls have been changed to Dual Stick controls. This can be fixed in the menu by clicking "Restore OLD defualts", giving the controls present in the original releases.\n\nAnyhow, this game takes you inside the mind of the Postal Dude, a man who is evicted from his home into a world gone mad. It's a truly eerie and scary game, and one that deserves to be more popular. Would recommend.","January 3","true","16.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerean/recommended/232770/","kerean","ウジ CARRiON 死神","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerean/","31 products in account","A game from a different time.\nPOSTAL is a game from 1997. I point that year out because this was a year in PC gaming that was very controversial. In that same year alone we had POSTAL, the first Grand Theft Auto, and the first Carmageddon all come out. These titles all had one thing in common; ultra-violence against police and bystander alike.\n\nIn a gaming industry that was fine with making you a space marine or a brave knight and killing terrorists, orcs, demons or aliens, this was a very sudden turn. Granted, there have been games in the past that let you play as "the bad guy", but not quiet on the level of these games. Games like the three mentioned above took it up a notch and started showing you the nitty gritty details of what it really means to feel like "the bad guy". Blood, gore, people screaming out in shock or agony, and at the time, eerily realistic violence.\n\nWith all that said, today POSTAL is considered tame, even wacky. It's a top down action arcade game where you move around small chunks of a town & city with 16 levels in all. You pick up items like weapons, ammo, health, and armor, and shoot down any hostiles and if you so choose, civilians. The enemies in this game are tongue in cheek, you have your standard police with pistols, shotguns and assault rifles. But you also have people toting RPGs, throwing dynamite at you, trying to set you on fire with Molotovs and napalm launchers, or they'll have you facing up against small blue turrets that shoot a range of weaponry at you. At the end of the game, you'll face off against US marines.\n\nYou have a variety of weapons in this game, from your starting machine gun with infinite ammo, to a shotgun, auto-shotgun, grenades, Molotovs, an assortment of mines, rocket launcher, napalm launcher and flamethrower. You can acquire a backpack to carry more supplies and your health always stacks up to 200. Armor acts like a total shield and absorbs all damage except heat until it reaches zero.\n\nIn order to complete a level, you must kill 90% of hostiles. This means you could leave every bystander and in some cases, a few hostiles left if you wanted. So let it be known that the game never forces you to kill civilians, it's entirely player choice. It's an extremely straight forward game for the most part. Kill, move on, rinse, repeat. Nothing too special. But not exactly terrible either. The controls are also extremely clunky for a keyboard and mouse, whereas the controller on the latest Steam version is very good. So be warned, KB+M users.\n\nGraphics wise, it looks aged and ugly. The backgrounds are all static artworks with voxel models running around on top. Think Resident Evil, only top down. They never change, and the only breakable prop are exploding barrels that lay all around the levels and cause fires to break out. The voxels are very ugly nowadays, and the game's color tone is dithered and muted. The surreal artwork, which is one of the only actually disturbing things about this game (besides the music and diary entries), is fantastic.\n\nSound wise, POSTAL is one of the most obnoxious games my ears have ever heard. Two words. Sound pollution. The people in this game, including your character, all talk A LOT. Too much in fact. It gets grating fast, and I would honestly give it a flat out F in that department. Hearing someone say their annoyingly cheesy line 5-6 times as I shoot into them gets mind numbing before long. However, your character's voice acting in this game is deliciously evil sounding and mean-spirited, they really made him sound like an evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it's the only good voice acting in the game, reminds me of the voices heard in Dungeon Keeper. The music and ambiance of this game is also really good. Some of it is downright dreary and disturbing, and it's things like that, that help POSTAL walk a fine line between being completely ♥♥♥♥ed up but also very wacky and darkly humorous.\n\nStory wise, there isn't much to go on here. You play a guy called "Postal Dude", who judging by his journal entries, is getting his house taken away and believes the whole town is mad with disease. So, he sets off on a killing spree to the air force base where he believes the chemical is being spread from. Each mission begins with a diary entry from your character and each of these is a very dark and disturbing look into a paranoid delusional man. You'll fight across small towns, an ostrich farm, a city, to an industrial complex and finally the air force base. The game comes with its original expansion, which include 4 new levels, including a shopping center and resort hotel. The artwork on these expansion levels is notably lesser quality than the original levels, and they don't feel like anything special to play.\n\nThe game also offers a gauntlet mode, which is just a bunch of cheaply put together objectives on the same maps. Things like collect flags or kill before the time runs out. Again, nothing special.\n\nAs I said, this game features civilians. Men and women that run around, scream, and pose zero threat but are there for you to gun down anyways if you so choose. Consider this, in 1997, with the theme that this game has (spree killer shooting up his town), this was so controversial that the developer, Running With Scissors, was not only sued by the US POSTAL service, but they also got phone calls from the FBI, the US Treasury Department, and had gotten visits from the government in person. In two short years, the Columbine high school shooting happened, and many, many copycat killers followed since.\n\nI bring all of this up because, honestly, the history of POSTAL and what it did for free speech in gaming I feel is far more important than the gameplay itself. The gameplay is standard stuff, with a slight strategic edge to it. Knowing how to deal with all the different enemy types and when to use which weapon is important. But the only thing that separated this game from the others, is the theme and the fact there are bystanders running around, free for you to gun down.\n\nOverall, POSTAL was an odd one back in 1997, and honestly it's not a particularly great one either. But what this game did for gaming often goes unsaid, with games like GTA taking all the credit instead. In reality, it was a group effort between games like POSTAL and others. The sequel after this would take a tone shift to a more "South Park" style of wacky satire and violence, but the first one lives on with the release of POSTAL Redux. So, in my opinion, unless you're curious about the start to this controversial series, or you just want to play a piece of forgotten history, I'd recommend you just grab the Redux instead, which plays better and will be updated with new content.","May 31","false","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game does at times have dark humor (especially in the Special Delivery expansion pack) that I'll admit I chuckled at, but it doesn't take away from the game's dark tone.  Originally the tank controls made the game more difficult, but as of this review an update giving it twin stick controls make it much more manageable.  Also, I really like the art style and the Postal Dude's voice.\n\nIt'd pain me to rate it on a scale so I'll just tell you that you should really buy it.\n\n","October 7, 2015","true","8.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Played using AWSD for movement and arrow keys for firing directions.\n\nOh, and if you aren't doing too well go ahead and kill yourself whenever with Q.\n\nSo, 17 levels, crazy weapons and the rage to murder people, thats what your getting into.\n\nIts cheapish and well worth it when its on sale.\n\nPersonal Rating: 2.5/5","December 3, 2015","true","4.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It was the start of the Postal series, some may argue that this is the best one, while the others don't really like the old school graphics and the way the game is played. I myself personally love retro games, it really shows us how much we have developed through gaming history.\n\nGameplayPostal hasn't really got that much too it via the gameplay. There isn't really any story line to the game, it's pretty self-explanatory when you first enter the game. What's your objective? Kill everyone. Yep that's right, your soul purpose in this game is to literally a certain pecentage of the population on that map in order to proceed. You'll find a variety of guns as you progress through each level, as they get more and more challenging as the game goes on. The controls are pretty basic, WSAD to move and the arrow keys to shoot in the direction you want to shoot. This kind of control scheme is so much better then using the mouse to point and shoot (in my opinion). You'll obviously have to dodge other police guards and other random people that will try to kill you at any cost, using rocket launchers, shotguns, machine guns ect. A small complaint I do have with this game is that if you get hit by a rocket launcher, then you fall on the ground. If the AI is smart he will continue to shoot rocket launchers at you before you can stand up, therefor killing you in a cheap sort of way. I'm not gonna say that this is a big complaint to make, as this game was made in 1997, but it's just something to keep in mind. Keep your distance. The variety of levels is rather nice as well, you may find yourself in a wide range of different locations, but with a not a lot of variety of enemies. I like the way that the game also has a quick reset, so that if you do die, or you feel like you have messed up then you can quickly and easily reset the game using space (by defult). This a nice feature to the game rather than waiting everytime for a laoding screen, losing the pacing of the game all together. That being said, this game is by no means easy, okay the first few levels are just a warm up to what you are going to encounter later of, with a large number of enemies attacking you from different sides, you can't simply just run into a area and kill them all. But this game is also by no means very strategic. I guess you could be, planning out what enemies you're going to kill that you see in the screen then going forth with that plan, but other than that it's not strategic at all, and that's perfectally fine for this type of game, a fast paced single player shooter.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics of this game is obviously gonna be judged from the time that this game was made. 1997. Well I wasn't even born then so I don't really have a standard of what games should've looked like back then. Some of the graphics seem to stand out more than others, some of them are really well detailed and done. While some others look a bit out of place, what I mean by that is that some are nicely polished off, and then some just seem to be hand drawn and not bothered polishing off. I guess that must just be because of the time of when this game was made, but like I said I don't really have much to work on since I don't really have any 'standards' for what games where meant to look like in 1997. The characters look well done, and the animations are smooth.\n\nMusic & SoundThe game itself diesn't base around the music very much, sometimes you will find some levels don't have any music at all. There has obviously been a lot of time and effeort for the sound effects of this game, each gun having a different sound effect when you shoot and reload the weapon. There is obviously a lot of screaming and grunting as you are literally killing every living person you see. It works very well with the whole murder spree situation of the game just because you can.\n\nConclusion/TL:DRThe game itself evolves around you killing every living person you come across. While collecting a variety of different weapons that you can use to kill other people. The graphics are fairly good for the time I guess...? I don't really have a standard for what graphics where suppose to look like in 1997.

In my opinion this is one of my favorites in the series, infact it's my favorite third-person shooter game.\n\nThe story isn't that incredible and just there because there needs to be one, basically life in paradise is ♥♥♥♥, and you are being evacted from your own house, you (The Postal Dude) think that there's a disease going around and you, you are the cure, you go on rampage with your shades and memorable one-liners to ♥♥♥♥ up Paradise. That is basically the plot, although there's a diary entry in the manual.\n\nThe aim of the game is simple kill all the hostiles, and kill all bystandards (if desired). You are told to kill a certain amount of people, however it's best to kill everyone, after you kill everyone you press F1 to proceed, this is what confused a lot of people who didn't read the instructions, but funnily enough you get an achievment!\nThe game can become difficult as you progress, so it's good to take you time, however not only does the difficulty increase, so does your roster which becomes very useful in certain situations. You have a stock standard weapons roster,  but you'll be using the SMG the most since it has unlimited ammo.\n\nAs I said this game can be very difficult at times, which is why the gameplay becomes very strategical making you want to plan your moves, the game isn't as frustrating as for example: Hotline Miami, the game is the sort of difficulty you would expect from Quake, a game that influences POSTAL quite a bit and was definetly the type of game RWS were aiming for.\n\nIf you were a fan of the sequels, then you may be","September 14, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, once you play around a bit with the control setup (I HIGHLY recommend clicking the "use old defaults" option and enabling the mouse btw) and acclimatize to the feel of the game, it's actually pretty fun.\n\nIt feels A LOT more demented and twisted than its more popular successor, Postal 2, but it still has a sly undercurrent of dark humor lying under the surface. In fact, I'd say comparing Postal 1 to Postal 2 is kind of like comparing Carmageddon 1 and 2; the sequels both have overall better gameplay and controls, but the originals deliver a lot more in terms of atmosphere and gleeful sickness. Games like Postal 1 and Carmageddon 1 just have this amazing grittiness to them that hasn't really been seen in games since the late 1990s.\n\nAnyway, do I recommend Postal? Yes, but only if you can stomach the disturbing content, and you have the patience to withstand archaic controls and graphics as well as semi-frequent bugs. If you don't like old games with weird controls, or are disturbed by anything more violent than Grand Theft Auto, then I wouldn't recommend it.","January 5","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But hey, I only decided to retry Postal now that the devs changed the controls, so that it's easier for people to play it. And indeed, it's better.\n\nAnd as to be clear, I'm not doing it because my negative review seemed to be not helpful (6 people on 9 downvoted it) at all when it was clearly constructive. I'm doing it because the change the devs made allowed finally to appreciate Postal like I should have if it wasn't for the controls.\n\nAnother thing: I don't mind old games. I didn't write first a negative review because of that. Like I've said in my old review, having played on PC, NES and Game Boy in more or less 1989-1990, at age of 6-7, I've seen a good part of the video game history. And I don't mind games like Postal. I could play them (or an old GTA) without problems. I don't mind Postal at all. Now that I've played enough, I can finally say more.\n\nYou have to understand that when you can't play a game because of a control layout, you can't fully explain it. Postal, it's a game where you kill everyone, hostile or not hostile. Well, you can choose to spare innocent lives. Anyway, the hostiles are mainly cops. The view is an isometric one, that's probably why the original layout for the controls didn't match my own pattern in these games.\n\nTrue, pressing "right" for me is equal to going right and not anything else. Back then, it wasn't doing what I wanted. The mouse wasn't easy to use. Now, there are several layouts. I don't remember if there were so many options, but now, when I press "right", I go to the right! I don't even use the mouse anymore. I've still yet to adapt some stuff, as I fire in the same time when pressing the arrows, but it's a matter of keys. Two actions are binded with the same key, I've just to change it, because I'm currently killing everyone and if I want to spare innocents, I need to stop firing.\n\nThe result was immediate. Now that I could move more freely, I've reached the fourth level, I've unlocked more achievements and I'm finally appreciating Postal. I'm finally appreciating the run in the levels, ducking under the rockets, when I remember that I can duck, executing people still alive, though it's just not my style to do it, I prefer to run and to spread bullets everywhere.\n\nTrue, I die a lot because I've no strategy apart running wildly around. And I don't even use the other weapons, don't ask me why I'm willing to use the infinite ammo one, though I suppose it will be hard to keep that strategy in the next levels. But hey, I'm willing to try.\n\nThe only downside of this is that I still need to find the best layout for me and that I read about an achievement with Mac and Linux and that I'm sad to see that the 100% completion can't be done for many of us. Well, yeah, I'm too lazy to install a virtual machine. Anyway, apart that, because the devs made the effort for the controls and that this was a saving update for the game for the players, I can't keep the negative review. That's how a game can go from a negative to a positive review: by listening your players and by improving the game to make sure that the majority can get fun.\n\nSorry for the lateness though. This update is around since October 2015. I wouldn't have tried the game again and rewritten this review if this update wasn't in my head somewhere. Good job!","January 11, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

A game of pure edginess that it makes Manhunt weep (kinda).\n\nGameplay\nIsometric shoot 'em up with a focus on a variety of weapons used to painfully dispatch your opponents. Using the arrow keys or the mouse to move and shoot, X when you have committed the act of violence and they beg for your mercy, you can kill them with that X key. You must cull a certain percentage of the filth that roams in front of Earth and then hit F1 to continue to a next area requiring your cleansing.\n\nRecommendations\nThe sound design for the game is a bit hammy (occasional humorous quips from Postal Dude) but works brilliantly in portraying a grimdark world in which you look through the eyes of a psychopathic serial killer. Alone that makes the game unique for it and recognizable.\n\nPostal itself is litertally self-parody, mocking the absurdities of the gaming industry's reaction to ultra-violence and decadence. Dark humour is present and makes fun of your victims deaths proves this. Pretentious as all hell statement but I feel it works.\n\nSimple control system makes it easy to play but hard to master.\n\nIgnore the critics (IGN, Gamespot), this game is above average. It's "low ratings" are because of Postal's overall thematic nature of advocating violence and murder is what gave it those low ratings. Beyond that, it's a competent title with style.\n\nCriticisms\nMajor\nExtremely difficult in later stages due to the way the rockets track, this can be rectified via holding CTRL but leaves you open to attacks from other NPCs. Being immolated (set on fire) is realistic but can grate you if you're trying to avoid the large hurtbox.\n\nIn terms of camerawork, the camera angles are horrible and heavily distract you while shooting.\n\nMinor\nGraphics obscure the player model making it hard to identify where you are in-game.\n\nGunplay\nUse the number keys 1-9;0 to change weapons that you collect during the episodes. Burn them alive and watch them turn into crispy human bits or blow 'em up and hear their screams!\n\nMusic\nGrim industrial music booms as you slaughter dozens of bystanders and aggressors.\n\nGraphics\nA mixture of 3D models superimposed onto a 2D isometric view of your character, giving the game a very grimdark, urban and hand-drawn feel.\n\nMechanics\nShoot or die. Literally there is all to it, different weaons such as Molotov Cocktails produce large AoE of flame causing DoT effect on the place it is thrown and the person that is on fire.\n\nStoryline\nThe Postal Dude is to cleanse the Earth of all that remain. The world is his oyster and coincidentally yours too. Murder all of the pixel men!\n\nEvaluation\nPassable recommendation, due to it's difficulty and short length.","April 15, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That being said I deffinately will admit it's a down grade. You go from a free roam world where you can do the objectives in any order and in any way turning the game more into an experinment of "It's only as violent as the player makes it." to a linear top down "Kill atleast 80% of hostiles" experience.\n\nThat doesnt mean the game is bad. I just want to make it clear that POSTAL is deffinately a required taste or for appreciation purposes.\n\nPOSTAL 2 is funny, vulgar, and the killing is just a joke [for me anyway]. POSTAL 1 has some humor and the killing is brutal as heck. How is it different from slicing a guys head of and launching it across the map? Because it's just Dark. Each level starts with a diary entry or qoute or whatever you wanna look at it. The qoute is extremely dark and kinda creepy. The pictures behind the quote is people laying dead and the art is just.....scary....\n\nThe game starts....and shooty shooty bang bang with such a dark atmosphere. Screaming and pleaing with little humor to lighten the mood.....I love it so much!!!!\n\nI like this game, It's a classic\n\n\n\n\n\nand there is achievements","November 17, 2014","true","1.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

It hurt me mentally, physically, and emotionally.  Yet I found myself alarmingly aroused. The art and music of the loading screens will haunt my nightmares to the end of existence, but I like that. The designers should be exiled from society for making this, and I should be exiled for enjoying it.\n\nPostal is the most demented, twisted, and unsettling video game I've ever played.  Whether that makes it good or not is subjective, it's one of those things that you don't want to do because you know it's wrong, but you can't stop yourself from doing it anyway, which (unfortunately for my humanity) means I liked it, which probably also means I'm going to hell.\n\nAs for the gameplay, look, it's an isometric top down shooter with tank controls, it plays wells, controls fine, difficulty level is pretty high, but that's not what you're coming to the game for, be honest with yourself.  You want to play this to find out how much of a piece of human garbage you are and revel in the discovery.\n\nListen-\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cio4Bx_9A8k\n\nHelp.","July 24, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I first played this on GOG and found it quite boring and wasn't has fun as the second postal. However I recently got it on steam and decided to try it out again. Wow this game is pretty epic. I'm also glad to hear a redux is coming. Back to the game itself: it's an isometric shooter developed in the late 90's in which the objective is to spread mayhem and kill anything that moves. It's quite fun and nothing like the second one. I like the second one better but this one is much more brutal! While Postal 2 pokes fun at America and satires how stupid American society is this one is basically a murder game. It has enough weapons to my likings although some say it's number of weapons is insufficent. The graphics are pretty interesting. It's mostly drawings with you and the NPC'S as pixelized humans. I personally dislike isometric games but this one is an exception. I reccomend "Reign In Blood" or "God hates us all" by slayer to have the greatest experience.","December 27, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But for the kind of game that Postal is, it doesn’t really need one. It’s just mindless fun. And you know what, that’s okay. The game is played in a top down, isometric point of view (kind of like Sonic 3D Blast or Command & Conquer). This is actually pretty cool. The camera is neither too far away or too close. You have a good sense of where you are and where enemies are. So it’s not hard to plan things out. It’s best if you play the game tactically. There is however a drawback to the whole bird’s eye, isometric view. It’s a bit hard to line up your shots with an NPC. And it can get frustrating (especially when the NPCs move which they will do by the way). But it’s forgivable seeing as that it doesn’t take much to kill an NPC. You have a selection of about eight weapons. Your default weapon which is a weak assault rifle, a stronger assault rifle, a shotgun, a grenade, a missile launcher, a molotov cocktail, a flamethrower, and an RPG. You even get a few specialty weapons such as land mines.\nYou play as a character called The Dude. No, not Dude from The Big Lebowski but The Postal Dude. The only way I can describe The Postal Dude is that he’s a smoother, less muscular version of Duke Nukem. He also shouts catchphrases like Duke. Catchphrases Like “Buttsauce” and “don’t be a sissy”. Though, he can also be described as a more tragic version of Duke Nukem as well. If you are following the games (almost non-existent) plot, it turns out that The Dude has gone insane and is under the impression that everyone in the city has a madness disease. So he takes it upon himself to exterminate everything that moves. I won’t give away the ending. But I will say that it is pretty satisfying.\nSo in conclusion, all I can say is that Postal is mindless fun. It’s really just a pick up and play game. It’s also a good way to relief stress after a grilling day at work or school.  This game gets the official Redneck grade of G for good.\n","June 16, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OutrageousTomb1/recommended/232770/","OutrageousTomb1","OutrageousTomb1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OutrageousTomb1/","119 products in account","Postal is by far one of gaming's most brutal and possibly traumitizing titles. Released back in 1997 for the PC, it was full of violence, executions, and very disturbing imagery. It wouldn't be a stretch to call this the Silent Hill 2 of its era for how it could scar someone. Coming from the lighthearted and South Park-esque tone of Postal 2, this is a pretty jarring shift in tone. So if you were expecting the goofy tone of Postal 2 to have originated in this game, then this won't be for you.\n\nBut ignoring comparisons of Postal 2 and its tone for this review, Postal is a very enjoyable isometric shooter. The weapons (with the possible sole exception of the basic shotgun) are all very powerful and fun to use. The levels are cool to look at, even if the character models look like something out of Thief or System Shock 2. The game does provide a pretty good challenge with a variety of difficulty modes to choose from. My only complaints with the game lie with the removal of the multiplayer and level editor (the latter of which could have been great for Steam Workshop), as well as the short 4-5 hour campaign. But if you're looking for a darkly-toned stress reliever, then Postal is for you. It's cheap and very fun. While Postal 2 is certainly a step up from this one, Postal is still very enjoyable. Well as enjoyable as it can be with its dark tone.","November 22, 2014","true","7.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Seriously, not many devs bother to patch a game as old as this one, but they recently provided a major update fixing most of the issues with the game (especially the controls). Really cool of them! :)\nOther than that, it's the same game. It's Postal. Not as good as the 2nd one, and not much depth in terms of gameplay, but what it does have is damn satisfying. If you can't wait for the Redux to drop, I'd say pick it up during a sale.\n\n----\n\nTo start, the controls are just awful. Remapping them in a number of different ways does little to alleiviate this. Playing with a controller or a joystick does little to make it better. It renders the game nearly unplayable. Words simply cannot express how backwards the control scheme in this game is.\nThe game was interesting back in the day purely for shock value, but now do yourself a favor and skip this one and go straight for Postal 2.","February 15, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

Unlike its sequels, the cynical humor and urination takes a backseat for a more dark, morbid and unsettling tone. The game is exactly as it was back in '97 just with a bit of tweaking to run on modern systems, so don't be all too mortified by the chunky visuals and horrendous aiming (the mouse AFAIK only rotates Postal Dude, it does not actually allow you to point and aim).\n\nI'd mainly reccomend Postal to those who played the game back in the day, curious about the grim and gritty beginnings of the Postal, or take enjoyment in playing archaic-as-hell PC games like I am.","November 20, 2014","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When I've playing Postal 2 first (A black comedy FPS) since its first release. I've done Postal 2 so many times, without knowing the previous game ... the original games.\n\nLater I've got the original one, and hey ... this games is so brutal and dark. There is only one mission in every stages, kill everyone you've see in the map. You can kill civilian or police or other gangs with various weapon you can carry. And then, you can execute the people and send him to afterlife despite he / she begging you do not to kill him / her. This options, made this game so controversial at that time. You've made a bloody cold killer without mercy.\n\nGameplay is good, but you've to learn how to use the control better. Mastering the control can be frutation at first, but when you've master it. It can be easy, and you can survive better in every stage. Well, its a gem to play this one.\n\nWell, without a doubt I've buy this game at steam for its feature (Achievements & Trading Cards) that I did't have in my own previous version.\n\nThanks RWS to steam version of this game.\n\nMy Rating : 9.5 / 10","March 30, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It suffers from crap controls, for example, you aim with your arrow keys. Sinful controls aside, the game doesn't include any kind of tasks to carry out. It's mindless slaughter. Yeah, I know it was the first game, but the first game had serious problems. I thought when I bought this I would be playing a birds eye view POSTAL 2 that takes place in... in... Alaska? I have no clue where the game takes place. The story isn't present. POSTAL 2 had a story believe it or not, but it was a random one. If you want to see POSTAL 2's father, here it is.

The enemies offer a good challange, and the game over all has it's charm, incuding the simple dark feel to the game.\n\nThe problem comes down to some simple things: the first is the controls, the game controls awfully, to try to explain, it feels like a high pace game, but it has Resident Evil controls (forward is forward no matter what direction you're facing.) This causes alot of problems with just STAYING ALIVE.\n\nThe level art design is also Bad.

Even by 1997 standards it looks and plays lousy, not to mention the arguably offensive content.\n\nThe only reason I was able to play this game is because I went into the file called "Postal Plus.ini" and manually tweaked the controls enough to get the game feeling smooth.  The in-game key binding feature wasn't good enough to map the mouse and some of the keys on the keypad.\n\nThe graphics are all hand-drawn and are (hopefully) intentionally lousy. This style makes the game more visceral and gritty while at the same time making the game less serious.  If the game looked good I think it would be much more disturbing blasting one's way through a shanty town, a department store, or a retirement home.\n\nOne area that the game shines is the weapon selection.  There is a good variety of things to try out like throwing moltov cocktails, heat seeking rockets, and even an automatic shotgun.  Unfortunately this is lost on dumb enemy AI and the point at which I can't recommend this game.\n\nIn fairness to the developers it seems they are still updating the game for Steam users that bought Postal Plus.  It's one of the few late 90's games that have achievements, and that is impressive to me.\n\nThis game is sub-par and only serves to fill a basic need for a violent action game when all the other classics have been finished (DooM, Blood, Duke Nukem, Quake and so on).  If it comes to you in a bundle give it a try, but don't buy it.","June 18, 2014","false","9.8"," 44 of 94 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","44","94","0","6"

But there is no background story and you don't know why you need to kill everyone you see. Graphics for a game that old are not bad, but controls are not comfortable, they need to get used to.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theflag/recommended/232770/","Theflag","Why would you do that?","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theflag/","134 products in account","(Just a side note I bought this game for 50 cents so I don't compleatly hate this game)\n\nThis game was Running with scissors's first game they made and dose it really show.\n\nWell first let me start with the things I like about the game,\n\n1. The backgrounds are hand drawn and looks great for a game that is a third person/ Isometric Shooter.\n\n2. You can kill everyone in all 21 levels in this game, Cop or Civillian.\n\n3. What little music this game has is great because it is the kind that I think whould deffinetly fit in a game about a psycopath going on a killing spree (I whold suggest you look up the sound track online).\n\nNow we get into the things I don't like the game, EVERY THING THAT ISNT THE THREE THINGS I SAID I LIKE (No the controls arent here because you can rebind them). Let me explain why.\n\n1. The Postal dude moves slow as hell. Even when you bind and use the run button he will only move at a walking speed with out the run button and a joging speed with it and that makes it hard to doge the bullets, grenades, and that fly your way Even thought it dosent matter when Molitovs and rockets come into play.\n\n2. The enemy A.I is stupid, Either the enemys act like real people and use cover effectively and get behind cover when ever you pop your head out of cover or it can just stand in one place and keep throwing grenades or shooting rockets at you and just stand out in the open and don't move into cover untill they get shot witch they then run right into cover and don't come out so you have to chase them or they can just be idiots and charge your position running stright into your bullets like a sponge.\n\n3. There are only 8 weapons in the game, The guns are a Rifle, a Shotgun, an Auto shotgun, Grenades, a Rocket launcher, Heatseeking Rockets, Molitovs, and mines. you might think that they must be fun to use right? Well that depends on if you don't mind having most of them have a very low damage output because the enemys some how can take so many rifle bullets and some how can take up to 4 shotgun blasts to the face. Also just for the hell of it the game has pointless executions that can only be proformed with the rifle and what I mean by executions I mean there is only one in the whole game and it is where you look down and shoot the person one the ground.\n\n4. Aiming in this game just sucks, To aim in this game you have to manualy rotate the Postal Dude 360 degrees around him to get him to face the right direction and there is no way to quickly turn around and defend your self from enemys behind you.\n\n5. You can't shoot while you are crouching. This is a major problem when you fight some one who has a rocket launcher because when you find someone who has a rocket launcher they will some times shoot their rockets so fast that when you crouch and get back up the ♥♥♥♥er will have already shot another rocket at you so you have to crouch again or get hit in the face with it and take both knock back and a chunk of your health with it but other that that you don't have to crouch AT ALL because crouching under enemy bullets dose nothing you will still get shot.\n\n6. The health packs and armor pick ups give you so little. When you pick up a medkit the most it will ever give you is 10 health and your max health you can have is 100 and the same things apply to armor only when you have even one point of armor your health will not drop at all but because of all the things tring to kill you (Molitovs and rockets espesialy) your probably wont have more than 10 points of armor before you lose it all and then because of this you will probably lose some of your health and durring the latter levels if it dips below 40 points you might as well just restart the level.\n\n7.If you die durring a level you have to restart from the begining of the level. Nuff said there.\n\n8. The game never tells you how to go to the next level. This was a huge problem for me because I was stuck on the first level after killing all the enemys for about 15 minutes just trying to find out how to progress to the next level before I looked at other peoples reviews of this game and found out that to go to the next level you had to press F1. Thanks for not telling me how to progress through the game your selves developers. No game should have you look online just to go to the next level and why choses a key like F1 for something this important? Why not just have it be automatic?\n\nThis is why I think you should not buy this game and buy Postal 2 instead and like I said I bought this game for only 50 cents but that was because I hat got a steam coupon from leveling up my steam level But get this, the game can be bought with out one for FIVE DOLLARS. I think that is too much for this  poorly aged turd of a game maybe if it was 50 cents like what I bought it for it might have been a good little distraction but you have to pay 5 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars for a game that wasnt even that good when it was released in 1997. But if you think you still want to buy this game go ahead I just wanted to warn you the things you might get your self into with this review so if you want to spend 5 dollars for a game that might just be forgoten in you games library go ahead.\n\n(Also I'm going to have nightmares because of the screen that shows up when you quit the game)","September 26, 2014","false","0.7"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","3"

The game feels incredibly clunky and the combat feels extremely archaic. Postal's greatest strength is its shock value, but the violence truly lacks the surprise it once had due to the ever increasing amount of over-the-top gratuitous violence in today's video games. While I tried to see the good in the game, there was barely anything worth buying the game for. The very fact that the player has to press a button to progress to the next level just shows how outdated the game is. I spent a couple of minutes in the first level wondering why I couldn't proceed to the next level. Hilariously enough, all it took was to press the F1 button. Overall, Postal has almost no redeeming value to it and you'd be better off playing almost any other isometric shooter game.","November 19, 2014","false","5.4"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Unlike Postal 2 (which is a complete chore of a game, a circus clown who smeared his face in ketchup riding on your shoulders firing his gun into the air while beating you about the head with his collection of Garbage Pail Kids merchandise), the imagery really works here and I felt genuinely, horribly disturbed by it. Say what you want about the series' tendency to dial it to eleven, here it ♥♥♥♥ing works.\n\nUnfortunately the gameplay is 1996-style isometric bullcrap. You spin your character around to shoot the bros, take cover when they are shooting at you. There are civilians and it doesn't matter whether you shoot them or not, you just have to kill the ones with actual weapons. So the big darkness the Postal Dude is fighting is other people with guns, because he should have all the guns and not anyone else!\n\nIt only gets away with what it does because of its context, but not enough to warrant a recommendation.","September 17, 2014","false","1.3"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","9","23","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sitagi/recommended/232770/","sitagi","undercat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sitagi/","940 products in account","Postal 1 is more fun than it may seem, but the reasons for that are quite vague.\n\nThe game is an isometric shooter with buggy hand drawn environment, extremely janky controls and poor semi-scripted AI.\n\nThat said, the weapon variety is rich and the maps are interesting. Most importantly, it actually feels fun to "outsmart" the dumb AI by shooting enemies that are stuck in the scenery or cannot see you and to trick them into blowing up and burning each other. It's a bit weird thing to say, but, as it turns out, the game's biggest appeal lies in its shortcomings.\n\nDespite the fun factor, I would not recommend the game to myself, had I not played it a long time ago. The reason for this is that I'm not feeling comfortable with such level of violence anymore. I'm OK with some cartoony murder of faceless low-poly clones, but when the police ladies you have to kill start screaming in agony for half a minute and the game has a dedicated button for putting dying people out of their misery, that's a bit over the line for me.\n\nOn top of this, the game crashes quite frequently, which may be very frustrating when it happens after nearly completing a level. I don't recall this being a problem with the original game, so there must be something wrong with the revamped Steam version.\n\nIf the excessive violence, low resolution and general instability do not turn you off, however, you may have some good fun with the game, especially on the hardest difficulty (which is really not that hard, once you get used to the controls and the pacing).","June 23, 2014","false","9.1"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Infyre/recommended/232770/","Infyre","Pyrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Infyre/","363 products in account","Piece of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI believe this is one of the most stress-inducing games you'll ever play. You'll be lucky that you wouldn't want to go postal after playing a game like this. I've forgotten how dark, disturbing and controversial this game is. Instead, I have feelings of nothing but headaches and stress. Giving an early review because I've had it up to my neck with this game.\n\nGraphics (89/100) - The artwork in this game is pretty good. Details greatly on how dark the atmosphere is to the level design. The fact that the levels are hand-painted, if I understand correctly, is really a nice touch and gives a certain detail. Although in some cases, it'll look a little ugly at times.\n\nGameplay (70/100) - I have some minor issues with gameplay, considering how to aim and whether it's hitting half the time.\n\nDifficulty (5/100) - This game is by default, set to "♥♥♥♥ you". Like I've said above, it'll give you more stress than easing it but that's my personal take on this game. The enemies have such a resiliency to die that it breaks realism. I mean, I'm pumping more bullets than the human anatomy can normally take. These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are still able to run, shoot and at times kill me before me getting them. Armor aside, it looks like most of them aren't really wearing any and they can take 20+ hits before FINALLY dying. You'll be screaming "DIE! ♥♥♥♥ING DIE!" in your mind or by voice trying to take these guys out.\n\nI also have to point out that the A.I can get cheap on you. Sometimes, the enemies get a little too trigger-happy so they'll be able to rapidly shoot and you'll be a sitting duck because your character isolates when hit. Then you've got the damn rocket launching ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spamming their rockets at you, by the time your slow-♥♥♥ character gets up, here comes another rocket to take! For ♥♥♥♥s sakes. It's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...\n\nControls (60/100) - My only gripe with the controls is that, I can move with A,S,W,D freely. But the mouse rotates me like a turret and I don't like that. I haven't seen a feature of the game where disabling that functionality from the mouse exists. So it takes some getting used to just using one button on the mouse to shoot and the keys to move.\n\nSounds/Music (80/100) - I mostly like the whole gothic/techno/industrial ambience themes going for what music this game has. It just sets the tone and atmosphere for what you're in for. Sound-wise, they're there. The voice is wise-cracking at times for certain kills and if you've played Postal 2 before Postal 1, you'll notice the guy's voice sounds familiar. However in this one, it's all in the head and not the actual character speaking.\n\nConclusion (50/100) - Now while I do say at the beginning that it's a piece of ♥♥♥♥. I have to point out some of the good things about this game. There is some novelty to be found here. However, I am not pleased at all with the difficulty and I simply refuse to alter it as I'm a player who goes in and plays a game at it's default setting. This is one of the most highly controversial games ever made and you would see why. Because for it's time, shooting up buildings and senseless violence were a  huge thing back in it's day within the 90s. Not that kind of thing has stopped, unfortunately. So, obviously this game alone would be one of the many that made controversy.\n\nPlay Responsibly. If it pisses you off, don't be an idiot and take this game too seriously and take whatever mental issue you have out on things. I know I'm taking a break from this damn thing because of it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.","October 4, 2014","false","12.9"," 4 of 21 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","4","21","0","0"

I wanted to play it for a bit longer and give it another chance but it's so bad that, unfortunately I had to exit it. The gameplay is horrendous and you can barely control your character. Your often getting stuck in walls and it's a task just to make your character go in the direction you want him to go. The game is also fairly hard. You have to kill a certain amount of people without getting killed, and if you end up getting killed you have to start from the beginning which is a real pain. Look, I understand the game is over 10 years old but I'm sure it could of been done better. Age is no excuse. I got a coupon for the game and only paid 50 cents and that's the only reason I bought it and even though I spent as little as 50 cents...I still feel like it was a huge waste of money. Don't even bother with this rubbish. I'm sure POSTAL 2 is even worse. I give it 1.5/10.","October 12, 2014","false","0.2"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","2","17","0","7"

The controls are a bit awkward, but once you wrap your head around the fact that ctrl is shoot and f is duck, it becomes a very successful anger management class. The reason I like POSTAL so much is because the levels all look like actual places, like a gas station or shopping mall, and are not just generic hallways and rooms seperating you from god-knows-what that is outside. POSTAL has very open levels with very few scripted events or cutscenes, but the AI is not suited for this at all. Instead of staying in one area, the npcs will either run away and force you to track them down, or home in on you like a heat-seeking missile. Another odd thing is the fact that you do not have to kill everybody, even if they are trying to kill you. You just press F1, and The Dude magically teleports to the next level. I recommend this game, but I suggest you only get it when it is on sale, or else you may be dissapointed.\n\nP.S.

This was mostly due to the fact that in early Europe, science and medical knowledge was not so present as they are today.\n\nWhen the United States was founded, it was at a time of Enlightment. Science and medical advancements and discoveries gave psychological and biological explainations to those ficticious vampires and ghosts, casting them away into the shadows. This paved way to something unique to American phobias, and ultimately what came to define American horror--human monsters. The American boogeyman is not a vampire, a stitched together corpse, or any other monster of the sort. It's Michael Myers, Leatherface, the hillbillies from Deliverence. Most of all, it's the crazy guy with the gun, and that's what makes Postal unique and brilliant. It takes that concept, and also takes another part of American culture--the second amendment--and perverses it into our wildest nightmares.\n\nPostal 1 is a brilliant horror game, and I'd rank it up there with the likes of Silent Hill or Amnesia. It's discomforting, disturbing, exploitive and most importantly, real. I'd highly recommend it, but only if you can handle it.","December 29, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does seem it has gotten enough attention for it to be A problem worth fixing.\n\nSo, do I recommend Postal? Well, Yes and No. The game is a cult classic.

The guns are SUPERB, with a wonderful default infinite ammo machine gun, with shotguns, grenades, molotovs, rocket launchers (homing or standard), flamethrowers, landmines, same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ creation half way between a grenade launcher and a flamethrower, as well as my personal favourite, the rapid fire machine shotgun.\n\nThe levels themselves vary quite dramatically in size and style, with multiple ways of approaching murdering everyone. Occassionally it will take you a few tries to figure out whats the best way for you to do it, with every level having just enough action all the time but not suffocating you often or in ways you can't escape and reapproach.\n\nI highly recommend this to anybody who likes the classic FPS from the 90s when you clear a room and move on, or arcade arena shooters like Robotron and Smash TV. A very enjoyable romp.","July 22, 2014","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I actually took the time to read some of the reviews over on Metacritic regarding POSTAL. All I saw was a s***-ton of conceited a-holes whining while they circle-jerked to one another's bulls*** (to put it eloquently, they are all repeating the same thing and patting each other's backs for doing so).\n\nBefore I actually played the game, these Metacritic shmucks actually had me hesitant to buy the game. It was the community's reviews that swayed me to give POSTAL a go. Now that I've played the game, I doubt if those "critics" even played POSTAL at all. I'm rather convinced that they read some other d*****bag's review, changed up the words to avoid plagiarism, and called it a day. That or they are just too idiotic to see the big picture that is POSTAL.\n\nThis game isn't like others. The majority of games (especially nowadays) are all about what gimmick the game is pushing. Sometimes there's a decent story. Sometimes the gameplay feels fresh, new, or innovative. A lot of the time a game is doing one thing differently and its hyped like they have forever changed the world and brought peace to mankind...Rarely does a game become an experience. POSTAL is one of these rarities.\n\nYou will start off trying to get the hang of the controls. Once you do, you will most likely focus on the rampage to be had. You will think "this is just a shoot-em-up. Nothing new here at all". Then, you will start paying attention to the loading screens. You will begin paying attention to the levels, the surroundings. You will begin hearing what the people are shouting and how they behave. You will start realizing what you are doing in this game, and question why you are still playing it. Then in the end of it all, when you beat that final level and the ending scene rolls...your mind will be blown as you observe the reflection in the mirror.\n\nFor all of you who don't quite grasp that review or don't really care about any point to the game; here's the short version:\n\nShoot ppl.

It was just great killing people and seeing them writhe in pain as some beg you to end their life mercifully. While the tightness of the controls feels outdated even when I mapped it to my DualShock 3 using the Better DS3 utility, the gameplay is fun enough to entertain me for a few minutes.

Your main goal of the game is to kill a certain percentage of hostiles in order to progress to the next level. (You press F1 to go to the next level once you have enough kills.) Though, you can also kill innocent civilians, which you are neither helped nor hindered by killing them. The controls are pretty simplistic and I don't why everyone complains about them, WASD to move, to shoot, press the arrow keys in the direction of your target, number keys to cylcle through your weapons, and Q to commit suicide. One thing that I really liked about this game and RWS, is that this 18 year old game features: ACHIEVMENTS AND TRADING CARDS which I found to be quite funny in such a dark and grim game. Another thing about this game (And the main reason why it disturbs me) is the music and ambiet sounds, Jesus are they creepy. There's also sometimes chanting in the background which adds to the scary factor. My final rating for this game is a 9.5/10.      (Word of advice, beware of guys with explosives. Also, listening to Slayer goes great with this game.)","November 26, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was mostly due to the fact that in early Europe, science and medical knowledge was not so present as they are today.\n\nWhen the United States was founded, it was at a time of Enlightment. Science and medical advancements and discoveries gave psychological and biological explainations to those ficticious vampires and ghosts, casting them away into the shadows. This paved way to something unique to American phobias, and ultimately what came to define American horror--human monsters. The American boogeyman is not a vampire, a stitched together corpse, or any other monster of the sort. It's Michael Myers, Leatherface, the hillbillies from Deliverence. Most of all, it's the crazy guy with the gun, and that's what makes Postal unique and brilliant. It takes that concept, and also takes another part of American culture--the second amendment--and perverses it into our wildest nightmares.\n\nPostal 1 is a brilliant horror game, and I'd rank it up there with the likes of Silent Hill or Amnesia. It's discomforting, disturbing, exploitive and most importantly, real. I'd highly recommend it, but only if you can handle it.","December 29, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it around 13 years ago in some shop, it was POSTAL PLUS for around 5 dollars with nice box. Anyway, it was a great thing to buy. It was probably better than Steam version because of level editor - which I, and probably many other Postal fans, hope to see one day on Steam.\n\nWhat's the deal with Postal? There is no need to give it any thoughts or sense. You simply kill people. Bad, or good, does it matter? It's just fun slaughterhouse. You can call it sick but it's only a game. And the last mission... wow. What I also love is music when you are starting game... it have this madness aura. It's great. Sadly, whole game doesn't have the same power as it was on realease but still, you can't find games like it nowadays. It's very unique and made for simply fun.","November 18, 2015","true","42.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The schizophrenic elements are from half of the lines said which sound like they are coming from a voice inside The postal dude’s head, the game kind of points to that The postal dude believes that the city is infected with a madness disease and of course the infamous ending. This entire game is centred on psychological horror which is shown from the premise, the game has probably the most disturbing backgrounds (for the load screens, menu and credits etc.) and music I have ever heard in a video game and the game has a very dark and twisted tone.\n\nThe gameplay is that you go level to level killing everyone and everything. You have a set of weapons consisting of a machinegun, a shotgun, an auto shotgun, grenades, a rocket launcher, Molotov cocktails, a napalm launcher and a flamethrower. There are a few different types of enemies in this game: you have the standard grunts (police officers) armed with either handguns, machineguns, and shotguns, you have the people with rocket launchers, you have people that throw grenades, Molotov’s and napalm, and you have turrets that fire rockets. The difficulties have a huge effect on the game since it changes how accurate the enemies are, how much damage they can deal and it also determines what they are armed with, for instance; on the highest difficulty labelled masochist mode the majority of enemies are armed with auto shotguns, the people with rocket launchers are exclusively armed with heat seeking rockets and the people who throw stuff sometimes have flamethrowers and you’ll get killed in seconds if you’re not being careful.\n\nThere aren’t really any problems with this game but it has a very, very limited audience and it all comes down to whether you think killing civilians is sick and offensive or not.\n\nThe controversy:\n\nThe controversy for this game mainly comes from the premise since this game isn’t all that violent even for the time, this game was banned in over 10 countries and the developers were ever sued by the American postal service but that case was dropped when they found out that the game isn’t based off real events.\n\nThis is a fun game to play if you don’t mind killing innocent people in games and its worth checking it out to see a high point of the dark side of video games, this is kind of the video game equivalent of the original Texas chainsaw massacre in that it’s a cult classic and it’s a dark and highly disturbing bit of entertainment and an intresting take on horror when it came out.","September 10, 2014","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The difficulties have a huge effect on the game since it changes how accurate the enemies are, how much damage they can deal and it also determines what they are armed with, for instance; on the highest difficulty labelled masochist mode the majority of enemies are armed with auto shotguns, the people with rocket launchers are exclusively armed with heat seeking rockets and the people who throw stuff sometimes have flamethrowers and you’ll get killed in seconds if you’re not being careful.\n\nThere aren’t really any problems with this game but it has a very, very limited audience and it all comes down to whether you think killing civilians is sick and offensive or not.\n\nThe controversy:\n\nThe controversy for this game mainly comes from the premise since this game isn’t all that violent even for the time, this game was banned in over 10 countries and the developers were ever sued by the American postal service but that case was dropped when they found out that the game isn’t based off real events.\n\nThis is a fun game to play if you don’t mind killing innocent people in games and its worth checking it out to see a high point of the dark side of video games, this is kind of the video game equivalent of the original Texas chainsaw massacre in that it’s a cult classic and it’s a dark and highly disturbing bit of entertainment and an intresting take on horror when it came out.","September 10, 2014","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it around 13 years ago in some shop, it was POSTAL PLUS for around 5 dollars with nice box. Anyway, it was a great thing to buy. It was probably better than Steam version because of level editor - which I, and probably many other Postal fans, hope to see one day on Steam.\n\nWhat's the deal with Postal? There is no need to give it any thoughts or sense. You simply kill people. Bad, or good, does it matter? It's just fun slaughterhouse. You can call it sick but it's only a game. And the last mission... wow. What I also love is music when you are starting game... it have this madness aura. It's great. Sadly, whole game doesn't have the same power as it was on realease but still, you can't find games like it nowadays. It's very unique and made for simply fun.","November 18, 2015","true","42.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The control scheme is simple, WASD to move and the arrow keys to shoot. There is even a key that lets you commit suicide, which I feel should be an option in all shooters.

Your main goal of the game is to kill a certain percentage of hostiles in order to progress to the next level. (You press F1 to go to the next level once you have enough kills.) Though, you can also kill innocent civilians, which you are neither helped nor hindered by killing them. The controls are pretty simplistic and I don't why everyone complains about them, WASD to move, to shoot, press the arrow keys in the direction of your target, number keys to cylcle through your weapons, and Q to commit suicide. One thing that I really liked about this game and RWS, is that this 18 year old game features: ACHIEVMENTS AND TRADING CARDS which I found to be quite funny in such a dark and grim game. Another thing about this game (And the main reason why it disturbs me) is the music and ambiet sounds, Jesus are they creepy. There's also sometimes chanting in the background which adds to the scary factor. My final rating for this game is a 9.5/10.      (Word of advice, beware of guys with explosives.

The controls are a bit awkward, but once you wrap your head around the fact that ctrl is shoot and f is duck, it becomes a very successful anger management class. The reason I like POSTAL so much is because the levels all look like actual places, like a gas station or shopping mall, and are not just generic hallways and rooms seperating you from god-knows-what that is outside. POSTAL has very open levels with very few scripted events or cutscenes, but the AI is not suited for this at all. Instead of staying in one area, the npcs will either run away and force you to track them down, or home in on you like a heat-seeking missile. Another odd thing is the fact that you do not have to kill everybody, even if they are trying to kill you. You just press F1, and The Dude magically teleports to the next level. I recommend this game, but I suggest you only get it when it is on sale, or else you may be dissapointed.\n\nP.S.

Your main goal of the game is to kill a certain percentage of hostiles in order to progress to the next level. (You press F1 to go to the next level once you have enough kills.) Though, you can also kill innocent civilians, which you are neither helped nor hindered by killing them. The controls are pretty simplistic and I don't why everyone complains about them, WASD to move, to shoot, press the arrow keys in the direction of your target, number keys to cylcle through your weapons, and Q to commit suicide. One thing that I really liked about this game and RWS, is that this 18 year old game features: ACHIEVMENTS AND TRADING CARDS which I found to be quite funny in such a dark and grim game. Another thing about this game (And the main reason why it disturbs me) is the music and ambiet sounds, Jesus are they creepy. There's also sometimes chanting in the background which adds to the scary factor. My final rating for this game is a 9.5/10.      (Word of advice, beware of guys with explosives. Also, listening to Slayer goes great with this game.)","November 26, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No dark humour, no backstory, just shoot things.\n\nUnless you are a fan of retro games, there is little reason to play POSTAL other than to learn more about the history of Running With Scissors and the POSTAL franchise. The gameplay and graphics are so simple, it's a wonder anyone ever got offended by it back in the day. Perhaps the last generation had a thing against violence against completely featureless stick figures?\n\nI nonetheless recommend the game for the sake of supporting Running With Scissors, as they are one of the few good game devs still remaining.

It speaks to the unabridged nihilism of the game that people are still feeling uneasy to boot it up. But of course the reviewers are right, there is nothing apologetic about the rampage in Postal - this is a Michael Douglas in Falling Down simulator. And at least for that it should be saluted even if it makes you queasy.\n\nIt was however never a good game even at release, but the controversy made it go to the top of the video game nasties  - even being banned in several countries. The question I’m stuck with is if Running With Scissors ever planned for it to be a fun game to play at all? Was it all just a sarcastic social commentary? From the grinding dark ambient soundtrack, to one-liners like ”made in america” and killing lawyers at a conference taglined "Lawyers above the law 1998", it all points to be a clever but not so tasteful joke on that eras hysteria about video game violence.\n\nIt’s still a guilty pleasure to play for when your partner leave with the dog and all the money for the boss that fired you. For a little while.","March 1","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Esentially, this game is nothing like POSTAL 2. This game's goal is not to entertain you, but to disturb you. In my opinion, it suceeds. This may be a negative for some and positive for others but I thought it was just, sort of,  a thing.\n\nPlot Summary\n\nTo keep this as spoiler free as possible, The Postal Dude has presumably been evicted from his home, as shown by a moving van near his house in level one, this (again, presumably) has driven him insane. As shown by the journal entries at the beginning of each level, he belives everyone ELSE has gone insane from, something... It's never shown if he's actually right or not.\n\nOverall, the controls are okay, the plot is also fine, and gameplay is fun too, it's an isometric, although some levels are top down, shooter. But, please note, this game could be a bit too disturbing and violent for younger players. The graphics have aged a bit and the tone might drive people off though, I haven't tried multiplayer, but I hear it's not very good.\nI give this game a 7/10","January 30","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You kill people with a variety of guns and explosives. The game is pretty short and I finished it within an hour but the short length prevents the game from becoming too repitive. This game unlike its sequel takes itself seriously, so if you were hoping for the humor seen in Postal 2 you will be disapointed. The game doesn't have as much difficulty settings as the sequal but this game doesn't really need a large amount of difficulty options, they have the basic difficulty options which is enough for this game.  Other than that I can't think of anything to say about this game. The game is good enough but don't expect it to be as fun as Postal 2.","April 14","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You should buy the sequel instead.\n\nFirst of all, what makes this game suck, is that the main objective is to kill everything in sight, meaning this games intended audiance is for anarchy-driven megalomaniacs, while in the second game, you could play the game as a pacifist, even if gunnign down enemies is much easier. Killing is not an option. it's a requirement in this game.\n\nAlso, the controls are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. I can't even describe how bad they are.\nIn the second game, they knew what they were doing. which is a big plus.\n\nThis game is just as bad as the despicable POSTAL III. which I haven't even played. Postal 1, is trying to be ingenuitive, but fails in every way. however, I can forgive RWS, because it was their first game. Postal 2 was the definitive crest of the series, and Postal III is where they ♥♥♥♥ everything up, because it wasn't from the same team, and Postal 2: Paradise lost is pretty good too.\n\nOverall, buy the damn sequel! It's got Gary Coleman, and Krotchy, the talking ballsack! and even a hidden easter egg where they fight to the DEATH! what more could you ever want? Paradise lost is also a pretty good buy.","July 3, 2014","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freecore_data/recommended/232770/","freecore_data","FreeCore_DATA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freecore_data/","83 products in account","Introduction\nBack in the 90's, some elements in gameplay, art and level design were a huge impact in the video game industry. On a  early stage, some video games were backlashed due to incidents related to specific titles based on violence. POSTAL is a video game whose purpose is to understand the madness of a person, and it does great.\n\nSypnosis\nIn POSTAL you play as a man who thinks the world is infected by a outbreak of violence which is not identified, therefore he goes into a massive rampage looking for exterminate anyone infected.\n\nGameplay Analysis\nConsist in a top-down camera feature that let you see any NPC visible on your perspective. The pattern system is pretty simple, you must defeat them in order to progress the game. There are some items which can help you to improve your rampage:\n\nItem        Description                Medkit        It's available in specific parts of each map and some NPCs can drop it. The amount of points for each of them is 10 (The maximum of Health points is 200).                Bulletproof vest        This item isn't droped by any NPC in the game, it's only available in some parts of each map. The amount of points provided is 5 (The maximum of protection points is 10)                Ammo box        This item has an interesting behaviour, if you're full of ammo, the items that you can't collect just blow away from you like confetti                Weapons        According to your progress, they'll be unlocking and can be use in the next maps\nIn addition, POSTAL provides 17 maps (plus 4 additional maps as an expansion) regarding single player including a game mode called The Gauntlet Challange.  In this mode you have different tasks which make the game less repetive. There are 8 weapons and 3 tactical ones.\n\nAudio Design Analysis\nRunning with Scissors (the developes behind this project) did a good job here, some audio effects such as Ambience sound, machinery noises, vehicles and animals were design in a way that fits the environment in the story, at some point it looks like an horror game (keeping in mind the intentions of the man known as "POSTAL Dude" has).\n\nLevel Design\nDue to the game engine rendering the game in a 2D enviroment, sometimes will be difficult to see some elements such as hostiles, pedestrians or items (despite that exist a mechanism which let you see through some buildings, vehicles and trees).\n\nThe artwork design for all maps looks like concept art, whether is good or bad is totally subjective.\n\nConclusion\nI recommend this video game for anyone who likes some old arcade violence, it's entertaining and the main story is worth it.","February 28","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
