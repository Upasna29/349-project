If you want a great shooter, this is the one to get - the feel of the shooting rivals H3VR, even though it is cartoon zombies - the graphics, especially when it comes to the iron sights is crystal clear which makes it a lot more realistic to aim properly than in most other VR shooters I've tried so far. I've been in the military for over 20 years now, so I have some experience firing guns, and something about the mechanics in this game makes it feel right.\n\nDo NOT let the cartoony style fool you - this is a must buy for your Vive - it is worth every penny!\n\nEdit: If I could ask for one single addition it would be to allow for manual reload of weapons using your offhand vive controller the same way it is done in H3VR. That would make it all but perfect.","May 1","true","5.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","2"

The guns feel very satisfying to shoot.  It is pretty fun to fight your way out when you're surrounded by ten zombies right in your face.  You can also physically hit them with the gun.  Tossing a propane tank into the air and shooting it is pretty cool.   Good idea to make individual scoreboards based on weapon selection.\n\nIt may be just another VR shooter, but did hold my interest longer than any of the other Vive arcade shooter games on my first play - I think that says a lot.  When I play a popular space shooter, I only get 15 minutes out of it till I get bored.  The game has several different levels and game modes which keep it from feeling stale too quickly.\n\nI think the sale price that I paid is worth it.  I hope a few more weapons or levels are added later.","April 15","true","2.0"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaegershroom/recommended/446620/","jaegershroom","jaeger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaegershroom/","844 products in account","Zombie Training Simulator is an addicting wave-based survival shooter. Gunplay is solid with no complaints. I am a huge fan of the cartoon pseudo 2d theme. It creates an atmosphere the is enganging, but, not tense and draining such as a more horror themed survival shooter such as The Brookhaven Experiment. The cartoony theme and low level violence makes this game suitable for older children. The difficulty settings provide a suitable challenge for any skill ranges. In addition to wave-based survival there is also skill based challenges which test the player's ability to cope with a specific circumstance. The progression system and gunplay make this title enjoyable and something you will keep coming back to for quite a while.\n\nGameplay Breakdown:\nChoose from one of the guns on the table and select your challenge. In Survival, you use the resources on your table and explosives littered around the map to make it to the end of the wave. Meat acts as a zombie magnet. Propane tanks and gas cans are throwable explosives that need to be shot. Grenades are throw-and-forget timed explosives. The objective in the skill challenges varies from one to the next.\n\nPros:\n+Cartoony theme is enjoyable and suitable for older children.\n+Intense zombie gameplay without a tense atmosphere.\n+Multiple maps and skill challenges.\n+Progression system to unlock bigger and badder guns.\n+Throwable resources and littered explosives respawn at the end of the round.\n+Difficulty settings make this title accessible for any player regardless of skill level.\n+Theming is great for people who want to shoot massive amounts of zombies but not have to deal with a scary or dramatically tense atmoshpere.\n\nCons:\n-The weapon system is a bit disappointing in that you can't have both the traditional primary (assault rifle, smg, shotgun) and secondary (pistol) at one time. Because of this there is almost never a reason to use the pistols once you unlock better weapons because they are straight inferior. Being able to swap to your secondary instead of reloading would fix this, and, greatly improve gameplay.\n-The strategy for survival seems pretty systematic. Throw meat to distract the zombies. Throw explosives into large groups if there isn't one littered nearby. Shoot at zombie heads. Throw more meat when the previous one's duration expires.\n-After completion of a skill challenge there is no incentive to replay beyond trying to beat your time.\n-Progression system seems to be a bit of a grind.\n-Unlocking new guns is only achievable through total zombie kills. Pretty boring, as they could have instead rewarded by beating a certain amount of waves on a map or a certain time/score in a skill challenge.\n-I don't know how much additional content is going to be added post-launch.\n\nAll in all I feel that this title was still worth the $20.","April 27","true","1.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Also helped me improve my aim in other games with less-frequent shooting.\n\nThe survival modes tend to involve mowing down literally hundreds of zombies in a wave, which can get to feel like overkill at times, requiring constantly mashing the trigger, but there's some strategy involved in using explosives etc. I spent the most time trying to improve my scores in the various skill modes. Guns reload automatically rather than requiring any complex motions, but that's necessary due to the constant streams of zombies.\n\nOne major drawback: No dual wielding of any weapons. The only thing your second hand is useful for is throwing grenades and other objects, and most of the time you'd be better using both hands on one controller. They should really allow at least akimbo pistols, even if it was a bonus mode without a scoreboard. Hopefully they'll consider it in an update.","April 18","true","3.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Even though the "zombies" are just cardboard cutouts, it's so fun killing zombie after zombie.

It avoids being too scary (though it's intense when things start falling apart and the zombie cutouts make it within melee range) but is addictive.\n\nI keep coming back to this game. The huge numbers of targets you have to destroy each wave in survival mode can get ridiculous, but you can really get into the zone as a result, it almost becomes like meditation.\n\nI feel that some of the skill test sections are a little meh, though challenging yourself to improve your personal high score, and advancing in the global ladder makes it something I come back to for a little variery.\n\nI also sort of wish that there's a way to mirror the table layout, As a leftie, it actually works nicely for me to reach with my right hand for steak, grenade, or other explosives. My wife, however, has a harder time since she needs to reach over her shooting arm, or momentarily stop shooting to use her right hand to use an item.\n\nOverall a fun shooting gallery that I enjoyed more than I thought (personally find it having more variety than space pirate trainer, though I think you should get both if you have the money).","May 9","true","4.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Damn lies...\n\nIt isn’t the visuals that freak you out – it’s the sound.\n\nPacked with a multitude of modes for you to play around with, something for everyone, ZTS is an excellent early game for the Vive that is worth every penny of the asking price. A great deal of time and effort has obviously gone into polishing this game and it shows. The graphics are bright and colourful, without being confusing. The zombies actually feel like they are made out of cardboard, shooting chunks off them is satisfying and gives you a great sense of real damage.\n\nYou start with access to limited weapons, a pistol as I recall, and are rewarded with more and better guns as you kill more zombies. It’s a little frustrating that you can’t use all the guns right away but it does give the game a natural progression which might be missing otherwise.\n\nSome gallery shooters on the vive have weapons that feel like toys, and this makes those games feel very lightweight. ZTS’s guns feel great, the animations are believable without being overcomplicated and the use of the feedback in the controllers is good. You can almost feel the bullets smack into the zoms.\n\nThe use of explosives is also excellently handled. Grenades, petrol cans and lanterns can be used to wipe out large concentrations of zombies. Getting the Z’s to stand in one place is managed by clever use of handy meat chunks you can lob out into the range.\n\nOn top of all this the leader board system is excellent. Showing your rank amongst friends or worldwide.\n\nI love this game. Well done devs.\n","May 2","true","3.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Your standard mode is a wave survival style game, you pick a weapon at the start of a game and stick with it for as long as possible. You are always postitioned next to a table containing various supplies to help you fight off the undead hoards including steaks which can be thrown to distract the zombies who will gather around the hunk of meat until it is completely consumed, these are essential to survival as the sheer number of zombies on-screen would overwhelm you if not for this element of control. You also have grenades which explode after a set time when you throw them and shootable explosives like propane bottles and jerry cans which can make you feel like a complete badass if you shoot them in the air.\n\nThe graphics are simple but effective, the idea of the game is to simulate training yourself for the zombie apocalypse, so you aren't fighting real zombies, but instead some very stylised cardboard cutout zombies, these can only be killed with a headshot meaning that this game is more about precision and strategy than wildly firing at the hoards. The survival mode has multiple maps of various difficulties, zombies will have different paths and items on your table will vary from level to level.\n\nThe challenges are all about defeating a set number of zombies in the fastest time possible, Crow's foot is all about precision, eliminating four zombies from both sides in the fastest time possible, where as Zombie bowling has a huge hoard lined up like bowling pins, armed with one grenade and your gun of choice, you have to clear the whole lot in the quickest time you can.\n\nIf you feel yourself getting too well aquanted with the game and want to ramp things up a little, you can switch to night time mode, you gun will have a flashlight on it and this will be the only way you will be able to see, it really changes the gameplay and puts you even more on your toes as it's not as easy to know where the zombies will be coming from.\n\nWith a variety of weapons which can be gradually unlocked by killing a specified number of zombies which can be used across each gameplay type, each with their own leaderboards, there is a lot here to keep you coming back. You get a lot of value from the game and it's easily one of my favourite Vive experiences so far.","May 12","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thereddevil666/recommended/446620/","thereddevil666","FDR Logging","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thereddevil666/","459 products in account","======================================\n(First Impressions) - Zombie Training Simulator\n======================================\n\nVideo Impression - https://youtu.be/t9bEHwB4pLA\n\n\n**Gameplay/My Experience**\n\nThe game starts you off in an interactive menu/environment level, giving you access to a variety of guns on a table. Only 2 of the pistols on the table are unlocked. There appears to be other machine guns and shotgun type weapons as well but the rest have numbers on them which represents how many zombie kills before they unlock.\n\nLooking around you can see sign posts with a picture and title on each, these are gamemodes and skill challenges you can select by shooting said signpost.  Also in the background are random zombies wandering around that you can test shoot with your weapon while you decide what you want to do. Behind you next to the table is a post with a light switch marked "hardcore mode" shooting this switch makes the game go from daylight to nighttime making zombie shooting even more challenging and scary.\n\nI started off on the first mission, others were also unlocked with varying difficulty levels listed, I chose what appeared to be the easy mission.  Once it starts I can see a few grenades, 4 steaks and propane tanks on the table next to my gun selection. To start the mission I shoot a single zombie standing next to a "start game" once he is down the other zombies start converging on my location. I take a few terrible shots before I get the feel of my pistols aim, knocking off the odd leg or arm of a zombie approaching before i get a solid headshot. Now these zombies don't mess around they move at a pretty fast pace so you gotta keep on your toes.\n\nThe horde coming at me appears to be picking up numbers so I reach over and grab a steak, tossing it into the crowd. The zombies herd around the steak gnawing and chewing at it, long enough for me to grab a grenade and toss it over. A huge explosion and cloud of dust clears away revealing a  a huge portion of the crowd disintegrated. Unfortunately i'm not quite quick enough and another horde from behind me snarls forward. I pop off all the rounds in my clip killing a few but inevitably i am overrun and dead.\n\nI move onto another few gamemodes including a sort of skill testing quick draw match where you are placed in the middle of 4 zombies that surround you. After your first shot connects with a zombie they all start moving forward and you try to kill them as fast as you can. I found this to be the most fun as i spent almost a half hour replaying it to see if i could get a faster john wick style killing experience. After all my time in gun kata practice i ended with a happy score of 1.182 seconds, a truly rewarding experience.\n\nThere were several other modes at different locations including a survival mission at a quarry where an entire gravel pit was filled with zombies as you sit atop a hill. Think of the walking dead scene in the quarry scene quite similar. You really get your skills tested as you try to pick off all the zombies before they squeeze up a tight road to your location. Very heart pounding and very fun overall experience.\n\n==================================================\n\n** Graphics/Audio **\n\nAlthough the graphics are very simple and cartoon like, I find this game to have a very inviting look, its angry birds meets plants vs zombies in the style department. The zombies maybe made of wood but when combined with the undead snarls and gruls your mind convinces you that your about to be eaten by the 2D plank approaching you.\n\nThe audio overall is fantastic, everything is set to a well balanced volume from the shooting, breaking wooden zombies and tweeting happy birds in the environment. The SFX are all very high quality and nothing seems annoying or out of place. The positional audio is perfect and your able to tell exact positions for when a zombie is sneaking up behind you.\n\nThe weapons are all very well designed, lots of detail and loud snappy SFX. The sound of firing and the cracking wood of a dead zombie is truly satisfying.\n\nEnvironments are cheery and detailed with bright green grass and fields all leading back to an at home Angry Birds type feeling. Never have I killed zombies in such a pleasant calming environment before.\n\n==================================================\n\n**VR/Comfort**\n\nEverything feels very smooth in this game, all the text is readable, nothing is blotched out or visually unappealing. I found the gun aiming angles a little tricky to get used to but honestly once you overcome the angle of the controller your mind just fills in the blanks and your fine. The game features no artificial motion or any type of sick inducing effects making it a prime choice for those that don't do so well in certain vr games.\n\n==================================================\n\n**My Wishlist**\n\nOverall the game so far is incredible but as always I have my wishes. I would really like the ability to dual wield guns as i think it would give a very nice bad ♥♥♥ effect. Now perhaps the developer didn't allow this simply because it would make it too easy to just mass fire two guns and clean house removing the necessity of accuracy. Never the less i would love to see dual wielding implemented in the future.\n\nI would also like to see the ability to manually load your weapons, currently you have a reload button on the vive touchpad or an automatic reload that happens when your clip count hits zero. I think it would cool to add an option to have to grab a clip and physically load it into your weapon. Even if it was added as like a super crazy expert only feature i think it would open up a world of skill and competition possibilities.\n\n==================================================","April 29","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Many others reviewers have covered the various nuances  of the game so I thought I would provide a "Can I play it?" Informational.

That should have been enough space to meet the minum for a 'room' setup, however Vive claims it's not, so I ended up setting it up as as standing-only setup.  This game claims you need a 2m x 1.5m play area, but I figured I would give it a shot and if it didn't work I could refund the game.\n\nTurns out 'standing only' works just fine!  The table was right next to me and I was able to reach everything with no issues.

Your standard mode is a wave survival style game, you pick a weapon at the start of a game and stick with it for as long as possible. You are always postitioned next to a table containing various supplies to help you fight off the undead hoards including steaks which can be thrown to distract the zombies who will gather around the hunk of meat until it is completely consumed, these are essential to survival as the sheer number of zombies on-screen would overwhelm you if not for this element of control. You also have grenades which explode after a set time when you throw them and shootable explosives like propane bottles and jerry cans which can make you feel like a complete badass if you shoot them in the air.\n\nThe graphics are simple but effective, the idea of the game is to simulate training yourself for the zombie apocalypse, so you aren't fighting real zombies, but instead some very stylised cardboard cutout zombies, these can only be killed with a headshot meaning that this game is more about precision and strategy than wildly firing at the hoards. The survival mode has multiple maps of various difficulties, zombies will have different paths and items on your table will vary from level to level.\n\nThe challenges are all about defeating a set number of zombies in the fastest time possible, Crow's foot is all about precision, eliminating four zombies from both sides in the fastest time possible, where as Zombie bowling has a huge hoard lined up like bowling pins, armed with one grenade and your gun of choice, you have to clear the whole lot in the quickest time you can.\n\nIf you feel yourself getting too well aquanted with the game and want to ramp things up a little, you can switch to night time mode, you gun will have a flashlight on it and this will be the only way you will be able to see, it really changes the gameplay and puts you even more on your toes as it's not as easy to know where the zombies will be coming from.\n\nWith a variety of weapons which can be gradually unlocked by killing a specified number of zombies which can be used across each gameplay type, each with their own leaderboards, there is a lot here to keep you coming back. You get a lot of value from the game and it's easily one of my favourite Vive experiences so far.","May 12","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I like the cutout, cartoon style graphics.  The developers nailed the Vive controller to pistol handling simulation.  The developers did the in game feeling of holding a real weapon when you are really holding a Vive controller.  My favorite in game weapon is the Glock as it is the lightest weapon in the game's arsenal and closest to the controller size and weight.  The grip angle is right and the you can sight down the weapon as in real life and you can even do position Sul or other ready positions.  There are no reload mechanics as reloading is automatic.\n\nThe game also has a high replay value as the game consist of quick challenges that last from  a little over a second each to  survival modes that may last 5 to 10 minutes each.","May 30","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's easily one of the most fully realized, with unlockable weapons, levels, and game modes.

Sure it's cartoony and looks cheesey but the game play by far is the most robust action packed shooting game on the vive in my opinion. There are so many features and the devs are pretty active in keeping this updated. The only thing I would like to see is more levels and maybe gun customizations like laser sites and a rocket launcher. Also maybe the ability to switch guns during gameplay. But even without those things, this game is really awesome.","June 6","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've gotta say, it's not just "another zombie game", it feels like a lot of thought was put into this one.\n\nSurvival mode is pretty intense, especially in some of the harder levels. It's all about managing your resources (distractions & explosives). You have to set some stuff up beforehand and then figure out just the right times to use the rest.\n\nAnd even though survival is fun, I actually prefer the skills levels. Each one has a very specific predetermined layout, and is essentially a time trial. They feel like puzzles where you have to come up with a plan to kill all the zombies as fast as possible.\n\nDefinitely one of the most fun and replayable Vive games I've played yet.","April 17","true","3.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is still a good game but I warn you that you will probably start getting bored by the 3-4 hour mark if there isn't more updates.\n\nAs such I only just recommend the game. It is still good but it gets so repetitive pretty quick and loses the magic. Pretty pricey for the amount of playtime, however it is so easy to pick up and play that it can be good for demoing to people.\n\n\n______________Previous review:__________________\n\nDon't be fooled by the cartoony style - this game is intense.\n\nI would definitely recommend getting this game, it's a charming wave shooter that isn't just barebones.\n\nThe main meat of the game is in the survival modes, and facing giant hordes while managing distractions and explosives is really cool. You can get hundreds to thousands of kills in a good survival session and it really gives the feel of mowing down a horde. What makes this game different to a barebones wave shooter like space pirate trainer is the progression system, the gamemodes, and the different maps.\n\nUnlocking new guns sets a good goal and pushes you to play just a little bit more to try out the next gun, and I'm always  looking forward to the next unlock. Night time mode is also great, and it kind of gives the same feeling I get in the Brookhaven experiment demo - although this has a lot more to do right now and runs a lot better.\n\nShooting feels really good in this game, and my bullets are always going where I feel like they should go. Some other games don't have the gunplay feeling as right, but it feels really good here and you can really hone your accuracy.\n\nThe zombies looking like cutouts is a really good thing for the game - landing shots has a lot of visual feedback, and the simple look of the zombies means you can have hordes of hundreds on screen at once.\n\nIn terms of performance, it is really good as a result of the cartoon style, which also looks great. The game runs really well. I am getting 90fps and running the game butter smooth even on my old 7950, which is below the minimum spec. Giant hordes and explosions don't seem to make a difference.\n\nWhile the game is already great, it would be awesome if the devs added more maps, and more guns. I would love some akimbo/duel wield gun unlocks too as most of the game you are just doing nothing with your non-shooting hand save for the occasional grenade/meat throw. However, the game is still awesome and very easy to get into for showing your friends, and I'd say quite worth the price for the amount of time you can get out of it.","April 19","true","4.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I find that my aim is more accurate without looking down the sights than in a lot of other Vive games.  I'm not sure if they're doing something differently with this one to make it feel more natural, but I love the feel of shooting in it.\n\nIt's got quite a bit of variety too.  A skill mode to see how fast you can kill the zombies, survival mode, and a bunch of different levels.\n\nI actually like the 2d zombie cutouts too, as it gives the opportunity for some guns to penetrate through a handful of zombies at once, and others only kill one at a time.","April 16","true","0.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
