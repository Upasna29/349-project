It's powerful when applied correctly, so often being impossible to emulate in real life. You can't run like Sonic, your car doesn't go as fast as Captain Falcon's - and I'd be very surprised if you can move like the hero of 10 Second Ninja.He's a double jumping, sword slashing, shuriken throwing robot destruction machine. Madly dashing through short platforming puzzles, his ultimate goal is always the same: destroy the nazi robots as fast as possible. Half the game is sequencing and strategy, determining the most efficient uses of those precious second jumps and limited throwing stars.At first a level will seem straight forward - a combination of runs and leaps that take out everything in what you'll assume is a respectable time.Things can be confusing at first, for different reasons - but then you notice the time savers. The opportunities to take out two enemies with one move, skip jumps or maintain momentum. In later levels the addition of complications like falling rocks and portals change the equation. The slow consideration to start a level is a nice counter-point to the split-split-second reaction times needed to perform the plans you come up with.That's the other half. Thumb-mutilating skills coupled with reset after reset to shave milliseconds off times in pursuit of those required to unlock levels or climb the bragging rights only online leaderboard. The game controls wonderfully and the simplistic art uses precise frame stages to broadcast changes in status, vital for instant understanding. While it won't be for everyone, Ninja does exactly what it set out to, with style and humour to boot.","January 22, 2015","true","112.1"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","23","23","2","0"

Just some keywords to describe 10 Second Ninja. You have 10 seconds to clear a level by defeating all of the enemies. You start with some simple platforms, but a few levels later the game will introduce something new. Falling pillars and portals to name a few. It requires speed, skill and a clear head. I think I would describe the game as a puzzle platformer, even if it's more action focused than you would think. There are 5 worlds to complete, and each world has about 8 levels I think. But I think it took me less than an hour to complete all 5 worlds (ok, ok, I didn't clear every level with 3 stars) so it's pretty damn short. But man, is it good. Normally I'd say that if you enjoy a game the price doesn't really matter. But it's hard to justify the price for this game just because it's so freaking short.\nSo, let it be for now and grab it when it's on sale, or at least costs €5 or less.\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","March 22, 2014","true","1.3"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","29","35","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heartview/recommended/271670/","heartview","Heartview","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heartview/","206 products in account","I have a few things to say about the game so I'll do a Pros vs Cons list first.\n\nPros\nFast paced\nPretty tight controls\nEasy to pick up, difficult to master\nCHALLENGING\nSimple (read effective) graphics\nGood sound design\n\nCons\nShort\nA bit pricey (related directly to above con)\nMaybe lacking a few features\n\nNow I consider myself to be a veteran when it comes to platforming games like this. I have completed n, Meat Boy, Super Meat Boy, I wanna Be The Guy/Boshy all in their entirety, as well as a slew of other action platformer games. And I easily consider 10 Second Ninja to be up there as one of my favorites. It's a game with a realtively simple concept: Kill all robots on the map using either a close range sword or long range shuriken projectiles, all without dieing in as little time as possible. Easy enough to understand, but the level the game is played at makes it a deceptively difficult. The timing for a lot of the levels requires near perfect jumps and accuracy to get 3 star ratings on, and posting higher leaderboard scores requires near pixel perfect accuracy and timing. There is a real challenge here hidden behind the easy to understand controls and mechanics. If you enjoy a good challenge in your platformers, don't skip this game. While not masochistic by any means, any self-respecting action platformer fan needs this game under their belt.\n\nNow the controls for this game are also pretty good, with great response time. My only gripe with some of the controls comes from slight issues like corner bumping. Landing too far off the edge on the corner will not let you stand on the ledge, however a second mid-air jump can still be performed after falling off even if both jumps were used prior to landing, meaning the game registers that you have hit the ground already. In a game where pixel perfect accuracy comes into play, this might get a tad annoying on some levels, though it is a bit difficult to notice. It can also be difficult to gauge throwing shurikens along the ground as the hitbox for it is a bit strange. This is really a non issue, but sometimes a shuriken will hit the wall at a corner, and other times it will slide across the ground as you wanted it to. I say it is a non issue because honestly, it comes down to how precise you are when throwing it in the first place, so it becomes more of an issue of when you throw it rather than the game registering the hitbox badly. So in reality, its just a small visual gripe rather than an actual game issue. Otherwise, the controls are incredibly responsive and tight. A real pleasure to play as the game feels like its actually listening to what you tell it to do.\n\nThe sound design, while not much to note, is effective and aestheticly pleasing. No over the top speaker destroying sound bytes, just simple, effective sound design. Love it.\n\nNow I listed 3 cons, however this boils down to really just one, and perhaps more of a reccomendation for future development. My only real con with this game is the current $10 price tag, for a pretty short game that can be completed in one sitting. No end game content, no unlockables, which means the only thing keeping you playing the game after beating the final level is getting better personal times, and ranking up on leaderboards. And with the few levels provided, should be quite a bit of replayability, though I would still say the game lacks girth. However, this issue would be remedied entirely by a user level repository, and obviously the ability to make your own levels. Now do I think the price tag is too steep? Not at all. I have payed more for less before, and given how awesome this game is, it is well worth it. More of a passing thought rather than a real issue to be fair.\n\nAs for any lacking features, it really boils down to adding in a level builder for users (Steam workshop integration would be awesome, a la Battleblock Theatre) and possibly adding in individual level leaderboards, though I could see how that would just be more confusing given that times come down to differences in 100th of a second resulting in long lists of the exact same time on down the leaderboard.\n\nSo in conclusion to my lengthy review of a rather short and simple game, I would absolutely reccomend the game to anyone, completley ignoring any small cons I might have found. Action platformer fans, if you don't already have it, get it. The games length and price is no excuse to not take part in the robo-nazi slaughterfest by the hands of a twitchy ninja. You are the only hope little man, save us from those Evil mecha-nazis.

It might sound like a gimmick, but levels are designed in such a way as to be almost puzzle like in execution, requiring not only brute reflexes but also an understanding of how to best make use of your limited repertoire to shave off every tenth of a second you can manage.\n\nNaturally, this causes the game to move at a ridiculous pace, but unlike a lot of hyper challenging platformers 10 Second Ninja avoided ever becoming overwhelming. Its basic mechanics give you just enough leeway to experiment within levels so as to keep them from feeling too linear or restricting their design, while being entirely understandable and intuitive to execute, and the necessarily small size of each level keeps the experience easily digestible but not to the detriment of a satisfying challenge. 10 Second Ninja isn't an easy game, but it always feels surmountable, if only you could find the perfect strategy or go a little faster.\n\nAnd then an hour later you're through, perhaps having missed a few perfect level ratings but for the most part seeing what the game has to offer. And surprisingly I was entirely OK with that. 10 Second Ninja for as short as it is makes every moment engaging, each level offering its own twist on mechanics that never change because they don't need to, and finding time for some humorous dialogue in between smashing up Robot Hitler's disembodied head. There's just something inherently entertaining here, and it all comes together into a tightly condensed package that understands it doesn't need to be hundreds of hours long. It just needs to be fun.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 8, 2015","true","0.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leonresevil2/recommended/271670/","leonresevil2","LeonRes [OC]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leonresevil2/","582 products in account","May 20, 2015\nIf you aren't a speedrunner, I wouldn't consider 10 Second Ninja. I decided to buckle down and really work at the game after a frustrating introduction, and quickly completed it with some effort. The full content is around 4 minutes long, with later levels only adding portals and enemies that take two hits to kill. The only appeal of the game is finding routes to optimize times, but other games do so much more in the genre.\n\nThe game is built on Game Maker, I only knew this after the 2nd cutscene gave up a Game Maker error report and crashed the game when an image couldn't be found. The program seems to take process priority along with nearly 500MB of RAM, slowing the Desktop and all other activities if you want to Alt-Tab. FPS is good, and I assume the high priority is to make sure the clock is accurate.\n\nControls are simple but inconsistent, not really fitting for a precision platformer. The sword hitbox can be gigantic at times, even allowing some kills through walls. Normal ground behaves more like Ice, while Ice really didn't give me much issue. Sometimes the ninja would run with no buttons pressed after restarting, while other times it would ignore my inputs (mostly in the Hard mode 100% run, wasting precious time). The 10-second max means most levels are very limited, with only 4 of the 40 levels spanning beyond the screen. I'm kinda shocked a ninja in a platforming game can't wall-jump, while a famous cube of meat puts this ninja to shame.\n\nThe game requires Stars to progress in the game, so expect to repeat and perfect levels from the start. Beginners will get trapped in the first world until they can improve times for Stars. At least the community seems friendly, with some helpful strategy videos to complete the game. I don't know if the developer cleans time records, but there's a cheater with a 100% time under 5 seconds that needs wiped. At least the music in the Bonus area was really good.\n\nOverall, the game is too one-dimensional. Super Meat Boy, Stealth Bast Deluxe, and other platformers allow speedrunning without limiting level design and cutting mechanics. 40 short levels, no variety in traps or enemies, and no included level editor means content is slim. It's bundle fodder, which is where I got it, and the store price is insane. There's nothing really unique here. If you're a speedrunner that has exhausted every other game, you could still find other games with more content. The cutscenes may be longer than the gameplay, but they try too hard to be memetic and get tweets. A hashtag in a cutscene, yuck. Considering all the levels can be reasonably completed in 240 seconds, you must see the cost-per-hour here is awful. It had potential, but the title restricted the gameplay far too much.","January 8, 2015","false","5.7"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","3"

In this fast-paced platformer, your aim is to clear every single level in less than ten seconds - that is, kill every robot on the screen, using your weaponry and triggering environmental hazards. Aim for the lowest possible time to earn a three-star rating!\n\nThe concept is really nice, and the par times are very tightly balanced. Finding the optimal route for each level will require meticulous planning, and the execution leaves no room for error. It is incredibly satisfying when you nail your inputs perfectly and maximize a route's potential, and deeply unnerving when even then, you're still half a second too slow; reconsider what seems obvious, think outside the box and, most of all, keep optimizing your inputs. The original core concept, the precise controls and meticulously balanced level design are the game's main strenghts.\n\nNow for the cons. The visuals and cutscenes are entirely forgettable, which can be excused in a low-budget indie game such as this. The soundtrack, albeit repetitive, serves its purpose but isn't particularly memorable either. My main criticism would be that the game is really short, and perhaps not quite as "hardcore" as it may appear at first. I was a little disappointed to hit the ending credits after only a few hours (plus maybe an extra half hour on the bonus world), with all the three-star ratings earned and without hitting any major roadblocks.\n\nI would have loved more content, and I felt that certain ideas in the level design could have been further developped (portals, falling/crumbling blocks, etc). As it is, I can't say that the game has exploited its potential to the fullest; nevertheless, it remains a solid puzzle platformer and one of the most execution-intensive games I have played in a while, with relatively fair content for its price.

The controls are extremely fluent, and the game takes about 10 seconds to pick up and play, and perhaps 10 minutes to get the hang of it. It combines puzzle with speedrunning in the most fundamental kind of way. The fact that each level is about 5 seconds long and restarting is instant means it's not frustrating or off-putting. This is perhaps its greatest strength - that by having extremely short levels, the execution becomes much more important. Timing jumps and movement perfectly to shave off milliseconds is something you'll be doing a lot right from the beggining - and this is, in essense, what speedrunning is all about. Games with longer levels and deeper mechanics are so complex that most players never really reach the point of searching for an extra few milliseconds to hit the target time because most players don't have the time to practice perfecting their run of a level longer than a minute - and thus, they lose out on the excitement of time trials. This game is extremely accessible and fun to play, and clearly demonstrates the appeal of speedrunning to any non-gamer. Would highly recommend for perfectionists. Also, the ahcievements are awesome.","October 8, 2014","true","16.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

At first glance (as well as when you play it) the concept seems more geared to be a mobile game than a PC game. However, the pacing is more fitting of a PC/console game. Completing each level in 10 seconds or less is not hard at all, even if you aren't used to fast paced games. With practice, avoiding spikes and falling objects becomes easy. The real challenge is getting 3 stars on every level, which can take some time.\n\nIf you are considering buying it, ask yourself this: "Am I going to try to 100% it?" If the answer is no, you aren't going to get much out of the game. Playing through each level only once won't take much time, and is especially not worth $9.99 in that regard. If you are a completionist (or are for just this game), definitely pick up the game, but still at a discounted price. I only heard about it and bought it because I crafted a 90% off coupon for it (s***, it was 99 cents!). At that price, it was definitely worth it.\n\nOf course, getting 3 stars on every level is often brutally difficult, and at times frustrating. You will have to time your jumps and attacks perfectly , which will take loads of trial and error (and error and error and error). This is a turn-off for a lot of people, but a selling point for others. It is entirely dependent on whether you enjoy fast-paced games or not. Completing each level with 3 stars left me saying "Damn, I can't believe I just did that, let's do the bonus levels!" and not "Wow, I just wasted 5.8 hours on that?".\n\nIn the end, the question I ask myself is "Did I have fun?". Yes. A lot of it. There were some levels that were just frustrating (I'm looking at you Deathcube Level 1), but most of them were a blast to complete. Definitely pick it up when it is discounted if you enjoy fast-paced games or are looking for something new to try.","November 20, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Good move speed and jump height, sword attack has nice range, shruikens are decently fast, double jump really helps out, and each area has a few gimmicks of its own to keep things fresh.\n\nThe main problem is that, well, the game is super short. Let's put it in perspective; "hard mode" has  you play through the entire game in under four minutes. So yeah... not a massive amount of content in all, especially for $10. And that's, really, the sticking point for me. I quite enjoyed my time with this game, it was a ton of fun. This kind of thing is right up my alley. But for the asking price, combined with the presentation equivalent to a flash game, I would *not* recommend this game at its full price. Half off, maybe. 66% off is what I got it for and even that feels a bit too high for me, but considering that I did enjoy most every moment I spent with the game I suppose I can't complain too much. It's designed well, the 3 star times are fairly realistic when you figure out the expected route, and the fact that everything is so quick helps too since you're never losing more than a few seconds of progress with every failure (or a few minutes in hard mode, but that's usually more than one failure to fail the target time...)\n\nSo yeah, if you want a good fast-paced platformer with an emphasis on speedrunning, and you don't care about the price, pick it up for sure. If money is a factor, wait for a sale. I do enjoy this game a lot, so it's a bit disappointing that it's as short as it is, really.","January 3, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Go over that limit and fail. Go at it at a certain speed and you could find yourself with three stars. Getting three stars is somewhat ridiculous, but a very fun challenge. This alone makes the game really addictive, with the gameplay backing that up even further.

To start off with, the game is VERY challenging but fun and rewarding if you succeed. This is not your average game that getting 3 stars is an easy walk in the park until later levels. NO this game hits you with toughness level 1. Every level must be compeleted under 10 seconds. Not to mention, the boss level requires you to have a certain amount of stars to be able to do it... and you cant do it with only 1 star per level. That means a lot of rage and a lot or restarts in under 5 seconds. The requirements for even just 2 stars is VERY challenging and you will have to start getting used to the game and develop a strategy to just get 2 stars. Actually getting 1 star is sometimes even hard. Now imagine 3 stars... When they say "You must be perfect, you must be fast" they 100% mean it.

The art is a bit basic even by indie game standards but the music is great and its funny enough that it got a chuckle or two out of me, which is next to impossible because I am an old, cranky man.\n\n6. Gameplay is just fine. Controls are simple and responsive. You basically just have to beat short platforming levels really, really fast, and that is pretty fun.\n\n7. You will accidentally hit the restart level button nearly as often as you actually die. It turns out this is just fine.\n\n8. Remapping controls just prove it's actually hard to manage three buttons plus a d-pad plus the restart button at the speed this game demands.\n\n9. This is a sincerely hard game. It strikes me though that almost all of the levels would be rather easy were it not for the strict time limits opposed.\n\n10. Number 9 is both cool and frustrating.

It's more of an initiation to speedrunning than a game tailored for experienced speedrunners, but it's probably enjoyable to both sides!\n\nEach level has a 10 second limit, taking some of Super Meat Boy's standards to the extreme, with quick restarts and keeping the player in the action at all times.\n\nI've 100% the game a bit after 4 hours, which includes beating the game in 4 minutes.\n\nThe level themselves are pretty easy to beat, but getting the 3 stars (for time) can be infuriating! In a good way, though. Missing the mark for 0.02 seconds is tough, but finally getting the 3 stars is really rewarding as well!\n\nThe boss fights were rather uninspired, but it's easy to overlook that.\n\nThere are several worlds, each introducing a small mechanic and making use of it.\n\n\nIt might be a bit price-y for its content, but the game itself is pretty good! The short length fits nicely, and it's a nice game to start up once in a while to make a quick <5 minutes speedrun.

You will be hopping around slashing at Nazi robots and a big robot Hitler, while laughing at the weird cutscenes.\n\nControls: They are pretty simplistic. Arrow Keys to move around and you can slash with you sword/throw ninja stars with X and Z. The game is really responsive to the control input, which is great. I played a bit on the steam controller and its just as good. I used the analog stick instead of arrow keys, with X and B as the sword and ninja stars, and the A as jump.\n\nGraphics: It's not too great, but that isn't the purpose. The purpose is suppose to similar to the internet flash games. Simplistic and easy on the computer.\n\nMusic: Not really that prominent. It's not really that bad but it's not really that good either.\n\nOverall: 10 Seconds Ninja is a great game, and I would recommend the game to anybody, but I don't think that it is worth the full price and wouldn't be a bad buy on a sale.

My major grief with this game is that it seems to run different depending on hardware (having tried on three different rigs, unpredictable on older hardware, running good (but slow) for a few minutes then running bad (garbage collection perhaps?) for a few minutes).

So, I have to take points off for that. Other than that, I don't have a whole lot to gripe about. The game does what they want it to do, and it's pretty fun if you're good at this sort of thing. Unfortunately, I'm not that great at...this...sort of thing.\n\nRevisiting...\n\nI decided to revisit this after taking a break from it for, uh, forever. If you can't tell, I got a little bit frustrated with trying to play to a ridiculous standard of speed. I don't know what I expected, given the fact that the title does mention 10 seconds, which is exactly how much time you have to do anything before you just fail miserably. However, I can't fathom why this has such high markings from other people.\n\nIt works!\n\nYes, it does work. Immediately, this puts it in a class of its own amongst other similarly-rated Steam games that flat out don't work at all. If the difficulty setting weren't on, "Screw you and your ability to enjoy yourself!" I might have played it more. It accomplishes making you think quickly to get all the kills you need, but falls short of being entirely fun due to this.\n\nGraphics and music blahblahblah blah\n\nBoth are good and they do what they accomplish. The pseudo-oriental theme music and robot nazi ideas are cute, but it wears thin after about 30 seconds, which is exactly how long it will take you to play through 5 levels of the game. Seriously, once you get through 3 you run out of things to expect from it - so you really only need about a half hour of playtime to get everything out of it that you need.\n\nA hesitant recommendation\n\nLook, the game says what it is, and it works well at doing it. The graphics are cute, there's robot zombies, there's ninjas, you can figure it out. This isn't exactly a game that many people will put hours upon hours upon hours of gameplay into unless they have some sort of spectrum disorder. I will, however, give it a 7/10 for doing EXACTLY what it wants to do, and doing it as hard as it possibly can until any respective player wants to cap themselves in the eyeball.","January 4","true","1.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

You might swear as you restart but it's never truly enraging.\n\nIt's much like Mighty Switch Force in that it's bite-sized speedrunning requiring very precise actions to finish (though shorter and more precise and action packed than MSF).\n\nA short game, but one that will take a bit longer to 3 star all levels, and it's a heck of a lot of fun; great deal of excitement-per-second. Leaderboards are a natural "endgame" for those inclined.","March 1, 2014","true","6.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I suggest a gamepad for this as  it feels so much better.\n\nThe game is very short though. I have all but about 20 stars left to get and I have played right at 2 hours.

Very easy to pick up and yet this game is extremely challenging if you are attempting to gain three stars on every level.\n\nThe game is divided up into worlds, each with several standard levels that lead up to a 'world boss' fight which must be unlocked by achieving enough stars on the previous levels. Every level, including boss fights, must be completed in under ten seconds, hence the name.\n\nThis isn't normally too taxing - the difficulty comes when attempting to either gain stars or to achieve a better time in order to get into the top 50 leaderboards.\n\nThe comedy in the cutscenes is fantastic - the premise being that 'Robot Hitler' and a legion of baddies are planning world domination and one little ninja is all that stands in his way.\n\nEasy to pick up and put down. An extremely fun distraction. Great as a tool for reaction speed training, too.\n\nHighly recommended.","October 8, 2014","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I recorded myself doing this once and it was fun to watch the frustration built up until that final moment when you get it just right.\n\nThe levels are well thought out and you are essentially competing with yourself for the best possible scores.\nThere are also ridiculous bosses that add a bit of flavor as well.\n\nAll in all, an amazing title with great music, gameplay and overall feel to the game.\n\nMust play for fans of challenging platformers","February 2","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Ultimately I chose "no" simply due to the bugginess of the game. I got this as part of a bundle, so I can't complain about it too much, as I don't believe the asking price is even reasonable. The gameplay is fun and the story is somewhat amusing. I would say that if you are really into speedrunning then you may enjoy this more than the average gamer. However, the game lags severly at seemingly random times (NOTE: I am playing on a brand new computer that plays modern 3D games, so I know it's a problem with the game and not my PC). This throws off your timing after you have planned a good route and the game stalls halfway through your run. I also experienced crashing in some of the cut-scenes due to some programming issues. If you look in the game forums - I'm not the only one experiencing these issues.\n\nSummary: Fun game, when it works. The random lag makes it often unplayable.

The game doesn't recognise controllers on many PCs. The devs are aware of this and are working on a fix, but to release a game based on twitch reflexes like this and have the controller support that bugged is a complete mistake on their part.\n\n2. The game eats memory like I eat Chinese food at a buffet. Why is a game that looks like a Flash game from 2005 using 400MB of RAM? Why does it stutter and lag on my computer? My computer can run Super Meatboy just fine, but this game has to be dropped to the lowest resolution in windowed mode to run smoothly. On better computers, this is probably not an issue, but a game like this should be able to run well on a computer from 4 years ago - heck, it should be able to run well on a computer from 10 years ago.\n\n3. This game is not worth 7.99€. The amount of levels is staggeringly low. I've played the game for 2 hours and am almost at 100% on all the levels except the locked bonus stage. Either the devs thought people would struggle more to get through stages that it would take longer, or they honestly thought the game has enough content to justify 7.99€. It does not.\n\nI get that the devs are independant, probably don't have a lot of money, and are trying to make some money to work on bigger projects, I totally understand and respect that, but as a consumer, 7.99€ is not a price I would pay for a game this short with so many problems. The devs say they're trying to fix things, and if the issues go away I will gladly change the review to positive (even despite the shortness), but until then, I'd have to advise people to not buy this game.","March 22, 2014","false","2.9"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

Something that shouldn't really be done for games made in Game Maker Studio unless you compensate it by adjusting the times needed for earning stars.  The physics engine that GM;S uses isn't the greatest, which explains why the ninja keeps losing speed as he lands as well as deadstopping in the air sometimes.

A few youtube videos showed gameplay that looked kind of fun, but the actual game itself is kind of buggy and poorly designed. I heard someone compare it to Super Meatboy, and I can only assume they meant the newgrounds flash version rather than the much more polished game available on Steam.\n\nAlso, a few times, it felt like my route was sufficient to get three stars, and it eventually did, but it fell short of a tenth of a second the first time. It's a very tight game with somewhat unforgiving controls. For example, I swear I should be able to jump at point A but no, I need to wait a twentieth of a second before jumping.\n\nIn short, it tries to be a Super Meatboy-esque game, but Super Meatboy was very polished, while as this feels more like something some guy just made in Game Maker. It COULD be a Super Meatboy level game, conceptually, but it just lacks that same level of polish.","June 2, 2014","false","0.9"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

Not 10 seconds short but not far off.\n\nBasic premise is, you are a ninja trying to take down robot hitler. He sends his army of robots (who really want guns but can't have them), which consist of generic robot #1 and slightly less easy to generic robot #2. The latter needing two strikes from your trusty sword or shuriken ninja death star to kill, opposed to the one-hit kill of the first variation.\nThat's about as complicated as it gets both story wise and mechanically.\n\nYou get a 10 second time limit on each level (hence 10 second ninja... The geniousity in that... Wait is geniousity a word? The red line of incorrectness didn't show. reboia... Oh guess it doesn't show for the steam client. Oh well, probably is a word). So, you get 10 seconds on each level, fail to do it and you lose because you have some kind of posion in your body that kills you after 10 seconds?? Not sure, but if you do do it you complete the level and are rewarded with 1, 2 or 3 stars dependent on how fast you clear it. Getting 3 stars on most levels require very quick reflexes and a lot of skill... and a few thousand retries.\n\nThis is the main crux of the gameplay and how, an otherwise 4/5 minute game, can stretch to several hours. It's fairly easy to complete every level within the time limit but trying to shave 0.02 seconds off your best time to get that third star is damn right painful and frustrating. Nearly as painful and frustrating as trying to read that last paragraph...\n\nThe overall game feels a little copy/paste in its execution and overall style, as most levels consist of the same kinda things but due to the short campaign length this isn't a huge problem. The inclusion of further obstacles such as spikes, portals, deathly iceberg-like icicles further help to make things not as monotonous.\n\nOne bad thing however is that it does seem to struggle with performance issues, I didn't notice this until about an hour into playing it my entire game just froze and lagged at about 2fps (Insert game console joke here). It wasn't until after I changed the resolution to the lowest and then changed it back, did it get back to normal. There has been a lot of issues with performance posted in the forums as well, not had any major problems with this though.\n\nThe price, for what you get, is a little steep in my opinion but I got it in a bundle so I can't complain.

An experienced gamer can get to the end credits in an hour and get every star in 4 hours. There's a marathon mode after that but only the most dedicated players will want to tackle it.\n- It felt like an odd and distracting choice to decorate such a simple, gameplay driven game with swastikas and Nazis.\n- While I would pay $10 if I had to, the game is probably only worth around $5 to the average player.","October 14, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like games where you try to find out the most elaborate, and sometimes fancy, way to complete the stage, this is your game! I found the controls to be great with a controller, and just the sheer effort you put into trying to get that 3rd star is very rewarding.\n\nAlthough I do have to say, it was pretty short if you just blitz through the game without worrying about score. Here's my short pros/cons:\n\nPros:\n-Fast paced gameplay\n-Puzzle solving involving "thinking out of the box"\n-Controls are great and pretty damn responsive\n-Dialogue, though short, is very humorous.\n-Swords and shurikens, mmm.\n-Replayability to get the fastest times\n-Leaderboards\n-Somewhat charming art\n\nCons:\n-Somewhat short if you just blitz through the game.\n-Interface, although simple, feels a little too simple, but not a big problem. It does the job.\n-Boss fights are pretty much the same, you usually beat them in one go anyways. Would have been nice to add a little more variation to the fights.\n-Where's the WEAPONS?

Defeat all of Robot Hitler's Nazi robot minions on the stage in ten seconds. This reminds me of Super Meat boy. The controls are tight and the action is hectic. Graphics are passable and the music is pretty good. If you are one to try stages over and over again to get the best rating, then you'll like this game a lot. On the downside, I found myself wishing there were replays so I might sit back and watch the ninja clear out the stage. There's also some plot, and from what I saw, it seems pretty funny.

If blowing up masses of nazi robots in 10 seconds of ninja action sounds like a good way to blow the afternoon, this game is for you. Not for the clinically serious gamer. Let's take a look\n\nThe graphics are pixelated, but look well enough. You'll find most of the enemies look the same, but the graphics are not the main point. The music is fine enough, but you'll be heading to the options to turn it off after half an hour or so, as the track can get repetitive.\n\nThe gameplay is the real action here. Your task is to destroy all the ninja nazis in your vicinity within ten seconds. This can become quite easy, but when you realize that for all three stars you need to do that in what is about one-third of this time, strategies begin to develop. It can be quite fun to find new ways to go around a level faster to defeat all of those pesky nazi robots. However, some levels begin to boil down to simple quick reactions, which can easily become frustrating after retrying a level ten times because you're one-tenth of a second short each time. However, the sense of accomplishment after finally winning is great.\n\nThere is no story other than the fact that you are a ninja and there are evil nazi robots and you must kill them.\n\nSo would I recommend it? If you haven't seen the big blue thumbs-up, then I would say yes. The gameplay is fun, as you feel great after defeating five nazi robots in three seconds. The music is no problem, and neither are the graphics. If you're looking for a quick, humerous, reaction-based puzzle game, then this is for you.","November 25, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The most I would be willing to pay is $4.99, and that's only if I really liked speed run games, which I don't, so the most I'd personally be willing to pay is $1.99. Thankfully, I got it in a good bundle.\n\nThe concept if fun and interesting, but it doesn't give any reason for the 10 second time limit that I saw, but since I don't really care for speed run games, I quit trying shortly after the first boss. I did kill some time betting some non-completion or score based achievements while waiting for cards to drop.\n\nThe artwork and audio is decent and fits the game fairly well. Some of the graphical mechanics were odd, but didn't effect gameplay at all... do ninjas really bounce excessively when they die?\n\nThe levels have some real challenge to them if to care about the stars. Although, you do need to get 2 stars on each level of a world before you can move on to the boss fight, so casual play will keep you from progressing.\n\nIf you are using a controller and aiming for best time with 3 stars, you should definitely enable clutch mode, which remaps the restart function from RB to BACK. After restarting 100 times, sick of being 0.08 second away from 3 stars, you will probably already have your finger on the restart button and accidentally restart early... repeatedly. Additionally, if you are using a keyboard, stop. Use a responsive controller that you are comfortable with.\n\nOverall, if you like speed running, get it. If you don't like speed running, only get it if it's dirt cheap: 80% off or better.","November 3, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are fairly small, encompassing no more than a screen or two in the first three areas I was able to get to in my runthrough, but the level of exact movement and style required, combined with the excelent design of the levels themselves, kept me interested.  With only ten seconds per level to hit all the enemies on the screen, the game keep you immersed in the strategy, trying to find ways to hit targets while not running all over the level.  Ill honestly say it puts in perspective the level of skill that I totally don’t have anymore, as I struggle to repeat the same actions over and over with little success.  My only gripe about this game is the price -- at ten dollars, I feel like the game doesnt quite offer enough to be worth the investment.  That being said, I know it does go on sale often, so keep an eye out for a sale, and snatch it up for a nice little side project.\n\nGame’s Fate: Kept. A quick little time waster that's worth keeping around.\nBuy/No Buy: Honestly?  I like this game, but I dont necessarily feel like its worth ten bucks.  Add it to your wish list and pick it up when it goes on sale.\n","January 30","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This requires discovering the ideal/shortest path through many, many deaths.  While each level has a 10 second limit, you'll quickly learn that you'll need to complete a level in just a few seconds if you want to receive full marks (3 star rating).  Before you can move on to the next world (of a set of levels), you must earn so many stars in the current world.  Thus, while you can complete a level and move on with a single star, earning a single star on multiple levels of that world will not be enough to move you on to the next world; so you replay the levels you did poory at and replay them, and replay them, until you can get ~ a 2 star or more average on all that world's levels.\n\nThe game in itself seems to be pretty well done -- the minimal graphics, style, and humor all work together nicely, and I love the leaderboard to see where you stack up against your friends and the world; both per level rankings and per world.  That did motivate me to press on just a little bit more and shave a few more hundredths of a second off my time.  :-)\n\nThe only minor downside I have with this game is the high level of difficulty required in order to progress to the next world.  I want to play to have fun; not to be nearly perfect.\n\nOverall this is a worthy little game to pass a couple hours; or several hours if you're a competitive perfectionist.  8 out of 10","January 26","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nazis are taking over the world led by a robot Hitler and his army of nazi robots. Fortunately for you (or not), you are the only person capable of stopping them because of your abilities as a ninja. This makes you their principal target.\nGameplay\nThe game was originally made for xbox360 and we can strongly feel it through the controls. After multiple attempts at configuring my keyboard and mouse to find a comfortable way of playing the game, I simply decided to plug in my xbox360 controller and everything was better. The time attack aspect of the game requires some kind of eye to hand coordination as well as quick reflexes. If you lack these qualities, chances are, that the game will seem overly difficult.\nGraphics\nLike everything else in this game, the graphics are fairly simple and straight to the point. It is a 2D platformer with a single camera shot that means that there is no camera movement. The overall look of the game is cartoony and simple, nothing too flashy or disturbing.\nMusic & Sound\nThe soundtrack complements well the rest of the game, creating a homogenous overall. However, the repetitive aspect of the soundtrack can become quickly annoying after an extensive amount of gameplay. The sound on the other hand offers and crispy, enjoyable sound to hear, whenever you slash a nazi robot.\nSpecial Feature\nThe game’s simple gameplay, yields no revolutionary special feature but still allows us to battle with friends for those lacking milliseconds.\n\nConclusion\nPros\n- simple but addictive concept\n- fast paced and fun to play\n- great sense of achievement when finishing a level\n- cheap price !\n\nCons\n- repetitive\n- only 40 levels\n- might induce rage\nFinal impression\n10 Second Ninja is a great game to play when you don’t have much time and you are looking to relax a bit after having worked ten hours on your dissertation.  Also, fans of Super Meat Boy will be served in this game. The only criticism that I could address a game of this standing is its short life as there are only 40 levels.\n","February 28","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Defeat all of Robot Hitler's Nazi robot minions on the stage in ten seconds. This reminds me of Super Meat boy. The controls are tight and the action is hectic. Graphics are passable and the music is pretty good. If you are one to try stages over and over again to get the best rating, then you'll like this game a lot. On the downside, I found myself wishing there were replays so I might sit back and watch the ninja clear out the stage. There's also some plot, and from what I saw, it seems pretty funny. Although I think some might find it kind of corny. Again, I only played this for a little bit but I feel the 10 dollar price tag may be too much.

If blowing up masses of nazi robots in 10 seconds of ninja action sounds like a good way to blow the afternoon, this game is for you. Not for the clinically serious gamer. Let's take a look\n\nThe graphics are pixelated, but look well enough. You'll find most of the enemies look the same, but the graphics are not the main point. The music is fine enough, but you'll be heading to the options to turn it off after half an hour or so, as the track can get repetitive.\n\nThe gameplay is the real action here. Your task is to destroy all the ninja nazis in your vicinity within ten seconds. This can become quite easy, but when you realize that for all three stars you need to do that in what is about one-third of this time, strategies begin to develop. It can be quite fun to find new ways to go around a level faster to defeat all of those pesky nazi robots. However, some levels begin to boil down to simple quick reactions, which can easily become frustrating after retrying a level ten times because you're one-tenth of a second short each time. However, the sense of accomplishment after finally winning is great.\n\nThere is no story other than the fact that you are a ninja and there are evil nazi robots and you must kill them.\n\nSo would I recommend it? If you haven't seen the big blue thumbs-up, then I would say yes. The gameplay is fun, as you feel great after defeating five nazi robots in three seconds. The music is no problem, and neither are the graphics. If you're looking for a quick, humerous, reaction-based puzzle game, then this is for you.","November 25, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a game you expect to play for long hours everyday, but it's fun to jump in every once in a while and try to get to new levels and scores. The storyline is actually slightly amusing, but I find the slow pace of the cutscenes a little anticlimatic and tedious to watch so I skipped most of them.\n\nOverall I just love the quick pace of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitalhead/recommended/271670/","digitalhead","Digitalhead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitalhead/","315 products in account","First thing: I only recomment if it's in a bundle or a good sale. $9.99 is way to high for for this game in my opinion. The most I would be willing to pay is $4.99, and that's only if I really liked speed run games, which I don't, so the most I'd personally be willing to pay is $1.99. Thankfully, I got it in a good bundle.\n\nThe concept if fun and interesting, but it doesn't give any reason for the 10 second time limit that I saw, but since I don't really care for speed run games, I quit trying shortly after the first boss. I did kill some time betting some non-completion or score based achievements while waiting for cards to drop.\n\nThe artwork and audio is decent and fits the game fairly well. Some of the graphical mechanics were odd, but didn't effect gameplay at all... do ninjas really bounce excessively when they die?\n\nThe levels have some real challenge to them if to care about the stars. Although, you do need to get 2 stars on each level of a world before you can move on to the boss fight, so casual play will keep you from progressing.\n\nIf you are using a controller and aiming for best time with 3 stars, you should definitely enable clutch mode, which remaps the restart function from RB to BACK. After restarting 100 times, sick of being 0.08 second away from 3 stars, you will probably already have your finger on the restart button and accidentally restart early... repeatedly. Additionally, if you are using a keyboard, stop. Use a responsive controller that you are comfortable with.\n\nOverall, if you like speed running, get it. If you don't like speed running, only get it if it's dirt cheap: 80% off or better.","November 3, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels like the game is not so much 10 second ninja and more 4.62 second ninja, as even if you destroy all enemies within 10 seconds, you will need to do better than that if you want to get further than the second world.\n\nLike I said, I no longer have the reflexes for this type of game, but if you do, it has a charming story and will offer a good challenge.\n\n7/10\n","November 3, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nazis are taking over the world led by a robot Hitler and his army of nazi robots. Fortunately for you (or not), you are the only person capable of stopping them because of your abilities as a ninja. This makes you their principal target.\nGameplay\nThe game was originally made for xbox360 and we can strongly feel it through the controls. After multiple attempts at configuring my keyboard and mouse to find a comfortable way of playing the game, I simply decided to plug in my xbox360 controller and everything was better. The time attack aspect of the game requires some kind of eye to hand coordination as well as quick reflexes. If you lack these qualities, chances are, that the game will seem overly difficult.\nGraphics\nLike everything else in this game, the graphics are fairly simple and straight to the point. It is a 2D platformer with a single camera shot that means that there is no camera movement. The overall look of the game is cartoony and simple, nothing too flashy or disturbing.\nMusic & Sound\nThe soundtrack complements well the rest of the game, creating a homogenous overall. However, the repetitive aspect of the soundtrack can become quickly annoying after an extensive amount of gameplay. The sound on the other hand offers and crispy, enjoyable sound to hear, whenever you slash a nazi robot.\nSpecial Feature\nThe game’s simple gameplay, yields no revolutionary special feature but still allows us to battle with friends for those lacking milliseconds.\n\nConclusion\nPros\n- simple but addictive concept\n- fast paced and fun to play\n- great sense of achievement when finishing a level\n- cheap price !\n\nCons\n- repetitive\n- only 40 levels\n- might induce rage\nFinal impression\n10 Second Ninja is a great game to play when you don’t have much time and you are looking to relax a bit after having worked ten hours on your dissertation.  Also, fans of Super Meat Boy will be served in this game. The only criticism that I could address a game of this standing is its short life as there are only 40 levels.\n","February 28","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This requires discovering the ideal/shortest path through many, many deaths.  While each level has a 10 second limit, you'll quickly learn that you'll need to complete a level in just a few seconds if you want to receive full marks (3 star rating).  Before you can move on to the next world (of a set of levels), you must earn so many stars in the current world.  Thus, while you can complete a level and move on with a single star, earning a single star on multiple levels of that world will not be enough to move you on to the next world; so you replay the levels you did poory at and replay them, and replay them, until you can get ~ a 2 star or more average on all that world's levels.\n\nThe game in itself seems to be pretty well done -- the minimal graphics, style, and humor all work together nicely, and I love the leaderboard to see where you stack up against your friends and the world; both per level rankings and per world.  That did motivate me to press on just a little bit more and shave a few more hundredths of a second off my time.  :-)\n\nThe only minor downside I have with this game is the high level of difficulty required in order to progress to the next world.  I want to play to have fun; not to be nearly perfect.\n\nOverall this is a worthy little game to pass a couple hours; or several hours if you're a competitive perfectionist.  8 out of 10","January 26","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although it lacks any visual aesthetic, it's the Gameplay that makes this Game so brilliant.\n\nGameplay  : Amazing!\nSimple, but hard. 10 Second Ninja might be frustrating, however it is satisfying to finally obtain the 3 Star of this one Level you have been trying to get.

Because of its simplicity, you can easily focus on what is happening. Only the Swastika bother me a bit, I understand that the main enemy is a Hitler Robot, but you don't have to add in every stage a swastika, just to remind us that the antagonist is Hitler.\n\nSoundtrack  : Meh.\nNot bad, nothing fancy, just a normal soundtrack.\n\nControls  : Good.\nI would highly recommend using a Controller, as I found it much easier to use in this game. Overall the Controls are pretty responsive and easy to use.\n\nFinal Verdict  : Its Good.\nIf you like a fun little game with responsive controls and an interesting gameplay concept, but doesn't care about the graphics and soundtrack that much, then this game is perfect for you.\nJust prepare to die a lot and maybe rage alot.\n\n","May 3","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
