Bought it anyway, more easy when I want to play it on other PCs.\n\nWell, to the game. If you like the first 2 Roller Coaster Tycoon, you'll like this one. It's simple, it's a top-down view, you can only rotate the camera 90 degress, you know, basic Roller Coaster stuff. You create train tracks and streets as if you were creating roller coasters on RCT. There's no secret.\n\nThe soundtrack plays accordingly to the year you're playing, it's awesome. Very relaxing.\n\nThe game starts very very easy, so you can learn basics. However, when you reach harder levels, the difficulty rises significantly. Isn't easy to play against 7 CPU controlled rival companies when you have to reach a 90% performance Index.\n\nYou may have problems understanding train tracks, routes and signalling when you start, but nothing that a little search doesn't fix. Isn't something complicated, once you understand it will be easy. Also isn't not THAT important that you learn about signaling if you're not making crossed tracks.\n\nAnyway, I have over 2000 hours on Locomotion using my old disc (I play this since 2006, on a Windows 98). It's simple, relaxing and can be really challenging on harder maps even if you KNOW how to play properly.","March 17, 2015","true","19.2"," 65 of 83 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","65","83","3","0"

All I know is when playing on Windows 7 with a Nvidia card the screen at random will go crazy. So save often and you should be fine. Everything else works as normal.)\n\nI do recommend this game even with the issues I stated above and the more you play the longer it takes to break it seems. There's no real campaign just "missions" but its still fun even if you don't play with the missions and just "free play". Its fun and despite the poor graphics it has a nice art style and has great music. There are so many vehicles to buy and use. All have different stats. Also the AI is really dumb or really smart at times. For $6 its a worthy purchase and I would buy it all the time despite its bugs.\n\nUpdate seems the issue with the screen going crazy is because of the steam overlay but still save often.\n\nI will be attempting to make a guide but I hate writing things so don't count on it XD","November 3, 2015","true","7.7"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","27","29","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drury27/recommended/356430/","drury27","Drury","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drury27/","144 products in account","In 1995, Chris Sawyer painstakingly coded Transport Tycoon in assembly. To those of you not familiar with software engineering, programming in assembly is like driving a car by pouring fuel into the engine and turning the wheels yourself, as opposed to Java, which is more like driving a car by letting your cat do it.\n\nEverybody loved Transport Tycoon, mostly because nobody could afford train sets. This is still the case, which is why OpenTTD exists.\n\nSeeing as nobody really cared about the other forms of transport in the game, himself included, Chris Sawyer made a sequel and named it Locomotion to make it abundantly clear that even if you find anything in the game that's not a train, you are strongly urged to ignore it. It's like the man is saying "trust me, you're not really here for the lorries that stop whenever they're being overtaken - I mean, do you even know what a lorry is? Thought so. Also the ships that are even more bland and slow than in the last game? They're that way so you can have the fun of building twisting railway bridges over the ocean because I built the game on the engine of a rollercoaster game I made! The second one! You'll never guess which! Also have fun hammering that left mouse button!"\n\nTo be fair, there's still some fun to be had building twisting mountain railroads and even bridges above entire cities using the rollercoaster tycoon 2 building tools. And you have the same degree of freedom, if not more, when digging underground, which is something not many games offer - which is a shame, I mean, if we take the Locomotion system and remove the part where you have to demolish everything on surface before you can edit anything underneath it (which in case of metro systems spells bad news for most of the above city's populace), as well as the part where your index finger and your mouse button partake in an endurance competition when building long stretches of rail, it might just make for fun and challenging railway building.\n\nOf course you'd also have to code an AI that would not cheat in every way imaginable to build hideous twisting skyrails all over the map, covering much of it underneath in some kind of bizarre train fetishist orwellian fantasy, where the lower class lives underneath many layers of railroad bridges as their train overlords stroll on the surface while you and AIs as olympian gods watch from above, with you trying to convince Zeus Transport to stop being a ♥♥♥♥ and not take your cargo.\n\nI'm afraid being religious still won't help when all your trains start breaking down every fifth tile of the way, no matter how much you pray for it to stop. Old man Chris would just never admit those were bad design, no, you absolutely have to do nothing but replace trains once you have more than 20 of them, it is so much fun, you see, you just fail to appreciate the genius behind it. You know what else is genius, Chris? Me taking a ♥♥♥♥ on your face.\n\nThat's not to say Chris Sawyer's Locomotion is a bad game, it just leaves a lot to be desired. It repeats many of the mistakes of Transport Tycoon, but it still improves on the basic formula enough for me to let it slide. In fact, if somebody were to tell me there was a sequel by the man in the works, you can bet I would preorder in an instant, then just copypaste this review over to that game's steam page and it would still be relevant.\n\nEven if it's not perfect, Chris Sawyer's Locomotion is still a Transport Tycoon 2 under a different name, and that means something.","February 16","true","5.8"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","88","23","26","16","6"

This game is not much improved in such a way that it would be more functional and more stable with newer computers as opposed to OpenTTD game. The game is mostly otherwise really good and simple, which I appreciate, but, a basic element seems to be missing from what you are used to using the OpenTTD game series and it is also more difficult than the OpenTTD game.\n\nFor this reason, I can't fully recommend the game, because when OpenTTD is free and all the other far better made and implemented, including further development of the game.\n\n50/50 recommendations. :3\n\n\nFIN:\n\nHyvin toteutettu klooni alkuperäisesta vastaavasta Openttd pelistä, vaikka peli onkin vanhempi niin silti, pidän enemmän alkuperäisesta Transport Tycoon sarjasta. Kyseistä peliä ei ole juurikaan paranneltu siten että, se olisi toimivampi ja vakaampi uudemmilla tietokoneilla toisin kuin OpenTTD peli. Peli on pitälti muuten todella hyvä ja yksinkertainen, jota arvostan mutta, moni peruselementti tuntuu puuttuvan siitä mitä on tottunut käyttämään OpenTTD sarjassa ja peli on myöskin vaikeampi kuin OpenTTD peli.\n\nTästä syystä en voi täysin suositella peliä, sillä kun OpenTTD on ilmainen ja kaikilta muultaosin paremmin tehty ja toteutettu, myös peliä kehitetään edelleen.\n\n50/50 suositteluni. :3","April 25, 2015","true","0.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

It's an extremely simple game with simple gameplay and simple (but pleasing!) graphics. Still runs fine with no issues whatsoever, but saying that, it's not exactly a demanding game for your computer to run. It's only real issue is caused by the AI companies, which tend to make a complete mess of the landscape as they build their infrastructure.\n\nAt the bare minimum this is a great time waster. You can be blasé and build train tracks and roads while running YouTube or music or whatever in the background. It's also surprisingly satisfying to watch a small village grow over time into a large metropolis, courtesy of your efforts.\n\nYou can, however, play its predecessor Transport Tycoon for free, with mods.

It was one of my very first games I ever played on the computer! When I saw it had come out on steam I couldn't wait to play it again. It's even more fun playing it now than it was when I was younger, because now I understand more of the game's mechanics. But even as a kid I was easily able to create and manage my huge transport company! This game is well worth the price in my opinion.\n\nThe outdated graphics may be an issue to some people. In my opinion the game looks very nice for its age, and doesn't bother me in the slightest. I experienced no issues running the game on my Windows 10 laptop, and it has a max resolution of 1280x768 (which for my 1366x768 laptop screen, fits nicely!)\n\nThe basics of the game are very easy to learn, and within an hour of playing you'll already have 10 or 20 different vehicles. The AI in the game can be a bit challenging to new players, so I would recommend starting out just on your own. There is even a multiplayer component built into this game (which I have yet to try out since I don't have any other friends who own this game), but I can picture having loads of fun competing with a friend to become the top transport business!\n\nOverall this game is a must have for people who enjoyed it before. Even if you've never tried it out, I highly recommend you at least try it! (I mean, 2 hours is plenty of time to decide if you don't like the game so you can refund it or whatever). If you're not willing to pay 6 bucks for it, then I'm sure it'll go for at least a dollar or 2 during the big sales.\n\n10/10","February 18","true","39.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This definitely describes Locomotion. I really enjoyed Transportation Tycoon when it came out and have great memories of playing it. To a modern me, this remake looks like something from the computer stone age and the interface feels like someone invented the mouse partway through the game's development cycle and added it on as an after thought. If you have tried to go back and play Civ 1 or the original Balder's Gate you know the feeling.\n\nThe basic idea is that you create rail services between industries and / or cities. You can also add trucking and buses, but they seem to cannibalize passengers and freight from your trains rather than taking them to and from the train station. Later on you can add in airplanes. Your actions will influence cities to grow and evolve over time.\n\nThis is a game a really wanted to like, but I couldn't play for more than a couple hours. If you enjoy nostalgia or simply like a solid transport / business game and don't mind very dated graphics and a GUI from the 80s, give this game a whirl.\n\nRating: D","February 17","false","2.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I don't know what went wrong here, but Chris Sawyer's Original Transport Tycoon was way better. Locomotion has so many utterly confusing quirks that it makes my head spin. It's completely unintuitive. The graphics are so poor that even when spinning the map around is no guarantee that what you are about to execute will succeed. Most likely you only destroy what had nothing to do with your original intentions and on top of that, you will waste a whole lot of money in the process. Buses that go around in circles and to the wrong stations, roads that seem complete, but actually aren't, accidentally wiping out housing crucial to the community, I don't want to go into chapter and verse here, but basically this game is about as much fun as reading insurance policy disclaimers. It's rubbish and best left alone. I do recommend Transport Tycoon though. That one is fun.","April 2","false","4.4"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

It doesn't explain much of anything and you have to figure out what you have to do. The first tutorial is supposed to explain to you how to setup a bus route and make money. All it tells you is if you hold the right mouse button down you can scroll around the map. And that's it, nothing else. I sat there for a while waiting, thinking okay what will it tell me next, except there wasn't anything else.\n\nThe interface is difficult to use. I couldn't figure out what as was. You would think that if you hovered your mouse over a button it would tell you what it does, but it doesn't. So you click and hope for the best.\n\nAI pathing is horrible. Example: Built 2 buses , they initially went to their destinations and after that all they did was drive around in circles. Deleted routes (didn't help), deleted both buses, tried again, the buses went to some stops and then got stuck driving around in circles again.\n\nI never heard of this game before, now I know why. Played the hell out of Transport Tycoon, was hoping this one would be fun, found out it's utter crap. This is just a cheap knock off of a great game.\n\nGot it for a buck 50, still feel ripped off.","November 12, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 of 13 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","13","0","2"

I first played it in 2005 I think, having a lot of fun in the process. After finding it again on Steam, I tried to use my CD, but I got errors of compatibility. So I bought it and, for 6 U$D, it´s still a very addictive game.\nMy only complaint is that the colours reverse, sometimes automaticaly (I read it is something in the Windows system), always after minimizing the game with the Shift key (that also happened with the CD).\n\nYou can´t get bored too quickly with the game, since you can make everything, modify the scenarios the way you want and also sabotage your competitors (but what´s the purpose of a game without a competition to defeat).\n\nWhat I would like to see are new scenarios as DLC content (free would be a nice thing), such as zones of Germany, Russia, South America, Asia and other, random scenarios, with their respective transports. I saw lots of mods for trains, aircrafts, ships, airports, train stations etc... for the CD version made by various fans of the game, so it would be a great thing if some of those fans could make new scenarios.\n\nTo sum up, it´s a fun and addictive game, but lacking in the scenarios department, though you can create your own using the "Scenario Creator" tool. Also lacking are several transports, having only a part of the maybe hundreds that could have been included (though it would make the game difficult to run and more expensive).","October 10, 2015","true","96.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh the memories...\n\nThis game teaches you how to create a sucessful transportation company. The game is great despite being old and provides a variety of challenges and you can even make your own. However, I hope there could be a game like this were player companies could compete with other player companies besides computer competitors. This could also be great if player made maps/challenges could be shared with others. The game is still a great classic regardless and I suggest people give it a try.","July 11, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The different scenarios can be pretty difficult at times but thats what makes it good. It works fine in Windows 10 for me. Other people have problems with getting some older games to run. The max 16:9 resolution is 720p.","June 2","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
