Note that this is not a review of the game itself (see reviews of Strike Suit Zero for a rough idea of how thing shake out), but rather the currently-$3 upgrade to the Director's Cut edition, assuming that you own the original Strike Suit Zero.\n\nThere's no doubt that this was a rushed release - a simultaneous PC/XB1/PS4 release was almost certainly too much for a small indie outfit to chew on. Technical issues and missing features, mostly, all adding up to a Director's Cut that ended up being less worthy a purchase than the original release of the game.\n\nThe patch released today has addressed several of the key problems. If you've got the hardware to make the game sing, it'll chug along at a solid 60fps with nary a hitch or stutter, and the controls feel all the more responsive for it. You can now also adjust the FOV freely, so if you thought that the game was a little claustrophobic even in third-person mode, you can widen your field of view and see more of the fight at once.\n\nThere are still some problems. For some reason, the 'shadows' detail option (one of the supposed major graphical upgrades of this edition) is still greyed out for everyone, and defaults to the 'off' setting to boot. There are also some missing features (mod tools and Steam Workshop support) and content (No integration with Strike Suit Infinity, the survival mode), but those seem to be in the works currently.\n\nProblems as it may have, they've done some good work on the much-maligned campaign of the original Strike Suit Zero here. The story has been rewritten and re-voiced to flow better and generally be more coherent, and the missions themselves have been rejigged to be more exciting (dropping you into spectacular fights sooner) and fairer, with fewer suicidal NPCs to babysit and more checkpoints for if you do fail.\n\nThe main value-for-money perk of the Director's Cut is if you hadn't previously bought the Heroes Of The Fleet DLC, which is included as part of the DC upgrade. If you already do have it, then the DC upgrade doesn't seem as exciting a purchase. Hopefully if they do integrate it with Strike Suit Infinity (which I'd love to see with tuned up graphics), it's inherent value would soar.\n\nEither way, it's a bit of a flawed release, but improving. It's a pity that it took so long for the developers to even acknowledge these issues, though, let alone fix them.","April 8, 2014","true","3.5"," 378 of 452 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","378","452","0","19"

Technical issues! (Review Updated)\n\nAs other reviews already describe, this game has a lot of technical issues which makes it pretty much useless right now.\nWorst offender for me is the framerate which is locked at 47 FPS no matter the settings and the game stutters terribly at that which renders it pretty much unplayable. But other things like the disabled shadow option and FOV slider as well as the missing steam workshop support are also true. And yes the textures are much blurrier than in the original for some reason, even after restarting the game. I also have to mention the missing support for languages other than english which is just blatant false advertising and quite frankly an absolute audacity although despite being german I'm not personnally affected since my english is sufficient to understand the game. (It seems that the language issue was fixed - now you can select the language from the tab in the games properties in steam - the texture blur is fixed as well)\nWhat's also pretty worrying is that none of the issues are being addressed by Born Ready Games at the time of this writing and that's always a bad sign (Obviously that point isn't valid anymore for the texture and language issues, but the framerate issues still aren't acknowledged).\n\nSo I'd strongly advice everyone to wait and see if these issues get fixed before you consider buying it.\n\nDependent on the fixes they put out if any I will amend the review.\n\nEdit: I can confirm that the texture blur and missing languages are fixed, now. However the framerate still remains choppy as it was before. If they can fix that as well I will change the review immediatly to a recommendation based on its technical state. That won't cover the gameplay, of course, I'll check that out if I'm able to play the game smoothly.\n\nUpdate: Practically all issues are being addressed by the developers and they pledged to work on it - that also includes support for DX10 graphics cards in addition to the other issues. Not enough to recommend a purchase, right now, of course, but here's hoping that it'll turn out well in the long run.\n\nAnother update: Man, news are rolling out by the minute on this one. Despite the information on the news page which says otherwise, one of the devs just confirmed that the 85% discount for owners of the original will NOT be time limited. So you have the time to wait until all technical issues are fixed.\n\nUpdate: The DX10 patch is out but I can't test this since I have a DX11 card. Anyway, the framerate is still in the gutter - no change there. So the negative review stays.\n\nMore Update: The patch which is supposed to fix the framerate lock and the stuttering didn't work for me unfortunately - now the game is capped at exactly 50 FPS throughout the whole game, including the menus - previously it only happened during gameplay. Also the stuttering is still there. What a disappointment!\nEdit: Alright, got it working at 60FPS sorta, kind of ish. First I had to set my Logitech F710 gamepad to Direct Input instead of XInput and then the game started of at 60FPS. Now when I start the first mission it starts off at 55FPS (still stutters) and at the time the Arcadia jumps away it reaches 60FPS. That's as far as I got last evening so I don't know if it stays like that. Oh and you need to leave V-Sync activated, otherwise the game stutters and framerate jumps between 60 and 64 FPS. What a mess! But good enough to try out the game itself so I'll see if the stuttering comes back or if it's just at the beginning of the mission.\nOh, nevermind, the game just does what it wants - sometimes it starts up at 60 FPS, sometimes it starts at 50 FPS and sometimes it reverts to 60 after changing the control input option. It's just a giant mess!","April 9, 2014","false","4.8"," 135 of 198 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","135","198","0","4"

This however, is not the case. IMO 'Strike Suit Zero' and 'Strike Suit Zero: Director Cut' are very different games. And while I do recommend the directors cut I do not recommend the original game 'Strike Suit Zero'.\n\nSo what's the difference?\nWell, the main difference is that you have a chance to complete the game in the directors cut. You might also be able to finish the original game, but according to Steam statistics only 5.3% of all players managed to see the end of the main campaign in 'Strike Suit Zero'. So the major difference is the difficulty. 'Strike Suit Zero' gets incredibly hard at some points, even on easy, while the difficulty in the directors cut if very fair.\n\nBesides the difficulty developers changed the graphics and made the directors cut more colorful. IMO this makes the original game look more realistic. But both games look very nice.\n\nThey also changed the sequences of the story dramatically. I would not say it's necessarily better, events just unfold very differently but eventually lead to the same end.\n\nControls are also different in both games, although only slightly.\n\nOne outstanding aspect of the game is the music. IMO the music of 'Strike Suit Zero' is on of the best game soundtracks ever. And while the original game comes with soundtrack and art-book, the directors cut does not. I even had the impression that not all parts of the soundtrack appear in the directors cut, although I might be wrong about that. I've started playing the music on my stereo via a MP3 stick. It's great. Go to the shop page of the original game to hear what I mean.\n\nStrike Suit Zero: Directors Cut\n\nPros:\n- nice graphics\n- great music\n- additional simulation levels beside the main campaign that are very enjoyable\n- good controls, although I needed a while to get used to them\n- some space crafts can convert into strike suits, a space robot that can kill scores of enemies in single attacks\n- good, interesting story\n- very good voice acting\n- balanced and fair difficulty\n\nCons:\n- disappointing final level of the campaign\n- short campaign (13 missions)","January 22","true","17.1"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","29","31","2","1"

Great story, fun gameplay, fast pace, decent music, nice steam backgrounds. ^^\n\n\n\nIf we are comparing this to Strike Suit Zero:\n\nGraphics are more pixelated and less detailed. Random Camera Flair and Blooms block much of the screen. AI seems slightly dumber than the original. The change in story line makes slightly more sense. The new color scheme is not great however. Black Fleet ships should not be orange....\n\nThe achievements are much easier to finish since there are fewer of them and the ai has such terrible aim compared to the original. I don't like the fact that I can't see weapon links anymore. Literally takes less than 5 Hours to finish the game and get all achievements since its easier than the original.\n\nHowever, since all the dlc is bundled into the game itself compared to the original, I would give this game slightly more positive than negative.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/288370/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","So in the late 90ies, when the N64 was picking up speed, Factor 5 released Star Wars: Rogue Squadron for the platform. It was an arcade style Star Wars flying game where you pilot a variety of Star Wars vehicles while trying to defeat the Empire. It was intuitive, fast paced, fun, and varied with a tonne of easter eggs and cool reasons to come back to it. Sadly, Factor 5 was shut down after the release of Lair. Leaving behind a gaping hole in the arcade Space Combat departement. Enter Strike Suit Zero, a high energy, fast paced, blindingly awesome space fighter.\n\nStrike Suit Zero Takes you into the far future. Mankind has taken to the stars and has gotten in a right kerfuffle. Renegade colonists and a mysterious militant faction called the Black Fleet have taken aim at planet Earth. In particular the former have come in possession of a planet busting weapon and seek to destroy the Earth. You're an ace pilot going by the name of Adams. After being reprimanded for disobaying orders you're stuck on mundane duties. During a routine escort, you and your wingman are drawn into a galaxy wide conflict with the existance of time and space in the balance.\n\nThe game dumps the Sci-fi and space opera blabble on you thickly right off the bat. Part Star Wars, part Mass Effect and part War of 1812, the story takes you through a bunch of scenarios where you attempt to disrupt the Black fleet or the Colonials. Every scenario throws you a different curveball. Defending, attacking, raiding, bombing, dogfighting; it's all part of the changing palatte of challenges the game throws at you. Every mission comes with a choice of fighters to use and customisable armnaments. Beating the stage unlocks more ships to use and so the games keeps you coming back for those shiny platinum medals.\n\nThe game's namesake; the Strike Suit, is the poster boy for cool. It is fighter craft that can transform into mobile weapons plaform. The ship turns from a jet fighter into an attack helicopter on the fly. In fighter mode you're fast and nimble. In Strike Suite mode you can strafe and fire a plethora of weapons with deady accuracy. Strike Suit mode however consumes a special energy that can only be replenished by waiting, or by dealing damage in fighter mode. It creates a high energy tango that rewards an agressive and fast playstyle that requires a traditional degree of skill in flying games, as well as new control scheme.\n\nThe controls are perhaps my one gripe. I had to remap the entire layout before I was comfortable. It is a small matter, but once you got it all in order, the game is a blast from start to finish. Everything is unlocked by being good at the game; not good against others (there is no multiplayer to detract from the core game). I would really like to see more from this developer, as well as more of these games.","January 26","true","7.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The Modeled in pilots are a really cool touch, this addition helps add a better sense of scale to each ship.\nThe better voice acting makes the missions quite a bit more lively, which surprised me because I didn't have a problem with the original voice acting.\n\nThe soundtrack is the same treat as it always was, and from what I can tell there aren't any dubstep remixes like the song used in the trailer, which is yet another plus.\nThe earlier Strike Suit is a nice change, but it is also one that I could have done without.\n\nThe Directors Cut is the best version of a great game, and I can't recommend it enough to fans of space combat or mecha games.\n\n4/14/14 EDIT: FOV slider seems to have been fixed.","April 9, 2014","true","3.8"," 35 of 62 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","35","62","0","1"

The developer has been working to fix the issues. Some of them have been fixed as of time of this review and most of the really bad issues have been sorted out.\n- No FOV sliders (has since been added)\n- No DX10 support (has since been added, fully functional as tested on my rig)\n- No shadows (pending)\n- Choppy framerate (patches fixed most of the worst instances, only encountered 2 situations where framerate dropped)\n- A slew of crashes (patches fixed most of the worst instances, only crashed once over 7 hours)\n\nThe "meh" and the average.\nThis game is just an upgrade of the previous game, Strike Suit Zero. Most of the content is still the same although the missions have been tweaked and the story has been rewritten. Several actors were called back to record new audio to voice out the slightly changed story.\n\nThe writing for the dialogue is not the best, however the voice actors themselves are pretty good. It keeps the story moving while things are exploding all around you.\n\nThe game uses a checkpoint system within missions. While they aren't especially sparce and the missions don't drag on too much, once or twice I found myself groaning when I realised that the game's checkpoint put me further back than I would've liked.\n\nNow let's move on to the "good".\nThis game is HELLA FUN! The battles are fast, frantic, and once you start a mission the explosions never stop happening. You'll be taking on enemies ranging from nimble fighters to large capital ships and carriers. Often you'll be taking on all these things over the course of a single mission.\n\nObjectives within missions include the usual:\n- Anti-fighter screening\n- Bombing runs\n- Escort (done right!)\n- Assaulting capital ships and large installations\n\nOne of the most refreshing aspects of the game's mission design is pretty superb. Objectives change as the battle flows around you, and its one of the few games that does Escort segments right.\n\nIts not uncommon for the game to give you an objective like, "Protect (Ship name)", but the ship you're escorting is far from defenseless and they have much bigger guns. I found myself frequently running back to my defence target because I was getting swarmed by fighters and the ship I was protecting blew them out of the sky.\n\nWhich brings me to what I loved best about this game; the sense of immersion it gave me while I was in the cockpit. Your allied ships and fighters are not useless, they're more than capable at blowing up the enemy with your support. Similarly, the enemy ships and fighters are just as capable of blowing you up as well if you're not careful.\n\nTo summarize.\nTechnical issues asside, this is one of the best arcadey space combat games I've played in a while. It harkens back to a lot of older arcady space combat titles that were mostly only available on consoles. The game isn't easy when you crank the difficulty up to Hardcore and WILL kick your ♥♥♥ if you're not careful.\n\nPlayed with a mouse and keyboard set-up, main story campaign completeed in just over 8 hours on Hardcore difficulty. There are quite a few 'Optional Objectives' I've yet to complete in the story missions. There is also the Heroes of the Fleet mission pack which I haven't touched.","May 9, 2014","true","8.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I even streamed the entire campaign at 1080p and 60+fps, no issues whatsoever.  Unfortunately I'm not a partner of Twitch so I don't have VoDs available, but I intend to go back and do some more runs of this game (because I got the "bad" ending).  That's not a shameless plug, but for those still on the fence that want to see some live game-play of this game so they can make their own decision, feel free to drop by my channel and ask me to play the game (if I'm not already playing it), and I'll happily show you.  I'm 1orionquest on Twitch.\n\nWhat I think of the game:\nRight now there's not many arcade styled space shooters around, so for fans of this genre, this is pretty much all you get, at least for the immediate future.  It's not the best out there, but it doesn't suck, I'd say it's slightly above average.  There are strange sound levels, for sure.  The options menu didn't have a borderless windows mode, which was slightly off-putting for me because I try to stream games.  The story, not really the best out there, certainly no Wing Commander, but let's be honest, this game's selling point is mostly the action.  And on that department, I believe it delivers.  Eearly missions are pretty easy, but some of the late ones, definitely not easy.  Sometimes it took me several tries to complete a particular mission or section of a mission.  And yes, sometimes the game is a bit vague about what you're supposed to be doing, or you'll find that you'd be better off not actually sticking to the main objective to get better results out of your mission.  For the most part though, if you failed a particular part of a mission or can't get past a certain point, I felt in no way that it was the game's fault, it's definitely the player's fault.  If you want an easy game you can just blow through in a single sitting without much challenge, or you're just not that good at space shooters, you might not want to buy it.  The difficulty curve is definitely there, and it's quite common to die or fail a mission because, well you suck.  I was pretty rusty, it's been a while, and I failed some missions pretty badly.  The AI is pretty good, matter fact I'd say the AI was better than me on many occasions.  They definitely don't just sit there and die or take damage, forcing you to do everything.  As a matter of fact, on some missions I pretty much just let the AI do most of the actual work and I sat back and played a "zone defence".\n\nTLDR:  I think the issues people had with early versions are fixed, my version has not a single problem of that description.  The game itself is above average, be prepared for some challenging missions.","April 10, 2014","true","10.6"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

First off the huge visual overhaul add a very homeworld'esc feel to the game, which is approriate seeing as it shares its composer. While we are not looking at some form of graphical ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the tripple A releases, for a small team this is still a nice piece of work!\n\nI havn't finished the main campaign as yet, but am enjoying the differences, you do get the Strike Suit earlier as promised and the tutorial has been made shorter and less static (No more making you press buttons to force it along). Also there is a bit more narrative exsploration, little extras I have noticed in later levels as well (Although that may be simply because I can't remember them as they are small details)\n\nOther things, it runs a lot smoother, I have mid/high rig and I had the rare FPS drop on Strike Suit Zero. I have had none so far, considering the impovments I was actully exspecting more issus. I also play this with a 360 Controller and the responces feel a lot smoother than the original game, I'm not resorting to just spamming missles at everything, which is leading me to try out the other ships in the game.\n\nI don't really have much quips with this game at all.

This is especially true of Strike Mode. It's a hurdle. In particular I have to switch the two control sticks -- not sure how anyone can play with the default (where left stick rolls your ship and right stick turns it).\n\nBut once you get over it, you have an awesome new game in the tragically underrepesented space shooter genre. I love this game to death. Dogfighting is satisfying, the controls ARE solid once you get used to them, and the missions keep things fresh enough all the way through.\n\nMy favorite part is fighting the capital ships. These things have tons of turrets and fighter support swarming them, but you can shoot at special weak points to do extra damage and systematically dismantle them. Bringing one down always feels like an accomplishment.\n\nThe Director's Cut changes are generally helpful. The rejiggered story to get you the Strike Suit earlier is better for gameplay, but the tonal shift as you re-enter the original story around mission 4 is noticeable (though it also creates a cool twist at the very end that wasn't in there before). The more colorful ships make it easier to pick out weak points and bring some more variety to the "everything is gray" feel before, though the tradeoff is everything has a slightly more toyish look to it. The game has received extensive patching for difficulty and checkpointing since release that make it a much better experience than immediately after it came out.\n\nHighly recommend if you're even a little interested in the genre.","April 19, 2014","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imnotthe/recommended/288370/","imnotthe","Break//man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imnotthe/","174 products in account","One of my favorite games in a while.  It really sated my craving for arcadey flight games that I've had since Ace Combat, which no other game I've played yet has done.  Once I started getting in the groove, switching between Flight mode and Strike Mode became very intuitive.  Fighting quickly becomes a matter of building Flux rather than taking down every target you see, since Strike mode is much more adept at completing objectives.  Switching between the two modes became instinctive, whether I needed a boost of maneuverability from the Strike Suit or to take down high-value targets like Beam Cannons quickly.  Adding weak points to large craft was extremely helpful, but I feel like having a lock-on target on the center of the craft is more of a nuisance since you're better off disabling the turrets or free-firing the weak points and vents.  Beyond the Strike Suit, the skyboxes are beautiful, the voice acting is superb, and the difficulty curve is great.  I also feel like playing vanilla Zero benefitted the experience of the new story, as I imagined vanilla Zero's canon ending was the timewarp, leading into the Director's Cut iteration of the story.\n\nGoing back to Ace Combat, I feel like the dev team could take some cues from the series if they haven't already.  I already see some similarities, coincidental or not (final stage tunnel run, post game fighter equipped with laser, customizable loadouts, crazy superweapons, radio chatter...) One-on-one high-skill dogfight bosses or boss squadrons would be cool, but I can imagine it would require some gimmicks to make it work in a zero-gravity environment.  Similar to the Black Fleet I suppose, but more on terms of encounters than difficut levels/scenarios.  And more tunnel runs, through a space station maybe?  Just because you're in space doesn't mean you can't get creative with environments.  Maybe all these are available with mod tools or something, I remember seeing a few mods for Vanilla Zero but I don't know much beyond that.\n\nOne of my main criticisms is that the Colonies had no characters or voiceovers which made them more or less story-related cannon fodder.  Sure they had motives to fight, what with Earth revoking their governmental rights and annihilating civilians... but beyond some bits of backstory they didn't develop or become sympathetic in any way.  And I can't say much about technical issues, because I didn't experience any firsthand.\n\nOverall I'd think if you enjoyed this game as much as I did, the $20 pricetag will pay for itself in terms of replayability.  Since I had Zero, the $3 pricetag seemed more than reasonable to support the game and recieve an updated experience.","May 13, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Watching larger ships trade fire is a fantastic sight to behold.\n-You will feel underwhelmed at first until one of the first larger skirmishes - as the dust settles, you will probably grin a maniacal grin at the realization of the potential of the Strike Suit. Beyond that you simply become better at dealing destruction.\n\nCons:\n-The story does nothing for me. Protect the blue guys, shoot the red guys and enjoy the carnage.\n-Unclear objectives. The bonus unlocks can also make this problem exponentially worse since they can be unrelated to priorities.\n-'Flux'  always seems too limited which makes the transformation mechanic of the game seem superfluous. Why transform unless I am engaging a cap-ship? Perhaps unlocks later in the game will remedy this, but maybe an XP-per-kill system would have been a better way to 'buy' those unlocks between missions...then you could properly stick to mission objectives without interruption.\n\nNeutral:\n-If you never played SSZ before, the Director's Cut is the way to go. But if you already owned the previous SSZ, you're not going to get much more that you already had. Still, a $2.99 upgrade for owners of the original isn't bad.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall SSZ:DC is a fun, arcade-like romp if you are a fan of the Homeworld and/or Freespace frachises. Homeworld lovers will enjoy the nostalgic engine trails and cap-ship design/coloration, and FreeSpace lovers will feel right at home in the frantic dogfighting nature of the game. I caution owners of the original SSZ not to get too excited, you won't see much new content. However, first time players will want to choose the Director's Cut since it includes some of the DLC and a (very) few extra touch-ups that bring it in line with the console release.","April 13, 2014","true","5.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It pains to me to say the nay with this game's reccommendation. I'll keep it short and simple as far as my grievances.\n\nThe biggest issue with the game is the sometimes unfair difficulty spikes, Mission 5, "Hit and Run" is a prime example. Phase 3 of the mission has you coming to the aid of a cruiser, which is already heavily damaged and is still being pummeled. Now that wouldn' be an issue if A) the game spawned you closer to where you could make an actual attempt at rescue and B) the targets you needed to hit to save it were clearly marked.\n\nThere were instances before this mission where it was the same issue, protect this, then protect or aid that only to find that the moment you were told the next objective, that objective was already beseiged and nearly dead, resulting in many a retry and hope that the games engine would give you a fair shot.\n\nAnother issue is the lack of a HUD, I spent many missions being plinked and tagged from all directions with no way of knowing where I was in relation to my enemies or targets, the directional arrows were not much help.\n\nIt isn't a bad game, but it does feel like as far as difficulty, they went for unfair situations rather than actually making it challenging, and some of the crashes and graphic errors that show make me wonder if this was a rushed deal.","April 12, 2014","false","11.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","2"

I have tried a bit of the game and this seems to be the case, AA works and the light from ships jumping doesn't cover the whole screen. It does look good now, and there is more content in this version than the standard edition obviously. To anyone looking to buy a Strike Suit game for the first time, this certainly isn't a bad first choice, although with Strike Suit Infinity being $7, you might want to first try that if you're still on the fence. The flight in this game feels to me a little odd, I don't know what it is and it's not bad, but I think it's something with the controls that seem a little weird to me, perhaps I played too much Battlefront II back on my PS2. The only other nitpick I have is there is no Steam Workshop support, but seeing that there are very few mods for the original, I'm not very suprised and I don't think people will miss it much. Overall, this is a fun space combat game that can look pretty, and you don't get that very often.","April 11, 2014","true","0.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

The story and characters don't manage to intrigue you before gameplay reaches the point it starts to feel tedious and poorly carried out. Just a few missions in and you notice many battles is flying back and forth or chasing enemies with really bad vessel turning mechanics. I guess if you could push one button to instantly turn the ship over or in the opposite direction with energy penalty it would be much better. On top of that, for a game as much un-fun as Strike Suit is, some objectives are immensely difficult, which can severely break the experience for casual players and those who have no experience in a flight simulator games. The game was sitting there installed for several months, but no matter how much I looked upon it, I'd never found the strength to force myself through it.","August 3, 2015","false","3.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

So, on a whim, I picked up this new dogfighter (because that pre-rendered cinematic trailer was awesoem). And having played it, it's good.\n\nIt's not a prefect game (so very few are), and this one could definitely use a little more work. That said, I would still call it a diamond in the rough. The game starts out fine, and the controls are pretty standard. Forward thrust, back thrust, barrel roll if you don't accellerate while rolling. But it's fun and nice to see a dogfighter again. Added points for the dated transforming ship, once a trope but now a relic.\n\nThe programmers do need to work on a few key details, however. The background radio drama doesn't start up until after you've cleared a wave of baddies, and it forces you to simply keep flying around doing nothing while it carries its tune. Then there's the final level, which goes from an open air game to tunnel crawler rather abruptly with no prior buildup. This is made worse by the fact that you have learn to manuever in tight spaces, but also do it while your ship is constantly speeding up. The radio does take this time to do the story right, so it wasn't a total bust, except when you inevitably died and had to start the whole damn tunnel over. Finally, the last and most glaring problem, especially on that last level, the controls are designed specifically for an XBox controller, definitely not for keyboard and mouse. I had to go out and buy a logitech game controller to actually finish the game, which might not have happened if the tunnel crawling had been introduced and practiced before that last level.\n\nAlso, i want more of the music. It was absolutely beautiful, and props to the company for getting the immensely talented Kokia to do the vocals. That being said, the stylized Middle-Eastern music is just scattered too thin. I would love to be able to complain that the music was too saturated, but most of the soundtracks are 2 minutes or less with no good way to repeat them smoothly. There is only so long that one can listen to laser fire and engine thrusts before wanting to shoot something, and not in the way the game was doing it.\n\nAfter all of that, I would love to have see this fully fleshed out. Some tight corner missions to introduce and teach the concept before going into the ever speeding up final mission would be awesome; longer versions of the musical tracks would be wonderful; and please, PLEASE, air your radio drama DURING the firefight so I (and everyone else) don't have to get bored and see how close to a cruiser I can fly without damaging my shields or hull.\n\nAll in all, I love the game. I just think that those specific pieces of laundry need to be aired.","February 1, 2015","true","29.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, Project Sylpheed came out in America in 2007, and Strike Suit Zero doesn't innovate on it. The one interesting point SSZ does have is the fighter's ability to turn, Macross-style, into a bipedal robot, which is not really a feature in space, where walking around is in no way helpful. It ends up just being a button you press to get the better weapons.\nLastly, the most important criticism: Their missiles have an Itano Circus reference right in the name, but don't do nearly enough to replicate the effect.\n\nI guess you can buy this game if you don't have a 360, if they were going to port Project Sylpheed, they'd have done it already.","August 31, 2014","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Director's Cut improves pacing and voice acting, adds much of the original game's DLC, as well as provides a visual upgrade. However, it is much more demanding on systems and ditches the (rarely used) Steam Workshop support. You're probably better off getting the Director's Cut as a new player (unless your system cannot run it), but veterans of the original probably don't need to double-dip.\n\nStrike Suit Zero is a intense and frantic game with a lot of significant flaws. Controls can feel complex and cumbersome, often akin to patting your head and rubbing your belly as you constantly shift between various weapons systems to chew through energy shields or armor more efficiently, time your EMP to throw off enemy missiles, manage weapon and thruster energy so as not to be left vulnerable while also keeping tabs on numerous objectives, enemy types, and friendlies that need more protection than Slippy ever did. Flipping into 'Strike' mode (AKA Mech mode) is only a temporary respite, cutting your maneuverability and boasting a whole different set of controls that must be mastered to maximize it's enormous firepower. It's overwhelming at times all of the stuff that needs to be kept track of, and the cluttered, boring missions don't help. However, when the game is firing on all cylinders and you get into a stride, there's absolutely nothing like SSZ in the genre that makes you feel like an ace pilot. The climax of one mission, for example, sees you screaming into combat as an outgunned allied battleship is melted, corkscrewing through a swarm of enemy fighters blasting at everything to build up flux in time. From there, you flip smoothly into Strike mode, strafing along the broadside of a massive enemy cruiser mashing turrets and hoping to god your shields can hold on for just a few milliseconds longer before shifting back to fighter mode and wheeling out for another run, eyes constantly watching the armor melting off your allied ship. Moments like these will be among the most memorable moments you can have with this game. Unfortunately, they'll also be peppered with hatred for the accursed bomber missions, long missions of "kill this group of enemies, move, repeat ad nauseam", and the boring story.","August 26, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaign was told a bit differently from the original but that only added context and made the story flow a lot better than before.  Otherwise, the gameplay from the original is the same and still a lot of fun and challenging.","May 7, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll be blowing up so many faceless mooks, you'll forget you're actually killing hundreds of people. Controls are weird and a gamepad is required or else say goodbye to your carpal tunnel.\n\nStory is decent, you really feel like you're crushing a colonial rebellion.  You play as a faceless soldier who just HAPPENS to be the chosen one! Pilot a sweet mech! The Game forces you to pilot things that aren't your mech for some reason!\n\n\nHave YOU ever wanted to fly around space and shoot missles at things?\nTHEN THIS MAY VERY WELL BE THE GAME FOR YOU!\n","June 21, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So, on a whim, I picked up this new dogfighter (because that pre-rendered cinematic trailer was awesoem). And having played it, it's good.\n\nIt's not a prefect game (so very few are), and this one could definitely use a little more work. That said, I would still call it a diamond in the rough. The game starts out fine, and the controls are pretty standard. Forward thrust, back thrust, barrel roll if you don't accellerate while rolling. But it's fun and nice to see a dogfighter again. Added points for the dated transforming ship, once a trope but now a relic.\n\nThe programmers do need to work on a few key details, however. The background radio drama doesn't start up until after you've cleared a wave of baddies, and it forces you to simply keep flying around doing nothing while it carries its tune. Then there's the final level, which goes from an open air game to tunnel crawler rather abruptly with no prior buildup. This is made worse by the fact that you have learn to manuever in tight spaces, but also do it while your ship is constantly speeding up. The radio does take this time to do the story right, so it wasn't a total bust, except when you inevitably died and had to start the whole damn tunnel over. Finally, the last and most glaring problem, especially on that last level, the controls are designed specifically for an XBox controller, definitely not for keyboard and mouse. I had to go out and buy a logitech game controller to actually finish the game, which might not have happened if the tunnel crawling had been introduced and practiced before that last level.\n\nAlso, i want more of the music. It was absolutely beautiful, and props to the company for getting the immensely talented Kokia to do the vocals. That being said, the stylized Middle-Eastern music is just scattered too thin. I would love to be able to complain that the music was too saturated, but most of the soundtracks are 2 minutes or less with no good way to repeat them smoothly. There is only so long that one can listen to laser fire and engine thrusts before wanting to shoot something, and not in the way the game was doing it.\n\nAfter all of that, I would love to have see this fully fleshed out. Some tight corner missions to introduce and teach the concept before going into the ever speeding up final mission would be awesome; longer versions of the musical tracks would be wonderful; and please, PLEASE, air your radio drama DURING the firefight so I (and everyone else) don't have to get bored and see how close to a cruiser I can fly without damaging my shields or hull.\n\nAll in all, I love the game. I just think that those specific pieces of laundry need to be aired.","February 1, 2015","true","29.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game packs ****tons of fun with few cutscenes not dettering from the action. The More adept you get at controlling the dual role controls between a fighter/bomber into your overpowered Mech the better and faster you can be blowing things up like crazy!\n\nI am always immersed in the middle of the fight feeling the bass of missiles making their impacts, watching a soft blinding light as things explode and sometimes getting lost in the dogfights all around me while the sweet ost is gently heard just past all the chaos. Oh, and beautifull graphics babeee\n\nAs for cons, The D3 Controlls can get a little confusing as first as it is definely not something I was used to. Over time ofcourse this should get better. Some levels have a much harder difficulty spike, and this is challenging not uderstanding how to win. If you keep trying the same thing again and again you might get frustrated at your failing strategy.\n\nAll in All, i highly recomend this game if high paced combat, space, or dogfights are your thing. A lack of experience might frustrate you but ofcourse difficulty is needed for a good game. And finally the medals and unlockable upgrades make the game highly replayable.","February 8","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I gotta say, it was definetely worth 6 Euro.\n\nPros:\n-Story is great (Control v2.0 gave me a good laugh, Control V1 was intriguing AF)\n-A total of 4 different endings\n-No DLC hassle\n-Textures are great on my PC (I do not have a direct comparison with the originial, but I do have infinity)\n-Combat system is very enjoyable (Spoiler alert: you WILL see the Itano Circus reference to Macross)\n-The music+good voice acting\n\nCons:\n-No shadows? The upped textures didn't compensate entirely for the loss of shadows. (In comparison to SSI)\n-Repetetive missions\n-Steep learning curve. You really need to practice before you can get the 'STRIKE FAST' achievement.\n\nIf you're very picky:\n-The strike mode (mecha mode) might kill the speed of the game, since you lose all your forward momentum upon transforming.\n\nIn the end, buy this game as long as it's under 10 *whatever your currency may be* :D","March 7, 2015","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
