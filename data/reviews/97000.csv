It's equal parts space physics simulator and arcade game.\n\nI find it very relaxing and entertaining to zip around space, gobbling up asteroids into a giant star-katamari and evolving my planets.\n\nIt's not a perfect game. I wish that there was a better way to battle star-vs-star with the AI. The best strategy I've found for stealing planets is to knock them out of orbit with a shielded planet, then chase them down. This works, but it's very damaging to your suns and planets, and tends not to be worth the effort. The best strategy for growth is roaming about the galaxy looking for free planets and asteroids to grow your system.\n\nNo matter. Solar 2 is not really designed for long-term play. I find it works best to pop in for a while and just knock around a bit. See if you have the patience to develop an 8-star system, for instance.\n\nThe missions offer a nice break to the gameplay, but some are easy and some are very frustrating. It's a mixed bag.\n\nA Multiplayer mode would have been welcome, too. Still, I find little to complain about in Solar 2. It's not perfect, but it is a light and fun sandbox game, which lets you decide how you want to have fun. Try the Demo.","November 4, 2013","true","4.5"," 176 of 192 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","176","192","0","0"

In this interesting take on the "grow bigger" genre you finally can. You begin as a smallest of asteroids and have to hit other asteroids to grow in mass and avoid marauding space ships and anything too much larger in the process. You move with arrows or ASDW (I used keyboard) in a 2D universe, while everything else is dictated by gravity.\n\nAt some point you will grow into a planet. This changes mechanics: no longer will you try to hit stuff but instead try to make asteroids orbit your piece of rock, after which you can absorb them. Mechanics are different for each phase: asteroid, planet, star and black hole. Planet phase is separated into regular and life planets (all with shields, planetary cannons and spaceships).\n\nOrbiting is pseudophysical: that is, not real physics at all. The objects will actually be attached to the orbiting system. You should know that this is not a real physics simulator, so this is totally fine. This makes for some truly bizarre possibilities: you can form multi-star ring systems with ridiculous numbers of stars and yet have aggressively orientated fully evolved killer planets orbiting the system.\n\nStory and achievements provide some 10-20 hours of playtime within three missions and 2-3 challenge mini games for each phase and finally a boss fight. They often make clever use of the game's physics and mechanics. You can also stop anytime you want and the cloud will make sure you can continue from where you left, or if you'd like to, from somewhere entirely different. Playing is very enjoyable and the only time I remember it getting tedious was when I grinded my way to 40 stars supersystem. Fortunately, you can save your favourite configurations (like that one with super-multistar megasystem) to be loaded any number of times again (handy for achievements) and play with physics options if regular pseudophysics gets boring.\n\nOnce you're done with the universe simply grow your planet-eating super-heavy neutron star into an all-devouring black hole and consume the world in a Big Crunch. A fitting end to a crazy little game.","June 11, 2014","true","18.6"," 54 of 60 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","54","60","0","0"

The formula isn't new in itself (if you've played the first evolution level of Spore, Osmos or Flash-game 'flOw', it's basically that idea (bigger consumes smaller), modelled on orbital rotation and gravity.\n\nYou start life as a small bit of rock - a tiny asteroid.  You must smash into other rocks in order to grow.  Grow enough and you will become a barren, rocky planet.  Gather more rocks into your orbit and absorb them for your planet to grow.  When it's large enough, your planet can sustain life (which has benefits and shortcomings - I won't say what as it's a bit of a spoiler).  Once your planet is HUGE, it can become a minor star and draw other planets into its orbit.  Be the biggest solar system.  Become a binary star system.  Become a black hole!  Survive as other systems try to attack your marvellous achievement and turn you back into an empty, tiny planet!  Best of all, you keep that planet or system.  When you reload, you carry on where you left off.\n\nBesides making your own star system, there are objectives to carry out if you wish.  They're fun and challenging, but to be honest I just enjoy making the biggest star system.  The controls are excellent for both keyboard (sorry - no mouse) and gamepad.  A simple concept really nicely executed.  Overall, this is a superb little game and I highly recommend it as one of those time-filling diversions when you don't want to dive into your huge AAA title.","September 29, 2014","true","10.1"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","35","36","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Selenography/recommended/97000/","Selenography","Selenography","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Selenography/","653 products in account","Possibly the smallest game I own, but it packs a bigger punch than that.\n\nSolar 2's main strength is that you can play at your own pace, with your own goals, and that leads to a good few hours that you can spend just bumbling around in space and figuring out what you fancy doing. Going from a tiny asteroid to a black hole? Staying as a solo planet and building up a small armada of ships? Just flying around like a lunatic smashing into stuff and dying repeatedly? All viable playstyles.\n\nIf you want more structure, the story and challenge missions offer a good balance between fun and difficulty, and add considerable longevity to the game. The general idea is to work your way up the planetary body hierarchy - from diminutive asteroid through to planets, stars, star systems and eventually nature's biggest vaccuum cleaner. There are individual missions for each stage of being, some of them simple, others very difficult. I have yet to witness another game that lets you play as the stage itself at a rock concert.\n\nFor a little indie title, there's a surprising amount to do, and while it could perhaps get a little samey after beating everything the game has to offer, there are physics options that you can use to craft a more creative playing experience - like mass space dogfights between hundreds of ships, for instance.\n\nOr, you could just let the cool ambience of the game float you away on a paradoxical vaccuum breeze...","July 5, 2014","true","19.1"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

None of them are particularly interesting, and so there is nothing in this game that is particularly interesting either.","September 24, 2014","false","3.8"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","17","29","0","0"

It can be either relaxing or intense depending on how you decide to play it.  There's a good sense of humour as well.\n\nDrift around the universe free of boundaries and pick up asteroid to form planets.  Evolve your planets enough and you might see intelligent life develop and help you out by attacking invading species for you.  Or if you'd rather, you can just absorb all matter you come across and eventually become a black hole.\n\nThere's also missions you can pick up which usually involve capturing or destroying a certain planet or star nearby, and these can provide some focus for people who aren't accustomed to sandbox games.\n\nIt's well presented and immediately accessible.

A lot. Strap in ladies and gentleman as I take you through this awesome indie space game. I'm going to talk about this game in grave detail and also add stores of my gameplay. I've only played for a couple of hours but the fun is instant. This review is gonna be rather long so if you aren't into long reviews i'll have a summary for you at the bottom :)\n\nFirst finding the game on store: I stumbled across this through looking at my recommended "praise gaben!" and instantly was intrigued by the screenshots and the introduction video; an added bonus was the sweet glorious blue text saying "very postive" this is a must for me as reviews determine whether I buy or not...That's why it is my duty to make reviews for the kind people of the master race so they don't miss out\n\nDownloading/ loading up: Okay let's get back into the review, As soon as solar 2 popped up in my libary I was ready to go, lava lamp setting the mood give a sci-fi feel to my room (I love to get lost in games...setting the scene beforehand helps ;) ) The download was very quick and i was in. You are thrown right into the game with the press of your enter key.\n\nGameplay: You start of as an asteroid with one simple goal...To grow! This is done by travelling at breakneck speeds and colliding with other lonely asteroids...It is a little tricky as the pesky asteroids would move at the last second allowing you to shoot past them with a firm middle finger plaved in their direction. The priciple is the same from there, you collide into asteroid after asteroid until you've gained enough mass to officially be called a planet. This is not good enough however, you must get bigger, stronger and most importantly you want to host life!\n\nFeatures: The main feature of Solar 2 is the life that forms on your planet/planets once you've growed into a big boy planet. You grow to either love or hate these people and trust me you get mixed feelings. You see, once lifeforce has evolved on your planet, this takes a couple of minutes if that, the people of your planet start installing defenses and firing space ships into orbit. These ships often fly behind you or circle around the planet and take down aliens or other planets. The main reason you may grow to hate your people is these ships....yes they are good defense but when you're a planet you still require asteroids to absorb...these ships however destroy most asteroids before you even get to them causing mass frustration...luckily you can full on smash into these little ships teaching them a lesson...as well as exploding them causing insta-death for the ship...but they deserve it! muwahahahaha-sorry\n\nStory time: So he's the little segment I like to call "story time" in which I tell you something that happened to me in my travels through this game...Todays story is about my first time becoming a star... So once you've become a planet that holds life what's next? Well, becoming a star of course. This is where the awesomeness is truely revealed. I named my sun The Milky Sun (Sadly you can't actually name it in-game) and I set off In search for planets to defend me. You see, once you reach star level you need to consume whole planets to progress to the next level but you can also keep some of these planets so life can grow on them to defend you. The first planet I found was a gem, it already had life on it and they were pretty advanced meaning I had a good defensive force. I pet named the planet Milktopia. Now me and milktopia had good travels together, I gathered other planets but always consumed them to become bigger. The story gets interesting when I  became a medium star which can hold 6 planets in orbit; I had all 6, 3 with life, 3 without. Then aliens...flipping aliens surrounded my solar system as I ventured into their teritory. Queue the badass music. 100s of little ships fired out of my 3 advanced planets attacking the alien invaders head on and the cannons based on the planets blasted away. I felt like I could rule the world...galaxy. I was wrong...so so wrong. The aliens kept on attacking and I wandered where they were coming from; I moved to the orgin to find a big ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• star with roughly 10 fully armed civilized planets. My pants filled with crap. I instantly fled but the aliens were stubborn. They kept on sending waves and waves of ships after me. One of planets exploded, then another one by one my planets were dying. I managed to escape as the aliens tired of chasing me...all that remained was my trusty pal milktopia. His life was sort lifed however as I traveled into a asteroid field, milktopia took heavy hits and exploded leaving tears rolling down my face...RIP milktopia RIP\n\nSummary: This game is fricken awesome and if you're a fan of sci-fi or general space game then you should definitely try it. The music also adds to the sweet badass feel and the gamegenerally is relaxing as you drift through space. Controls are really simple even a monkey could play it (no offense)\nPros:\n-Awesome soundtrack and funky, soothing graphics\n-Solid fun gameplay that challenges you (to some extent)\n-Vast galaxy meaning ulimited potential and exploration\n-Cheap price especially on sale or on cheap key websites (don't tell gaben I said that)\nCons:\n-At times the AI aka the ships that defend you can be a little "special" and fly straight into your planet\n-Maybe needs some more features to add to the replay value\n\nHope this review wasn't too long and helped you making your decision. Feel free to add me if you want just message me saying you've seen my review; I'm always looking for some more gaming pals...Peace :)","October 20, 2015","true","1.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","4","5","4","0"

One of the few games I know where going for the achievements is not a bad idea and gives the player some direction. In this sense this game ends up being more of a meta-game and the ending, which was a bit of a surprise, wraps it up well.\n\nNote this is not a game that will appeal to simulation fans.

It's short, the missions aren't that fun and the controls make them awkward, but just crashing around space and working your way up to a blackhole before ending the universe can be an amusing pass time. The art is beautiful, the ambient music is lovely and watching an alien civilisation build itself on your solar system is fun, before you blow them up for fun or use their planet as a bowling ball to blow up a star.\n\nDespite what reviewers said about this being 'unique', it isn't. Such games have been floating around the internet for a long time, crash your rock into smaller rocks or be a fish and eat smaller fish to grow. I think there is one about being a virus or something as well. Most are free flash games or part of the larger arcade-style gaming packs that used to be distributed back in the XP/2000 era.

You begin as a tiny asteroid and you must gradually upgrade it through several planet/star phases before the final stages of your cosmic voyage :   the black hole era. Rival systems you encounter during this epic drifting also evolve as well to more complex entities, and veteran players might try to complete optional challenges - some being utterly strenuous, testing uber patience AND ultra skills alike. Gameplay remains decently fluid throughout, but directional/rotational/gravity effect  speed feel somewhat awkward either via keyboard or controller. Most players will find the learning curve for control mechanics a tad steep..... or let's say though skills are required, it often seems ultra precision doesn't pay off on the other end.\n\nPros: upgrades to space drifting genre nicely presented; cool ways to enhance star systems; neat visuals.\n\nCons: short mandatory voyage next to overwhelming trial and error for optional challenges; move interaction feels awkward.\n\nBottom line: a bit pricey at 10$, but recommended when a deal 50%+.","January 12, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Errrr....\n\n\nI hopped into the world of Solar 2 prepared to have a super fun sandbox experience of messing around with stuff in the big realm of space.\n\nWow that just simply didn't happen.\n\nSolar 2 has fair music, fair sound effects and overall okay design. The sandbox design of it isn't particularly fun. Even if you're trying to build a giant solar system it is not fun.\n\nAll you can do in this game is absorb planets/stars/asteroids in your system and move around. Now that wouldn't be so bad if so much stuff was just so out of your control. Sudden planets out of no where destroy your planets or level down your "evolution" from the next object you could be. I mean you can have your planets and your star(s) and you could suddenly be destroyed by stars, asteroids, planets, evolved life that lives on planets. It would be fun if you weren't always being punished while you're trying to just build your systems. That is what annoys me.\n\nThe missions are okay. They're sometimes a little bit too challenging for the controls or are far too confusing. Some are just plain unfair. And most of the time for combat missions I found that just having a giant system and then saving it to my Solar system files and then proceeding to absolutely brute force my enemy into submission and then reloading the system before I did that is probably the best and easiest way to victory with no damage after the reload.\n\nI really don't like how the game shoves missions down your throat either. My goal in the beginning was to just become the big crunch (a black hole) and eat absolutely everything. But I had to do that with mission markers on my screen that would never go away unless I beat them. I looked for a button to turn those off, but it was nonexistent.\n\nI expected the things you can do, the systems you can create to be much more vast and interesting and expanse with new things to adopt into your system. But really it was just nothing but asteroid, planet, planet with life, and then just stars. It wasn't fun, it was disappointing.\n\nOverall, with such minimal amounts of things to do "sandboxy" wise. It wasn't very fun, the missions weren't fun and pretty much a lot of things weren't fun. Nothing in this game really made me really dislike it except when planets or systems I was working on just get crushed in an instant just because a random solar system came wizzing my way.\n\nOther than that, the game isn't bad. It's just painfully mediocre, but mediocre games can still make you smile, this one though, doesn't. It's just a timesink where you're sinking time just because you have time to kill. It won't make you enjoy your time in it, and if it does. It will be very briefly.\n\n\nI obtained this game for free by winning a giveaway of it on {LINK REMOVED}steamgifts.com. I don't recommend the purchasing of this game at any pricecut.\n\nThank you for reading my review, I hope it is helpful in your decision of buying this game or not. Have a good one.","November 16, 2014","false","5.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leonresevil2/recommended/97000/","leonresevil2","LeonRes [OC]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leonresevil2/","582 products in account","Solar 2 is a simple sandbox with not a lot to keep you compelled. Gameplay revolves around smacking into things to grow (asteroid and black hole stages) or get things in your orbit so you can press some keys to grow (planet and star stages). Missions and challenges play around with these goals, mostly by telling you to avoid contact with most things and not grow.\n\nSome people say that the game is relaxing, and it can be if you don't care about doing anything. If you want to see anything new in the game, you will have to fly through 2D space and hope that the strange physics doesn't impede your progress. I can accept being attacked by spaceships and having to avoid obstacles, but my biggest issue is that pulling an object into orbit has a bad habit of rubber-banding the object into you, reducing your mass. So the method of growing your planet or star can randomly decide to remove your progress just because the programming has clear-cut orbit paths with the first object being yanked to the closest orbit.\n\nEven the black hole stage is underwhelming, HOW could they mess up something that should be total fun to let loose and eat everything! Once you reach black hole stage, other black holes begin to appear, although they never spawned in the previous stages of the game. These other black holes can take objects from you, and if you hit a larger black hole than your own, you are forced to restart the state with no progress. This restart is made more terrible as black holes have a nasty issue of failing to pick up many items. Apparently entire stars and systems can fly around a black hole and not actually be swallowed.\n\nI remember liking this game originally, but I only played for about an hour. The game has definitely become dated and feels especially mediocre now. Controls are weak, physics are annoying, and the gameplay is a repetitious grind full of elements that impede your progress. I believe I got the game for cheap in a bundle, but I wouldn't really recommend it for even $2. It's a time consumer, but similar games could be found for free. I'd recommend just playing a game you know you like, as this won't last long for most players.","November 19, 2014","false","19.8"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","0"

Solar 2 is one of the few games I've bought again on another platform (owned it on the Xbox 360 already).","December 31, 2013","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead, you manually control an asteroid, often in complete defiance of gravity and with no orbit at all.  You smash into other asteroids and get bigger, eventually becoming a planetoid, then a planet, then various phases of stars, and so on.  When you're a planet, your gravity draws asteroids in to become satellites.  When you're a star, you draw in planets which draw in asteroids of their own.  Bigger stars allow for bigger solar systems, and intelligent life can form on any number of your planets and protect you with spaceships.\n\n\nReally it was all basically just the first stage of Spore, set in space.\n\nAnd I can't stop playing","December 25, 2013","true","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game features tones that would remind gamers of Katamari Damashii, the item collecting game featuring a god that simply likes to party. Instead of being on a planet, you play a celestial body and grow from asteroid all the way up to black hole. The game is a sandbox game featuring a series of challenges that the player must complete in order to beat the game. Apart from that, it's fun simply to move through space collecting asteroids, planets and, eventually, other stars and black holes.\n\nOf course, the scale and method of growing isn't entirely accurate to the real universe. That would lead to a less interesting game with much less interaction. However, the game's physics is accurate enough to allow you to simulate orbits of binary star systems, black holes and gravity towing.\n\nThe game's current price of $10 is about right for the amount of play it provides, but it's possible to find other games with a much better ratio of hours of enjoyment to price. If you care about price: wait for a sale; if not: this is a good buy.","January 4, 2014","true","11.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You begin as a simple rock in a field of rocks, your goal is simply to become larger to absorb more asteroids that lay in your path, while avoiding bodies stronger than you. Your controlled asteroid progresses by combining with others until you become a planet, and eventually a series of stars which leads to the point in which you become so massive you become a black hole absorbing anything, save for larger black holes. Eventually you gain enough mass in one singular point until you explode outwards in a 'big bang' and you once again take on the role of a lonely asteroid.\n\nThe focal point in the game I figure is the point where you become a star and are allowed to capture planets which may become massive enough to develop life. The star and life bearing planets share a very interesting paternalistic role. As the center of the solar system you are responsible for their growth until they may accompany you as another star, but in the mean time they give you protection from the various external senient solar systems, conversely you may simply choose to absorb your planets in a pseudo Saturn eating his sons' sort of lifestyle.\n\nThis game is not for the weak-hearted, total war with other solar systems and planets is inevitable, you must succeed in absorbing your foes if you desire to become the sole point of singularity within the universe.","January 4, 2014","true","6.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Never has using the direction keys had this much deciding depth. This might be the only game in which you can meaningfully dance.\n\nAnd the satisfaction once you have reached the peak of your development and things become cosmic...\n\nI bought this for 1.8‚Ç¨ and would recommend it for up to 4‚Ç¨, if you buy cheap like I mostly do, but for a gamer who buys a 50‚Ç¨ game every few months, this game should well be worth 15‚Ç¨ - if you disagree, you should play it for at least 2 hours so that you can see the strategic depth that it can reach. To play systems against each other, to lure attacking aliens against another system, to bump planets away and assimilate them for your own cause, to be so massive that you can drag the whole enemy system into another, to have to take care that you don't accelerate the enemy system too much ... And so many fronts on which you have to care about balance, but in a fun way.\n\nThe first play-through (which took me 50 minutes, and I haven't done any of the "side-quests" yet, which supposedly are quite simple and hence not really mention-worthy) has the very important bonus of "What will happen then?" which the next play-throughs won't have, but I have done a few by now, and it's still a great experience. The depth is really surprising.\n\nThis game is *different*. In a good way. It's not for everyone, as you can see in other reviews.

There are two ways to move: slow and monotonously, meticulously avoiding any stray asteroids in your path, or barreling through space and taking hits like you owe money to Mike Tyson. Even if you try to move at a slow and cautious pace, the orbital strength of other neighboring bodies is often strong enough to pull you in and smash you, and you won't have the momentum to break out of it.\n\nThe minigames are just bad. Either dodge a bunch of things being thrown at you, or don't smack the planets, just the rocks orbiting them.

It's essentially a universe simulator designed like an arcade game rather than a simulator though it still utilizes realistic gravity based on object mass.  It has a thin semblance of a story and missions to play around with along with some special challenges that all take place in the endless space sandbox.  There are different missions for each level of gameplay which must all be completed to play the final mission.\n\nYou start out as an asteroid, colliding into other asteroids to gain mass and eventually turn into a planet.  As a planet you can collect asteroids in orbit and absorb them, but colliding with them damages you.  With enough mass, life will evolve on your planet which shields you, puts up turrets, and launches ships to protect you.  Continuing on, you turn into a star which can pull planets into orbit which themselves can "evolve" into stars to create a multiple star system (up to 100, maybe even more.)  The game lets you save your state and respawn as any of 10 saved states at any time which is enormously useful, especially when you missed a lower level mission after evolving.\n\nGameplay-wise the game is quite intuitive, though some of the controls can be a bit clumsy.  Missions range from easy to quite difficult with the challenges being even harder, though the difficulty can be alleviated by modifying physics options.  Doing this will only give you half credit, however, and not let you play the final mission until you beat them without modifications.  For the greatest challenge, try doing all of the achievements as some of those are quite tricky.\n\nThe bottom line:  This game's quite fun, and it surprised me how much time I put into it.  If you're looking for a fun indie game you can pick up and drop whenever, this is where its at.","March 10, 2013","true","9.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

Beyond the basic main game there are a few "missions" and "challenges" to offer a bit of variety. The missions are being offered and commented by "The Entity", an obnoxious talking MS Paint-tier emoticon and self-proclaimed "God". While these missions do add a bit of a challenge to the game, they have no real replay value. The dialogs ramblings of The Entity add to the feeling of redundancy when repeating a mission.\n\n\nSo, what does this game offer to keep one playing? Grinding. A lot of that.

Everything is out of scale (asteroids are a 3th the size of stars!) and colliding with smaller objects makes you lose mass (???) and the quests are just the same bucket full of WTF with things like having to steal a 'swipe card planet' for a bank heist and destroying a planet 'because it is full of skunks'. And jeez are they hard (as in impossible hard), for example; in the one for the bank heist you need to have a star exactly the right size (not too big nor too small) in order to steal the planet and the game does not inform you of this and when you finally manage to steal the planet the game instantly spawns 500 enemy ships (NOT HYPERBOLE!) right on top of you and they destroy you and the planet in a second, in fact the entire game is unreasonably hard because unless you're an asteroid or a black hole then the entire game is about dodging everything on the screen and the only way you can grow is by getting something smaller to orbit around and then consuming it and the orbiting mechanic doesn't work right because sometimes you catch an object that's far away when you're just casually flying by and sometimes you just keep floating parallel to an object for 10 seconds or more and instead of orbiting you it just crashes on your planet/star and shrinks or kills it.\n\nAnd the worst part is that this game's price tag is too high given the amount of content in it (it took me only less than 2 hours to finish even though I died and restarted a lot).

So, armed with my little experience wiht this game, I decided to write a review, telling others why Solar 2 is not that good a game and is not worth a great deal of money.\n\nFirst of all, one of the most important mechanics in a game to make it fun to play are the controls, the perfectly sensitive mouse controls and their transition to controller in the indie masterpiece Jamestown being a prime example of this. However, this game begins with you controlling a meteorite drifting through space. 'An intersting concept,' I hear you utter towards your monitor, 'I would like to see how this game would work.' The game has you control the meteorite with a mouse, which is probably the best way to control something like this, begging the question, 'How did they get it so wrong?'\n\nYour meteorite ends up shooting through space at rediculous speeds (where did its inertia come from? I don't know, but that's only part of my point) and stopping is virtually impossible. Velocity is not controllable, and you end up staying at a constant speed. Then, a mysterious voice asks you to do certain tasks, such as 'Helping your metorite friend become a meteor' by colliding it into other rocks. Again, I hear you saying: 'This is interesting Portal style humour, this could be my cup of tea after all!' Trust me, it isn't, as the preciseness required to complete this mission is unachieveable at the speeds you are travelling at and with the sloppy mouse controls.\n\nNow, one mission seems a bad thing to put a game down on, but all the missions require the same amount of accuracy that is just impossible to achieve. Some missions also repeat themselves throughout the game, and, if you were to 'die',  you are spawned in a random position, meaning you could spawn next to an √ºber-powerful enemy, and 'die' once again instantly, or spawn literally minutes of game time away from any missions, planets or any sort of civilization.\n\nThis is not a review saying 'This is not my kind of game'. Instead, it is saying avoid this game at all costs. My point in that statement being if you saw a review saying 'It's not my kind of game, but others might enjoy it' on games such as Air Control, Ride to Hell: Retribution, Towtruck Simulator 2015, Ashes 2012 and Dungeon Keeper Mobile, would you buy it? In the same way, avoid Solar 2, as you may well soon see it in a list among those 'games'.\n\nLuckily, I recieved this game in a Humble Bundle, so I didn't pay full price for it. Please do not pay full price for this atrocity.","October 12, 2014","false","0.2"," 0 of 19 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","19","0","1"

You control an asteroid in a 2D sandbox universe. By bumping into other asteroid, you can grow to planet size. You can even have a life form in your planet if you grow it big enough. Though it serves only as an automatic self defense from celestial forces.\n\nFrom then on, you can do whatever you want. Slam into other solar system, capture lots of asteroid to orbit your small planet, become a black hole to wreck the universe, anything. You feel that the universe is truly alive and the game mechanics are fluid. The gravity is really the main hook of this game in my experience. It was fun to become a big star and bend planets and asteroids to slam at each other.\n\nThe art-style and the music is well merge into the game's atmosphere. The background can immerse you into the world as the music gently soothing your mood in the game.

You control an asteroid in a 2D sandbox universe. By bumping into other asteroid, you can grow to planet size. You can even have a life form in your planet if you grow it big enough. Though it serves only as an automatic self defense from celestial forces.\n\nFrom then on, you can do whatever you want. Slam into other solar system, capture lots of asteroid to orbit your small planet, become a black hole to wreck the universe, anything. You feel that the universe is truly alive and the game mechanics are fluid. The gravity is really the main hook of this game in my experience. It was fun to become a big star and bend planets and asteroids to slam at each other.\n\nThe art-style and the music is well merge into the game's atmosphere. The background can immerse you into the world as the music gently soothing your mood in the game. It's overall a relaxing sandbox simulation of a universe.\n\nI highly recommend this for those who search for a non-rage inducing game and in need of relaxing game after a long day.

It's an atmopheric, arcadey, sciencey, surprisingly deep experience full of challenges and emergent gamepley.\n\nYou start as a lowly asteroid and through physics and gravity, you collide your way to a planet.  When your planet becomes big enough (by absorbing more asteroids), it can harbor life.  Eventually, you gain enough mass to implode into a star.  You may then harbor a number of planets, with or without life.  All the while, the life on your planets evolve into space-faring societies willing to die to protect you.  You grow into multi-star systems and beyond, taking on challenges along the way from another interdimensional being like yourself.\n\nSound strange?  Yeah.  It does, but it works.  It exists somewhere between dreamily zen-like to frustratingly difficult.  But it's always interesting and engaging.  The only downside is that it doesn't last long enough.  There is more potential from a game like this, but it will easily earn you 10-20 hours of entertainment.","December 23, 2013","true","31.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have a lot of time to kill on your hands, this game is for you. You start off as an astroid then build yourself up to a planet, then a planet with life (you gain a shield, self defense turrets and fighting ships) and you can battle other planets by floating by ahaha. Soon after you can evolve (if you choose) to become a small star, then medium, large, nebula star. If you gain enough mass from sucking in planets you can become a black hole... The ending is for you to figure out. You can do missions too given by a "voice (it's in text)". Also as I mentioned about the life planets earlier. You can become a star and grow/catch floating planets around you to form a solar system full of life planets and battle other floating life systems.

While the game can become frantic and difficult, cruel even at times. For the most part it's a relaxing game and flying around, absorbing stuff to make yourself bigger. There's a little strategy involved but mostly the game is simple enough that you can just enjoy playing in this sandbox when the mood takes you.\n\nI only wish that a sequel had come out that built on what was here as the mechanics of the game play and the idea for the game itself are both very strong but let down by their not really being as much depth as you might hope. I've never come across anything since this game that scratches the same itch, it's certainly unique in that respect and I suspect that also will make it a bit of a niche title that won't appeal to everyone.\n\nBottom line, when I first came across this game, I quickly moved past it, I kinda guessed it was sort of an asteroids like clone and didn't want anything to do with it. I later got the game in a bundle and just put it on for the hell of it. Hours were lost to it over days, weeks and months and I wonder just how many odd little games there that I miss.

You can't take your hand off the helm at any time, cause there's always aliens (Nomads) out to blow you or your system up, other systems to wipe out, or steal their planets, and even creating a multi-star system for yourself.  Takes time, but do it right, and your system will be the strongest.  Then evolve into a Black hole and nuke everything :)","July 2, 2011","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a known fact that I'm a sucker for sandbox games and this one is a true shining example of one of those :)   There's no real learning curve to speak of.  You can pretty much jump right in and have a solid idea of what to do.  You discover everything along the way and what naturally comes to mind is usually the exact right thing to do.  A prime example of a game that is easy to pick up, but quite difficult to truly master.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty chill ambient which reminds me of Loscil or the music from Osmos.  Graphics are nice and glowy/shiny albeit simple, and the controls feel very natural.\n\nI highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys sandbox style games.

Don't get me wrong, it was worth the amount I paid for it and enjoyed playing it while i did, but it's not a game that has lasting appeal.  It's pretty straight forward and without the achievements to strive for it can seem a bit repetitive.  The biggest suggestion i could make for people who purchase this game is to actually fly around and do the quest hubs, the commentary system involved with it is worth the extra time.","June 21, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Starting out as an asteroid you're tasked with colliding with other asteroids to form a planet. As a planet, asteroids can orbit around you and eventually, once you get big enough, you can even support life that will defend you from other planets. If you keep on growing you'll form a star until you get so big that you collapse in on yourself and form a black hole that can in turn consume the entire galaxy. Of course if that doesn't already sound fun enough there are a number of interesting missions that set up a number of cool scenarios all leading to a very inception themed ending.

It reminds me a bit of Osmos, in that you can absorb smaller items to become larger.  However, this game is less structured than Osmos, in that the game isn't divided into levels (not a bad thing).  Different activities are available at the different size levels (asteroid, planet, star, black hole).  It also has the added twist that your planet(s) can "evolve" life once they become large enough, and it's great fun to see a fleet of friendly ships defending your solar system from an enemy fleet (though you have no control over the ships, other than that they try to stay near their planet(s).\n\nThe player may choose to play in a calm, relaxed, explore the universe manner.

While you do this, try to avoid being destroyed by\n"bigger fishes". If you get big enough, you will become a black hole.\n\nThe only drawback is that the longevity is somewhat limited. Initially the game is very funny, but after going from asteroid to a black hole for a few times it becomes a bit repetitive.\nA number of funny missions help keeping the game fresh though.","March 28, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You start as an asteroid, but you can evolve to a planet, a star, and a black hole. The constants are the same, but the mass of these objects affect the way the environment interacts with you and between them. And that is the base of the game. You can explore as much as you want, and it's fun discovering how the next object works. And you also have missions, those being more challenging. And beating the game unlocks god options, allowing you to tweak the experience almost at your will, feeling like a god. The art is cool, and the soundtrack is amazing for a indie game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKing4562/recommended/97000/","TheKing4562","Ammy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKing4562/","229 products in account","A game where you play as a sentient space mass that roams the galaxy in a sandbox type of way. You start out as asteroid that can magically move around using some short unknown force, your 1st goal is to build mass to progress into latter stages of space mass ingame. You progress into planet which eventually leads into being different stages of stars until you each being a ‚ÄúBlack Hole‚Äù. After being a becoming a black hole, you get to suck up the galaxy and other blacks holes you‚Äôve meet along the way until you reach critical mass, this is the technical ending to the game but there is still more to be done.\n\nAfter unlocking all the stages of being space mass (which you can now access at any time), you can now tackle the missions within the game which mostly involve doing stupid tasks for the ‚ÄúAll mighty being‚Äù of the universe. (There are also survival challenges which I still need to dip into)\n\nThe graphic quality of this game is very well done for the time when it was made (expect really good space backgrounds) and the gravity/physics engine functions more or less what you can expect from being in space. The physics engine has less effect on you though (by default) to prevent you from getting frustrated by being so easily suck up/destroyed by bigger masses than you. (Yes, you can mess around with the gravity properties after a certain point ingame if you want to)\n\nProbably the game‚Äôs biggest selling point or what I think is the most wonderful thing in this is the soundtrack. IMO It perfectly captures what a space theme soundtrack should be\nhttps://youtu.be/hJusXaPHLcU Although some of the soundtrack additions are better than others, there are enough goodies in there to warrant ripping the OST from the game files and listening to it when you need to kill some time.\n\nAs to go for buying this game, I would personally price it around getting it around at least < $7 sale, on the bearing on how good it is for what you are spending.","August 29, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
