Awesome and hectic top-down shooty action.  Bright colours, a good sense of humour and an utterly fantastic chiptune soundtrack from Syphus, this is not one to miss.\n\nLevels are randomly generated, and get larger as you progress.  Lots of unlockable 'grenades' with all kind of effects from standard explosions, to healing and teleportation.  Adjusting your approach on the fly based on what grenades you have is great fun.\n\nIt's kind of a shame the controller support is only sorta-implemented though.","October 22, 2013","true","6.1"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Is it any good ? Yes. Yes, it is. Is it the best one so far ? No.\n\nIt's an indie game with a cute, retro look. And since it's an indie game, you can't really compare it to the bigger (retail) titles, qualitywise. That doesn't mean it isn't any good though.\n\nSo, like practically all twin stick shooters, you just run around with your crew and kill enemies and objects. Destroying stuff will earn you XP, credits and grenades, which you can use to eventually upgrade your grenades or buy reinforcements when necessary. Grenades are actually an important part of the game. Almost every enemy leaves behind a random grenade. These range from healing grenades to missile grenades, and they're fun to use and the key to success as the missions get increasingly harder.\n\nMissions are randomly generated, maps as well. But the designs are so similar that it's hardly noticeable. It will keep you coming back though.\n\n[Rating: 71/100]","February 25, 2012","true","0.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I don't see much replayablity here.\n\nThe soundrack was fantastic, graphic style was nice but that's not really enough.","January 30, 2014","false","1.9"," 22 of 38 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","22","38","0","0"

Tough enemies and gigantic explosions provide ample difficulty, but it's the relatively strict time limit that makes Pineapple Smash Crew the game that it is. The player is forced to develop an efficient strategy and work quickly to accomplish objectives, though the temptation to wander and collect the loot necessary to level up can at times be overwhelming. Randomly generated levels and three modes of difficulty provide some amount of replayability and variety, but realistically, you'll probably only get a few hours out of this game before the whole thing starts to get stale. Still, I can see this game becoming a fun diversion to revisit on occasion.","January 30, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's featured in the game's trailer.\nThe game itself is simple and fun, but I wish that in some capacity that it were more difficult, or that like the Giantbomb.com crew, there were more default weapons besides the regular gun. The grenades are fun, but sometimes the delay in tossing more than one makes it feel like doing combos, as the trailer suggests, doesn't quite work out? It still works. It's just that this game can be so fast-paced that you'd expect to be able to toss out all four grenades in a pinch.\nThe visuals are cool. The SFX are pleasing. The game itself though.. It's good to pick up once in a while.\nIt needs more boss types, sadly.\nI doubt I'll pick it up after they add achievements since I've never been one for hunting them too much, unlike in the game Bastion, where the narrator will often reward you for 100%-ing various portions of the game with a new piece of dialogue.","February 9, 2012","false","3.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game has more personality, gameplay and joy in it's measley 15mbs then some games manage in 15gbs. It's a case of the easy to learn, hard to master trope when it comes to employing the different types of grenade to their most devasting effects and getting used to the dynamic behaviour of the humble yet ever present explosion. However even the simplest of lucky shots or corner rebounds are satisfying thanks to the bright effects and puddles of pixelated mush enemies leave behind.\n\nIt is not the deepest game, but highly satisfying and perfect for either one quick mission or an hour or two of blasting your way through wrecked ships.","February 4, 2012","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The game relies on random level design to keep things interesting, but the level randomizer just isn't up to the task -- by the time you finish a campaign, you will feel like you've replayed the same level several times over, rearranged slightly. All levels are subject to a time limit, which is more annoying than invigorating. The RPG elements (equipment, levelling) help somewhat, but they don't have sufficient influence to significantly change gameplay, nor are there enough options to keep things interesting.","June 28, 2014","false","3.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

The engine sure as hell feels nice to handle, easy  and a pleasure to use  and I would wager that they have play tested this pretty decently,\n\nIt seems a simple game, but apart from when it becomes harder in the later levels (and perhaps hard difficulty) the effort to kill things and to frag your way through level feels what I would describe as 'Pleasantly taxing' and the action is quite enjoyable.\n\nThe grenade system is infact one of the best aprts of this game, as the guns are not upgradeable (whcih this game could benfit from having) and can be a bit boring to use ALL the time;  the grenades on the other hand add a very nice amount of variety and fun.  You can create combos, set up multikills and manipulate your enemy fatally, which is seldom seen in many games, and I think that was the best part of Doom, where enemies could be manipulated to kill each other and die at your environment's hands, not yours(at least directly)...\n\nThe decor at time does change,  but subtly, although the random generated levels are different and many levels dont look EXACTLY alike with all the differnet layouts and wall design(which normally consist of different colour schemes)(reminds me alot of Phantasy Star II actually:) )).. The props themselves consist of a set of doors and a number of crates, although many of them can be used to blow up and evaporate your enemy which is anotehr  good thing.  Generally everything here is quite simple, though not TOO simple.\n\nThe sound is retro style, although the guns and explosions are satisfying enough, but the music side of things really good... I remember watching a You tube vdeo of Total biscuit talking about another game... and mentioning Syphus; and I totally agree that the drum and bass influenced electronica (or chiptune as I read in other places) really is nice and a pleasure to listen to, making the most frantic levels throughly enjoyable! I like electronica and DnB  so I really enjoyed his wall to wall sound and elaborately colourful melodies :3\n\nAll in all I was not inpressed at first but got a bit hooked.. I may return to play this again, perhaps for 10-20 mins a time inbetween other things, as that is possible with this game... Don't overlook this game if at first it seems boring, as there is much more of worth in there; which is pretty good for what is essentially a simple game.\n\n\n\n","June 22, 2015","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It breaks any enjoyment by forcing your to fly through everything.\n\nUpdate: Will change to a Yes, but it is still greatly dissappointing the higher difficulties are behind a stupid time limit. Later levels give a great feel of being 'busy', frantically moving to avoid shots, switching aim non-stop, and keeping your brain busy with the peripheral of the incoming fire. A little bit of Cannon Fodder with a lot of top down shooter thrown in the game is fun.\nI would have liked to seen the leveling system expanded on. Right now all I see is increased armor for each level. It also needed control over the grenades. Should be able to choose/prioritize which type you want, what character picks up what kind (eg, always have someone pick up a heal). Even 4 hotkeys for characters equipped nades would be nice. Having to switch character to then throw is unnecessary.\nSo far I have ignored upgrading to new nades just to keep the game predictable without having to pay so much attention to whatever I happen to have equipped at that moment. In fast situation you can hurt yourself a lot by tossing a nade into a pile and expecting one effect but getting another when guys pick up random nade types.\n\nI would love to see the dev return to this game for a sequel and expand on its depth. There is still very little of this type of game available.","July 26, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
