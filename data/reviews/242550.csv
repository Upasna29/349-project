Each of the levels are hand drawn and beautiful to look at. Despite not being overly impressive on a technical level, Rayman uses a timeless style. While games like Crysis 3 probably won’t look that great 10 years from now, Rayman Legends will no doubt retain its charm.\n\nThe game also has multiple characters to choose from along with a host of unlockables. There are underwater stealth missions, time trials, and even musical stages where you jump to the rhythm of remixed popular songs. The inclusion of daily and weekly challenges allows you to compete with your friends, adding tons of re-playability.\n\nIf you enjoyed classic 2d platformers like Super Mario World and Donkey Kong Country, you should check out Rayman Legends as it’s the closest thing to them in this day and age.\n\nFor a more detailed review, here’s a video my friend and fellow reviewer Trent uploaded:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=195783687\n\nRayman Legends also made our list for The Top 35 Games of the Generation.

Taking Rayman back to the drawing board, Ubisoft and series creator Michael Ancel took the bold decision to steer the series back to its 2D roots with the introduction of a new framework called UbiArt that simply has to be seen to be believed. Through the use of UbiArt - Rayman Origins became the closest game this past generation to get the actual look and feel right of a Disney movie or cartoon come to life. It was also a wise decision because it helped differentiate the new game in a 3D platform dominated AAA arena.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=340572257\nWith its tight, razor-like controls harmoniously married to the games increasingly frantic series of precise jumps, runs, kicks, swings, slaps and air glides, Rayman Origins was an absolute delight to play and a joy to handle despite almost reaching Super Meat Boy levels of frustration towards the end. So... after years of roaming the platform desert (where many a failed platform hero is sent out to die) the genre suddenly had a new unsung hero. Had Rayman finally arrived at the gates of Mount Mario ready to take his place in the pantheon of platforming gods?\n\nEverything about this sequel is larger, funnier, livelier and more joyous than the first. It's also bat-♥♥♥♥ crazy in the same way one would expect an asylum to be when that asylum has been taken over by the nut hounds themselves. Legends goofy story pretty much picks up where Origin left off with our friends once again awakening from another 100 year slumber only to find out that the mad magician from the previous game has split into five dark magicians who are once again running amok releasing nightmares of all kinds into the Glade of Dreams and its mythical lands beyond.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=227755791\nYet again, the nightmares and the magicians have gone on to capture all of the teensies along with the 10 princesses that rule this delightfully wacky world and it's once again left up to Rayman and his mad, zany cohorts to save the day. Like Origins - the game starts out deceptively easy but ramps up the difficulty pretty fast becoming rather super-duper difficult towards the end and will rely on lots of precision timing in order to complete. You will need pixel perfection to complete this adventure and if you don't mind that, you are going to have a blast and some seriously good laughs along the way.\n\nI really admire Michael Ancel and the team he put together to create this platforming adventure. The levels of creativity on display in Legends far surpasses the surprise and wonder from Origins as they disassemble the traditional platformer yet again and in the process create what I now consider a platforming masterpiece. Coupling this with some of the most intensely satisfying level design and music they really have gone on to create last generations platforming masterpiece. If platformers get any better than this - please direct me to it because quite frankly this is the new gold standard in my books.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=340572690\nIf I have one gripe - its a large one but thankfully the games generous and loving heart is so huge it has swayed me not to deduct from my personal rating - is that is still does not offer online co-op. In this day and age this is a major oversight on Ancel and his teams part. I would want nothing more than to experience this zany adventure with some of my close friends who don't happen to be sitting on the couch with me but alas I can't. Like the Lego games from Traveler's Tales this repeated oversight is starting to make them look like stick-in-the-mud's and I hope that with the next release they seriously consider making this an option because I won't be so kind the next time around. If you are a platformer, cartoon or - hell, even humorist enthusiast you owe it to yourself to own this game immediately.\n\nWelcome to the pantheon Rayman - your seat is the one next to the Italian Plumber with the red hat!\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","February 22, 2014","true","21.7"," 110 of 140 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","110","140","2","2"

Whenever people hear "greatest platformer ever" people always point at the original Mario games, Super Mario Galaxy, etc. However, this easily joins among their ranks.\n\nThis game is a breath of fresh air in the platformer genre. Along with its counterpart Rayman Origins (which I have also beat), they are both really refreshing platformer games because of their unique style, in graphics, gameplay, and level design.\n\nFirstly, the game is visually stunning. The game uses an engine called the "UbiArt" engine, which is used to easily animate any image. The animations in this game are flawless given the many different movements that Rayman can use. Plus, the game feels INCREDIBLY smooth, and there are no visual flaws whatsoever. If I was to ever to die in this game, I cannot fault the game for choppy frame rate... I always blame myself!\n\nSpeaking of which, the game has a difficulty balance that can accomodate both new players and old players. Some levels can be a breeze, but then others you can die A LOT, especially some of the later levels.\n\nThe level design is really good. Like most platformers, each world typically has a "theme". In my personal opinion, I believe that the "Fiesta de Los Muertos" world in Rayman Legends is the best, clearly because the level design is so great in every single level (if you play the first level at the world, you will see exactly what I mean). What a lot of platformers truly fail at achieving is creating MEMORABLE levels, and Rayman Legends has at least a few memorable levels that will be stuck in your head. Even the boss battles are really great!\n\nThe gameplay is also really addicting, with plenty of different moves to learn. This can range from a series of simplistic punches, all the way to cartwheels (a slightly more advanced move). While the objective is to complete a level, there is also a ranking for each level to grab a both a certain number of lums and "teensies". Lums, unlike the last game, are accumulated and can be used to unlock new variants of characters. Plus, lucky tickets unlock plenty of different things, including updated Rayman Origins levels!\n\n...and the multiplayer...oh my....the multiplayer is GOLDEN!!!! This game easily has the most fun local multiplayer in a long while! The multiplayer is perfect for anybody, whether you want to play seriously or if you want to troll your friends. :)\n\nAnother memorable part of the game, even though it is not as prominent, would be the soundtrack. The soundtrack really compliments the game in different ways, and I had a couple of tunes stuck in my head. Overall, the game can last you quite awhile, maybe about 15-20 hours to complete everything (depending on how good you are). What can also add to the length would be the daily and weekly challenges, where you can REALLY hone your skills.\n\nThere are a few flaws, given the overall grand scheme of things, but hardly hold this game back from sheer greatness. I think that there should  have been more minigames along with "Kung Foot" because "Kung Foot" isn't necessarily my favorite part of the game. Also, I think that there are also too many "clone" characters (variants of Barbara in particular).\n\nTo whomever might read this review, I would not even hesitate getting this game. Play it and love it! You won't regret it!","December 19, 2014","true","6.7"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/242550/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Rayman Legends is just so much better than Origins. I remember talking, erm.. not so positive,.. about Origins. aside from the wonderful, colorful graphics. Well, let me say that Legends is a bigger and better game in every way; customization, unlockables (oh man, they keep on coming), secrets; there seems to be much more variety this time around and I couldn't recommend this game more.\n\nThere are 6 worlds to be completed, with the last one being more of a bonus world. Each world has about 8 to 10 levels, and each level could you take at least 5 minutes to complete. So it's a big game. Add even more secret and unlockable levels to that number and you know why it's called Legends.\n\nEach of the first 5 worlds end with a musical level where you just run, punch and avoid enemies based on the music. It's brilliant and it works very well. In general there's much more variety gameplay wise as well, with the aforementioned musical levels but there are also stealth levels, and levels where you have to rely on a (CPU controlled) co-op partner.\n\nThe animations and graphics are top notch. Rarely have I been as impressed with 2D visuals as I've been with the last few Rayman games. No words can describe how this game looks and plays, you really have to witness it for yourself. This is art !\n\nBy the way, the boss fights aren't as frustrating as the ones in Origins. There was only one boss that, in my opinion, was more of a trial-and-error boss fight, the rest of them could easily be beaten the first time around, if you pay enough attention.\n\nRayman Legends surprised me in a big way and I'm saddened to hear that it didn't sell all that well.

Taking mechanics that worked from the first title and buffing them to a mirror finish, and then introducing new ideas to make it original.\n\nFor me, Origins was a really, really fun and solid game and a great return to form for the Rayman franchise. I've sunk many hours (three digits) into it and, despite not being the completionist type, have been pushed to try quite hard to do so by it's captivating art and great soundtrack, plus pile of content. With Legends, Ubisoft has managed to recreate this gem, but better. It's as simple as that.\n\nThe UbiArt engine is slick at all times and always stable, the game is even prettier then the first and, somehow, even more tuneful. I haven't anything to complain about yet, except perhaps that it's not occasionally as brutal as Origins in spots, but there's always plenty more in the game, and I haven't even mentioned the online challenges yet where the player competes against a global leaderboard.\n\nIf you like platformers, you'll probably love this game. It's fast, it's competitive and is sensibly integrated into online challenges, and doesn't suffer very much from being originally WiiU exclusive. It's my favorite game of 2013 (previously a title given to Revengeance), and a perfect 10 in my books.\n\nI do recommend picking up Origins before this one if you're a newcomer to the franchise, though.

They're such a nostalgia blast, taking me back to the old days where I was parked on the living room floor, 5 ft. from the TV trying master that epic double jump without falling in the hole for the 10th time in a row.  Rayman Origins came along and proved that that old school platforming action could still be viable, fun and challenging.  Now, Rayman Legends has managed to come along and actually improve on the foundation that Origins laid!\n\nRayman Legends packs a ton of fun in one single package.  You have unlocks to collect, in the form of lums, characters, monsters and even old Origins levels.  You have challenging platformer action.  You have varied platformer action!  You have a great sense of humor.  You have a great art style to make it all shine.  It's really great.\n\nSometimes, games of these types reach a point where the game becomes too difficult.  It makes the experience nothing but frustrating and then the fun falls off fast.  Even Origins suffered from this from time to time.  In Legends, they've managed to find a perfect balance in the difficulty.  Most maps are challenging, without becoming anger inducing.  You might have to take two or three tries and a particular jump, but the pattern will click.  These types of games can also suffer from repetition, but Legends break that up as well.  You'll find the puzzle style changing from level to level, even within the same groups, keeping the game feeling fresh and entertaining.\n\nBeyond all the platformer action, I'm really impressed with the style and art direction going on in the game.  The end levels in each section doing something really great in how the tie in the games music with the game play.  This really stood out when I was playing a boss level to a Rayman-esque rendition of Ram Jam's "Black Betty".  As I came to obstacles, it because clear my jumps were timed to the drum beat of the song.  As you progressed, hearing that familiar back beat, you noticed the entire level was timed to it.  I couldn't help by smile and play the level over a couple times, just to marvel at the fun of it all.  They do this on every level and it's an attention to detail that you don't see to often!\n\nSo, should you snag Rayman Legends?  Yes.  Yes you should.  Don't even debate it.  Really, this game is worth it at any price.  Definitely bring your game pad though, I can't imagine pulling this game off with a keyboard and mouse.\n","June 27, 2014","true","8.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

It has got bright colorful graphics, great controls, interesting level design and it offers a good level of challenge without being unfair or frustrating, something Rayman Origins often missed the mark on.\n\nThe main part of game world is divided up into 5 different paintings, each with 9-10 levels based on different theme.  The paintings all end with a boss and a musical level, where the action in the level follows the background music. I loved the musical levels and I wish there were more of them. There is an extra unlockable painting that let’s you play the musical worlds again with added challenges, but it is basically the same level.\n\nThe game has tonnes of content with invaded levels, daily/weekly challenges, and you can unlock most of the levels from Rayman Origins. You certainly get your money’s worth here.\n\nHonestly the only caveat for this game is Uplay...I have had issues with it in the past and I know many people continue to even today.\n\nTo Ubisoft’s credit, over the last 3-4 years they have taken Uplay from being an unusable piece of malware to more of an annoyance. So let’s give them credit for that, I guess…\n\nMy advice is just log into the Uplay application once, set it to offline and never, ever, touch it again.","March 6","true","24.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

There’s a huge amount of levels to play, and since you aren’t restricted in playing all of the worlds in order, you are given a lot more freedom to tackle levels! The return of 4-player co-op is good fun, although it quickly devolves the game into a chaotic mess, so completionists are better off playing alone (Which is still fun!).\n\nGameplay for the most part, is as refined as Rayman Origins. The controls are responsive, and your moveset is versatile but simplistic enough that you are given a lot more control. It’s actually really difficult to talk about this game because of how perfect controlling the characters is. The physics, the button layouts, it just feels so natural. However, for keyboard players, I highly recommend picking up a controller to play this game, as with other platformers.\n\nThe newest mechanic in Legends is of course, Murphy. By the press of a button, you can have him slap switches, tickle enemies, and cut ropes. For the most part, however, Murphy’s only included in some of the levels, which I’m perfectly fine with because Murphy feels heavily gimped from the Wii U version.\n\nAs someone who’s 100% complete the game on Wii U, I’ve noticed huge differences between this version and the Wii U one as well. For one, there’s no 5 player co-op, or the ability to have complete control over Murphy. Both versions seem to trade one thing for another; The Wii U version allows complete control at the cost of not having direct control over your player in single-player mode, and the PC version lets you control your character, but have more limited control when it comes to Murphy. A good middle between the two would had fixed the problems, but both versions are stuck with the levels containing Murphy being either a slog or being quite the unintentional challenge when speedrunning/completing comes to play.\n\nThe reason why Murphy levels feel weird in the PC version is because they were designed to be slow-paced, which makes them unintentionally more difficult now that you have full control over your character and can freely run.\n\nThe game includes a wealth of side-modes to play, and while they aren’t anything to write home about, they are nice additions. Challenges make for a unique set of leaderboard challenges that’s constantly reset weekly (although a lot of the challenges are the same things from past rotations and can get repetitive), and Kung Foot is an insane blast to play. However, the addition of a XP bar to lock challenges and the “Creatures” addition seem to be completely unnecessary, and only serve to make 100%ing this game feel more like a chore. Also, Online Multiplayer would had really helped when it came to modes like Kung Foot, because I can’t really get my friends together all the time to play it.\n\nPresentation-Wise, Rayman Legends nails it. While I like the more zany look of Rayman Origins, Legends polishes up the artstyle to look completely unique and beautiful. When certain enemies or objects are shown as a 3D model, it doesn’t look odd or unusual, making it a solid blend of 2D and 3D visuals. It’s music is a joy to listen to, despite being dangerously close to being generic medieval fare. The UI mostly doesn’t distract the player, although the constant in-game notifications definitely are annoying.\n\nSo how’s the PC version of the game? Surprisingly good! I managed to get it running 60fps on my laptop (which seems to like running games at terrible framerates), and it’s been doing superb for me on my main PC (to no surprise). If you have a low-end computer, you should give it a shot, it isn’t as intensive as it looks.\n\nUnfortunately, the game requires uPlay (which is weird because Rayman Origins didn’t!), and it’s as big of a mess as always.\n\nTL;DR - Rayman Legends is a fantastic platformer with splendid controls, tons of bonuses, and a stellar presentation. It’s still my GOTY of 2014!\n\n\nFor more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!","April 15","true","8.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

If you like Jump'n'Runs / Platformers you really should give it a try.  I managed to collect all possible 700 Teensies and I never had the feeling that I have to go on just to finish it, which sadly happens too often to me nowadays. I think it's easier than Rayman: Origins, which could be seen as one of the few cons. Especially the Back to Origins levels felt less challenging than the originals.\nThe art-design is superior and the graphics look just great. It's crazy, bright and funny, but not too childish to be not appealing to mature audiences. Surely, you have to like that type of style and humor. The same goes for the sound, great work!\nThe levels are greatly designed, not too long not too short and enough variety to keep it fun to play. It has challenging parts, which never are too hard and can always be mastered with some tries. Fortunately, the checkpoints are set really fair, perhaps making it a bit too easy.\nThe music-levels are a highlight of the game, you run through a level to a song, while your jumping, attacking and the whole level architecture is timed to and built for the music.\nThe daily and weekly challenges are nicely made and keep you going after you finished the rest of the game.\nI haven't played it with local multiplayer, but that also looks fun.\nWhile the game is such a great one and really conquered the throne of 2D-Jump'n'Runs for me, the only really big letdown is the usage of Uplay. Since you can buy it on Steam, why the hell do I have to use Uplay for online features. I can't even change my username! Sadly, I realized this after I connected Rayman: Legends and Farcry3 to it, with something like: username: uplayaccount … -.-\n\nConclusion\n*Story: Well this is not the biggest part of the game, it's OK, nothing special but it doesn't need to be.\n*Gameplay: Great! Fluid controls, impressive varied levels, lots of stuff to unlock, online challenges\n*Graphics&Sound: Superior! I really love that style, not too childish but funny and crazy\n\nI give it 95 out of 100\n\nSide note: I played the game with maximum graphics fluidly and with a controller.","December 27, 2013","true","26.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

The vector graphics are back and look prettier than ever, there is the addition of a sidekick as well to help you get through some levels.\nThere is a lot to do in this game, each level has 10 teensies to find (The little blue guys), as well as the challenge to find enough lums (The yellow flying guys) to earn the Gold trophy. There are also unlockable characters as well, collectable creatures, unlockable bonus levels from Rayman Origins (each has teensies and trophies to collect) and Time Trial levels as well. If you're a bit of a completionist like I am with these sorts of things, you'll have lots to keep you occupied. There is also the new music levels, which are very much like the chest chasing missions in Origins, completely timing based where you jump or attack in time with the music. These are excellently thought out and the timing is spot-on. These are a bit more forgiving than Origins' chest chasing missions though, having checkpoints rather than making you restart after each death.\nThere are downsides though, this game is a console port and at times it shows, making some actions hard to perform using keyboard if you don't have nimble fingers. It is perfectly playable with the keyboard though and supports full key remapping (Which I suggest you do, I set mine to the Origins controls and it saved me a lot of trouble), but it may be easier to play using a controller. I can't say which is better, since I've only played using keyboard, although you can play one handed using keyboard, leaving your other hand free to do other stuff like eat a sandwich or write a book. It also doesn't really have much replayability, apart from the music levels which are awesome just to play occasionally, unless you are a big Rayman fan. Plus it only works through UPlay, which is not a bad piece of software but it does make things frustrating when you just want to get right into the game.\nOverall, this game is worth picking up, even at full price and the annoying DRM. Graphics are pretty and there is a lot to do. I'm really looking forward to the next game in the series,\n9/10","November 27, 2013","true","16.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Want to play as a duck? Wanna see a random giant wrestling guy falling from top to bottom just you can go on? Or do you just want to hear a plant singing by slapping his eye?\nThen this game should give you a good laugh.\n\nGameplay: Nothing here changed since Origins, which i also played too (Wiii Version). I feel like Legends is easier then Origins. I had my problems getting progress in the previous game, probably because i was back there a child which had nothing better to do. Also, the levels from Legends are in my option better, but it's also cool to see that you can play the previous levels from Origins, i really like that.\nBosses that i had to beat were top. My favourite one HAS to be the 3rd boss.\n\nThe biggest feature are the music levels. Diffirent covers from songs, like from Black Mary, Eye of the Tiger and so on. I NEVER had so much fun playing these Music Levels. They are completly new and fresh also. if some DLC's were avalible, i would defendly try them out. Also Castle Rack has to be the best one.\n\nSoundtracks: Some soundtrack from Origins were re-used, but that doesnt matter. The soundtrack is often outstanding, is fitting really good in the currently situation you are in. I was imaging i were in a mission impossible in World 4-1, damn that was perfectly.\n\nChallenge: I never had the experience yet to be in a trial and error section. Otherwise, the game isnt too easy, and isnt too hard.  Mixing the difficulty perfect together makes an awesome game experience.\n\nOverall, this game is it money worth. Buy it now if you can!  Trust me! You will never have more fun then playing this!\n10/10","March 15, 2015","true","53.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rafsterman/recommended/242550/","Rafsterman","Rafsterman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rafsterman/","186 products in account","Rayman Legends, a game that was supposed to be Wii U exclusive on February 21, 2013 and Ubisoft decides at the last second to make it multi-platforms so it was moved to September 2013. I honestly have played all the versions of this game but i only own the Wii U and PC version. Rayman Legends is a sequel to Rayman Origins where this time, instead of saving happy faces, you save the usual Teensies like in most Rayman games. There are multiple characters to play as even though there all the same. Gameplay is good however, when your playing Murphy levels, you cannot tap whatever you want unlike the Wii U version. This is frustrating since you cannot get some extra lums for a gold trophy. Every level has 2 objectives, get a certain amount of lums and save teensies. You cannot progress furthur until u get the right amunt of teensies. There are other modes in this game like Kung Foot where its basically soccer. There are also Challenges in which you do a certain objective everyday. There are 4 types of challenges: Daily.Daily Extreme,Weekly, and Weekly Extreme. The maps also change once its been a day/week and a diffrent objective like how far can you go or how fast can you get a certain amount of lums. You do get trophies for this which raises your Awesomeness level. Your Awesomess Level increases as you collect trophies as they give you points. Once you reach a certain amount of Aweomess, you unlocked all the challenges. There is also a lottery and to get tickets, you need to get a certain amount of lums in levels.\nI give this game 7 out of 10 because this game is literally meant for the Wii U, Plus the Wii U version has more content than the other versions like being able to control Murphy which is really good.","March 16, 2015","true","16.8"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","11","17","2","2"

This is seriously one of the best platformers I have ever played.  The developers should be proud to have made such a refined and ejoyable game.  The balance of difficulty is excellent and better than Origins, I think.  I'm glad they let you skip the animation at the end of each level during the Lum tally.  There are a lot more game modes here than just the story too.  It feels like there's more variety to the gameplay than origins as well.\n\nWell worth the purchase.","July 11, 2014","true","25.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/recommended/242550/","sarysa","sarysa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/","177 products in account","I have to say, this is a pretty inspired platformer. The controls are simple, power-ups are few, but instead you get treated to some seriously well designed environments. The daily and weekly challenges are a testament to how much gameplay variety the game has. There are enough background touches that replaying a level a few times, you'll notice things that you missed the first time through. The musical stages are a treat for the eyes, and a nice homage to the early auto-play ROM hacks (i.e. SMW Kumikyoku) which would do the same thing. (though you need to jump and fire to the beat, of course)\n\nYou don't have a lives counter. When you die, you just start back at some arbitrary checkpoint. You can also just opt to restart at the last checkpoint via the pause menu if you messed up getting some collectible. (lums or teensies) Challenge purists may scoff at this feature but anti-frustration features such as these are long overdue. Some players go for utter perfection and they can still impose that challenge on themselves. Those of us who'd rather not endure dozens of repeats of an entire stage for one difficult section will have things the way they are. Not to mention, anti-frustration features are much more kid friendly. Finally, Ubisoft cycles through challenges every day where you can compete with the world. They have you covered, though they admittedly do a miserable job at managing the hackers.\n\nThe game is fairly non-linear, with paths opening up as you collect more teensies and lucky tickets.  Teensies make more standard stages available, and tickets (eventually) open up more of the "Back to Origins" stages.\n\n90% of what I _didn't_ like about this game can be summed up in one word: UPlay. The fact that they're using steam as a conduit to push their redundant DRM system which significantly adds to the startup time is appalling. One thing you better not do is check the box that says "don't tell me again" when you close the window with your key. You won't have the steam overlay available to get it again when it's time to enter the key again, many minutes later. I almost botched my install this way...luckily I hadn't copied something else into my clipboard. This experience alone almost caused me to knee-jerk a negative review in...lucky for them, the game is extremely good.\n\nThe rest of what I found irritating were some of the pop-ups after a level. One made it look like an option but literally forced me to stop what I was doing and go play an invasion level. I also kept getting annoying popups to use the tickets even though I'd already responded to one such popup. It's my own damn prerogative if I want to use them all at once. I also don't like the fact that unlocking levels is somewhat RNG based, but I'm guessing that they had the sense to heavily influence the "randomness" of unlocking said levels.\n\nAll in all, I guess I recommend it. Hopefully someday Ubisoft will realize they're alienating gamers with their DRM, and...yeah, I'm sticking with Steam. Thanks. That said, the game itself is worth the annoyance.","March 29, 2015","true","21.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Well, ah...not really, but the visual style is great and if you've played Rayman, then you already know what you're getting into.","March 29, 2015","true","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The gameplay is superb, and although it does lag a tiny bit now and then, you won't even care because you're too focused on how fun this game is. ;) Some levels require fast thinking, multi-tasking and being quick on your feet (Rayman feet) as you jump through obstacles and fight off enemies that come in your way whilst a fire blaze is coming after you. There are also lever-related levels where you have a handy sidekick guy who helps make your obstacles a bit easier, as long as you remember to use this little sidekick guy by pressing 'w', or 'q' and 'e' to make him rotate the wheel/s. Furthermore, there are mini games such as challenges, and a sports ball-kicking multi-player mini game. Throughout the game, you'll have little bonuses popping up here and there to help you gain more points/life, and during the game loads, there may be a free life-line heart which you must grab before the loading has finished (if you want to!). You also must try to free all of the little blue guys (in some or all levels) in order to gain all three trophies for each game room. Overall, from a Rayman lover, I think this game is worth the buy, especially since I was able to get it 75% off (special sale). You won't regret it, and like I similarly said, you will have so much fun once you get into the grip of the game.","March 17, 2015","true","5.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The gameplay, the art, the soundtrack ... is all so well done. It truly makes you want to come back to the game for more hilarious fun. It's like Rayman Origins, but with enough new elements to keep the experience fresh (and imo it's more fun too).\nHave to say this is one of the most (if not the most) fun rayman game I've ever played. Rayman 1 is still my favorite in the series (though nostalgia is a big influence here), but in terms of pure fun, this game is just AWESOME.\n\nIf you have some friends to play this game with, I strongly suggest you do so. It makes the game even more fun & hilarious. Don't worry though, so far I've only played singleplayer and that is a lot of fun aswell. Also, if you haven't played Origins (and you wish to do so), there is no real need to buy it, as there is a whole "back to origins" stage available in this game. You gain access to these levels throughout your adventure.\n\nSo: if you like rayman, or 2d platformers (with humor), just get this game.

Once you beat certain levels and reach a certain level of collectibles, levels unlock that are tougher than the main campaign for those seeking challenge (they usually have time limits which require perfect control or else you will not reach the goal).

If you liked Rayman:Origins, you'll like this one. If you don't have Origins, you don't really need to buy it, since this game contains almost every one of the origins levels as bonus levels. It's a great idea, and they're fun to revisit.\n\nIf you like fun, cheerful platformers with good music, good controls, and a good difficulty curve, you'll really like this game.\n\nHowever, unless you really enjoy pain, I'd recommend finishing the main levels and quitting.\nBy the time I realized that was what I should have done, I was close enough to 100% that I just soldiered through, but it really left a sour taste in my mouth in places.\nOne of the best parts of Rayman:Origins for me was how the difficulty ramped up through the whole game, culminating in the Land of the Livid Dead. Those levels were monsters, but practice and a bit of luck would see you through, and man did I feel accomplished when I beat them. You needed every single trick you'd picked up in the game, and maybe a few more, but they weren't unfair, just brutal.\nRayman:Legends on the other hand, has a land of the livid dead that's not new, it's not interesting, it's just selected levels you've already beaten with hideous graphical filters over them. Pixelating them, adding pulsing static and other visual noise, oh, and removing the checkpoints. Two of them gave me hideous headaches.\nJust for that alone, I'd have to say Origins is the stronger game.\nLegends also adds a whole bunch of timed mini levels, some of which can take dozens of runs if you're trying to rescue all of the smurfs that have been captured. Some of them are a nice break, but having so many of them makes the magic run dry very quickly.\n\nI'd also like to know why there are ~40 unlockable playable characters when there aren't appreciable differences between them. Not sure what the point there is.\n\nAnyway, overall, this game is in places good, even great, but for completests, it's a bit of a kick below the belt in the places it should really shine. I recommend it, but with the caveats mentioned.","March 6, 2015","true","27.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Superior to Origins in everything, it features lots of improvements since graphics until its gameplay. It is officially the biggest Rayman game ever, with more than 20 hours of gameplay plus the online challenges that extend more the experience.. Although it isn't better than the first three games of the quintology, this title is superior to Rayman Origins and it brings back fourty levels from it with adapted gameplay mechanics and slightly improved graphism, but the return of the RO levels might make the experience feel repetitive. Sadly, the story isn't quite improved either, it is a game that mostly focuses in gameplay. Despite of this said problems and other particular ones, it is still an enjoyable game and recommended especially to people that still didn't have the chance to play Rayman Origins.

The Rayman Legends movie was done with Silicon Graphics Computers™ and the instruction booklet says the game's graphics were created with the same 3D computer models used in the making of the blockbuster movie.\n\nWe don't know however if the game uses Silicon Graphics Computers™. If SGI Computers™ were used, we suspect they were only used for character animations because the backgrounds do not have the detailed quality graphics of Donkey Kong Country. As any good dedicated game-player knows, Donkey Kong Country was created with Silicon Graphics Computers™ and doesn't have edging problems.  Whats even more strange is that  Rayman is the only character with edging problems. All of the other characters look great.\n\nOne question remains, why didn't Ubisoft use Silicon Graphics Computers™ for the entire game? Were they too expensive? I don't think so. Come on. Big Ubisoft is one of the richest corporations in France.

And yep, Rayman Legends is not an exception.\n\nFirst, about the graphics. This game has came a long way from the first game, "Rayman Origins". The graphics is STUNNING. I mean literally, it's like, the whole different game from Rayman Origins, from the world, to every character in the game, all have been enhanced, and they fit with the world perfectly. And the best part is, this game runs at full 60FPS in my crappy laptop. Yes, not a single drop, it's always stable at 60, all the time. That's the one i like most.\n\nOk, now about the storyline. Rayman Legends, like the other Rayman games before, puts you in a funny storyline. Well gotta say, in my opinion, this game is made to make you laugh, specially when you're playing coop with your friends. Every levels is well designed, suitable for both adults and children to play together, not too hard, but also not too easy, just challenging enough. Also, this game has a "Back To Origin" part, where you can play the levels from Rayman Origins (but this doesn't mean I recommend you to play just the Legends one, i've finished Rayman Origins, and currently playing Legends, and tbh, each game has its own unique style, you can try both if you want)\n\nThirdly, i really don't understand why people don't recommend this game because of just "Uplay". For the first 3 hours, i haven't encountered any crash, bug, or something like that. When i launch the game from steam. Uplay just pops up for a few seconds, then I'm enjoying the game, without any bug, or crash.\n(And for those who can't play properly because of Uplay, and want to rate down the game, here's my suggestion: After you've launched the game, saw Uplay pop-up said "logging in", shut it down, uninstall Uplay, and download the other version at Ubisoft homepage, install it. After that, you can launch the game properly)\n\n[EDIT] How could i forget about the music, the soundtrack? They are like, what made this game to become a success. All of the music, specially the music levels, are amazing, that's the part made me want to play it again and again (Still in love with the Mexican style music) xDDD\n\nIn general, i think this game is perfect to play when you want to relax, or playing with your friends and family. Seriously, i couldn't think of anything bad about this game. So yeah, my score for it is 10/10.

Before I started writing these reviews nobody reads. Today I decided to reinstall this game  because I needed some inspiration, as I make games on my spare time and I remembered this game as one of the most amazing looking games I ever played, then write a review nobody will read.\n\nEvery screenshot is an artwork. But visuals anyone can tell how good it is by looking at the videos and screenshots, so I'll move on and talk about the rest of the game. By the way, if you're into art I also recommend googling Rayman concept art and get to know Aymeric Kevin's artwork, the artist behind it.\n\nNow that I started writing this I realize I don't have much to say about the game. There is nothing new to be analyzed; you jump and attack through the levels. So I'll put it like this: imagine the best 2D platformer you ever played, it's likely done by a small team, indie. Now imagine if that game had the amount of polish a triple A game  usually gets. That's Rayman Legends. Every second on it seems to have been crafted by a hundred skilled hands and playtested to exhaustion. It's so well paced that at times it's challenging without being frustrating, at other times it's easy without being boring. At the end of each chapter there's a musical level where you run and jump as you do in bit runner and other rhythm running games, and it's so fun I was laughing out loud while playing. Laughing because you are having fun is not something I'm used to. Laughing of a good joke? sure, but it's not the same thing. It's a super nice variation from the previous levels and it does feel like a reward for beating every level. This is something we always want as gamers, rewards for beating the game. It's why we watch the whole credits and absorb every bit of extra content we have. In the old days we would examine every pixel of those static images of the end game credits. I feel like These musical at the end of each chapter gives us exactly what we want. An explosive and fun reward for all the "work".\n\nAlso, it's not every day you see a reboot light years better than the source material. It baffles me every time I remember what the original rayman was like.\n\nIf that's not obvious by now, I quite like Rayman Legends and I recommend it.","April 9","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Take everything great about Rayman Origins and make it even better. All the great stage design, boss fights, and challenging difficulty is back. There is so much content in this installment of the Rayman series. Online challenges, remastered Rayman Origins stages, Local Co-Op mode with a fun minigame, Time Trials, creatures to collect, characters to unlock and a ton of awesomely designed stages in the main section of the game. There is also a nice statistics screen to keep track of all your progress.\n\nThere are online challenges that change on a daily and weekly basis. Every player in the world competes in them and gets ranked by how well they perform in the challenge. You can also race against the better ranked player's ghosts. It basically shows exactly what they did during the challenge, while you are playing. You can also increase your trophy level by placing high in lots of challenges and clearing portions of the game.\n\nThe music themed stages in this game are probably my favorite platforming levels in any game ever. Playing a whole level in sync with the music feels very satisfying. There are also a ton of other stages that are amazingly designed. The boss fights are very satisifying to play. The Time Trials portions of stages feel perfectly designed for running through them as fast as you can. There is quite a bit of depth in making your character move as fast as possible in all situations. These Time Trials make you realize how fast you can actually go.\n\nI have spent around 40 hours to 100% the game and do some of the online challenges. You can probably spend around 30 hours just to 100% the game and around 20 hours trying to complete the levels. Some of the levels are very hard and the online challenges have sections that are even harder. They bring back portions of the Land of the Livid Dead from Rayman Origins for some of the online challenges. You can also play a lot of the Rayman Origins levels in this game, but they have been remastered to make the levels a bit better designed.\n\nThis game has everything you could want in a platformer. It is highly recommended and I don't think you can find a better designed platformer game than this one.

You owe it to yourself to check out Rayman Legends. Just make sure to rebind Murphy's context button. It's horribly placed. =D\n\nHowever, there's a pretty big asterisk to this review: Like most Ubisoft games, this game requres you to maintain a Ubisoft Uplay account in order to run the game. I don't care, personally, but a lot of people are turned off by draconian DRM measures that Ubi has put in place. Making matters even more confusing, Ubi is evolving Uplay into its own digital distribution platform ala Steam. So it's like Steam-ception. It's a Steam within a Steam, albiet a Steam that is geared towards Ubi's publisher proclivities. So, to recap, you have to download a digitial distribution service through your digital distribution service in order to play the game. Like I said, doesn't bother me, but I know it sure as hell bothers a lot of people.","October 7, 2014","true","29.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is therefore a surprise how Ubisoft with its overall declining quality, managed to produce such a great quality work with this one. Could this mean the same for its other series? Only time will tell, since as Ubisoft has shown here, it's never too late to get back on track.\n\nSome snippets from the game itself:\n+This game as many others have mentioned, is suitable for all ages and is great for gathering friends and family in playing such a fun game cooperatively or competitively.\n+Every level is unique on its own, giving a different flow, challenges and experience to every level, this is one of the major factors that make the game so replayable.\n+Small details regarding playable and non-playable characters in their movements and reactions to the envirnoment, which are so well made that not only do they truly give an impression of the personality of the character, but aids in making the gameplay experience so fluid.\n+Manages to instill an actual sense of achievement, versus a ton of modern games that reward 'achievements' without the actual sense\n\nMinor negatives:\n-Requires Uplay which constantly and forever will have sync issues with achievements or saved games. (I never needed to backup saves for Rayman, but for AC:Unity and Sleeping Dogs, which overwrote my progress, I needed to backup my saves constantly mid-game)\n-Only local Coop +Counter: However this encourages getting actual persons to play with you in the same room, which enriches the experience. Also, there is an online score ladder, with other player's ghosts to compete with in the weekly/daily online competitions.\n\nRating: 9/10","February 28, 2015","true","13.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

However, this game is much bigger and more detailed than most of the indie titles. The game appears to be bigger than its predecessor, Rayman Origins, as well. There are 60 main stages, "Back To Origins" levels re-playing some Origins levels, rotating daily and weekly challenges, and more little stuff. All of that adds up to a lot of gameplay, especially considering you'll want to go re-play stages multiple times to get the fastest time, or collect all the things.\n\nSpeaking of which, this game is a collector's paradise. Every corner of the game is littered with collectable items, which the game constantly tallies and rewards you with new levels and characters. There are a lot more characters in Legends than there were in Origins, and they all have their own amusing animations.\n\nThis game is highly polished on every level. From the character animations, to the visual style, to the music, this game is a joy to behold, unless you're only interested in the brown-grey wash gritty shooters. In a way the game is visually old-school, in that every level has a theme(swamp, fire, etc.), but it's always interesting to see new scenery, and it's all beautifully drawn. I can't tell for certain, but I'm pretty sure the soundrack is recorded with a live orchestra. The resulting sound appropriately zany, but rich and authentic at the same time. Again, this is on a level beyond what an indie side-scroller can offer.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly old-school as well, in good ways and bad. While the simple, classic controls never seem to get old, the game can also be very demanding, requiring split-second precision. If you want to get a perfect run through a stage you pretty much have to retry and retry, and basically memorize every button press, or every attack in a boss fight. While it can be frustrating, there are relatively few moments where you're bottlenecked; you don't have to grind unless you're a perfectionist.\n\nI was happy to get the game for $20 during the holiday sale, and I think the game is absolutely worth it at that price. Is it worth $40, though? I'm inclined to say yes, simply because of the amount of content and the level of polish throughout. This is a full-size game, and it comes at a full-size price. If you can get it at a discount it starts to be a great deal.","January 1, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've loved the Rayman series for it's immersive gameplay and unique style since the announcement of Rayman Origins. Ubiart Framework is a fantastic studio and I just adore this game like no other. The game is quirky and fun, you'll notidce that little is serious about this game when you play it. It's comical and charming all together. Fans of Rayman Origins will definitely enjoy this game. It has a lot more features than Rayman Origins had-In this game you collect Teensies, there're 10 in each level, and how many in each painting varies. In the invasion levels, and other specific levels(such as bosses or music levels) there're 3 teensies to collect. Each level is just an epic immersion into the marvels Ubiart Framework can achieve with their technology. The music is phenominal, it adds dynamic to the overall gameplay and allows the player to truly get into the game, and the E3 press conference mostly emphasized one of the music levels-but it's not just the music levels that have great music. The entire game has a beautiful soundtrack that truly adds to the game's feeling. I only have a few complaints about the game...Some of the invasion levels are merciless and tedious. For one level I spent a good hour trying to get it just right to earn all 3 teensies. The levels are put together awesomely, but the spike in difficulty of invasion levels sometimes takes a toll on gameplay. If you're a perfectionist, it becomes more of a chore than something fun...But it feels great once you do get it just right. The daily and weekly challenges always add a spice to the game, allowing for players to earn more lums for completing various tasks in certain levels, it helps keep things fresh, and it definitely made me come back for more because I always wonder what's going to be the challenge for today. In this game you recieve lottery tickets after earning so many Lums, which is pretty cool-but you can also earn 'creatures' for your creature gallery. I never really understood the creature collection. They supply lums daily, but otherwise they don't seem very collectible unless you just, you know, like to collect them(personal opinion). Overall this game is amazing. It's worth every penny,","December 2, 2013","true","101.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: Rayman Origins was a very fun and generally very well designed game, if slightly flawed in certain areas. Rayman Legends is a very fun and generally very well designed game, if slightly flawed in certain areas. It's the same "old-school" platforming experience delivered in Rayman Origins, but this time it's delivered just a bit better. Gone are some of the absolutely infuriating and sometimes unfair memorization-heavy levels (for the most part; I'll get to that later). Out of the core five worlds, there were really only three levels that I wasn't too terribly fond of. For a game that has about 40 levels in the core worlds, that's quite good. In fact, my only "minor-major" complaint about the core worlds is the implementation of Murphy. It shows that he was meant for the Wii U version, but it's not that much of a deal breaker; just that it maybe could've been handled in a slightly better manner (let's say controlling Murphy with the right analog stick).\n\nNote that I signified the fact that the ratio of good to bad levels was quite good in the core worlds. There is also a portion of the game called "Back to Origins," which is essentially a best-of collection of levels from Rayman Origins. Again, most of these levels are pretty good, but it just seems lazy to me to only bring back some of the levels, rather than bring back all of them. They've essentially given us all of the good stuff, leaving us no reason to go out and buy Origins. Much to my annoyance, they also brought back the boss fights from Origins, which are the aforementioned unfair memorization-heavy levels. They were the worst part of Origins in my opinion, but they are not the worst part in this game.\n\nThat "honor" goes to the Livid Dead Party world, which in my opinion contains some of the worst levels in the game. The Land of the Livid Dead level from Origins was easily my favorite level in the entire game, so you can imagine my disappointment when I found that all that was new and Livid Dead related was another music stage. It wasn't bad, but it was still very disappointing. Then... the remixes strike. These are 8-Bit reprises of the music stages that you unlock at the end of each world, with the two primary differences being a lack of checkpoints and an (in my opinion) incredibly stupid and infuriating visual filter(s). The first stage wasn't so bad; it just kinda hurt my head since it was a fisheye lens. The second stage... made me not want to 100% the game, even though I had gotten 682 Teensies up to that level. I don't get motion sickness, but that stage nearly made me throw up about three times due to the godawful visual filter done exclusively for "LAWLZ RETRO GUIZ." The rest of the stages were more of the same, albeit not nearly as bad as the second remix stage.\n\nAgain, despite my negativity, I will wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who anyone who just wants a pure fun platforming experience. Just stick with 100%ing the core worlds; the rest of the game ain't worth it. For an incredibly well crafted and fun set of core levels, a mediocre way of padding out the gameplay, and an immensely disappointing Livid Dead world, I will give this game an 8.5/10 for gameplay.\n\nStory: Skipping this, as the story can literally be told in less than a paragraph.\n\nGraphics: Man, I wish Ubisoft would release the level creator/editing tool to the public so that we can do things with it. Then again, maybe it's for the best that they don't; it'd only be a matter of time until the Internet poops all over such a glorious utility. What I'm trying to say is that this game is gorgeous and that we (as consumers) should totally be able to get our hands on the editor to make more amazing stuff happen. The character design is quite good as well, if some of the characters start to look like the others after a while. Despite this, there's a great deal of characters that you can switch between, so that you're not stuck staring at the same character the entire game. For proving yet again that style trumps number of polygons, this game gets a 5/5 for graphics.\n\nMusic: You can tell that the composers had a great deal of fun with the music in this game. That fun of composing transcribes into additional fun in playing the game. It's not something that most people would want to listen to outside of the game (at least I'd think so), but it's still very fitting and lends itself quite nicely to the ambiance of the stages. The songs chosen for the music stages puts this soundtrack over the top, allowing it to receive a 5/5 for the music portion.\n\nOverall score of 8.5/0/5/5; cumulative score of 9.3/10. If I didn't decide to be a completionist for this game, I would've rated it higher; however, the Livid Dead Party is still a pretty large blemish on an otherwise excellent game. Again, the best experience is achieved by just sticking to the core five worlds in my opinion.","April 26, 2014","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, this game is much bigger and more detailed than most of the indie titles. The game appears to be bigger than its predecessor, Rayman Origins, as well. There are 60 main stages, "Back To Origins" levels re-playing some Origins levels, rotating daily and weekly challenges, and more little stuff. All of that adds up to a lot of gameplay, especially considering you'll want to go re-play stages multiple times to get the fastest time, or collect all the things.\n\nSpeaking of which, this game is a collector's paradise. Every corner of the game is littered with collectable items, which the game constantly tallies and rewards you with new levels and characters. There are a lot more characters in Legends than there were in Origins, and they all have their own amusing animations.\n\nThis game is highly polished on every level. From the character animations, to the visual style, to the music, this game is a joy to behold, unless you're only interested in the brown-grey wash gritty shooters. In a way the game is visually old-school, in that every level has a theme(swamp, fire, etc.), but it's always interesting to see new scenery, and it's all beautifully drawn. I can't tell for certain, but I'm pretty sure the soundrack is recorded with a live orchestra. The resulting sound appropriately zany, but rich and authentic at the same time. Again, this is on a level beyond what an indie side-scroller can offer.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly old-school as well, in good ways and bad. While the simple, classic controls never seem to get old, the game can also be very demanding, requiring split-second precision. If you want to get a perfect run through a stage you pretty much have to retry and retry, and basically memorize every button press, or every attack in a boss fight. While it can be frustrating, there are relatively few moments where you're bottlenecked; you don't have to grind unless you're a perfectionist.\n\nI was happy to get the game for $20 during the holiday sale, and I think the game is absolutely worth it at that price. Is it worth $40, though? I'm inclined to say yes, simply because of the amount of content and the level of polish throughout. This is a full-size game, and it comes at a full-size price. If you can get it at a discount it starts to be a great deal.","January 1, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've loved the Rayman series for it's immersive gameplay and unique style since the announcement of Rayman Origins. Ubiart Framework is a fantastic studio and I just adore this game like no other. The game is quirky and fun, you'll notidce that little is serious about this game when you play it. It's comical and charming all together. Fans of Rayman Origins will definitely enjoy this game. It has a lot more features than Rayman Origins had-In this game you collect Teensies, there're 10 in each level, and how many in each painting varies. In the invasion levels, and other specific levels(such as bosses or music levels) there're 3 teensies to collect. Each level is just an epic immersion into the marvels Ubiart Framework can achieve with their technology. The music is phenominal, it adds dynamic to the overall gameplay and allows the player to truly get into the game, and the E3 press conference mostly emphasized one of the music levels-but it's not just the music levels that have great music. The entire game has a beautiful soundtrack that truly adds to the game's feeling. I only have a few complaints about the game...Some of the invasion levels are merciless and tedious. For one level I spent a good hour trying to get it just right to earn all 3 teensies. The levels are put together awesomely, but the spike in difficulty of invasion levels sometimes takes a toll on gameplay. If you're a perfectionist, it becomes more of a chore than something fun...But it feels great once you do get it just right. The daily and weekly challenges always add a spice to the game, allowing for players to earn more lums for completing various tasks in certain levels, it helps keep things fresh, and it definitely made me come back for more because I always wonder what's going to be the challenge for today. In this game you recieve lottery tickets after earning so many Lums, which is pretty cool-but you can also earn 'creatures' for your creature gallery. I never really understood the creature collection. They supply lums daily, but otherwise they don't seem very collectible unless you just, you know, like to collect them(personal opinion).

A friend of mine lend me Rayman Origins and it was good. When I saw on Steam Rayman Legends for sale I bought it straight away and I have to say its one of the best games Ive played. I grew up with 2D platformers like Mario and Sonic, I played the New Super Mario Bors on WiiU but its no match for Rayman. Rayman is in my opinion the best Ubisoft Game and the best platformer hands down. It has so much content - unbelievable. Here you can even unlock the levels from Rayman Origins - so basically you have two Rayman games. The later levels are challenging but not unfair thanks to well placed auto-saves where you dont have to restart the whole level - which is fair because I think I wouldnt finish some levels, or I would have to play them till I retire. It has a very high replayability value and is definitve worth the money even on full price. The next Rayman game I will buy right when it comes out - im looking already forward to it.

A well-thoughtout game, but a bit unpolished. Legends adds that extra pollish to both controls and art style, although that's hardly what feels improved. Difficulty curves quite nicely letting people experiment and mess around without being forced to progress until later on, and the controls are very responsive (even when used with a controller! Controller mappings are rebindable). The games tacked-on "underwater" world isn't actually too bad, more requiring critical thinking than it does skill and percision. Challenge support for this game isn't too unique, I've seen challenges repeated quite often although it was nice to see that I ranked at the very top of Gold-level players. Even if you aren't good at said challenges, a "ghost" option lets you hone and improve your skills and learn from other players.\nAlthough... I've two semi-obvious complaints. The Ubisoft DRM can be quite invasive before gameplay, REQUIRING updates to its service and making you lauch the game from its Uplay service (I do not approve of it, mind you). My other negative thought being there is NO online multiplayer.

I swore not to buy it at full price, let alone preorder it, solely because of that fact. I would not be the one supporting DRM in my DRM, no sir.\nI eventually bought this more than half off and found out that there's no option to disable gamepad rumble, and do believe that I loathe rumble.\nAfter having muttered some Ubisoft addressed swear words I started playing and...  I forgot about my well-founded self-rightous hate in all but a few minutes. It's slick, intuitive and responsive, the sound design is one of the best you'll ever find and the graphics are sure to make you widen up your eyes on occasion.\nDo I recommend getting this game? Of course I do. Do I recommend getting this game on Steam? Not necessarily.","March 16, 2014","true","36.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Though, there are quite a few sections in the game where (assuming you're using an Xbox controller) you have to press Y to control a fairy guy to activate obsticles on the course, and it's a little obvious it was made for the WiiU's gamepad. It's a better transition then you think it would be, but it really ruins the pasing in my opinion, the flow is almost completely ruined in those levels. (Update: It's worked in a lot more levels, but in quite a few he could definitally been left out) That, and the added punishment for people who actually bought the game, and no one else, which is known as "Uplay" (A DRM service for ubisoft games as an anti-piracy method) is also used for the game. Multiple people have reported Uplay crashes when attempting to boot up the game, and they have also reported stolen gamekeys, so Uplay doesn't think you actually bought the game when you did, and the customer service is reluctant to help. So be cautious with the software. Currently, i'm unable to get cards and steam acheivements because of Uplay, so that's a bummer. Probably won't go for that completionist because of it. (just saying, Uplay is basically gunlaws for piracy, the only people you're punishing is the honest.)\nBut, with the game's amazing art, controls, gameplay, music, and even a large collection of levels from Rayman Origins, it's definitally worth getting on sale, just in case Uplay does ♥♥♥♥ you over. Otherwise, i'd maybe even spend the 40 if you're a platformer or rayman fan. And it's easy to see that Ubiart put a lot of care into the game, they even added lore for pallet swaps. Reccomended.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention the lack of online multiplayer, because "You can't punch people over the internet."\nUbi pls no.","March 15, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","2"

It also has the disadvantage of being tied to Uplay for pretty much the sole purpose of the daily challenge feature... which has to date not worked for me even once.\n\nIf you can stomach Uplay (which I have had more than my share of issues with, personally), it's the better game, and an ace example of platforming.","June 18, 2015","true","13.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I can't write so much of this game because I have barely played any of it but I can tell you what I think so far. I was confused in the begining because their was no difficult options. I guess the game will gert harder and harder but still I wish I could have the option. I also hope that the enemies will get smarter and harder to kill later in the game because so far they are pretty much one hit kill, unlike in the old 3d Rayman games the take more hits untill they die.

Man, was I ever pleasantly surprised! It's truly one of the most fun games I've ever played. While not particularly deep from a gameplay perspective, good humor is bursting from every seam and it's impossible not to be swept along.\n\nThe level design is perfect and the visuals are utterly spectacular. I find myself playing "just one more level" to see what incredible visual treats the game has in store for me next. I also have to single out the game's remarkable composer, Christophe Héral. Music is as integral to the experience here as it was in classic Warner Bros. cartoons. You may find yourself replaying certain levels again and again just to enjoy the wonderful soundtrack. Of particular note is the fact that many of the tracks were recorded using a full orchestra, something which is very rare in games these days. Huge kudos to Ubisoft for being willing to spend the extra money to get such high quality results!\n\nIn conclusion, Rayman Legends is pretty much a must-have game.

This is the culmination of decades of creating platform games, and they nailed it.\n\n-The game looks absolutely incredible. There are 3D elements tied into the 2D perspective and they really did an amazing job with it. The game is VERY colourful and looks super crisp on my monitor at 1920x1080.\n-The game runs like a dream, no problems there. The graphics settings are rather limited, however.\n-The game features precision platforming but at times it becomes a spectacle-platformer of sorts\n-It incorporates very creative ideas in its level design, including rhythm courses where your actions sync up with the music - this was incredible. I had a smile on my face the entire time, it is a must play, or at least a must watch on YouTube.\n-The game is very deep, with tons of unlockable heroes and weekly and daily challenges, etc. Leaderboards are very prominent. The replayability of this game is unbelievable.\n-I HIGHLY reccomend you play this game with a controller. It is doable on keyboard with some keybinding adjustment required, but I much prefer the controller.\n\nI cannot say enough about this title! Must-own.","December 27, 2013","true","33.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You now have the help of Murfy the Greenbottle guy.\n\nSo in this game you have a ranking whatever you played offline or not. Each world and each levels have their own cups and each cup give you points to level up your rank. You can get copper, silver, gold and also platinum cup. Also you earn cup doing online challenges, depeding of your ranking at the end of each challenge.\n\nIn this rayman, you get some brand new worlds, levels, bosses and also a "karaoke" mode. The online challenge is pretty new too.\n\nSo depending of the amount of lums you got at the end of a level, you get a cup. Also you need to save the teensies, all if you can. When you are good enough you unlock lucky tickets that may reward you with a random gift such as : a creature, lums, teensy or a level of "Origins".\n\nYou'll also unlock time trials levels, where you need to rush to the teensies before the evil foes launch them with rockets.\n\nAt the end of each world you'll have a boss level fight and after that a "karaoke" level. The karaoke level, feature a music with "voices" if we call that voices, where you need to rush continuously until you reach the end. One of it great aspect is that the rythm of the music and voices are linked to your moves.\n\n"Back to Origins" world and levels are the replica of the original Rayman Origins levels. Only several levels are missing. In this one you'll find normal levels, shooting levels with the mosquito, rushing levels with the moving chest, and last levels with a boss at the end.\n\nFinally the online challenges will be required in order to have all achievements and it will take time until you reach the needed rank. Hopefully you can earn a lot of cups in a week and a lot of points if you're good enough. (16 cups each week)","March 18","true","34.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Castle Rock is the best level in any platformer i ever played.\n\n+ CONTENT.\nthere's quite a lot to do.\ncollect 700 teensies - and it is pretty fun to do it. main levels have 8 (6 scattered across the level, 2 found in special puzzle rooms) in them, with time attack/rush/boss levels each having 3.\ncollecting lums net you lottery tickets, which are a fun side activity - they unlock collectable creatures and also remastered levels from the previous Rayman game, Origins. yes, they are gated between the grind, as in you have to collect enough lums in each available level to get a ticket to get a chance to unlock a level, but without trying to get a maximum rating we easily unlocked more than 16 remastered levels by simply beating the levels.\n5 colourful words, each having two additional character unlocks, a boss level and a musical level. 6 world, as a bonus one, contains remixed musical levels. strangely enough, those are quite nauseating to play because of the fish-eye effect.\nthere are lots of other unlockable characters as well.\n\n+ DIFFICULTY CURVE.\nOrigins had one very annoying feature, or rather, lack of one. proper checkpoint system. often you had to redo way too long sections of the level, especially, if you missed a Teenie, and that was one of the reasons we couldn't finish all levels from it. i feel like Rayman Legends, while easier overall, is a good balanced game, and much, much less rage-inducing that it's predecessor.\n\n- STEAM INTEGRATION.\nyes, that is a con for me.\ni'd have loved getting achievements from this game. i'd love trading cards and background art for my profile from this game. i think workshop could have been pretty wonderful too, you know how many amazing talented people are there in the mod community.\ni must mention the uPlay thing. i hate being forced to use their DRM on top of Steam. it's unnecessary. and i'm never going to spend money on a platform, that is trying to force itself on me. i bypassed uPlay requirement in my own version, so i'm missing out on the leaderboards, but so be it. i don't consider this to be a fair requirement to begin with.\n\n- MINOR PORT SYNDROM.\nwell, it was originally conceived for Wii U, only later brought to other platforms.\nthis is not a major problem, trust me. the thing is. Murphy levels, which are based on QTEs and moving certain level props as you progress through them were originally controlled with special controller Wii U has. instead, in the port we control Murphy with a button push ('Y' on XBOX controller). sometimes he's focusing on the wrong platform depending on which player is ahead, and that can cause problems for players to progress at a slightly different pace.\nthat's not too bad, but it could be better, simple as that.\n\nto sum up, it still is an amazing experience, despite the uPlay DRM inconviniences. i highly recommend it, this is a great, family-friendly, couch co-op experience that will net you many hours of enjoyment.\n\n9.5/10","January 4, 2014","true","34.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","3"

The spot-on controls make it so when you die, you feel it was your fault rather than the game messing up or the game being cheap.\n\nSince this game was originally planned as a Wii U exclusive, there are several stages that are clearly intended to be played on a touchscreen, which involve using longtime series character Murphy the fly to do tasks such as moving blocks, rotating wheels & cutting ropes. These features work perfectly fine on controller, but these particular levels are not nearly as engaging as the rest of the game.\n\nThis game also supports four player co-op and has a fun multiplayer mini-game. Sadly, the multiplayer is only local. There is also a daily challenge mode that gives players the opportunity to complete with other players in several time trial courses complete with player ghosts to help feel the competitive spirit of the addicting game mode.\n\nThis game has a great deal of content that can be enjoyed both in single player and multiplayer and is a title that deserves to be in your library.","March 15, 2014","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I have tried to contact Ubisoft Support and they have told me that there is no fix for this issue.\n\nOthers on their forums are also complaining of this issue, and the official statement has been to "Disable internet before launching the game, and start Uplay in Offline mode".  When done, the game *does* launch (and it's a GLORIOUS game).\n\nThis is quite possibly one of my favorite couch co-op games, similar to a less-frustrating Super Mario Bros Wii in that each player tries to complete the level simultaneously, but can punch or inhibit other players if they want to be mean.  The game has very excellent controls, vibrant and varied visuals, and a stellar soundtrack.  Upon completing each stage you are rewarded with a "musical" level that requires you to keep the beat almost like a platformer Guitar Hero.\n\nHowever, despite my glowing review, I cannot in good faith give this game a recommendation until Ubisoft does something about the Crash On Launch issue that turns launching the game into a chore.","March 3, 2014","false","14.0"," 30 of 63 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","30","63","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterofthechips/recommended/242550/","masterofthechips","Deuterium the Sentient Mattress","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterofthechips/","1237 products in account","As of late, the 2D platforming genre has seen a bit of a resurgence, especially in indie games like Super Meat Boy, I Wanna Be The Guy and to a lesser extent in more high-profile titles New Super Mario Bros. and the like. Rayman Legends, the sequel to 2011's reboot of the Rayman series, Rayman Origins, is one such platformer, and quite possibly one of the best in its genre.\n\nRayman Legends, like its predecessor, is very simple in terms of its gameplay: Run, jump and punch your way through each of the levels, rescuing the small, fairy-like Teensies (who replace Origins' Electoons) as you go. It's actually quite a good thing the gameplay is this simple, because this game's difficulty is certainly not to be sniffed at. On some of the Challenge levels in particular it might take someone many different tries to get past a particular area of the game, and whilst at first this may seem aggravating there's no feeling quite like finally completing that ONE level. Another interesting addition is the Murfy mechanic - whilst playing, the player can use Murfy to guide their character through the level, by for instance moving platforms or distracting enemies, adding a little variety to the gameplay whilst still retaining the simplicity that makes it so enjoyable. There are also additional characters, but the differences are mostly cosmetic and don't change the gameplay, though in all honesty this is more to the game's benefit, since the gameplay is OK as it is, and doesn't really need any different character abilities to make it any better.\n\nAlso like Origins, Legends' story is barebones, quite possibly to the overall game's benefit. Not focusing much on the story means that the player can divert their attention to actually enjoying the gameplay and uniquer art style, which are the game's main points.\n\nI have but two overarching criticisms of this version, however: First of all, the implementaion of the uPlay DRM system, even on the Steam version, which is unnecessary and cumbersome. Second: This game was clearly meant for the Wii U, a fact that shows as you play the game. I thought that maybe the Wii U's features would transfer more easily to the PC, but unfortunately Ubisoft didn't really take advantage of the keyboard ands mouse in the same way they took advantage of the Wii U's gamepad. Actions formerly performed by the player themselves as Murfy on the Touch Pad are now performed with a single touch of a button on the controller, which if you ask me is a bit of a missed opportunity.\n\nTo summarise, despite clearly being designed for the Wii U, Rayman Legends is the best anyone could ask from a platforming game. It's challenging, it has funny characters, enjoyable levels, it doesn't focus too much on the plot, and most importantly - It will keep you entertained for a VERY long time. Yes, it can get very, VERY difficult, but as you play it, you realise that that's the whole point: Trial and error, improving with every failed attempt, slowly but surely perfecting your strategy. And it's exactly that that makes Rayman Legends special.","March 15, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Noteworthy for strong platforming and aesthetics.  Very weak on plot, legacy, and characters.\n\n\nVery fun platformer, for sure.  Difficulty starts low but it ramps up as it goes, and the game feels challenging yet rewarding.  This is at its core, a platformer, though.  Don't expect much from combat and don't expect much from the boss fights.  The platforming itself is spot on, and arguably the game's best strength is its music levels (watch some videos to see yourself).  The visuals are breathtaking and just in style with Rayman, and the soundwork is equally top tier.  The platforming, art, and sound all definitely feel like Rayman, alright.  I give these an A.\n\n\nHOWEVER\n\n\nWhile this game looks, sounds, and plays like Rayman, thats as far as it goes.  If you are looking for a Rayman nostalgia trip, I wouldn't exactly say this is it.  Beyond what I mention above, this game holds little in common with its predessesors.  First off, Rayman Legends fails to live up to the tones of the previous games.  The trademark "grimdark hidden by a humorous and groovy world full of adventure and mystery" has been thrown out in favor of a completely light hearted and juvenile tone, but somehow isn't even big on the humor from previous games to make up for it.  Rayman Legends is as it implies; its all about adventure, mystery, and exploration, so it manages to keep those at least.  Its not about saving the world or laughing your ♥♥♥ off, its about running through various locations while you beat up random monsters that happen to find themselves in your way.  You won't feel much for the characters and they won't inspire you to feel much yourself.  Every character is a cookie cutter of the last; they offer no unique expressions or unique performance.  Rayman won't be offering his snarky comments and you won't get the comic relief you expect from Globox or the Teensies.  Villians from previous games do not make appereances.  None of the additional characters have anything to offer rather than a sentence of flavor text and are cookie cutter skins, and feel quite out of place given the Rayman universe.  Nobody even SAYS anything to characterize them or add any semblance of a plot.  The most plot you get is the order in which you play the levels and the progression between them.  I give the game's legacy, characters, and plot a D.  Note this game is still quite good, but its sad given that this game is literally half of Rayman; Rayman was known for its superior universe / tone AND its gameplay.\n\n\nLegends and Origins are supposed to be prequels to the 3D games, but since there is no dialogue or plot its highly arguable that this is a completely standalone title.  This dissappointed me quite a bit, since the game's sells itself as Rayman's "origins" and "legend."  Please keep that in mind when purchasing this product.\n\n\nAlso if you are eyeing Origins, don't bother since this game includes Origins.\n\n\nAnother thing that might really get on your nerves is that because of the game's target audience, there are a bunch of really dumb minigames that the game is constantly shoving in your face, such as the Monster Room or the Lucky Ticket game.  In fact, in order to even play the Origins half of the game you must play that minigame around 100 times.\n\n\nOverall, I give this game a B-.  Noteworthy for strong platforming and aesthetics.  Very weak on plot, legacy, and characters.","December 10, 2014","true","21.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nate7/recommended/242550/","nate7","Nate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nate7/","112 products in account","I'm all for Rayman, I'm a fan of the original Rayman on the Atari Jaguar/PSX, it was colorful, and I was a huge fan of the very difficult and challenging nature of the platformer.  I have not played any other Rayman games except the original, so I'm not sure of those leading up to this game.  The art style in this game is very vivid and colorful, just like the original, which I really like.  The music is also okay, though I was not a huge fan, that is just personal preference.\n\nThe main "lobby" for selecting worlds and levels feels cluttered, like they just threw it together.  The movement is pretty good, my only gripe is that you can only charge your punch standing flat on the ground.  My main problems begin with level design.  They really like to use these chains/ropes which you can grab onto and slide down, but unfortunately if you even get CLOSE to anything that you can grab onto, it will auto grab whether you want to grab onto it or not, and you have to hold down and jump in order to let go.  After grabbing onto, say, a rope that you can slide on, you gain a lot of momentum almost instantly, which means if you are trying to get to something to the left, you have to let go of the rope and walk back, which, if there is an obstacle you have to jump over, you might accidentally grab onto the rope again and have to repeat this same process over and over.  It's not as though I fundamentally couldn't get past this obstacle, it's just that it happened often enough to be annoying, and that stacked up pretty quickly.  A lot of the levels consisted of me wanting to get to a secret area, but having to play around the frustrating issue of Rayman grabbing literally every rope handle and ledge in sight.\n\nThe level design isn't very interesting, every level blended together, felt pretty much the same, and left me bored very quickly.  Everything is very simple and quite easy, for the most part you can just hold down the run button and blast through all of the enemies without a second thought or ounce of difficulty.  They introduce a basic enemy right off the bat which is almost no threat at all whatsoever, I don't know how anyone could ever get hit by them.  Later on they give those enemies wooden shields, but you can just kick and one shot them just like the others, what is the point of them having shields if they are literally the same enemy and the shield does absolutely NOTHING?\n\nBasically, I just feel like I am just playing Super Rayman Bros. Wii U.  They don't really do anything interesting to pull you in and get you addicted and wanting to play more, it felt more like a chore going through each level like a zombie hoping that the next level would be exciting (never happened).  I will say, though, that this game would probably be best to play co-op with friends and not single player.  It seems to be designed with the exact same co-op as Super Mario Bros. Wii U (and the four five or six or how many other generic mario bros. platformers Nintendo made for the Wii, not including Galaxy of course, those games were a breath of fresh air).  Easy to say that I would not recommend a game that left me wanting to quit after getting halfway through the second world.  It's not interesting, it really doesn't introduce anything new or exciting, it's just, well, a generic, unmemorable platformer.","June 25, 2014","false","1.4"," 20 of 43 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","20","43","0","4"

This can be avoided by disabling the LAN/WiFi connection on your PC and disconnecting yourself from the internet and then launhing the game. Releasing a game in this state is not right from any company but from the likes of a Triple-A publisher like Ubisoft this is an insult to the paying customer.\n\nIt also cannot be played in fullscreen on 1080p monitors when using AMD graphics cards without significant adjustment either. As standard this game runs at 50hz in fullscreen 1080p forcing a black frame around the screen. This can be fixed by setting up a Custom Resolution in the AMD Catalyst Control Center.\n\nYou can also run the game in windowed mode in which case the game is displayed correctly at 1080p and 60hz, but the game does not have an option for full screen windowed either so this also presents the game in a less than optimal maner. Again there is a fix, and again it involves the use of external applications to fix the problems created uncaring and bad developers, you need an application to firce full screen borderless windowed like "Borderless Gaming" and "Fullscreenizer".\n\nThis of course is not an issue for Nvidia users, Ubisoft are openly backed by Nvidia and their software solutions, it is only an issue for AMD graphics cards.\n\nThis is basic stuff and the developers have made a mess of it. They have had years since the release of the game and still these issues have not been fixed.\n\nThis game is not worth the money, clearly they are not using it to produce complete and working games. Do not buy this game.","June 25, 2014","false","0.2"," 19 of 41 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","19","41","0","2"

Ubisoft makes players' life more... well, intresting. You cannot simply buy the game and play it. It would be too easy. You need uplay installed. You need to download it manually (kill the uplay process first, and then reinstall) as the steam version does not work. Even if you installed the more recent version you still cannot play the damn game because the uplay, when registering the game, says that the connection is not available and you should try again later. It tells the same message every time you try to run the game.\n\nIf you read this to find out whether you should buy the game or not, my advice is: stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from every game Ubisoft hosts in its uplay software.\n\nI really want to play the game as I love the franchise, but I feel like I just lost the money. Again. Next time I'll be more careful and check whether the game I buy use external services such as uplay or origin, or not.\n\nI hope you were more lucky than me if you decided to buy the game.","September 24, 2015","false","1.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

This game was made following Rayman Origins model and work pretty well! of course the detail fit to the type of game this is which is of course not COD Ghosts but it manages to get a really satisfiying quality and the result of years of working on ubisoft really pays off.\n\nMusic: Maybe the best part of the game, the music is simply 1 world: Awesome! You have deep tone balades and some amazing rock for times you just enjoy the moments were you complete a level and you get rewarded with rayman dancing, making the sountrack one of the best available.\n\nStory: The story follows the line of the Rayman series, the world is threaten again and Rayman (and friends) must wake up to save it from the evil (things?) that swarm the peaceful world. Really the story is just a background for the game and does not really affect, every person that have played the previous versions of rayman knows that there's no need for an excuse to kill the bad things and save the good ones.\n\nMetascore: 90/100 "Maybe the actual 39.99 it's a bit high, the game worth it but a sale of 75% it's deffinetly the moment to get this game and you MUST get this game".","March 14, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Funny as well. Though the few annoying ones make this game not worth getting. I feel as if they did not test this game properly. There are these time trial based areas in which you have 40 seconds to save the three teensies. Most of which are doable on around the third or forth try, some take a bit more. However a select few require sitting for maybe an hour or more endlessly trying to even finish. Taking a break doesn't help, you lose the rhythm of the course.  If you want something with sever difficulty curves bend inward, this game is worth a try.

Simple things like not being able to do a charge attack upwards shows how little polish the game has. The running attack mechanic is poorly designed and flings you forward causing you to lose the ability to accurately land after a run attack. You can't "hang" off ledges, which means you will spend a lot of time accidentally running off cliffs when you simply meant to get close to the edge.\n\nCollecting random garbage is NOT fun. The game ranks you based on how many fairies and mini guys you grab but at no point do you feel rewarded for collecting these things. The fairies are ONLY used to unlock characters which don't have any different abilities or anything unique about them. The mini guys that you find unlock levels but having to find 10 of them per level makes the task feel like a chore instead of a game. Overall you spend the majority of your time collecting items that serve little purpose.\n\nEnemies? What enemies? The enemies in this game are WAY too easy. It is almost impossible to die from them as they don't attack back, rarely move, and have such a short range of attack. The game would be more fun if you didn't have an attack button and actually had to land on the enemies heads, at least this would give them a shred of difficulty.\n\nThe saving in this game is absolute trash. Did you just spend 10 minutes collecting all the random garbage in an area. Well you better not die because if you do you will have to collect all of it again. In almost every other modern platformer I have played the things you collect are saved but you are returned to an earlier checkpoint. Making you go back and have to recollect every item is terrible design. Not to mention replaying the music over and over which is annoying to say the least.\n\n90% of the levels are a complete bore and lack creativity.  Each world introduces some new level mechanic but none of these mechanics are really "fun". Flying = boring. Sneaking = boring. Hitting Y to move some element in the level = oh god so boring. Compare this game to any other platformer and you will see more creativity in one level than you would in this entire game.\n\nOverall the game can be summed with two words "not fun". It doesn't hold a candle to  Braid, Super Mario, Little Big Planet and many other modern platformers.  It is a step back in patforming and I am surprised that people have given it such high praise.","July 3, 2014","false","7.2"," 11 of 32 people (34%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","34","11","32","0","1"

Can't go to options page without crashing. Couldn't find any fixes after searching for over an hour. Just a terrible buy esp.  with the 3rd party drm which screws up my bluetooth gamepad. Never had such a bad experience with a game before. It's silly that pirated software works better than this. Would not recommend.\n\nUpdate 1/12 - Have asked for support as of Jan 3 and no reply yet from ubisoft so there's also that. Also, I understand that this review has nothing to do with the game. I'm sure it's a great game, but the fact that the game is unplayable for me makes me unable to recommend it to anyone.\n\nUpdate 1/15 - Received support yesterday after 1 week + of waiting and after about an hour of trying their methods I gave up. Ended up just pirating the game and it ran perfectly. After a few hours, I'd say this game is pretty fun and it is deserving of the positive reviews. I however still can't recommend this for the PC just because of gamebreaking drm.\n\nUpdate 3/10\nFinally finished this game without ever using the official stuff.

Rayman was once considered "just another platform game" but now with Sonic running underwhelming sequels and Mario failing to do anything new or creative since Mario Galaxy, it's Rayman whose ultimately on top and destroying them with what is hands down one of the best examples of a platform game in over a decade.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice about Rayman is the atmosphere. With beautiful hand-drawn artwork and polish that is truly unrivaled, the game gives off an immediate great first impression. Fortunately it doesn't stop there.\n\nLead by great music and fantastic level design, Rayman Legends manages to snag your attention and hold on to it for dear life. Constantly changing things up, every world adds new concepts and eases them in with an old-school "learn by doing" approach.\n\nWith that said, it should be said that this game can get very hard. It starts out easy but very quickly ramps things up. This is of course expected of a Rayman game and wouldn't be one without being as punishing as it is beautiful.\n\nAnd the best part of it all is... content.

The levels are well designed and just as lovely to play. The music varies from Orchestral to Rock, and the 'music' levels will surely get a smile on your face.\n\nBesides the main games, you can also win in-game prizes, such as levels in the worlds of Origins, 'creatures' that give you free lums and much more.\n\nThough the game is originally designed for kids, it is seriously difficult to play. Some levels are never saved inbetween and you seriously have to get it all through in one go... making even me, a rather often playing gamer, really frustrated.\n\nBesides all that the harder levels, are seriously HARD.\n\nI, myself, play on the keyboard, and the 'W' for help and 'S' to hit, arent always as ideal as thought by the designers. Fortunately you can change that in the settings.\n\nIt might sound all really intense, but I would really recommend the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ripshaft/recommended/242550/","Ripshaft","Ripshaft","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ripshaft/","411 products in account","This game is fantastic.\n\nI'm not much of a platform gamer, but I grew up loving the crazy twisted world of the earthworm jim games, and many good games in the early eras of gaming were fairly platform-ish... but basically it's not been a focus for me.\n\nThat said, this game really brought me back and drove home what a great experience the medium can provide.\n\nIt's made by a team composed largely of the people behind the legendary game "Beyond Good and Evil" - if that's not enough to make you moist, you havent played that game, or you have no soul.\n\nIt's dripping with character, and the art is wonderful and consistent, portraying a bizzare, slightly twisted but incredibly bright and joyful world, even in the darkest places. The music is phenomenal, with a wide variety of excellent tracks, including some that are reditions of songs you may be familiar with.\n\nWhat really got me was the well defined worlds and the sheer variety of gameplay mechanics. It seemed at times like every level was introducing a new mechanic, that may or may not be used in further levels - the path of the game is largely non-linear, with difficulty from level to level having little to do with its place in "order".\n\nIt's most definately not a difficult game, it's a very easy to approach platformer, and you'll quickly learn the ins and outs of what they expect from you. Checkpoints are generally numerous, though the game does spice things up as you progress, there's even levels that have no checkpoints whatsoever and are just a long string of potential deaths - this initially was a source of frustration, but after completing my first level like this I couldnt deny that the sense of satisfaction gained by beating the whole thing flawlessly was well worth it, and I'm glad they had it.\n\nIt's quite hard to really convey what's really best about this game, and that's the experience of playing it.\n\nIt's just... fun!\n\nIf there's a demo out, I'd reccomend giving it a go and seeing what you think. I cant imagine you not finding it worth your time and money though.\n\n\nFor long term enjoyment, they have 2 daily and 2 weekly challenges, that are varied in type and setting. While I dont particularily like all of the challenges, they're mostly very enjoyable - the distance based ones, where you're falling down an infinate pit, running up an infinately falling tower, or running across a seemingly infinate level are my favourites, and you'll find yourself rated based on where you stand vs everyone else playing the challenges. You can see the ghost players of other people who have played the challenge who are close to your score, see the markers where they bite it, and generally it just feels solid...\n\nOh yeah, and this game seems to include all the levels from the previous game, Rayman Origins, within the game, so you get 2 games for 1!\n\nAs for negatives... hmmm... well there's one level left that I havent finished that's hard as ♥♥♥♥, though I dont think that counts...\n\nOh I've got one - there's a "creature" system, where you collect creatures occasionally when you beat a level, and they all go into a special room and once a day give out lums (the currency - which are these delightful little smiling bug things)  - and the system seems... pointless... you only get the monsters by beating levels, so you've basically beaten the game when you get them all, and the amount of lums they give is negligible compared to even just doing a normal level or challenge.\n\nAlso the large number of alternate skins for barabara, the female character, are... a bit weird if not downright creepy or offensive at times. Barabara is the character I played as most due to the incredible character design, she's just brimming with a joyful michevious character that really fits the game, and she swings a mean axe... and rayman's kind of silly. But every world you enter has 2 alternate skins for barbara - the first one's pretty tame, but from then on it gets... odd.... There's barabara's that are sexualized (pronounced curves and cleavage) in appearance, and weirder still, when you die in this game you expand and then pop like a baloon - barbara's regular death is fairly normal... but there's 2 skins for her where you get a weirdass panty shot when she dies... it's... weird, man.\n\nBut whatever, lets just blame it on them being french canadian. The game is absolutely phenomenal and any negatives I've encoutered, which are few, are greatly balanced out by the awesome.\n\nSo yeah, try demo, get game, enjoy.","July 21, 2014","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had fun playing this game. I had fun unlocking all the levels in this game. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in modern day, and the music really fits the mood of levels quite well. I just wish you could buy the soundtrack with the game on Steam, but apparantly that would make too much sense.... and that would probably be my only complaint.\n\nBy far the best parts of this game are playing the music-synced levels.

This game continues where Origins left - gameplay and "story" alike. It also adds some things to the formula, like your pixie helper you can raise bridges, cut ropes and eat cake. Also you can be turned into a duck or infiltrate a James-Bondian underwater lair. So far, so Rayman.\n\nIf you played Origins, you already know the new Rayman is a splendid combination of Mario, Sonic and Rayman games in terms of Jump'n'Run, Speedrunning and Wackyness. Legends doubles the fun with perfectly speedrunnable maps, many secrets to find and even Rythm levels. The game is smooth, beautiful and has even more gorgeous soundtracks the the previous title. To the less important additions count a strange monster collecting game and ticket rubbing.\n\nRayman Origins is, in my opinion, the best Jump'n'Run in history. Rayman Legends comes close, but despite the greatness of the levels, the less punishing checkpoint system and the TLC overall, I feel slightly disconnected from the overall story. You can skip worlds and levels and do them in your own order (with boss and rythm levels being an exception) and the feeling of advancement is overshadowed by the "Do whatever you please" attitude. It is probably more fitting for a Rayman game, but Legends cannot quite grasp the tone like Origins did it, where the the transition between the worlds was smooth and logical.\n\nP.S.: James Bondian Laser Security System can be run through without you needed to stop which felt so forking awesome!\n\n","June 26, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game saw the limbless hero of many games in my childhood return to his platformer roots. The game was visually stunning and challenging with a superb soundtrack to boot.\n\nAnd now we have Rayman Legends. This game is quite literally the logical next step for the reboot of this franchise. It still has the cartoony visuals, but this time it looks like you're watching a moving painting instead of a colourful cartoon. The level design is top notch and can be very challenging at times (which led to frustration in my case. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing as it made overcoming these obtacles that much sweeter) and oh my God is the soundtrack even better than the last one. Everything just breathes atmosphere and polish and the attential to graphical detail and the interaction between what happens on the screen and the music/sound design is nothing short of a victory in game design. Well done.\n\nSo, for a fair price you get a whole plethora of levels set in different worlds, loads of collectibles, online rankings (with daily and weekly challenges) and a host of levels from Rayman Origins with updated visuals.\n\nIn short: best platform game in recent memory.

The vector graphics are back and look prettier than ever, there is the addition of a sidekick as well to help you get through some levels.\nThere is a lot to do in this game, each level has 10 teensies to find (The little blue guys), as well as the challenge to find enough lums (The yellow flying guys) to earn the Gold trophy. There are also unlockable characters as well, collectable creatures, unlockable bonus levels from Rayman Origins (each has teensies and trophies to collect) and Time Trial levels as well. If you're a bit of a completionist like I am with these sorts of things, you'll have lots to keep you occupied. There is also the new music levels, which are very much like the chest chasing missions in Origins, completely timing based where you jump or attack in time with the music. These are excellently thought out and the timing is spot-on. These are a bit more forgiving than Origins' chest chasing missions though, having checkpoints rather than making you restart after each death.\nThere are downsides though, this game is a console port and at times it shows, making some actions hard to perform using keyboard if you don't have nimble fingers. It is perfectly playable with the keyboard though and supports full key remapping (Which I suggest you do, I set mine to the Origins controls and it saved me a lot of trouble), but it may be easier to play using a controller. I can't say which is better, since I've only played using keyboard, although you can play one handed using keyboard, leaving your other hand free to do other stuff like eat a sandwich or write a book. It also doesn't really have much replayability, apart from the music levels which are awesome just to play occasionally, unless you are a big Rayman fan. Plus it only works through UPlay, which is not a bad piece of software but it does make things frustrating when you just want to get right into the game.\nOverall, this game is worth picking up, even at full price and the annoying DRM. Graphics are pretty and there is a lot to do. I'm really looking forward to the next game in the series,\n10/10","August 13, 2014","true","34.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are well designed and just as lovely to play. The music varies from Orchestral to Rock, and the 'music' levels will surely get a smile on your face.\n\nBesides the main games, you can also win in-game prizes, such as levels in the worlds of Origins, 'creatures' that give you free lums and much more.\n\nThough the game is originally designed for kids, it is seriously difficult to play. Some levels are never saved inbetween and you seriously have to get it all through in one go... making even me, a rather often playing gamer, really frustrated.\n\nBesides all that the harder levels, are seriously HARD.\n\nI, myself, play on the keyboard, and the 'W' for help and 'S' to hit, arent always as ideal as thought by the designers. Fortunately you can change that in the settings.\n\nIt might sound all really intense, but I would really recommend the game. It's well worth it's money in both time to play and the in-game content (without paying for a DLC).\n","July 5, 2014","true","66.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really recommend a controller.\n\nThat out of the way: WOW\nEasy to pick up and play -  had a stressful day? Play one or two of the music levels and you'll feel releaxed and calm.\nWant a challenge? My controller has toothmarks from some of the time trial levels which get unlocked later on.\nBut still the game is never unfair or discourages you so you just keep coming back until you get that sweet sensation of finally beating the level. And when you have you can go to the daily challenges and compete against other players.\n\nOne thing I like to point out is the level design. Especially in the music levels but also in every other, theres a certain flow. You're almost playing yourself into meditation. Rayman Origins, I felt, had to much backtracking so that you get all the lums and unlocked more stuff. Here you have much less lums you have to collect to get a gold medal, so you can just play the game. Even finding the caged Teensies isn't pulling you out of the flow.\n\nOn top: The visuals are just.... happy. Nothing against dark and gritty games, I love them, but this game is radiating with happiness and joy. In the animations, the background, the enemys.

Excellent audiovisual art direction (music is a work of genius). Whole game can be played cooperatively by 2 players (with fun soccer minigame up to 4 players as a bonus). It gets challenging hard really fast, but repeating is not frustrating - game makes you want to play. At the end of every chapter that consists of typical platforming gameplay there is one "music" level where you have to play according to rhythm of music that is playing - excellent idea, too bad there are so few of those. Technically game has some downsides - max res is 1080p, max framerate is 60HZ. This, of course, is dictated by hand made animations and graphics. Platforming genre, like no other, could really make use of 120Hz and beyond with some motion blur reducing technology (like ULMB) :(\nAnother downside is that Ubisoft insists on putting Uplay on their every game even if you buy it on Steam :(\nThis is the game that converts people into gamers.","February 2, 2014","true","93.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very satisfying when you get it right, exhilierating when you crack the challenge levels, and constantly entertaining. And the musical  levels which end each "world" are just top-class, a welcome reward for your efforts. 10/10.\n\nWorth noting, though, that you have to run the game through UPlay, which is an intolerable piece of bloatware which does nothing but slow the game down.

I find that this is incredibly under-appreciated in the platformer genre these days; the reason Super Meat Boy was challengingly fun, rather than challengingly frustrating was because of it's incredibly tight controls that keep the game feeling fair and fluid, but demanding.\n\nThe musical score is nothing short of incredible once again, with all the digeridoos and kazoos that are associated with the franchise, as well as excellent orchestral pieces.\n\nVisually the game is gorgeous and hilarious. It's just so great to see in motion, the animations are so slick and varied. The style is just so cohesive, like a modern looney toons. The one blatant exception to this are the 3d animated bosses. They really stick out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the game, though they are good and fun in their own way.\n\nLevel design is varied, the world themes are fantastic, and I never got the "ugh, I've had enough of this world/level" feeling I get in some other platformers. I did miss the 'Misquito' flying levels from the first game, but they are adequetly replaced by amazing Musically paced levels at the end of each world.\n\nWhat I didn't know going into this game, was that the 40 remasterd levels from the original are available through a scratch card unlockable-system. You've basically got a whole second game worth of content to play through (including some of those misquito levels I believe), if you didn't play through Origins the first time.\n\nIf you're a fan of the sidescrolling platformer genre, this is a must play.","December 19, 2013","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Excellent audiovisual art direction (music is a work of genius). Whole game can be played cooperatively by 2 players (with fun soccer minigame up to 4 players as a bonus). It gets challenging hard really fast, but repeating is not frustrating - game makes you want to play. At the end of every chapter that consists of typical platforming gameplay there is one "music" level where you have to play according to rhythm of music that is playing - excellent idea, too bad there are so few of those. Technically game has some downsides - max res is 1080p, max framerate is 60HZ. This, of course, is dictated by hand made animations and graphics. Platforming genre, like no other, could really make use of 120Hz and beyond with some motion blur reducing technology (like ULMB) :(\nAnother downside is that Ubisoft insists on putting Uplay on their every game even if you buy it on Steam :(\nThis is the game that converts people into gamers.","February 2, 2014","true","93.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's high-paced and essentially very simple, but the inclusion of challenges and collectables add a layer of sophistication.\n\nRhythm runs right at the heart of Rayman - a perfect level run is a beautiful, flowing experience. Very satisfying when you get it right, exhilierating when you crack the challenge levels, and constantly entertaining. And the musical  levels which end each "world" are just top-class, a welcome reward for your efforts. 10/10.\n\nWorth noting, though, that you have to run the game through UPlay, which is an intolerable piece of bloatware which does nothing but slow the game down. Not a game-changer, but certainly something which should be complained about.","December 24, 2013","true","64.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are well designed and just as lovely to play. The music varies from Orchestral to Rock, and the 'music' levels will surely get a smile on your face.\n\nBesides the main games, you can also win in-game prizes, such as levels in the worlds of Origins, 'creatures' that give you free lums and much more.\n\nThough the game is originally designed for kids, it is seriously difficult to play. Some levels are never saved inbetween and you seriously have to get it all through in one go... making even me, a rather often playing gamer, really frustrated.\n\nBesides all that the harder levels, are seriously HARD.\n\nI, myself, play on the keyboard, and the 'W' for help and 'S' to hit, arent always as ideal as thought by the designers. Fortunately you can change that in the settings.\n\nIt might sound all really intense, but I would really recommend the game. It's well worth it's money in both time to play and the in-game content (without paying for a DLC).\n","July 5, 2014","true","66.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The vector graphics are back and look prettier than ever, there is the addition of a sidekick as well to help you get through some levels.\nThere is a lot to do in this game, each level has 10 teensies to find (The little blue guys), as well as the challenge to find enough lums (The yellow flying guys) to earn the Gold trophy. There are also unlockable characters as well, collectable creatures, unlockable bonus levels from Rayman Origins (each has teensies and trophies to collect) and Time Trial levels as well. If you're a bit of a completionist like I am with these sorts of things, you'll have lots to keep you occupied. There is also the new music levels, which are very much like the chest chasing missions in Origins, completely timing based where you jump or attack in time with the music. These are excellently thought out and the timing is spot-on. These are a bit more forgiving than Origins' chest chasing missions though, having checkpoints rather than making you restart after each death.\nThere are downsides though, this game is a console port and at times it shows, making some actions hard to perform using keyboard if you don't have nimble fingers. It is perfectly playable with the keyboard though and supports full key remapping (Which I suggest you do, I set mine to the Origins controls and it saved me a lot of trouble), but it may be easier to play using a controller. I can't say which is better, since I've only played using keyboard, although you can play one handed using keyboard, leaving your other hand free to do other stuff like eat a sandwich or write a book. It also doesn't really have much replayability, apart from the music levels which are awesome just to play occasionally, unless you are a big Rayman fan. Plus it only works through UPlay, which is not a bad piece of software but it does make things frustrating when you just want to get right into the game.\nOverall, this game is worth picking up, even at full price and the annoying DRM. Graphics are pretty and there is a lot to do. I'm really looking forward to the next game in the series,\n10/10","August 13, 2014","true","34.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeMarCanlan/recommended/242550/","GeMarCanlan","DEEP.Va","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeMarCanlan/","326 products in account","I loved Rayman Origins, completing it 100%, and consider it one of my favourite games. With that in mind, Rayman Legends is better. In every way, Legends has improved upon the formula from the previous one, itself a worthy and excellent successor to the classic Rayman games of old. With the power of the beautiful UbiArt engine, this is a uniquely pretty game. I sometimes find myself stopping to watch the backgrounds of the levels, before continuing on a mad, frenetic and incredibly fun romp through the fantastic landscapes. The music is also excellent, with the musical levels being particular standouts. These levels are strictly platforming, with the only cues for your jumping and punching being the music and occasional markers on the ground. They are tough, but even if you die, there are frequent respawn points to keep you in the action. This fits the game on the whole- it's grueling, but the respawns are fast and the lives are infinite. It's possible to rush through the levels while only collecting what crosses your path, but there are secrets all around which require some exploration to find.\n\nThis leads to my complaints about this game. Yes, I love it, but it's not perfect. Firstly, the Teensies and other collectables. They are hidden, yes, but usually not very well. There are some that I've found and thought were harder or more clever than the norm, but on the whole it's not hard to collect everything. It just requires some thoroughness. Second, Origins had a speedrun feature, where beating a level gave you the option to replay it with no checkpoints, and a medal if you finished within time. This added some good replayability, and while you can still run through levels in Legends, there's no speedrun feature. There are special short invasion levels which time you and post your time to a global leaderboard, which is cool, but ultimately I would have liked for the speedrunning to be available on normal levels too. Thirdly, I've had two levels actually glitch out on me. The second music level has a segment where you jump off a large cliff and fall, and my game does not allow me to do this properly- I die mid drop because the screen scrolls too fast for me to survive. I managed to get around this by pausing and unpausing repeatedly during the fall, but this is a fairly major problem. As well, the third music level has a section where you run through a skull, and come out the other side shrunken. The first time I played this level, when I ran into the skull, I died. Every time. The next time I loaded the level, it worked fine, but I was left thinking it would be uncompleteable. Perhaps the first bug is due to me playing on a laptop, but nothing else in the game has done that, so i have no idea. Finallly, my last problem is UPlay. 'Nuff said. I personally have had no real problems with it, but it's still annoying and unneccessary, and many people do have major problems. So keep that in mind when considering this game.\n\nIn conclusion, Rayman Legends is fantastic and I love it and it's one of my favourite games, but it has got problems, and I recognise that. Still highly recommending it, 10/10.","August 18, 2014","true","25.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/acidreign2/recommended/242550/","acidreign2","AcidReign","http://steamcommunity.com/id/acidreign2/","459 products in account","Rayman Legends is a fun, addictive game, that improves upon the originals with slightly improved graphics using the beautiful UbiArt Engine. The level design as well music are fantastic, A few shortcoming held it back from completle greatness, but I still thorougly enjoyed it.\n\nForemost, the interesting level design really shines with the varied levels that you have to overcome. The goals is always the same if not slight different. Rescue a certain number of teensies by finding the secret rooms as well as scouring the level for invisible walls and areas . The journey is accomplishing this and there is nothing better then finding them all  and getting 100% on the level. Other levels of interest are the boss levels as well as the timed ones that keep the variety up. Continuing on, the music levels that you find at the end of each area in the game are fabulous and are always something to look forward to as well as challenging in their own right. Lastly, the simple fair gameplay and tight controls. Everything required for a great platformer. Xbox controller is what I used and what I would recommend althought I'm sure keyboard works fine.\n\nFor the negatives I wouldn't really say they are complete negatives, but something that people like me will have to learn to live with. There is a lot of online/leaderboard type integration. There are dailies and weeklies. They are indeed fun and definetly challenging. By doing them you are rewarded with lums which are used for unlocking differnt characters in the game that you can play as.The majority can be unlocked just by beating the game but there are a few that require you to do them for awhile. Although I have no idea if these characters are worth the effort or if there mere recolors they are considered superior in terms of cost and I would assume they are pretty good. The positives of this is there is added gametime to the game as well as a stretch goal if you really enjoy it. The negative is not everything is unlocked right after beating the game which means you were probably wont go back unless you really are dedicated. Definetly the most frustrating thing would have to be the Back to Origins levels. While all the good levels in the original Rayman Origins are included they are not unlocked right away. You will unlock all of them sometime after you've beaten the game which means you cant play them in their original order until then. This is extremely frustating as after you beat the final boss and done the extra world the last thing you want to do is go back and 100% those levels that you have done before if you played the original. It would of been a lot better if they were unlocked in order after beating each area of the main game. At the very least I am happy they are included in game as extra content and I applaud the devolopers for not making someone purchase Rayman Legends if they want to experience it.\n\nKind of ranted on about the negatives, but I figure people know or have heard about how great is and should hear a different side. Definetly worth the puchase!\n\n8.5/10\n","April 13, 2014","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Absolutely fantastic. This is EXACTLY how you make a sequel to a good game!\n\nFirstly, the artwork of the game is just like Rayman Origins, only there's a lot more detail going on here to make the colors and art style mesh a bit more together. That being said, the artwork is beautiful and despite the main characters' very colorful, silly appearance, the settings and areas match them so well that it's hard to say that they feel out of place. The music is just as good, and also brings a more thematic feel to the game, seeing as how Legends takes a bit more of a civilization styled world as opposed to the open wilderness areas that Origins featured. The soundtrack fits each world nicely, nailing a variety of genres and styles almost perfectly. My only complaints with the music would be the oddly off-putting Invasion level songs, which don't seem as urgent as they're supposed to feel.\n\nAs a modern platformer game, the amount of levels in the game is extremely important, and Legends most certainly didn't disappoint. There's TONS of levels in the game spanning over five unique worlds, and for those who dearly miss the content from Rayman: Origins, there's 60 levels from Origins included in the game to satisfy both crowds. Legends' levels also add a bit more challenge to the levels which partly secures my previous complaint on the easiness of Origins' levels. Though some levels still did feel a bit too easy, I feel the challenge is still decent in the game for what it was going for; a game to please both casual and hardcore players.\n\nThe amount of unlockables in the game is a great deal more than Origins, but it is a bit lacking. Once you've unlocked all of the normal levels, and the Origins levels, the only other things to get include costumes for the four main characters, though they aren't that special as many of the costumes follow a set theme with each of the characters, such as a Knight costume for Rayman and Globox, a Caveman costume for the Teensies, Rayman and Globox, a Dark Rayman and Dark Globox costume, etc. As far as the methods to unlock them go, it all depends on how much you've played the game as most of the costumes are locked behind a set amount of Lums collected to unlock them, going all the way up to 1 million lums for the final Rayman costume. Collecting all 700 Teensies also rewards you with a costume, which I think is pretty underwhelming. Though the Warrior Princess characters are just different costumes for Barbara, I do like the different amounts of variety in clothing, hair styles and colors they use with each of them. It's a nice touch and they at least added more than 2 extra costumes for Rayman this time.\n\nThe game plays very fluently, the controls are very well thought out and easy to use, so most of the gameplay is reliant on the player's skill. I've never felt like any death in the game was on part of bad level design or poor control design as they're damn good. I would recommend that people play the game with a gamepad though as playing with the keyboard can get a bit awkward.\n\nSpeaking of level design and levels, the way they presented the levels in each of the worlds was fantastic. Although each world spanned across at least 10 different paintings that counted as levels, I felt as though I was transitioning from one part of the world's story to the next. Additionally I will say that each world seems to have it's own story, rather than seeming like each world is connected somehow. It makes it seem like each world is separate from the others moreso than just in setting and appearance and gives the game some actual life and a sense of freedom and adventure despite being in a large tent with a bunch of old, crusty paintings.\n\nMy absolute favorite part of this game that got me hyped were the ingenious music levels, where every action int he level is set to the beat and rhythm of a song, remixed in a very special way for each world's music level. Though there's only a handful of music levels in the game, I feel like this isn't a bad thing as each music level plays out fantastically. The look of sheer joy on my face when I realized that the song playing in the level Castle Rock was a Rayman style remix of "Black Betty" is something I can never forget. And although the music levels are seen as the biggest selling point of Rayman Legends, Ubisoft went the extra mile to ensure that they put effort in all of the levels, and used the music levels as a lure for players, which makes the game that much richer in the experience.\n\nIn terms of story, I'm willing to forgive Rayman Legends for its very basic storyline. Rayman games never exactly had a great story to them, and the fact that there's no set canon of the Rayman games just adds to the charm, which this game is chock full of. The basic goal of the game seems to intertwine itself with the individual stories that come along with each of the worlds.\n\nThe Challenges and Kung Foot modes of the game add a bit more of a competitive side to Rayman Legends. Competing in different challenges every day and week for a chance to be seen at the top of the leaderboards is very nice, but I feel the PC version's Challenge mode is sort of sullied with the rise of many cheaters, especially in timed Challenges. I don't consider timed Challenges of any sort to be very serious on the PC version as people just cheat to get sub 10-second times as opposed to the people who actually have skill and talent in the game. Lum collection and Distance endurance challenges are just fine though as it's very hard to seem like one's cheating at these challenges as they can be done at one's own pace.\n\nI don't have any experience with Kung Foot though as I haven't had the chance to play this game with multiple people.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is absolutely fantastic. Rayman Legends is a damn good example of how to make an excellent sequel to a good game. Legends builds upon the foundation and base of the original Rayman Origins and addresses many other issues that Origins had and aims very high to correct them. I would certainly say that Rayman Legends is much better than Origins, despite Origins also being an excellent game in its own right.\n\nOh, as an additional warning, you have to make a separate U-Play account in order to play the game from Steam, which I honestly find annoying and a little pointless.\n\nOverall I'd give this game a 10/10\n\n","April 5, 2014","true","59.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is so amazing I don't know how to even convey my impressions, which are positive in every possible way. The game has everything you would want from a sequel to Rayman Origins: a lot of levels full of crazy platforming, fun challenges and smooth difficulty curve, beautiful art style which manages to blend parallax 2D sceneries with 3D bosses perfectly, and the music which is not only amazing on its own, but fits the style of the game perfectly and highlights the crazyness of the action. The game even has a good share of levels from Rayman Origins added as a bonus, reworked to feel like a part of the new game experience (even those annoying mosquito levels aren't annoying anymore).\n\nAnd yes, Rayman Legends has its amount of re used assets from Rayman Origins, both graphics and sound wise, but it is still an astonishing game with a lot of new good stuff added to the mix.\n\nAll in all: well designed, well executed and damn compelling.","September 10, 2013","true","38.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was originally a Wii-U game, utilizing the touch-pad on the Wii-U for certain segments of the game. In this PC port, these segments still exist - rather than redesign the level to be more fun platforming sections, instead they ham-fistedly added a "press Y to do a thing" function that makes these sections occasionally fiddly and tedious.\nOther than that, this is more of the same (quite literally, as a good few dozen of Origin's levels make it into this one too as a bonus). Excellent music, theming and platforming. Highly recommend either of the recent Rayman games for any fans of platformers.","June 27, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's hard to put in words how highly I praise this game. The level design is near perfect for a classical platformer. This, paired with great music, art design, and controls, results in one of the best platforming titles of this generation.\n\nNot counting the gameplay, my favorite part of Legends is how the game is broken up into worlds (which, in itself, is a design choise dating back to 1985, but I digress).  Each world has its own theme and model swap of enemies, making each chapter seem like a new game; even though these are losely connected into the over-arching story, they have their own, subtle sub-plots.\n\nUp to this point, I've only mentioned the gameplay in passing, mostly because there's not much to criticize about it. Rayman handles like you would expect him to (most of the time) and never feels too stiff.  At times, Legends can be a little on the easy side, mostly because you have unlimited lives and frequent checkpoints, but is balanced out by the difficulty of the secondary objectives. This game is great for completionists, and you can put a good amount of time into grinding out the last few unlockable cosmetic characters that you wouldn't otherwise have by just completing the game.\n\nI don't have a good place in this review to mention the musical levels, but they're pretty fun and a nice change of pace.\nUbisoft also posts daily and weekly challenges with worldwide scoreboards, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\n9/10, would recommend in a second.","November 23, 2015","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ripshaft/recommended/242550/","Ripshaft","Ripshaft","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ripshaft/","411 products in account","This game is fantastic.\n\nI'm not much of a platform gamer, but I grew up loving the crazy twisted world of the earthworm jim games, and many good games in the early eras of gaming were fairly platform-ish... but basically it's not been a focus for me.\n\nThat said, this game really brought me back and drove home what a great experience the medium can provide.\n\nIt's made by a team composed largely of the people behind the legendary game "Beyond Good and Evil" - if that's not enough to make you moist, you havent played that game, or you have no soul.\n\nIt's dripping with character, and the art is wonderful and consistent, portraying a bizzare, slightly twisted but incredibly bright and joyful world, even in the darkest places. The music is phenomenal, with a wide variety of excellent tracks, including some that are reditions of songs you may be familiar with.\n\nWhat really got me was the well defined worlds and the sheer variety of gameplay mechanics. It seemed at times like every level was introducing a new mechanic, that may or may not be used in further levels - the path of the game is largely non-linear, with difficulty from level to level having little to do with its place in "order".\n\nIt's most definately not a difficult game, it's a very easy to approach platformer, and you'll quickly learn the ins and outs of what they expect from you. Checkpoints are generally numerous, though the game does spice things up as you progress, there's even levels that have no checkpoints whatsoever and are just a long string of potential deaths - this initially was a source of frustration, but after completing my first level like this I couldnt deny that the sense of satisfaction gained by beating the whole thing flawlessly was well worth it, and I'm glad they had it.\n\nIt's quite hard to really convey what's really best about this game, and that's the experience of playing it.\n\nIt's just... fun!\n\nIf there's a demo out, I'd reccomend giving it a go and seeing what you think. I cant imagine you not finding it worth your time and money though.\n\n\nFor long term enjoyment, they have 2 daily and 2 weekly challenges, that are varied in type and setting. While I dont particularily like all of the challenges, they're mostly very enjoyable - the distance based ones, where you're falling down an infinate pit, running up an infinately falling tower, or running across a seemingly infinate level are my favourites, and you'll find yourself rated based on where you stand vs everyone else playing the challenges. You can see the ghost players of other people who have played the challenge who are close to your score, see the markers where they bite it, and generally it just feels solid...\n\nOh yeah, and this game seems to include all the levels from the previous game, Rayman Origins, within the game, so you get 2 games for 1!\n\nAs for negatives... hmmm... well there's one level left that I havent finished that's hard as ♥♥♥♥, though I dont think that counts...\n\nOh I've got one - there's a "creature" system, where you collect creatures occasionally when you beat a level, and they all go into a special room and once a day give out lums (the currency - which are these delightful little smiling bug things)  - and the system seems... pointless... you only get the monsters by beating levels, so you've basically beaten the game when you get them all, and the amount of lums they give is negligible compared to even just doing a normal level or challenge.\n\nAlso the large number of alternate skins for barabara, the female character, are... a bit weird if not downright creepy or offensive at times. Barabara is the character I played as most due to the incredible character design, she's just brimming with a joyful michevious character that really fits the game, and she swings a mean axe... and rayman's kind of silly. But every world you enter has 2 alternate skins for barbara - the first one's pretty tame, but from then on it gets... odd.... There's barabara's that are sexualized (pronounced curves and cleavage) in appearance, and weirder still, when you die in this game you expand and then pop like a baloon - barbara's regular death is fairly normal... but there's 2 skins for her where you get a weirdass panty shot when she dies... it's... weird, man.\n\nBut whatever, lets just blame it on them being french canadian. The game is absolutely phenomenal and any negatives I've encoutered, which are few, are greatly balanced out by the awesome.\n\nSo yeah, try demo, get game, enjoy.","July 21, 2014","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is fantastic, topped off only by having a few special levels that revolve around the music. The game is packed with a lot of fun and a lot of laughs, I love Origins and Legends is certainly a worthy sequel with a lot of charm to it.\n\nOther platformers certainly seem to have gotten lazy with their games, where one would struggle to know which one is which if they didnt' see the title screen. This one shows effort and is worth the buy. I cannot reccomend this game enough if you like platformers whether it be Sonic, Mario, Commander Keen,  previous Rayman titles etc.\n\nIt's a great co-op and solo game and don't worry unlike the New Super Mario Bros games, you do not bounce off eachother, you actually have moves to help. You can slap one another ...but, if used right it can actually save your butt.\n\nIt's worth noting both Rayman Legends and Origin are worth having together, there are SOME levels from Origins you unlock in Legends. But there's a lot of fun to have with both- so get on it!\n\nDRM NOTE:\nThis game requires Uplay to launch, which is incredibly irritating. On top of steam a mini-Uplay client needs to boot and often you'll find yourself waiting for Uplay to update before you get a chance to play your game. This counter productive move really ruins the whole idea of steam keeping games up to date when Ubisofts -DRM ontop of DRM- has to update seperately so it can triple check you're not a thief. This is of course is only highlighing my frustration when you know there's pirates playing this who do not have to sit through any of this and just enjoy the game that they didn't pay for but I did.","May 22, 2014","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Awesome platform that always caught my attention. I'm glad to see Rayman has been remade for the PC.\n\nThis game has no graphic options at all but it doesn't need it because its a 2D platform with amazing graphics and art design. It's very well programmed and the colors are eye catching and beautiful.\n\nThe characters in the game of course is Rayman and now you can unlock Hero's to play which feels slightly different then playing Rayman. Each hero has many skins to unlock as well.\nThe enemys are well desgined and some look really epic and deadly.\n\nThe controls are simple. I use a USB 360 controller of course and the game's physics and mechanics are not difficult to figure out and is actually programmed rather well. The movement is simple and basic but yet one wrong move equals instant death. Game is playable to a 5 year old but becomes difficult enough for an adult while a child can still enjoy the difficulty as the game progresses.\n\nThe platforms are awesome and the levels are super creative its almost genius. Lots of hidden secrets in every level.\nThere are so many levels to play and unlock its insane how much work was put into the length of the game. You simply cannot get bored but many breaks will be taken.\n\nThe sound effects are neat. While the music really sells it for me. There is also an online type challenge everyday and one that lasts 7 days. You compete for the Bronze, Silver or Gold cup. Which is great if you like a good challenge.\n\nI'm running this game on an AMD ASUS Sabertooth 990 FX, AMD 8-Core, 16gb Ram, Nvidia GT 750 2gb LP. Windows 7\nno issues at all running this game or any crashes.\n\nYes this game does require Uplay which I wasnt a fan of awhile back but who cares it doesnt hurt anything having it installed just don't use it as a main client. Keep using Steam. Uplay only launches when you launch a game that requires Uplay. After you done playing close it. Steam still records your hours played however Uplay is where your achievments are unlocked and recorded unfortunatly. This shouldn't stop you from enjoying the game though. It's worth the time and effort.\nI purchased during the Steam Summer sale for 12$ org price was $29.99. It also included Rayman Orgins for 3$ I believe which was an absolute steal. Highly recommend buying this game. If you can wait buy it during a steam event.\n\nOverall 10/10\n\nLook up some gameplay on youtube just to see the greatness Rayman has to offer. :)","August 23, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are challenging but not impossible, and makes the right choice to have there be varying rewards based on how well you do, rather than make every level a pass/fail.\n\nOne of the best parts of it is that there's no real penalty for dying.  Other players can just shoot you, and you're back.  This means that I can play it with my 5 year old and 7 year old, and we all have fun.  Sure, I'm getting most of the lums, but they're having a blast, too.\n\nI'm not as big a fan of the challenges.  They're repetitive, and I felt like I was grinding out my million lums by the end.  There's also the problem that there are so many cheaters that a platinum result in the challenges is basically impossible, so it makes it an even longer grind.\n\nBy far the biggest problem, though, is the lack of multiple saves.  I couldn't play my own game, and then start over again with my kids.  If you want to start over, you need to delete your entire save.  That means multiple people can't really have their own games.  It's a huge flaw, and something the first game didn't do.\n\nScore: 8.5/10","July 3, 2015","true","76.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He doesn't have a neck or limbs, but that doesn't prevent him from being a platform household name. His first game back in 1995 was full of original gameplay concepts that kept you hooked, despite the game's brutal difficulty. The game was such as succes that sequels followed after a few years. As great as those were, they were subject to the '3D rule' that departed from the classic side-scrolling worlds of old and offered 3D worlds instead.\n\nAfter the succes of games like New Super Mario Bros. in recent years, many platformer series started to explore the good old realm of 2D platforming again, a realm lost somewhere in the late 90s. Rayman did it with the fantastic Rayman Origins (also on Steam, check it out if you have not already). Origins was a welcome game in 2011, as we hadn't really seen Ubisoft's mascot in a while. It was an old-fashioned 2D platformer like the 1995 classic, but also brought in elements from the 3D sequels. What Origins did better than many games in the new generation of sidescrollers, though, was that it also had new additions to the series of its own.\n\nOther genre icons often kept innovation limited to 3D games, using the 2D entries to provide a nostalgic feel of familiarity. Origins was different. It was quirkier, more experimental, more anarchic in both gameplay and visuals, while also remaining true to its 90s roots.\n\nBuilding from the same engine as Origins, Legends controls and feels very similar to its predecessor, yet somehow it also manages to feel fresh. What makes it so fun is that each level feels different and new gameplay elements are contstantly added, adding additional depth to the cleverly designed levels. At one point you're jumping through the desert along the beat of 'Eye of the Tiger' while later you might find yourself running vertically along a wall being chased by dragons. For a true fun fest you can gather some friends around and play cooperatively. Too bad there's still no online mode for this.\n\nThis is especially painful when you notice how big and robust of a package Legends otherwise is. There's plenty of  unlockable characters, which unfortunately have very little variation in both appearance and gameplay. More interesting are the levels you can unlock. Additional levels are unlocked if you collect more fairies and free more Teensies (your friends). The game has new weekly challenges to satisfy even ardent platform fans. The game even throws in a selection of the best levels from Origins as an unlockable extra. These are tweaked just so that you don't quite get the same experience as in the previous game.\n\nThe presentation is even better than in Origins. While I found that game to be one of the prettiest I ever played, Legends is even more detailed and dynamic than its predecessor, without changing much in terms of Rayman's distinct style. I could not have imagined a 2D game even more stunning than Origins, but Legends somehow manages it. Legends truly shows that there's really no limit to what can be achieved with today's 2D graphics in HD resolutions. The musical score is gorgeous and fully orchestrated. The tunes are a little similar, even when compared with Origins. There could have been a little more variety. Still, this is a soundtrack with a level of quality that most platformers don't have, just like in 1995.\n\nRayman Legends is just sheer fun, especially with friends. While not a drastic departure from the already impressive Origins, Legends still manages to provide a bigger, more polished package. If you can look past the lack of variety in characters or the lack of an online coop mode, there's is simply no better side-scrolling platformer available at the moment. This is the combination of art direction, gameplay and creativity that is rare in the genre these days. Rayman could just have taken the easy route and use the 'retro IS the appeal' mantra so common these days. Instead, Rayman Legends is also a modern game at the same time. Don't waste your time and money on the latest same old New Super Mario Bros. Rayman is where it's really at right now. Sorry, Nintendo, but Ubisoft beats you where you used to excel.\n\n9,5/10","June 15, 2015","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rayman is at it again as he traverses 80 creative and often hilarious levels to save the world from nightmares. You'll be swimming, flying, transforming and more through 8 incredibly stylish and unique worlds. With each level you will surely be trying something new, with a huge variety of gameplay mechanics involved.\n\nLevel designs are incredibly fun and fast paced, including musical levels where your actions are synchronized with the music. While we're on this topic, the score is awesome. There is everything from tropical ukulele driven tunes to stealthy James Bond-esque ballads. Did I mention this game is really pretty? Especially the remastered throwback levels where the detail is immense.\n\nDon't even get me started on replay value. Not only are there 120 levels to master, but in each there are plenty of collectables and secret areas. Online challenges also ensure the introduction of fresh new content EVERY DAY. Finally, the ending includes the most creative credits sequence I have ever seen. Never have credits been so much fun.\n\nThere are only two minor gripes I have with the game. There is no online multiplayer co-op, and there is Uplay integration, meaning you must create a Ubisoft account in order to start the game. Otherwise this game is absolutely brilliant.","May 28, 2014","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are challenging but not impossible, and makes the right choice to have there be varying rewards based on how well you do, rather than make every level a pass/fail.\n\nOne of the best parts of it is that there's no real penalty for dying.  Other players can just shoot you, and you're back.  This means that I can play it with my 5 year old and 7 year old, and we all have fun.  Sure, I'm getting most of the lums, but they're having a blast, too.\n\nI'm not as big a fan of the challenges.  They're repetitive, and I felt like I was grinding out my million lums by the end.  There's also the problem that there are so many cheaters that a platinum result in the challenges is basically impossible, so it makes it an even longer grind.\n\nBy far the biggest problem, though, is the lack of multiple saves.  I couldn't play my own game, and then start over again with my kids.  If you want to start over, you need to delete your entire save.  That means multiple people can't really have their own games.  It's a huge flaw, and something the first game didn't do.\n\nScore: 8.5/10","July 3, 2015","true","76.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are challenging but not impossible, and makes the right choice to have there be varying rewards based on how well you do, rather than make every level a pass/fail.\n\nOne of the best parts of it is that there's no real penalty for dying.  Other players can just shoot you, and you're back.  This means that I can play it with my 5 year old and 7 year old, and we all have fun.  Sure, I'm getting most of the lums, but they're having a blast, too.\n\nI'm not as big a fan of the challenges.  They're repetitive, and I felt like I was grinding out my million lums by the end.  There's also the problem that there are so many cheaters that a platinum result in the challenges is basically impossible, so it makes it an even longer grind.\n\nBy far the biggest problem, though, is the lack of multiple saves.  I couldn't play my own game, and then start over again with my kids.  If you want to start over, you need to delete your entire save.  That means multiple people can't really have their own games.  It's a huge flaw, and something the first game didn't do.\n\nScore: 8.5/10","July 3, 2015","true","76.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you create an account with them (Uplay) in order to get the game started you have to have a game key. Well to save you some time and aggravation, once you have downloaded the game look underneath your DLC and youll see that the game key has been installed and then cick on that to copy the game key to the Uplay window that prompts you for said game key. Then you should be good to go. Im new to that whole process with having to download a game like that, so it might have been the obvious thing to do but for someone who has never had to do anything like that before it was aggravating.

This was originally a Wii-U game, utilizing the touch-pad on the Wii-U for certain segments of the game. In this PC port, these segments still exist - rather than redesign the level to be more fun platforming sections, instead they ham-fistedly added a "press Y to do a thing" function that makes these sections occasionally fiddly and tedious.\nOther than that, this is more of the same (quite literally, as a good few dozen of Origin's levels make it into this one too as a bonus). Excellent music, theming and platforming. Highly recommend either of the recent Rayman games for any fans of platformers.","June 27, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I paid about $10 for it and it took me about 6 hours to finish. That 6 hours is only playing through the Rayman Legends levels, not the levels from Rayman Origins which are unlockable in this game.","June 27, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It offers a clean experience without being too pure, it's loaded with goodies without getting bloated under the weight, and it stands out with its own signature rather than rely excessively on classic gaming references and nostalgia (excluding the 8-bit levels of course.)  The game is just right, just plain fun, and it never outstays its welcome.  A rare example of its kind, it's a delight for the casual and the hardcore alike.","July 25, 2015","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The platformer action is fast-paced and at some points, really challenging and the collectibles are plentiful. If I had to say one thing that's truly amazing, it's the music. I can't help but whistle it anytime, anywhere.","December 24, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, this game reminded me of the exact reason why I got into video games in the first place. It is just pure fun and amazement, constantly showing innovative and creative ideas. Every single level adds something new to the table and the mechanics are refined and polished. The reward system is great as well, giving you the incentive to keep on trying for that high score, or trophy, or extra levels. It's a simple shame that this game does not have any steam support (besides launching in Uplay, a terrible DRM system by ubisoft) so I cannot see all the many achievments I would have wracked up. However there is a sort of online vs play with scores, and if you enjoyed a game like dustforce for that aspect I could see you enjoying this as well. Bottom line is: buy it for single player or buy it for multiplayer, but if you like sidescrolling platformers, fun action, and incredible visuals and music there is no reason for you not to have this game.","September 11, 2013","true","74.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved Rayman Origins, and I'm tempted to say this is the better game, overall.  The level design is both more creative and flows a lot better than Origins, even when it was at its best.  I'm also glad they replaced the time-trial challenges for each level with specific speed-run challenge levels.  My least favorite part of Origins were those timed runs -- the base levels really weren't designed for speedrunning, so trying to beat them in a set time limit without dying was more awkward and frustrating than challenging or fun.  The speed-run challenge levels here are short and play almost like platforming rhythm puzzles.  Speaking of rhythm -- the music levels are amazing!  By far the most memorable part of the game, and they add a lot of anticipation as you work to unlock them.  It's also one of the most beautiful games I've ever played.  The special effects, shaders, and 3D assets meld perfectly with the overall 2D aesthetic.  I wish more games looked and played this well!","May 24","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's beautiful, the music is great, and it's not too easy or hard.  My greatest love of the series is that it's always so silly!\nMy one complaint is, and I don't know if this had to do with uPlay or my fault or what-have-you, but I 99.99%-ed the game (I got every character except Rayomz) but then when my computer broke, I went to play on my new one and my progress was all lost!  For other games though, like Super Meat Boy, it saves progress from device to device.\nAside from my bad experience, I highly reccommend this game.","April 20","true","55.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
