The animations are fluid and level design is very well done. The only issue I have with it is that teleportation is very hard to control, it could've been designed to be more responsive.\n\nOther than that, I highly recommend this game, it is fun, challenging and addictive. If you're interested in this by looking at the screenshots, then don't hesitate to buy it. You won't regret it.","August 19, 2015","true","3.3"," 101 of 154 people (66%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","66","101","154","15","5"

Its broken past level 9 and after looking around on forums the problem has been there since release and theyve done nothing to fix it as they have said its an nvidia problem. such a shame. this game is incredible on ps4 but another example of the ♥♥♥♥ end of the stick that happens with pc ports :(","March 19","false","0.5"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

Paid way more than I should have because I was so excited to play it. Great graphics, beautiful music, the default controls were counterintuitive but was able to customize those easily enough once I figured out how to best lay the controls out.\n\nPlayed through the first 8 levels without a problem. Level 9 refuses to load. Publisher blames Nvidia's Win 10 driver. Widespread problem but nobody seems to care or be able to do anything about it. This problem has been going on now since August of 2015 with no resolution in sight.\n\nGreat game. Has the makings to be a true stand out title that is at the same time familiar and innovative. A spiritual successor to the original Metroid games. Unfortunately, I can not recommend due to the fact that this game is simply broken and abondoned at this point... What a pity, too.","March 18","false","2.0"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

It's so much fun and intuitive on both systems. I even purchased the Soundtrack on Itunes and then even Velocity Ultra on PSVita. So when I had the chance to purchase this game on PC, I jumped for it. but sadly with Windows 10 and an Nvidia graphics card, it crashes on level 9.\n\nI've contacted the developer and they said they couldn't do anything because nvidia didn't extend their help to them and then I contacted Nvidia. I told them about this and provided as much information as possible and that didn't amount to anything either. Might as well just take this game down from steam and leave it on consoles where it belongs anyway.\n\nOnly brightside is the artbook...","April 30","false","0.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","3"

It plays smooth and fast and it's very, very refined. You can complete levels pretty easily but earning high scores is a different matter - you'll need all your skills.\nThe sidescrolling sections are actually a very good addition and blend perfectly with the top-down shooter\puzzle hybrid.\nVelocity's story is entirely skippable, but Lt. Kai tana is a very likable and determined character, so at least there's some context to the action.\n\nRecommended, it's an incredibly tight and enjoyable game. Bonus points for the nice, colored graphics and the driving electronic OST.","September 11, 2015","true","8.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

There is an unresolved known issue (see forum.)\n\nAn enjoyable shmup/metroidvania mashup or a demanding 2D speedrunner, depending on your aptitude.  Kb&m is supported, but it's mostly tuned for gamepad.\n\nThe game's main gimmick is the teleport ability.  You can go through walls, make shortcuts by dynamic warp points, or even fling teleport targets into otherwise inaccessible areas in the platformer section.\n\nIt fits surprisingly well in the shmup/platformer scheme of things, and the game encourages experimentation and exploration with secrets and unlockables scattered across 50 levels.  The time limit is loose enough so that you can mostly forget about it and have ~10 hours of casual fun by fiddling with and getting better at the unique mechanic, taking in the gorgeous artwork and uplifting soundtrack as you go.\n\nThe platformer section is a brilliant addition since the prequel Velocity Ultra which was a pure shmup.  Contributions are multitude - sense of scale, change of pace, and much-needed personality and coherent context to the experience.  It's nice to finally meet gritty Lieutenant Kai Tana up close and personal in action, and this time she even gets to play some bromance with a newfound alien sidekick in numerous cutscenes (which are sensibly skipped during replays.)\n\nThe real challenge and much extended playtime come from repeated attempts at perfect speedrun on each level by meeting 4 criteria: time, pickup, points, and no death.  Good balance is kept on length, difficulty and complexity for the most part.  It's utterly satisfying to finally win the coveted perfect trophy in the snazzy post-mission tally-up report after heated iteration of trial and failure to climb the leaderboard ladder.\n\nThat is, until they start to push the envelope so far that the fundamental design flaw inevitably emerges: speedrun and drag&drop operation (which the teleport mechanic boils down to) don't mix all that well.  They demand utmost speed and accuracy, then provide slow and clumsy interface.  They are contradicting themselves, and fighting the interface is never fun.\n\nI have clocked ~40 hours of playtime before reaching that saturation point (at about 80% on the way,) so I have no hesitation to recommend the game on its merits - it sure was an exhilarating ride.  Just be mindful that you might hit a thick difficulty wall somewhere down the line.","May 27","true","43.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Volaicty 2X is one of those rare genre mashups that ends up working in both areas it takes from. A robust top down shooter mixed with a fast and fluid side scrolling platformer. Both spit polished to a shine and could have a held up the game entirely on their own. And even though I wish it's story was more involving given the gorgeous artwork. It's a great burst of clean, colorful fun that's fast-paced, addicting and challenging.","January 28","true","8.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Certainly worth the price of admission.\n\nWhile I can appreciate the dynamics of switching back and forth between ship and "on foot", I must confess to enjoying the side-scrolling portions more; it's fun to direct Lt. Kai Tana as she runs around jumping, blasting and teleporting.\n\nThe developer should consider using this character in a different game genre - third person action/adventure & exploration would be ideal.  Hot cyborg chicks with cool abilities NEVER get old and I think Lt. Tana would thrive in a larger game.","August 22, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

The puzzle elements add a little variety but aren't my cup of tea. Running, flying and teleporting through the "critical urgency" levels feels amazing, though and keeps you playing til you get that perfect score. At a 20€ price point it might be a little expensive, but if you find it on sale for 10€, I can only recommend it.","May 2","true","21.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Shows a lot of promise, and I was looking forward to playing it.\n\nToo bad it's broken, and will likely always be broken.  The developers blame NVidia and are waiting around for them to fix it.
