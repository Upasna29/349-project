"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070177578/recommended/292760/","76561198070177578","Burglar Bill","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070177578/","373 products in account","Probably the best of the AGE Games, Rise of Prussia covers the fascinating European Theatre of War during the Seven Years war, or third silesian war. The Gold Edition also adds the First and Second Silesian Wars, which are smaller and more focused and great for learning the game. Its a period that is ironically, often overlooked by most people. Taking one of histories greatest generals, Frederick the Great, you lead the fledgeling nation of Prussia into war against the monstrosities that are France, Russia, Sweden and most importantly Austria, with only a few hannoverian allied armies supporting you.\n\nThe game enjoys minimal bugs compared to most AGE Engine Games, and I have only run into one so far and it was minor at worst (A General teleporting). The Performance is good, which is something you can't normally say for an AGE game as well, and whilst it isn't the prettiest game around the graphics are pleasing enough to the eye. Although the UI is a little outdated, its easy to get used too and can be learnt quickly enough.\n\nA major strength of the game, infact the main focus, is the way in which war is waged.  You have total control over your force composition, in a realistic manner that even takes into account your generals seniority. (A General with more seniority expects to be promoted before that new guy, even if the new guy is  10x better hes gunna have to get some achievements before being promoted to leading his own Corps). Your armies are divided into groups, starting with an Field Army, which is made up of different Corps, which are in turn made of different Brigades, and whom are also made up of Battallions etc. This area of organization is brilliant for anyone who enjoys reforming whole armies to fit their needs and despite how it sounds, is relatively simple once you get used to it. The UI for doing this is far less convuluted than similar games (Looking at you hearts of iron). Each of these forces can be detached or re-attached to their command at will, so if you have a Brigade of Hussars and need to know if the enemy is in Prague, or still sitting on his ♥♥♥♥ in Vienna, you can detatch them from the main army and send them on a scouting mission (or a raid). This level of flexibility blends excellently with the warfare of the time period, where battles are fought and won on manouver.\n\nOn the note of manouver, don't expect the enemy to just sit around and wait for you! You both move at the same time, planning your turn for the next two weeks and then the plans execute simultaneously, this can lead to some very interesting situations and provides for a far more interesting gameplay experience, and also means you'll have to predict enemy movements and prepare for them accordingly.\n\nIn addition to a brilliant manouver system, the Supply system is perfect, and accurately represents the systems used in the time period. As you advance deeper into enemy territory, it may become necassery to build supply depots to keep your men fed, and to even place guards at these depots to ensure enemy cavalry brigades don't come along and raid it. I havn't fully worked out the supply system yet, but running out of food stocks is sufficiently devestating, and Winter is suitably harsh (In the actual war they had to sit around in prague until winter was over, I had to do the same thing) effecting supplies, movement and attrition effectively, as well as combat and encourages one to wait it out and lick your wounds rather than continue the advance.\n\nThe game isn't perfect though, it has a few flaws and I think the foremost of them is the military recruitment system. I feel as if, the recruitment process is a little slow at times, and that whilst the time it takes to prepare men is fine, the number of men I can prepare at once feels rather limited. I can't speak regarding the realism here, its a personal view and may be to some peoples liking. But it isn't to mine. Another issue I've run into is the reinforcements. I'm not really sure how they work, and the concept is never really explained. But I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually, so I'll update the review once I have figured it out.\n\n\nIn short, for those looking for a pretty realistic strategy game, with indepth customization of forces and an excellent combat/manouver warfare system and mechanics, this is the game to get. Its fairly priced, clean of bugs, and provides hours of gameplay.\n\n\n","April 27, 2015","true","16.2"," 42 of 43 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","42","43","0","0"

This one covers the 7-years war in Europe, and comes with several long and short campaigns. The game works on a WEGO system, and focuses on operational level warfare. Supply is very important, as are weather conditions.\n\nYou can build units for your armies, give orders to your generals (which they will not always carry out, due to an activation system, simulating the difficulties in co-ordinating actions in this period). There is no 3-d battle function. Strictly old fashioned strategy, played out on a beautiful 2-d map. The units and leaders also have very nice art to represent them.\n\nHighly recommended, in-depth simulation of the campaigns of the 7-years war in Europe!","September 27, 2014","true","7.9"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","29","34","3","0"

Despite my initial thoughts of the game, and assumption that it could not feed my 18 century war feel itch was wrong. The music, sound effects (especially during the combat phases) and overall 2-D graphics of the game helps me immerse myself into period. I do not know how, but there is a huge sense of satifaction hearing those muskets go off and watching your meter (green) eat away the red until a message pops up stating the battle was in your favor.\n\nI have not experienced crashes or long loading time like others have reported. In fact, it is quite fast; even with 'Give AI More Time' checked (this simply improves AI gameplay 10%). But I can agree with other reviews that have said that once you learn a little about the game, it becomes extremely rewarding. Perhaps one day I can have the courage to delve into another AGEOD game, but for now I want to see what RoP has to offer.\n\nUpdate 1: Played an additional three hours in the very first scenario titled, "Maria-Theresa At Bay," a very straight forward scenario. In the Silesia area you must conquor major cities in that area, however most of the other regions of Austria is impassable (region not passable during this scenario). Therefore this scenario gently pushes you to the objectives. The way you win a scenario in Rise of Prussia is to take major objectives (different depending on alliance chosen) and gain victory points for them. Once the alloted amount required to win is achieved that alliance will win. In the scenario two other army corps are locked too but unlock in about three to four turns. Also you do not need to reorganize your troops in the chain of command in this scenario because this scenario leaves you with two stacks of corps already attached to an army. To those of you reading this now and scratching your head, Rise of Prussia features a Chain of Command mechanic as in most AGEOD based games. Basically you take the elements from the lowest level of organization to the highest from 1. Army 2. Corps. 3. Brigades 4. Regiments 5. Squadrons highest obviously being Army. The Chain in Command must be "fulfilled" in order to avoid penalties in battles which could seriously turn the tide of the war in the game. Anyhow, after looking on the AGEOD forum, the first two or three scenarios are kind of "tutorial" styled. More updates to come as I continue playing RoP.\n\nThanks for reading\n\nThis review is subject to change/updated the longer I play the game. Wargames are not easy to review unless you play a full session of the game which I haven't. But having  some form of a review for this precious game is important to me.","July 13, 2015","true","9.0"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"
