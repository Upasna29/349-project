"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekomimibadik/recommended/431300/","nekomimibadik","XJ9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekomimibadik/","2089 products in account","As the title says you will get 5 classic games you used to play back in good old days on windows XP or 98 :) 2 things missing are minesweeper and pinball, but maybe they will release 1 more pack in the future.Another thing i noticed all the games are water themed, anyway about those games:\n\nTetris:\n+3 Different mods\n+Different difficulties\n+looks nice\n- tutorial is for phone version of the game (aint sure if anybody even need tutorial for tetris srsly)\ni.e. - worth to buy\n\nMahjong:\n+Looks nice, very classy\n+Nice music\n+Has 2 different mods with 2 difficulties\n-You cant pause and save progress, so each game must be completed, when you leave the it just counts how much points you managed to get so far as a result.\ni.e. - worth to buy\n\nSudoku:\n+Has 5 difficulties\n+Music is nice\n+Has pause button (if you click menu)\n-No saving progress upon leaving, so you have to complete the whole level or leave uncompleted and get your points\n-Even the easiest difficulty was kinda frustrating for me, so i cant really tell the difference\n¯\_(ツ)_/¯\ni.e. - definitely worth to buy since there is lack of sudoku games on steam\n\nWords:\n+Great game itself for expanding english vocabulary\n+You can reroll the set of letters and it shows all possible combinations for those letters (like 8x3 5x4 1x6), so you know where to dig\n+Nice music\n+button to shuffle letters so you may see some word you missing\n-When the time is up, it would be cool if the game would show those words you missed, but its not :)\ni.e. - worth to buy\n\nSolitary:\n+Pirates themed cards looks okay\n+2 mods with hidden cards and with visible cards\n+Sea themed music\n-Tutorial doesnt explain rules of this one version of solitary so you have to figure them out yourself\n-Cant say i really like this one solitary, basically at steam you can find a lot of other solitaries, which would be better\ni.e. Not really worth it\n\nSo in total i rate this pack 4/5 which is pretty nice. Now overall:\n+Very low cost for what you get\n+Games are nice\n-Some of the tutorials explains how to play this game from the phone :|? Hope they fix that in the future\n-Lack of settings changes like resolution, window size, music loudness etc\n-No achievements and steamcards :(","May 3","true","3.6"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","13","18","2","3"

Great menus and settings, nice interfaces, pleasant to look at and play, it's 5 games in one well-made package.","April 30","true","16.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","5","0","0"
