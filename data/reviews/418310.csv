It's definitely worth the current price of â‚¬0.49.\nDon't expect great writing but the music is really good.\n\nCopied from my forum post which kind of turned into a review.\n======================================================\nAllright, After playing it for a bit I want to add that I am enjoying it although it has many problems.\n\nFirst allow me to vent my frustration: I just got a 122 combo and wanted to take a screenshot, so I pressed F12 and the game rebooted.\nPlease remove this reboot button :)\n\nAllright, that's out of the way (I'll get it again later)\n\nThe story doesn't make any sense: characters are not introduced and it jumps from one thing to the other. Somehow everyone has this urge to die. The writing feels cheap, more like a fanfiction than a game. (Well, the game is cheap)\nI guess it's just a recap of some memorable moments of your other games and is not supposed to form a cohesive story in itself?\n\nI don't know how you guys came up with the controls but they were unplayable for me. I created an auto hotkey script that swaps the X and D keys. It's still confusing sometimes but works way better now. I'm using a Belgian AZERTY keyboard. This game needs a custom controls setting. But I understand if you don't want to spend development time on that. There are many alternatives available that let the player rebind keys.\n\nThat said I do enjoy the game. The gameplay is solid. It is also a fresh take on rythm games.\nInstead of the usual press this button on the correct timing, you opted for "you have limited time to input these buttons". I also like the variable speed the button prompts fall and the breathing room once in a while.\n\nI think it's great how you guys made this possible with RPG Maker! Good luck on your future projects.\n","February 12","true","1.8"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","17","21","2","0"

Using arrow key and ASZX is a nightmare even in easy mode, but I'll already get a perfect in one stage because of luck. And its nearly imposible to get 1000 combo achievement with this unmanageable control.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=632775144\n\nIf we can customize the control, especially for ASZX key. It becomes manageable and enjoy to play. Well, I love the concept of this game to use RPG Maker engine to a rhytym games. And I love the soundtrack too. But alas, I can't recommended this game because its unmanageable control.","February 26","false","4.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"
