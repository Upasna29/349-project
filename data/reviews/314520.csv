The words that spring to mind having now played 8 hrs since launch. That the developers have labelled this a simulation and imagine it is worthy as a release candidate beggars belief.\n\nPick one of 4 rig types that you are limited to carrying when you are fishing, pick one of four baits that you are limited to carrying and that's your terminal tackle sorted, seriously? Where do I adjust boilie buoyancy, hair length, my shock leader, and link length, pick hook type and size independent of the chosen rig. Where are the method feeders, carp poles, marker floats, bait boats, baiting sticks, feeder rods. Where are the oils for soaking boilie's, the pva stringers and bags, and the selection of groundbaits and particles for the spod rod. Why the hell are worms, luncheon meat, casters and maggots awol in a fishing game that features roach bream, tench and carp. Where is the window dressing such as alternate clothing, bivvies, bite alarms, landing nets, et al. Everything I would expect to see at launch from a title labelled an accurate simulation of European Fishing.\n\nThen there are the game mechanics that are present but not working correctly, even the basics such as fish control and landing glitch frequently, fish that run for 20 meters under the bank, line retrieval that bears no relationship to what I am actually doing or seeing, fish that become stuck under the tip of my rod, fish ai that is unaffected by wind direction, then there are the constant stream of bites, how I wish that fishing for carp and cats was so easy irl.\n\nI could go on but if you do not have a clear picture of this title yet, there is little point.\n\nIt clearly has potential, graphically it looks good, but as a simulation of angling it stinks, as a release candidate it stinks, it is just not good enough; at best it is a shallow, broken, arcade game.","November 3, 2015","false","19.0"," 443 of 529 people (84%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","84","443","529","43","48"

They clearly spent a lot of time on their foliage, but for a game that's all about staring at water for hours on end, their water effects are absolutely terrible.\n- - There are no water physics at all. Even when you are reeling in a fish the water just remains static and boring.\n- - Even on Ultra the water doesn't reflect the sky or surroundings.\n- - You really can't see into the water. They don't have fish swimming around the bottom. They don't really have visible weeds or anything like that. It's just murky brown blandness.\n- Lack of variety. You are basically limited to several different types of carp, and one or two lakes also have catfish.\n- The net mechanic. It's awkward, it hurts the flow of the game, and I suspect the mechanic was mostly added to avoid needing physics for the fish.\n- There are no physics for the fish. You can't pull the fish out of the water with the rod while you're reeling it in. You never see the fish satisfyingly thrashing in the water, on the hook, or in your hands.\n- You can't get your line caught in a tree.\n\nPros:\n- The casting physics are a fun novelty until the rest of the game ruins the experience for you.\n- It's cheaper than a fishing license. Also you don't need to go outside.\n\nThe pictures and videos on the store page definitely make the game look better than it actually is. It's not the worst purchase I've ever made but I've already uninstalled it and probably won't ever be playing it again.","November 3, 2015","false","0.8"," 238 of 304 people (78%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","78","238","304","50","19"

Mainly because it wasnt based on lure fishing for bass, which it seems 99% of fishing games are.  The first thing that struck me on playing it was the beautifull training lake, it was a while before i even cast a rod out as i was strolling round the lake in awe of the lush scenery. I struggled a bit at first with the fishing mechanics, but soon got used to it, and with practice it became very natural and pretty dam realistic. Im so glad i stuck with it for a couple of hours and got to grips with the controls, because now after several updates and much practice i am enjoying this game more than ever and would highly recommend it to anyone.\n\nThe most impressive aspect of this project i feel, is the direction its heading in, although the updates arent super regular when the do hit they bring massive improvements and content. Phase 6 added a massive new lake, boss fish, landing net mechanics, a tackle shop and much more. All of the additions were well implemented and brought a lot more structure to the game. Unfortunatly i have now bought all the best tackle and saved up quite a bit of money for future tackle shop items. But the fact that its the first game i check everyday when im looking at whats been updated is testament to its genius. With the promise of Tench and float fishing equipment to come my mouth is watering!\n\nThere are still some bugs of course as it is early access, but the devs are active enough and seem to be working on them. There is also online multiplyer now which works but is still very much in Alpha.\n\nI truly hope this gets the support and backing it deserves as it is, by far, the best fishing game ive ever played, already and theres still content to come. My advice to the devs on this one is please keep up the good work and keep heading in the direction your are... oh and hurry up with my Tench :P\n\nOverall the good massively outweighs the bad and in my opinion is already a worthwile purchase.","August 11, 2015","true","163.8"," 116 of 152 people (76%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","76","116","152","11","8"

You finally have a sense of freedom in freedom fishing. Game mechanics feel good, though I feel like now I'm throwing so far I might hit mountains the far distance. I liked the triple spinning wheel bug as well, sadly it is going to be fixed.\n\n[Early Access - Phase 3] UPDATE\n\nWhat I like:\n- Casting is a lot easier. I didn't find myself trying over and over again to get a goot shot like in phase 1, and I didn't have to move mymouse all across the table (mouse mat was sufficient :)).\n- Improved visuals. Some of the things that annoyed me about the first release was some basic but unrealistic/immersion breaking visuals like a rope-thick line and a very wobbly fishing pole. These have been fixed now, at least to some extent. The line is pretty good, or perfect in terms of thickness now and the pole has just about the right stiffness to it. I still experience motor-boating and pole glitches kind of often, but the basics are a lot better.\n- Character feedback. Another issue I had that has now been improved on is the characters feedback to the force of the fish and so on, when you are fishing. It is very pleasing, and I didn't find my self getting thrown off by the characters reactions this time - big +.\n- New features. The fish variations are great and I managed to catch a few during my testing of the game. Leader boards are great. Adds a lot more to the game and actually makes it worthwhile to play the game in its current state. I didn't manage to go too far up the rankings but it was a lot more fun and exciting to catch something and see how far it will get you.\n\nWhat I could see improved:\n- The fish AI. It was a lot better than first time I played, but I still experienced fish going from 10-80yds in a matter of seconds when fishing from some spots (especially the little closed spot without a lot of room, had issues). The fish also seemed to not care about swimming through landscape as I frequently saw fish going directly throw rocks/trees and sometimes into the land/road/path on the other side of the lake.\n- The force on the pole when having a hook is ok, but the line is not always acting accordingly. I frequently experienced a pole arced and bent like a bow, while the line acted as is if no force at all was being aplied to it.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- Reeling/catching fish seems to be bugged sometimes as I have found myself reeling in for a solid 10 minutes two times in a row at the same fishing spot without anything major happening to the yard indicator/other. I frequently feel like having no idea whats going on underneath the water. Like if I'm catching a fish and it's almost in reach (5-10ish)yds I'm just able to keep reeling in without anything happening. The line should be rather short at that point, but it feels like it's extended by 100 miles underneath the water. Also while reeling, at times when I was not able to pull the fish towards me (maybe extended the line underneath the water) I was still able to steer the fish to the left or right which makes no sense. While reeling I often wondered if the game had bugged out, if I was doing something totally wrong etc. Didn't feel very responsive.\n\nI think the latest updates have been good and have improved the game in areas where improvement were needed, but some fundamentals are still flawed. Pleased with this update :)\n\n-----------------------------------\n[Early Access - Phase 1] ORIGINAL\n\nI understand the game is in early access, but I just think it is lacking in too many aspects, and I think the developers should have waited a bit before releasing it to the public and accepting your money.\n\nWhat you get to see in this early access is basically a few tutorials and trials, so you can get a feel for how the game and the mechanics are going to be implemented. This is fine, it is content-wise what they claimed it to be. I would be satisfied with this amount of content, if it wasn't because of the bare basics of the game not being very well implemented at all yet. For a dedicated fishing simulator, it doesn't do a very good job at simulating what real fishing feels like. On top of that the mechanics felt clunky, the visuals didn't feel right and the main point of the game (fishing) felt really awkward, unreal and unresponsive.\n\nProblems with the visuals:\n- The fishing line looks thicker than the pole itself, and I know it has to be easy to see on screen but there has to be a better way. The line also seems a lot heavier than an actual line (which is as light as a snowflake flowing in the wind), when you look at how it reacts with the physics currently in the game.\n- The fishing pole looks way too rubbery/elastic compared to a real pole. Very wobly :). Like if you shake your hand a bit, it might go all bananes.\n- The tension on the fishing line is the worst part about the visual issues. Very immersion breaking. When I have a fish on the line, the string tension is very unrealistic. It doesn't matter if the fish is 40 yards away or 10 yards, if I'm reeling in or being idle, the string looks all the same. I get no real feel for how far away the fish is, how hard it is pulling and so on - other than the numbers I see on the screen. I found this to be very immersion breaking, it didn't feel at all like I was having a hook!\n\nProblems with the game (fishing).\n- When I'm reeling in I have no idea what is going on underneath the water. Sometimes I was reeling in for a long long while, but the yard indicator stayed the same, and there was no other visual feedback. I didn't know if the game had glitched out and my reeling didn't do anything, or if the fish had managed to extend my line by another 100 yeards underneath the water for me to reel in afterwards. I think it would be nice to get some sort of idea of how long your line is, and not just how far away the fish is. Because this just felt so weird when I couldn't feel the force in my pole, and just stood there reeling in for minutes from a minor hook.\n- The fish (1 kind in this early alpha) is very athletic, it goes from one end of the lake and back in a matter of seconds. It does this for a while, then suddenly stops. Like it spend all of its energy traveling so fast from one end of the lake to the other and then suddenly colapses. It also bites the hook very frequently, so the food must me scarse around this lake. :)\n- As mentioned earlier you get almost no visual feedback or cues from the fishing pole, the string or the fishing guy. When you get a hook the pole, string, and the guy - they all just act as if there was no force pulling in the other end of the line. In contrast to this, the fish is going crazy underneath the water as I mentioned earlier. It just feels so unrealistic and weird. This would be okay as a side game in GTA or something like that, but this coming from a dedicated fishing simulator was disappointing.\n\nProblems with the controls:\n- Something feels really awkward about the controls, I have a hard time pointing out exactly what is causing this.\n- I think one part is the mouse sensitivity. You turn very slowly while the pole is very wobly and when you throw the line out into the water I almost have to move my hand all across the desk to get a good shot.\n- The throwing part does not feel consistent. Sometimes I get a really nice shot, but the next time I do the eactly same movement (with minor differences ofc), the bait may end up only 11 yards away and in another direction. It just didn't feel right.\n\nAll in all, I think the basic features should have been better implemented when releasing a paid early access of a dedicated fishing game with this amount of content. I don't see a point for anyone to get it yet, UNLESS you are very interested in fishing and can't wait to get a glimpse of what this new game will look like.\n\n[Deleted the last 5 paragraphs to make room for the phase 3 review update].","November 6, 2014","false","2.8"," 166 of 250 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","166","250","5","31"

Or maybe even niche. Because the people who actually do fish, will be outside doing actual fishing. It makes you wonder why to even make a simulation based on it? Well to be fair to DTG, they hit the nail on the head. The game is still Early Access, so a lot of features of the game are unavailable, but as they develop it, you can really see the game shine through the cracks of it's early builds.\n\nThe whole idea of fishing and just relaxing and enjoying doing something that doesn't require hard manual labour, is top notch. The game itself is based around a lake which you now, have complete control over. You can now walk and fish in different spots, you can now, change your lures, and you can even put your rod down!\n\nThe attention to detail is amazing as the whole atmosphere projects a warm sunny summers day morning and the ambient sounds of birds chirping away to the splashing of over excited fish is simply sublime.\n\nTo their advantage, is that the developers of the game at Dovetail, enjoy fishing and do it often. So the game is being made by fishers for fishers. I myself am not a fisher. But to play this game is to encapsulate what I do enjoy. A nice relaxing morning or afternoon in the middle of a green area.\n\nI would recommend this game based on "Phase One", and this review is based on "Phase Four". As such, I'm still going to recommend it. Quality. Absolute quality!","March 27, 2015","true","6.8"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","33","41","0","1"

Like, not one type of fish, but specifically just one carp. Just one guy I keep catching over and over again, only to let him go. It reminds me a lot of the complicated relationship between Batman and the Joker, so if you think about it, this game is at least as good as Arkham City.

But the fish and your model look pretty good overall. The water and reflections also are quite nice.\n\nThe menu screen is barebone and only is navigated by keyboard. The options are barebone with only having settings for mouse sensitivity, audio levels, and Graphics detail (low,med,high,ultra), resolution with being able to select fullscreen, window or borderless window. Setting the game to fullscreen at 1440p would not display properly and only worked via windowed mode for me.\n\nMechanics-\n\nCasting is decent once you get use to it, but suffers from mouse sensitivity issues where you have to turn it up a lot or you will be doing the picking up and dragging and repeat to start your backswing for casting. Sometimes even while releasing the line it will shoot forward then bounce back oddly. When the line is in the water it is pretty smooth sailing, and reeling in the fish is fun. I just wish upon landing the fish it would at least make up some numbers for you so you can keep trying for something other then landing another generic fish. Also be aware that the current plans is to only add in carp til a much later date.\n\n***\n\nLowdown- As of this review the game is in very early alpha, but looks promising. With a great intro price of $7 ( which is said to increase as development continues), its a good time to buy to support pretty much the only modern realistic fishing game on steam or PC pretty much.

DTG pushed the release on this (Nov 2), perhaps to try and counter Fishing Planet.\n\nIt was a mistake because the bugs and problems with this are numerous.\n\n\nSome of the glaringly obvious:-\n\n- Fish that SLIDE sideways, they don't swim at all. Sure, their tails wag but that's the model, not the AI. They almost teleport they move so fast sometimes. Even the biggest fish around the 40kg mark, bounce and slide around like a Smartie in a blender. I've written script for fish and rotating them "naturally" is a pretty simple task. Adding proper inertia and momentum is a little trickier but certainly doable too.\n\n- The casting is not bad (with practise) but a 50m cast, to the opposite side of a lake, which looks to be 150-200m away, is up on the bank. 2 winds of the reel and you're back in the middle of the lake at 30m or so. In some cases you can't even see where your gear is until you bring it back to under 30m.\n\n- Reel winding is shocking. A 5:1 reel, with zero tension, should be bringing in close to a metre of line per turn. You can literally turn the handle 50 times and get back a metre of line. I made this observation in the forums and was told it's an "audio" problem because I mentioned I should at least be hearing the clutch slipping. Did they answer about not being able to wind in with zero tension or that my reel acts like it's  1:25 ratio?  Not even mentioned.\n\n- Fish snap off, for no reason, in some places on some maps. Can't even be bothered reporting it.\n\n- The fish "fight" is only really differentiated by time. A BIG fish in RL can and will run for 10's of metres non-stop, sheer power. Smaller fish dart and dance. Some of these 40kg monsters swim like a Goldfish and you get frustratingly stuck with a bouncing yo-yo fish, 7m out and 5m deep, going nowhere. Some smaller fish, where your breaking strain is 3 times that of fish, simply "lock up" 10m out and just pull against the line. You cannot wind them in, you have to pump and wind like it's a 10kg carp.\n\n- 15lb Touchdown line is borked. Unlimited drag. Max it to 100% and skulldrag your fish straight in. I mentioned this is a pretty serious exploit because XP and TP (the currency) is linked to catches. There are also live tournaments against real players and anyone NOT fishing 15lb will lose - obviously. Answer from devs. "It's up to you if you use it or not".\n\n- Tournament scores do not update in RT, in some cases not at all.\n\n- "Boss" fish are able to be caught one after another. I caught 5 in a row, from the same location, using the same gear, line, bait. everything.\n\n- My favourite. You can catch a "Boss" fish (all independently named) on Rod #1 and while you're taking it off the hook, Rod #2 goes off and presto..... same Boss fish. I've caught 3 in a row on this, others have caught the same Boss 5 times in a row.\n\n- FPS is capped at 30fps. Yes folks. UE4 engine, PC game, CAPPED at 30fps.\n\n- AMD users are suffering all kinds of glitching, gamma, flickering and crashes. Devs say it's AMD and/or Epic (UE4). Anyone who playes the multitude of UE4 games out there (Ark is one of the most popular) knows that AMD cards are NOT suffering this across the board.\n\n- VERY short gameplay. In 40 hours, much of it playing the broken tournaments, I am nearly maxed out and own almost everything.\n\n- The gear. Some of it is so similar (or lacking in gameplay neccessity) that it makes accumulation pointless. BUT, you need to buy item #1 to be able to buy item #2 so... accumulate you do.\n\nLook. I've had enough of this, I've annoyed myself, sounding all whiney and sooky. I could go on but just the attitudes of devs to problems you officially document is pretty poor. A whole lot of pseudo-surprise, "we'll look into it", "our testing didn't do that"  etc... all the while telling you they're working on more content, and given it's Dovetail Games, it'll be mostly DLC.\n\nFor now. IF it's on special it might be worth a look because they MAY address these issues. $20 for 40 hours is probably not too bad so I'll not complain too much more.\n\nIF this had been an Early Access title my review would be completely different and my tolerance for errors would be much, much higher. But when you release broken titles... Shame.\n\n5/10\n\nIt get's an up.... Just. It is fishing, it's kinda relaxing and looks reasonable. It will be good for awhile but you'll run out of fun very quickly.","November 9, 2015","true","42.5"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"

I actually expected a lot worse from the game and what people may not know is that the developers originally hinted that there would be only one type of fish in the release and everything else would be DLC. However they apparently changed their minds and put out a release version with a decent amount of content. I havent encountered any problems with the release version of the game and for anyone who thinks he might enjoy a fishing sim this is not a bad choice at all. My hopes are that the developers will continue to fine tune the game and I wouldnt even mind future DLC if the additional content is decent.\nBottomline is a recommendation for anyone who doesnt expect call of duty - modern fishing.\n\nThis is my first review and I am mostly writing it to balance the mixed reviews which I personally consider to be a bit unfair.","November 14, 2015","true","17.6"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","25","38","2","0"

I knew nothing of fishing or it's intricacies until I ventured onto this game. My Husband and Son have been plaing this game for a while, and to be honest, it is great viewing as well as playing.\nBut I wanted to have a go myself and see just what all the fishy fun was about. Cue my guy, Wilhelm. Wilhelm is going great guns. He has 3 rods; Kenny 'Fishing' Powers, Ray Bream-ero and Doug Heffer-Carp. The delight in pulling in a fish that takes a while to land is thrilling and just so satifying. An Acheivement that is as unexpected as it is awesome.\n\nSo about the game; well, go through the tutorial or Acadamy to learn the basics- if you know nothing as I did then this is the  place where your fishy education begins. Then feel free to go and complete the challenges you have unlocked, or free fishing and just enjoy the game's beautiful ambience. The graphics, the fish detail, the weather, the sounds within this game are just fantastic. Immersive and peaceful. The gentle plopping of fish as they leap out of the water, or the sound of the wind as it begins to rise (shadow detail also shows the tree shadows moving in the wind) or the pitter patter of rain. I just simply love playing.\n\nThere are levels to go up, a skill tree for tackle and bait. Earning Tackle Points as you catch fish, complete challenges and finish tournaments (the latter has either a live daily match or in game AI tournaments) means that you can develop your fisher-person to be the best in every field or go for one particular area of expertise.\n\nThere is nothing quite like landing your first big carp, or first fish, but the ultimate (next to Boss Fish) is catching a HUGE Catfish!!!!\n\nNotes on gameplay: -\n\n* Have patience. Learn the tension gradients that are applicable to your tackle- losing a fish that you have spent 5 minutes reeling in only for it to get away can be gutting. Learn your rod's capability\n\n* Equip your net at 4yrds or less to get the instant land- anything above 4 and you wont be able to manouvre the net to catch the fish.\n\n* Screenshots are addictive- But awesome to show off those catches that made you feel proud. Please do take a peek at mine if you would like to see the look of the fish.\n\n* Character choice is limited- but there is no need to have a full on customisation option when all you see mostly is the back of your character.\n\n* Learn about the rigs, the best bait for that rig and go fishing where the fish you want to catch hang out.\n\n* Read the Boss Fish Menu and descriptions they are awesome\n\n* Don't be disheartened Rome wasn't built in a day and neither is the best tacklebox- take your time and have fun with the game.\n\n* Make as many fish related puns as you can- this is a source of never ending amusment. Life is but a Bream :-)\n\n* Slow life down for an hour! Take the small joy of a days fishing and be at peace. No traffic, no bosses moaning, no stress- just one rod at a time, one fishy at a time\n\nEnjoy and 'Carp-i' Diem ;-P\n\nAngelDelight81 xx","January 7","true","10.2"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","18","26","3","0"

The game needs lots of extra A.I. and lots of different scenarios. Otherwise it will run straight into that deadly trap called Boring! Also fishing isn't just about Carp, there are a lot of other species out there, all needing different approaches  to catch them. By this I mean Float fishing, Fly fishing and Stalking to name but a few. The Graphics seem to be okay, but a bit on the basic side. I had everything maxed out and to be honest I didn't see any difference at all!\nI think that to Charge People for the "Game" at the moment is a BIG mistake! Get more into it then you can sell it for peoples hard earned cash. To actually sell it at this stage of it's development is rather cheeky to say the least!\nFinaly, I will recommend this game, but very reluctantly, as it has a lot of scope.

The 2 things that are taking away from the game for me are: 1) Netting is the most difficult part of catching the fish which is silly. 2) I play with a mouse and keyboard and usually the only indication I have a fish on the line is a beeping sound; this really dispels any illusion of the fishing experience.  Get rid of the beeping sound altogether; the bend of the rod, the sound of the reel, the erratic movement of the line in the water.  Those should be the indications that you have a fish going for the bait.\n**update**I just caught a fish without having that beeping sound let me know the fish was on the line and it was great.

A lot of the bugs and issues have been fixed now, so I can definetely recommend this game. It may not be the best fishing simulator, but it is still an enjoyable game.\nA few positive points:\n- An in-game shop with a very extensive set of possibilities for your tackle boxes: reels, rods, lines, hooks, baits...\n- Several fish species: multiple carp species, catfish, bream, roach...\n- different bed types: silt, gravel and weed. You have to keep this in mind when choosing your hooks and bait.\n- Enjoyable and relaxing ambient sound.\n- The thrill to keep fishing to get to the top of the leaderboards, and/or set a personal best. There's also your profile with statistics and fish species and bosses you have already/not caught. Each lake has its own unique bosses.\n- There are also online tournaments, tutorials, AI competitions and minigames which all reward in-game currency and xp.\nNegative points:\n- A few graphical bugs.\n- The time to wait for a fish to bite is sometimes too long.\n- Some players find casting too hard.

This game has a lot of potential though. One very annoying bug is in free fishing during a long session sometimes you get a bug where you cant set down you rod.. This means you will never be able to control your other two rods again. This is unless you quit and restart free fishing.\n\nThe casting is another problem I have some sort of power meter or bower button should be used to guarentee you can get at least some distance.. Over use of the power button could be compensated by less accuracy..\n\nIve also had many occurances where I catch the same fish 3-5 times in a row.. However this could be due to the fish staying in the same area and chance?\n\nThings I liked, and what i'd like to see: Playing fish is really enjoyable. By far the best fishing sim out there all things considered, just the casting and occasionalo bug that gets annoying. More accesories need to be added such as PVA bags to allow you to send out your hookbait with more feed. Groundbait would be nice too. A slingshot might be a good addition too , this allows more feeding options. Whereas im stuck to using single baits..\n\nI hope they continue to refine the game as it does feel in complete, not that much unlockable products in tackle shop ect. I would not reccomend this game yet as I feel like I said its not finished.

Game info and ads does can confuse users and the game is not really as big as it looks. The game is really Early Access the game.\n\nThe game is on the one hand, therefore, difficult to evaluate and write reviews because the game is not really enough significant content, which could be something to say.\n\nThe game is and looks promising, but the game missing a lot of things, what i like to see in this game. The game is not really any free-form fishing game such as Rapala Pro Fish game, even this game have "Freeroam mode".\n\nThe game is on the other hand does work, but it should be much more greatly simplify the mechanics of the game, which would be more content and less visual beauty.\n\nMore than that the game is like most of the cheap games, so on the desktop fish in the fishing game where you fish place.\n\nIn the game there is only one game mode and one of the really small "pond" fish place and one fish species at this time.\n\nThe player can not even change the place of the fish pond and walk freely in the environment. The game does not include a lake or sea fishing or even a motor boat rides.\n\nAlso fish in artificial intelligence does not seem to be very good or even the environment seems to be enough interaction or vitalization and the environment there is not much else in life.\n\nThe player can not change the gear or fishing supplies and the game will also be maybe possible to include additional content later on a charge even though the game may not be worth it.\n\nThe game is missing a second over the fishing feeling, because the fishing area seems like it would be an empty place, and the game area seem plausible.\n\nIn the game there is no other artificial intelligence fishermen, which would be a nice addition to the game, so the player is quite lonely when the game is also not have a multiplayer game mode.\n\nIt is, frankly, this is a lightweight desktop fishing game. The game run the same as ice fishing or angling fishing, so this is not a hardcore fishing game.\n\nSad to say also, that even the cat could cry this game, because the cat would not be able to fish the cats do not have enough fish to offer. x3\n\nI fear only that the game is going to be a long time Early Access the game, even years. Very few of the game is not over yet reached the level of the Early Acces. So the game can stay many players short-lived.\n\nI can recommend the game, but I would recommend the game actually later if the game actually add more content. :3\n\n\n//Ensimmäinen alpha julkaisu version arvostelu:\n\n\nFIN:\n\nTyylikkäin ja realistisin kalastuspeli Steamissa, mutta...\n\nPeli on halpa, mutta todella vähän sisältöä. Pelin esittely ja mainokset hämäävät käyttäjää, eikä peli ole oikeastaan niin iso kuin miltä näyttää. Peli on siis todella Early Acces peli.\n\nPelissä on siis toisaalta vaikea arvioida ja kirjoittaa arvostelua, koska pelissä ei ole oikeastaan riittävästi merkittävää sisältöä, josta voisi jotakin sanoa.\n\nPeli on ja näyttää lupaavalta, mutta pelistä puuttuu todella paljon asioita vielä, mitä itse haluasin nähdä pelissä olevan. Peli ei varsinaisesti ole mikään vapaa muotoinen kalastus peli kuten Rapala Pro Fish -peli.\n\nPeli on toisaalta ihan toimiva, mutta pitäisi paljon enemmän huomattavasti yksinkertaisemmasta peli mekaniikasta, jossa olisi enemmän sisältöä ja vähemmän visuaalista kauneutta.\n\nEnemmänkin peli on kuten useimmat halvat pelit niin, työpödältä kalastettava kalastus peli, jossa kalastetaan paikaltaan.\n\nPelissä ei ole kuin yksi peli muoto oikeastaan ja yksi pieni "lampi" kalapaikka sekä yksi kala laji tällähetkellä. Pelaaja ei pysty myöskään vaihtamaan kala paikkaa lammella, eikä kävelemään vapaasti ympäristössä. Peli ei siis sisällä järvi tai meri kalastusta tai vaikkapa moottori veneellä ajelua.\n\nPelaaja ei voi myöskään vaihtaa asusteita tai kalastustarvikkeita ja peli tulee myös ehkä mahdollisesti sisältämään myöhemmin maksullista lisäsisältöä vaikka peli ei välttämättä ole sen arvoinen.\n\nMyöskään kalojen tekoäly ei vaikuta kovinkaan hyvältä eikä edes ympäristössä tunnu riittävää vuorovaikutusta tai elävöitymistä sekä ympäristössä ei ole paljoa muuta elämää.\n\nPelistä puuttuu toistaalta kalastus fiilis, koska kalastus alue tuntuu kuin se olisi tyhjään luotu, eikä peli alue tunnu uskottavalta.\n\nPelissä ei ole myöskään muita tekoäly kalastajia, mitkä olisivat kiva lisä peliin, joten pelaaja on varsin yksinäinen kun pelissä ei ole myöskään moninpeliä.\n\nKyseessä on suoraan sanoen, tämä on kevyt työpöytä kalastuspeli. Peli ajaa saman kuin pilkillä tai ongella kalastus, eli ei ole kyseessä hardcore kalastuspeli.\n\nSurullista sanoa myös, että jopa kissakin voisi itkeä tätä peliä, koska kissa ei voisi kalastaa kun kissalle ei ole riittävästi kalaa tarjota. x3\n\nPelkäänpä vain, että peli tulee olemaan pitkään Early Access peli, jopa vuosia. Monikaan peli ei ole päässyt vieläkään yli Early Acces tasosta. Joten peli voi jäädä monella pelaajalla lyhyt ikäiseksi.\n\nVoin suositella peliä, mutta suosittelisin peliä varsinaisesti myöhemmin jos pelissä olisi oikeasti lisää sisältöä. :3","November 7, 2014","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You will then feell like you've really fished. And see again how far off this "Simulation" is.\n\nGraphics ...bland, weak colours, water is from circa 2005.  No underwater shots, to see the fish use its particular abilities to throw the hook and run with the bail screaming on your reel.  The sense of weight, the feel like you are working something toward you, careful guiding it around obstacles , lowering rod tip when you think the Fish is about to jump.\nBasic stuff .  But not even that. All you have to do, is basically Horse the fish in.

All of these games get something right and all have something that a fishing game ought to have, whether its variety, casting ability, lure working, bait presentation rig set up etc. And all of them have something wanting. But what makes Euro Fishing stand out is it has nothing to add, it is a poor version of the free to play Fishing Planet. Dovetails graphics are similar to Fishing Planet with the added bonus of in game mechanical difficulties- Casting. Unless your running a gaming laptop your going to have problems with this game, there are known issues with casting. Dovetail have released an update which is an additional basic casting system.....but using this you cannot cast as far anyway. So its not really a fix, or solution but barely makes the game playable. With 8 GB ram , over 500 MB a modest processor , i had to reduce the graphics to the point that text was no longer readable to play to enable a grand success of a cast from 3yrds to 8yrds. Dovetail needs to double check there own research, casting in fishing is really not that difficult, ask any angler, to finnese it to a fine art is difficult but 8 year olds are quite happy casting from the get go.\nAll in all Dovetail have established themselves as a poor game developer with this title, in future beware Dovetail for they know not what they do.","March 22","false","2.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

However what is available right now seems to be running pretty smooth.  Its a lot of fun to wrestle the fish once it is caught, the graphics right now are pretty decent, the skill level required right now makes it a bit too easy but hopefully that will change over time.  I cant recommend this game in its current state.  I would wait until its full release before purchasing it.\n\nWith all that being said my only fear is that this game will be a play to win type of game.  If you want to catch that bigger fish then you're going to need to spend real money to get that tougher fishing line and so on and so forth.  Really hope that isnt the direction this company is headed, but I have a huge hunch that it is sadly.","November 10, 2014","false","0.6"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","21","40","2","5"

I like both and think they're both quality titles, but they do different things well and will satisfy different tastes. This review is meant to help you decide which one you might prefer. I wrote a similar review for FP, and will update both when FP comes out of early access.\n\n+Enjoyable, pleasant environments you can actually explore\nDTG's Euro Fishing really nails the old adage "There's more to fishing than the fish." The different lakes have a real sense of place, and they're all beautiful locations that are a pleasure to be in. This is helped by the ability to actually walk around each location and fish from different areas. Being able to explore and discover your own favorite spots adds a lot to the feeling of authenticity. While Fishing Planet may have a greater diversity in locations and environments, only a few tiny areas in each place are open to you.\n\n+Nice photo-op payoffs after landing a fish\nAfter landing each fish, DTG's Euro Fishing gives you a little photo-op with your catch. This might sound silly, but it actually adds a lot to the game by providing a sense of closure to each catch and a sense of personality to the fish. It's why Euro Fishing is one of only 2 games I ever bother to screencap (the other being Kerbal Space Program).\n\n+The fish look really good\nThe fish themselves are well done, and thanks to the photo-ops you get some time to really look at them. Fishing Planet's fish look good, but not nearly this good (and w/o a good photo-op moment, you never get a clear look at them anyways).\n\n+Real Multiplayer\nYou can play multiplayer matches with other people on the same lake. FP, while ostensibly an MMO, is so highly instanced its multiplayer is basically a chatroom added to a single-player game. That said, both communities are very friendly and helpful, and FP's multiplayer features haven't been fully implemented yet.\n\n+Actual casting mechanics\nThis is a blessing and a curse. Casting is an actual skill to master in DTG's Euro Fishing, which makes it satisfying when done well and frustrating when it impedes you from catching fish. Landing the perfect cast to catch a unique fish you know is hiding in *that* weed bed feels like an accomplishment. Casting your rig into your foot over and over again for 10 minutes gets aggravating. FP's casting is much easier, but is nothing more than a power meter.\n\n+Real "unique" fish\nMost areas have a number of unique named fish. Since IRL people fish stocked, managed lakes where you must release your catch, some fish gain names and reputations (one famous carp even received a burial from anglers after it died of old age). These unique fish are well-implemented, and catching one is a fun accomplishment. They go a long way toward adding personality to each location. FP's unique fish don't have nearly this much to them, and seem to be just very large specimens of the species.\n\n-Not much variety of environments\nAll of the locations in DTG's Euro Fishing are stocked lakes. While you can walk around and explore them all, they all lend themselves to the same kind of fishing. Compare that with FP, which has a much greater diversity of location types.\n\n-Not much variety of fishing styles\nDTG's Euro Fishing currently has one kind of fishing: ledgering. This is a rather sedentary form of catching fish, where a weight holds your line to the lake bed and you wait for a fish to pick up your hook & bait. Float fishing will be added in a future free DLC, but currently you only get to do one kind of fishing: ledgering for carp & coarse fish. Fishing Planet supports both float and spin fishing. Spin fishing in particular is a much more active method of angling, and FP even recognizes different techniques and styles of presenting the lure.\n\n-Not much variety of fish\nLake fishing for carp & other coarse fish is the focus of DTG's Euro Fishing. No trout, no pike, no crappie, no bass, no salmon etc.\n\n-Not much equipment\nEuro Fishing's selection of gear is pretty small, and the descriptions do a mediocre job of explaining what it all does. Fishing Planet has a dizzying amount of gear, which supports its greater variety of target fish, locations and fishing styles.\n\n-Landing mechanic is a mess\nNetting & landing fish is barely functioning at the moment. It beats FP's landing mechanic (it has none), but it won't take much for FP to release something far superior.\n\n-Mediocre water effects\nA fishing game really needs better water. It doesn't cripple the game, but it doesn't compare well to the water in Fishing Planet. Considering how much time you spend staring at it, I'd have hoped for something more convincing.\n\n-Weak NPE (new player experience)\nEuro Fishing's tutorial is mediocre, but it actually has one (which is more than can be said for FP). However, it does has a really helpful series of videos to help those completely new to coarse fishing. Unfortunately, the lack of a wiki will hamper those who want to dive deep into the game. This is a similar issue with FP, which lacks a real tutorial but has a great WIP wiki.","November 11, 2015","true","21.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Cooperative play works well in my limited experience playing this way, however be aware that another player can stand literally on top of you, completelyt obscuring your view and making it almost impossible to see, and therein do, anything at all--something as ironic as it is nonsensical, given that another player is cannot, supposedly, fish the same spot as you concomitantly ('Pegged' areas become player unique territories once pegged by any single player). This just one example of how poor game design makes Euro fishing contravene its own intentions. And logic.\n\nEuro Fishing is ultimately  rendered frustrating and not really worth playing owing to bugs, and some extremely poor mechanics--specifically the striking and netting features. Both are awkward, clunky,  drudgerous  and generally difficult to negotiate with a keyboard & mouse setup. With respect to the former,  you have to really slide backwards with your mouse very quickly (and quite excessively)  quite a distance to succesfully sink in a strike which may or may not bug out irregardless of line tension. It's not easy to get right, and Lag spikes compund this problem considerably.\n\nThe netting mechanic is, quite simply, spectacularly and singularly awful, and needs to be rebuilt from the ground up or done away with entirely. Because you cannot simueltaneously control your rod (with fish on) and the net at the same time, it is extremely difficult to orientate either so they allign, which is what you need to do in order to succesfully land a fish. What5 this tends to result in  ( along with many, many lost fish) is aa kind of rage-inspiring comedy of errors to the tune of:\n\nReel in fish a little closer to the bank. Pick up net. Fish takes out more line, making iut impossible to net fish.  Drop net. Reel in fish a little. Pick up net. Net not at correct angle in order to allign with fish. Drop net. Repeat x3. Get frustrated. Attempt to skulldrag fish in as close to the bank as possible in order to compensate for abysmal ( and entirely not sensitive enough) netting mechanic. Drag suddenly gooes from not tight enough to too tight. Line breaks, lose fish.\n\nAnd over and over ad nauseam.\n\nPerhaps the system is easier to negotiate with a controller. I have not played Euro fishing this way.\nIn any case, the game feels rushed, malformed , and  compared to something like fishing planet, is more annoying than it is enjoyable--additionally, there's not enough that's great about about it to allow one to look past its considerable and multivariate problems.\n\nScore:\n3/10.","March 31","false","9.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","1"

It's literally a run every 10 seconds. Because of this, there's no 'strategy' required at all. Just turn up to any water and flick just one rod out and catch constantly until your bored (5-10 minutes), and then quit. Even using 18mm baits with size 6 hooks doesn't seem to slow the catch-rate.\n- There needs to be a catapult/ bait boat option AND a way to select the bait your sending out.\n\nIf these issues are sorted that would be fantastic.","November 17, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It started out as a very solid, albeit bare, fishing game, but with every update features are added, and mechanics are dialed in some more. The team seems to be listening intently and working hard to put out as much win in every update as they possibly can.\n\nThis update brings a working multiplayer mode, which consists of the training lake (only) and up to 4 (iirc) other people fishing. There is a (half-working atm) chat function that lets players on a lake share tips and brag about big catches, which is very cool (if I see someone landing many fish, I tend to ask what bait they're using). Using chat while on a peg is problematic, though, due to the hotkeys for keyboard controls not being disabled while focus is on the chat box. My whole peg has been closed many times because I tried to chat, heh. The chat box also has a bad habit of ignoring sentences. Other than that, multiplayer is definitely working and enjoyable.\n\nThe quality of the fishing experience gets better with every update (imo), and the team behind it stay on the forums, getting feedback and making changes based on what they see and hear. Force feedback on a 360 controller is much improved, and the controls, for the most part, make sense. However, general consensus is that a mouse gives much better control of power for accurate casting.\n\nYou carry a tackle box and up to three fishing rods, and gain new gear by spending money earned from catching fish. Lake bed conditions and other factors make the careful choosing of bait and gear an important part of the process, as well as knowing a good spot or two. One can have 3 fishing rods baited and in the water at a time, and alarms on each rod (audible + light) let you know if something is nibbling and running with anything.\n\nThere are occasional bugs (flying fish, SPOD-arm until restart), but nothing too bad. After the features get hammered out better I am sure that the few there are will be dealt with accordingly.\n\nIf you like fishing and video games, this is a pretty safe bet. Just don't expect it to be a polished experience at this time.","December 20, 2014","true","68.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

If yes, this is your game. If I have to compare this game with the others from the past, this work is the most definitive masterpiece from all times. It aims for the relaxing side of lakeside amusement. No need to reel in to catch  your bass or pike, just use your wits to select your most effective rig, choose your most attracting bait, make a precise throw and wait for the bite. If everything's in harmony, you don't have to wait too long. The bite alarm will go off, and there you go... The fish fights, kicks, struggles as long as her energy keeps her moving. Is she big? Well mate, she will make you sweat because the rod behaviour and the the line tension are as realistic as in real life. It's not a rare thing, when you fight with the fish for 20 or 30 minutes. Keep the tension downs for a sec and off she goes... Your fish swims away like a lightening, and you stare at your empty hook thinking: "How's that possible?" On the other hand. If you're the better one: your catch tires out, lying exhausted on top of the water , you're still have to use your net to catch you prey. One wrong move, and the sleeping beauty awakes and off the hook... In short terms: This game is awesome, even, if it's in early acces stage. I just can't do anything else, only to recommend it!","June 27, 2015","true","46.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

The graphics are first rate. Great immersion. The animation of the water, trees, birds, flowers, this truly is the foundation for greatness. And I always wanted a fishing game where I could walk around the lake and fish from shore at various spots. Maybe a row boat will be in the future or a small hp outboard?\n\nTwo lakes for now. Hopefully more in the future. Would like better animation when you net your fish. I lost a couple because I wasn't sure how it was done. Then all of a sudden got one in the net. It's like from lake to shore with the net seeming to be a bit of a play with luck.\n\nConfusing start process. After the first lesson I went back and there was the same lesson. I thought there were more lessons. Apparently not but maybe I missed something.\n\n\nNetting: Weak. STINKS! The way it's done with the animation is p'poor. A stiff arm with one position and I can't even see the fish being netted. All of a sudden magically I'm seen with the fish on the shore. Lame. Very unsatisfactory. Looks like a shortcut to making this feature. Wish you either would get rid of it or stop making it seem like it was the hardest part of  fishing. It's not. It's a stupid badly implemented feature which has caused me to lose 4 fish on one session. It seems a huge shortcut was done at this stage and not worthy of the rest of the program. Pheuuey!\n\nHow about instead of a goofy menu system for the fishing supplies we can walk to a fishing supplies store with a store layout for each lake. Much more appealing and realistic.\n\nI'm expecting big things from this game as there is a great foundation.\n\nHow about taking a path to another lake by walking there and there is a stream on the way crawling with fish. I mean the beauty of the countryside has to be worth a nice hike.\n\nKeep it up guys (but get rid of or vastly improve that stupid netting feature - junk).","July 14, 2015","true","9.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Players are saying that the controls are whack but I just dont see it. Its supposed to be challenging and just one of those things that you have to master before you throw a perfect cast every time. I even found reeling in the fish was a nice challenge also (for me) but others may not think its hard and just pick it up fast. The only thing I have seen in the negative reviews that I agreed with is the textures and water quality but im running the game on ultra so it didnt bother me. The other presets though are kinda ugly but not ugly enough to give the game a negative review. I am a carp fisherman in real life and this game represents that well. The game is very fun and addicting but definantly not worth 25 bucks with the amount of content but if you get this on sale right now its worth it. If you are a fisherman this game is a must have.

The fishing may not be the most realistic in terms of fish behavior, but it is a newly released game so I hope there will be some improvements later on.\n\nSome reviews say this is a "Fishing Simulation" so it needs to have all of these different fishing tools and adjustments. But I don't think that the average player would want to learn how to adjust boilie buoyancy, hair length, shock leaders, ect. Also regarding the comments about how long it takes for a fish to bite, people would not want to sit for 15-30 minutes for a fish to bite so of course Dovetail would speed up how often you get a bite.\n\nAnd lastly the complaints about the graphics, its not a AAA title, don't expect groundbreaking graphics. The water could use some improvements, but the grass, fish, trees, and characters are fine the way they are.\n\nOverall in my opinion this is a great game just to sit down and relax, or try and compete with friends to see who could get the biggest catch.","November 4, 2015","true","8.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

McConville [29th]","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997042170/","117 products in account","This is a great game, very addictive but with some work needed.\n\nFirst the good,\nI like the fact you dont have to grind it out just to use some good tackle. when I walk into a fishing shop im not asked "what level are you?" ehh! the lakes look really well, digger lake is my fav' with all its nice we pegs snuggled away for me to find. Stalking suits me best. having used the Unreal engine is good as many know it and sets a sturdy base for game stablity. No doubt ill keep euro fishing installed as Im always saying "just one more fish" before im done today.\n\nNow, the bad (sorry it has to be done).\nThe game feels very, alpha still. there are a load of areas that need tweeks. ill start with the tackle, ive found the strongest line isnt the 25lb but the 15lb SUBLine (Stalking section). with the 15lb I just set drag to 100% and pull in anything that I hook up without a single danger of the line going tight and snaping. Of course the down side is if your fish goes real loose it will come off easy, or when you get a bite you may loose the fish before you even get to strike. this I dont mind though as its just like getting small hits as with real fishing. The rate of catching BIG fish is un-real, its like match fishing for roach and hauling in big carp and cats. The landing net just about works but again, it still works just needs more time spent tweeking, like most areas of the game.\n\nSo I would say this game is totally worth its price. Im really looking forward to the free float fishing DLC and the other areas the Dev's have sites on. A BIG factor im worried about though is the leveling, once on level 20 thats it. no need for any more XP. The game is JUST about ready for release and no more and I think the Dev's know that. There's plenty of work to be done but I for one will be supporting its progress.\n\n--EDIT--\nAfter the poor release of the patch its clear the dev's are un-able to put any effort into fixing the game. looks like it will stay half built....\n\nCheers!

After trying to cast oh I don't know at least a couple hundred tries at least. I once managed 11yds. The rest of the time it was 2 or 3 yds and sometimes it was behind me. I got it juring early access and thought well surely they will fix this so we can a least meet  the minimum useful distance of 15yds some of the time any way. I get it that it is a timing thing to the casting but I mean this is absolutely ridiculous. So I wasted my money on it. DON'T waste yours\nWell it wasn't me or the game. I went out and bought a new video card and it works beautifully now. So that being said the optimisation for older computers is poor. But with a decent video card it really could be one of the best fishing games ever.\n( (e.g. gtx750Ti). This replaced a 610. Big difference ddr5 memory.)

I sit on my couch, grab the Xbox 360 controller and start up the game. Not knowing how to play I go into Academy Mode to learn. Well guess what? ALL THE CONTROLS ARE STILL KEYBOARD/MOUSE.\n\nYou can move the guy around with the controller but the tutorial shows you what key commands to use and does not teach you how to play with a controller.\n\nYou would think after this much time they at least could have added proper controller support.\n\nThis is why you don't pay for EA games.","November 10, 2014","false","0.6"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","7"

I AM NOT REVIEWING THE GAMEPLAY!  I AM WARNING FELLOW AMERICANS THIS MIGHT NOT BE FOR THEM AT THIS POINT IN TIME.  This is for those who read reviews more carefully than store pages because we all know how stuff gets left out and details omitted on the store pages. This is for those who are looking for an American fishing game and I am here to tell you it is not.  I also in my original review below have doubts that there will ever be something for Americans. This is a very simple logical result of looking at how long it has taken them to get this far. They are not yet close to having carp done. In order to do lets say, northwest American Salmon fishing it would require at least an equal amount of time because locations, gear, everything is different. To do even catfish which they could borrow alot of stuff from the english carp world it would take months. Now I am not programmer but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see if it takes them over half a year to do 2 fish species with a few sub-species thrown in, then it will take a simular but not as long time to do a single other species. Does this game play ok?? IDK I don't play it anymore and I couldn't tell you because i am not English and I wouldn't fish for a carp if you paid me money to.  But if they ever do add any American species I will be the first MF'er to let yall know.\n\n\nAt the moment I cannot recommend this game due to one simple reason. The fishing is foreign. They do plan on having more fish species but for now its just carp and bream. Carp is a throw away fish that noone wants to catch in the US because they are full of bones, eat terrible and are considered the garbage of fish here in the US. Guess English folk love them but here they are junk. Bream is a fish your kid catches here in the US while your fishing for "real" fish. Its a kids fish that you can catch here in the US without even trying.\nSo really just have no desire to fish "ponds" for carp and bream. When the game gets completed I will give it another review. But I have my doubts that any American fish will be represented well because of the disconnect they seem to have to our fishing world(US). I don't think there is an American among them and fishing in England is apparently vastly different than it is here.","May 13, 2015","false","1.7"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","3","12","2","15"

The average game time over the last 2 weeks for all players is just 8 mins and the highest peak was 87 players in game 3 months ago.\n\nI hammered play hours into this game earlier this year and was very optimistic that the ideal carp/coarse fishing game was on it's way but I'm now of the opinion that whilst the community might differ in their opinion of the quality of the beta versions being offered up via Steam, the developers are now just using the PC players to "bench test" the gameplay on the version they plan to push out on console.\n\nLooking at those stats (8 mins average play over 2 weeks!) this far down the line I can't come to any other conclusion. The game is losing players and yet I still sense no urgency on the part of the developers to address those issues that the community is constantly offering up as constructive feedback relating to their gameplay experience.\n\nI am not being negative for the sake of it but the game appears to be going backwards in overall quality, aside the fact that additional content is being added in beta versions.\n\nThe Beta versions I've tried appear to contain many more "glitches" and bugs than the Alpha version that players enjoyed throughout the summer!\n\nAll stats were taken from Steam's own database and if it transpires that those figures don't include ongoing "beta" versions then I still think we should be nearer a finished and more polished version for the PC than we are now.\n\nI originally gave this game an ethusiastic thumbs up earlier this year but I regret that I can't continue to recommend it in its current state.  Even Early Access appears to have been withdrawn from the Steam Store with a final "Retail Release" being further delayed.\n\nVery disappointed overall given the game once appeared to have so much promise.\n","October 24, 2015","false","183.6"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","8","23","0","0"

I am enjoying the game, but I must say that casting by moving the mouse and clicking the right button at the same time is messy and inpractical. Anyway, by adjusting the mouse sensibility (middle position) I found that it is a lot easier. Still, I wish it could be done in other way.\n\nLakes are great. Each one with its unical features, including boss fishes. I hope they will add some more lakes in the future. Those available are located in various countrys, and tough the lakes themselves are fictional, they strongly resembles the real lakes of those areas.\n\nMy main complain is that you don't need much strategy for fishing. I mean, you mainly search for a nice peg, or go stalking. Fish move through the day from one area to another. But there's nothing that you can do to catch a certain species (well, except for the kind of bait you use), or going for real big fish or lake bosses . I would like the game to be more rewarding for the patient, strategic player, but devs tend to make this games more rewarding for begginers, in hope that they won't put down it due to initial boredom. The devs had stated that they are adding float fishing for free in the next weeks, so I hope the game will grow and get better. The store is a bit small, I would like to have more items to buy, including clothes, customized equipment, and so.\n\nOh, and Multiplayer is ok, but is not my thing.\n\nLast, but not least: I feel that the game is not very optimized. It won't run fluent in the typical laptop. My GeForce 840N doesn't handle it very nicely. You better check the requirements.\n\nAs a clonclusion... a very nice game, **if you like these kind of games**.

Right now im wondering if the game is already abandonned...EDIT: Ok they just started a beta with ALOT of contents.I tested it out and its very fun.Not polished yet.Game is not abandonned!I just wish they add more fishes other than carp. 2016-01-05 edit: Turned out to be euro fishing.They attracted us saying that they will add all types of fishing so we bought it.Now they totally changed the thing so they have less things to do to make the game complete.They said ''We start with european fishing then we will add other types of fishing''.I first bought the game planning to do some lure fishing but now its ''euro fishing only''.They should have said it earlier...Oh wait,if they would have said it earlier,nobody would have bought the game :P Waste of time and money.Pass your way.","July 7, 2015","false","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For me it's all about the gameplay which counts, almost everything is done well except one thing, and that's the feeling of the controller. Dear Developers, I don't know if you ever played the good old Nintendo64 game Zelda the Ocarina of Time which had an excellent fishing mini game in it. When I used to fish with the Nintendo64 controller I could feel what I was doing, there was a certain resistance because of the so called rumble pack especially when I caught something. I could even feel if it was a small or a big fish. But in this game I can't feel anything at all. This was a big disappointment for me and to be honest I now regret the fact that I bought the game (because I bought it thinking the controller function would work well, but I was wrong). I think you missed a great chance to make this a great game only because of this :(. I hope that "Fishing Planet" will do a better job by providing a better controller setup in the near future.","December 24, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
