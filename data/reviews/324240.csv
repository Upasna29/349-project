Zooming in helped make I Will Escape a bit better, but being zoomed out and going through a door sideways gives problems to the camera. Also, first person view isn't that well recieved either. You either have to hold the mouse buttons for that view or try to scroll around and click left mouse until you get it. AI has gotten a little better, but it's still bad. They still have that component of idiocy where they stand there and look around and leave (only this time it's longer). A guard caught me hiding next to a wall even though he was looking at the right of my perspective, which still shows that they're incomplete. There's still no option to change controls, so that's a big NO devs. Also, good thing that there's a tutorial now since people playing this game got confused trying to figure out how the controls work. This game is still not above mediocre. I could accept the fact that the graphics don't matter to any game, but suprisingly, the update gave me lower FPS than before. That might not be the problem for others, but for me, it is obviously.\n\nBefore update:\n\n-terrible graphics\n-terrible AI\n-terrible animations\n-terrible "stealth" system\n-terrible camera\n-terrible controls that you can't even bind\n\nOverall: I thought this game could pull off some good features, but boy was I wrong. The game is downright a disappointment. This game looked like a mod for source games. It doesn't even give you a tutorial on the start. Instead, you have to pick up pictures that give you a "tutorial", and it doesn't even tell how how to pick it up until you find one of the pictures for it. The worst part is that you're stuck with the controls for the rest of the game because it won't let you bind keys. The AI is downright terrible. I opened a door, and the gaurd went to investigate by walking towards the door and saying some random dialogue as he just walks away. The "stealth" in this game plays out as trial and error since getting caught once is an instant failure. The protagonist walks (or runs) like a woman. When you jump off and die, the death animation looks like it was from an N64 game. The camera is way too far away from the protagonist, and when you use the mouse, it just zooms in near your shoulder to the point where you can see through his arms and shoulder. This game's mechanics feels incomplete, and I feel like I've been ripped off. This game could've been good, but it's execution is too terrible.","December 22, 2014","false","2.1"," 226 of 262 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","226","262","0","5"

Even that is botched up on the very fist time you need to that.\n\nThe unresponsive controls (at least on the keyboard, don't know about controller) certainly doesn't help it. Just to open the inventory I had to bash the "i" button several times to get it open.\n\nThe story also is quite non existent and you get no connection to the silent protagonist at all.\n\nIf you want to see some footage of the game you can check my video of it      here\n\nDon't buy this. The Steam sale is on and a lot of better games are available for far less of you'r hard earned dollars/euros/quids.","December 22, 2014","false","0.6"," 146 of 179 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","146","179","0","2"

The fact that it doesn't highlight objects around in the room makes it more challenging.

I played it for about 2.3 hours  and it finally destroyed my computer. I went to go open a cabinet in game and it completely crashed. The part that I played though, I quite enjoyed very much. I recorded it on my youtube channel and I could tell it wasnt ready for youtube yet knowing that I just bought it in the early stages of development. Overall though, excellent and challenging game :). https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpu2OT14iHlOrwQV92bcPgfNdeTdOoL7L","December 29, 2014","true","2.3"," 22 of 110 people (20%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","20","22","110","3","2"

Surely this game also shows what the Blender game engine is capable of.\n\n","December 22, 2014","true","11.7"," 50 of 331 people (15%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","15","50","331","6","22"
