Actually, although this is a very technical subject, the developer's commentary that comes with it, is more than worthwhile listening to. It gives quite some insight into how this mini-level was constructed, and even into how HDR lighting actually works. It's not easy to talk about something as complex as this is an easily understandable manner. Fascinating stuff, and for the die-hard Vavle-fans: you even get Gabe Newell's words at the beginning of the commentary ;-).\n\nAfter playing it through for a second time recently - after having left it aside for over five years -  I felt amazed by how lively most of the graphics and - of course - the lighting still look today - a full nine (!!!) years after this level was published. Especially the little Byzantine church, part of the monastery on top of the cliffs, still feels amazing and oozes atmosphere. Valve did a wonderful job with the lighting inside the church, even letting dimmed light through the stained-glass windows. At the same time, it also made me a bit sad, because, well, how long has it been since we got the latest Half-Life content? Oh well, who knows....\n\nSince this one comes for free in the Orange Box and the Half Life 2-complete package, I guess most of you who played Half-Life 2 at some point, have this in your game collection. If you haven't tried it yet, by all means do so, but be advised: it's very good, but also very short ;-).\n\nOverall rating: 8/10","August 23, 2014","true","1.9"," 124 of 135 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","124","135","2","2"

To do that, you need to turn commentary on. This commentary came straight from the developers from Valve, like Gary McTaggart, Robin Walker, and Chris Green. After playing and listen to what they had to say, I understood the process of making a game a little bit more.

After finishing this game for the first time, I had to go back and play it several more times. In fact, I replayed this over 70 times and I still wasn't able to fully soak the story of the lone fisherman and his quest to help the protagonist Grodan Friedman and his trusty companion, the crowbar. I spent many hours up at night just trying to fathom what exactly went through the mind of Friedman as he traversed through the barren landscape of Highway 17. Don't even get me started on how much the High Dynamic Range adds to the whole game. Seriously. I mean, you couldn't get anymore detail and lighting even if you went outside, took a rocket to the surface of the sun, and stood there even though you'd be burning up. Overall, I give this game 8.76 times the square root of pi out of ten. Plus, you get more Garry's Mod Props.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/universeqq/recommended/340/","universeqq","UNiiiii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/universeqq/","101 products in account","Good, old memories...So one day, after school, I met with a friend at my home. We were both very young back then. I just got my first PC, but only played a few browser games on it. My friend however knew this one program which I thought would be illegal at first called "Steam". The dark design of it and the fear of the unknown made me feel like a hacker. The reason why he forced me to download it and create a new account was a special sale, where AMD graphic-card-users would get some games for free. These games were Half-Life 2: Deathmatch and Half-Life 2: Lost Coast. Lost Coast was my first First-Person-Shooter. After we killed every enemy and annihilated the chopper, tried every path, spammed "E" at every door in hope that we could open it, we gave up. We played a whole 2 hours (!) without knowing that it is just a showcase of the beautiful Half-Life-engine. But it was great. And it felt great. The scenery was beautiful and we both knew that we would get killed if our parents would find out. Actually, I believe that the fact that we played it secretely made it even more exciting. To hide Steam and both of these brutal amok-games from my father, who checked my Computer from time to time to install security-updates, I created several sub-folders in folders, all with unique categories about "Pokemon" yes, I played Pokemon a lot back then :D. I will never forget the day I started PC-gaming, nor my first FPS-experience. This day will be in my memory for all time. And no, I did not run amok a single time. At least not in real-life :P\n\nEdit: I played the game on another account tho.","January 27","true","1.1"," 75 of 82 people (91%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","91","75","82","45","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/recommended/340/","bashfulbritishboy","Schmoes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/","121 products in account","This really isn't much of a game, but more of a tech demo for the technical geeks. This little gem includes most elements found in its complete game, Half-Life 2. Originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2, this unused concept was scrapped, possibly due to time constraints or maybe based upon the fact that this game is a prototype all on its own.\n\nThis demo details various visual and graphic capabilities that are found in that said complete game. All the while, this ''game'' just shows how immensely strong the Source engine is, considering it was pretty new for its time back in 2004, and how it would become the most essential game engine to date, what with various Valve and 3rd party games being built on top of this incredible engine. The most clear concept that is shown off is the high dynamic range lightning that is now most commonly used in nearly all of Valve's games.\n\nThere isn't much of a story or a narrative in this demo, you're none other than Gordon Freeman, who is stranded on a lost coastal cliff, (The clue is in the title.) that you must climb up to destroy a Combine artillery launcher in a monastery, which is rebelling and attacking a nearby town. Though this is just one massive chunk of a technological demonstration, it has several story elements that didn't make the cut in the final game. As a result, this level received a good response from the community, as if the fans haven't been missing anything at all.\n\nWhile I would say, this game is very interesting if you love to dig down and unearth various unused game content and maybe discover a little of the history that had been closed.","November 3, 2014","true","0.1"," 65 of 73 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","65","73","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/340/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nHalf-Life 2: Lost Coast was used as a “Technology demonstration” showing the graphics, style, lightning, combat, and generally demonstrating the Source Engine in Half-Life 2. Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was developed by Valve the same time that Half-Life 2 was being developed, Lost Coast was released on steam in 2005.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: Some people might be asking “Atratzu, why are you reviewing this? It's not even a full game, it's a demo”. My answer is... I dunno... It's a game in my library and I want to review every game I've played.\nThere's not much to the story, you meet an old man (the fisherman) who takes you up a flight of stairs to unlock a gate to let you up to the chapel. Then you get ambushed by the Combine and need to demonstrate the amazing Half-Life 2 source engine to those jerks and kick their butts.\n\nGameplay: Keep in mind that this game came out in 2005. Today and in the future a Technical demo like this might seem silly, but at the time it was dazzling 3D graphics to onlookers.\nThe controls are the same as Half-Life 2... First person view, different types of weapons can be found and switched between using the scroll wheel or 1-2-3-4-5-etc, pew pew.\n\nAchievements: This game has the hardest achievements out of any video game I've ever played. They're broken down into one category: unforgivingly difficult. Beat the whole game in extreme-FUBAR-murder-death-mode. Play for 1,000 hours. Reach notorious hidden objectives, slay the hidden spider queen, and many more.\n\nActually, there aren't any achievements in the game.\n\nPrice: Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is priced at $39.99, for the stand alone game, it's crazy, isn't it? Imagine how much fun you could have with a game from 2005 for $39.99? I think that's a solid price, I think Valve could get away with charging an extra hundred dollars for the game and it would still be worth it.\n\nActually, it's part of a bundle with 9 other games within the “Buy Half-Life Complete”.\n\nConclusion: To quickly recap, the story was short and not really relevant, since this was taken out of Half-Life 2 (this was supposed to be a section of Highway 17). The Gameplay was identical to Half-Life 2 because it was basically a town in Half-Life. The Achievements were non-existent. The price is non-existent because it comes in a bundle with other games.\n“Should you get this game?” That question is irrelevant, “Should you buy and play the Half-Life Games?” Heck yes.","August 11, 2015","true","1.2"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","22","24","7","0"

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.\n2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.\n3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.\n4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed\n5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.\n6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.","February 14, 2015","true","0.4"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","69","25","36","38","0"

The gun mechanics are perfected without a flaw, when you are either shooting or reloading, its movement and sound are as convincing as a real gun. And the lighting and reflection make it seem as if it were real life. I would not recommend spending the $40 as its more of a demomstration and explanation of HDR rather than a story.

They cut it from the game but I think it was never a part of it, just a tech engine level. Reason being, it used HDR lighting and that is a feature of the Source engine that HL2 didn't use at all. People were upset by that but hey, here it is now. It's fun, beat it in 19 minutes but it came with my HL2 purchase here on Steam. It wasn't advertised with it but it was included.

Do yourself a favor, if you own this game, PLAY IT !!! This is the best chapter of the original Half Life 2. It wasn't finished at game release, because it was so advanced that it took longer to perfect. Everything about this game is amazing. The sound effects, the voice acting, the characters, the visuals, water effects, gravity gun, the exploration, the many varied weapons and ammunition, the shootouts, the game play with keyboard and mouse. Don't rush through this game, do some exploring, throw objects around with the gravity gun, smash wooden objects; boxes,boats, find health, find armor repair, Towards the end you get unlimited bazooka ammo, to fire at enemies, helicopters, down towards the beach, at the rocks.  I found alot of replay value, because you can use different tactics, and learn how to make best use of your weapons. The Artificial Intelligence of the enemy is the best.

If you get Half life: complete, play this game, and make sure you turn on the developer commentary! Thats pretty much the entire point of the game, beacuse it focuses on how Valve diescovered new ways of developing the source engine after Half Life 2: Episode 2 was released. If this was available to buy by itself, I would assume that Valve only released this short, basic game to earn an extra few thousands of dollars or so, but also beacuse they wanted to show the players the new way they came up with making the graphics for the source engine, the character animations, and the lighting affects. If you are a developer, this is a good game to play if youre testing out your Source scripts or something. I think this is a pretty good game. I recomend the it. Don't wonder why I typed so much for a game that you can't even purchase without buying the entire pack, but I just feel like typing right now. Well, thats all. Goodbye. P.S, don't think im an idiot if you look at this game its its perfectly available to buy, when I wrote this, it wasnt available, and I don't know if it ever will be available to buy by itself again.","March 15, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's not a game in itself, it's a brief but enjoyable scenario/side-quest set in the Half Life universe.  Made by Valve.  So obviously excellent, but I wouldn't exactly go buying a $40 pack for this and this alone if you already own all or most of the other stuff in it.  But if you got Lost Coast for free, as I believe I did, then there's nothing to complain about, is there?\n\nOn the other hand, if you're the "independently wealthy" type, $40 might be the equivalent of a piece of chewing gum in the back pocket of us lesser plebs, so you may as well just spend that much on a 30-minute "game" irrespective.  Or you could be more generous and give it to the derelict currently rifling through the trash can on your footpath, if you're that filthy ♥♥♥♥ing rich.

It's not a game in itself, it's a brief but enjoyable scenario/side-quest set in the Half Life universe.  Made by Valve.  So obviously excellent, but I wouldn't exactly go buying a $40 pack for this and this alone if you already own all or most of the other stuff in it.  But if you got Lost Coast for free, as I believe I did, then there's nothing to complain about, is there?\n\nOn the other hand, if you're the "independently wealthy" type, $40 might be the equivalent of a piece of chewing gum in the back pocket of us lesser plebs, so you may as well just spend that much on a 30-minute "game" irrespective.  Or you could be more generous and give it to the derelict currently rifling through the trash can on your footpath, if you're that filthy ♥♥♥♥ing rich.

It took me 10 minutes to finish the entire chapter and it's still incredibly fun.\n\nThe reason this was released was to showcase the incredible range rendering and the new feature which was implemented into future valve games, the commentary mode.\n\nSince you get this for free if you own Half Life 2 I see no reason not to check it out. It's still Half Life and it's still great.\n\nFinal Rating:\n7/10 - Play It\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked the review post in the comments on what you disliked.\n\nPlease also check out Completing the Backlog's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n","October 30, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Half-Life series goes on a flash sale. I buy Half-Life 2 and both episodes for a total of around siz bucks. I go to my library to see something odd. Three other games I have no record of purchasing.\n\nHalf-Life 2: Lost Coast is more of a sightseeing tour than an actual Half-Life game. The game is supposed to take place sometime during the "Highway 17" chapter of Half-Life 2, but it really dosnt fit in.\n\nHalf-Life 2: Lost Coast introduces nothing new to the series, exept a heavily modified Source Engine. The water is more reflective and Gordon's pupils ajust to lighting. Thats it.\n\nThe game looks more like Counter-Strike: Source that Half-Life 2.\n\nStandalone, you pay $50 for a 10 minute experience. Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is $30 for the main 2 hour mission, plus side missions. Half-Life 2: Lost Coast has one mission, and one mission only. Do NOT buy this as a stand-alone game. Buy Half-Life 2 and both episodes (if you havnt already) and you will get this for free. You will also get Half-Life Deathmatch: Source and Half-Life 2 Deathmatch. Three free games for the price of one and two expantions? Thats a good deal.\n\nHalf-Life 2:Lost Coast isnt a bad game, its just unfairly priced. If anything, it should be free.\n\n2/10","September 10, 2014","false","0.9"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","2"

To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press the +USE key. To stop the commentary, put your crosshair over the commentary node and press your +USE key again. Some commentary nodes may take control of the game for the purpose of showing something to you.

The price does seem odd even though its a unreleased level of Half-Life2!
