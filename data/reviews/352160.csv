For example, an enemy you can't hit, until it slams it's shield onto the ground. However, once those same shield enemies clump together, it becomes very difficult to kill them. There are also enemies that heal their allies, two different ranged attackers, an enemy that rolls near you, in droves, and blows up, an enemy that throws flame AoE at you, and small critters.\n\nThe game became very fustrating towards the end, which was at wave 29-30. You are expected to retrieve 3,000 souls, which is a lot. You will be engulfed in flames, shield slammers, enemy healers, and lots of explosive enemies.\n\nI was terribly, terribly destroyed and I ended up quitting on my 5th try on completing the wave, where I must retrieve the 3,000 souls. I have yet to complete the game.\n\nI do not recommend this game to casuals, but those who are willing to experience a game that will challenge their gamer minds.","June 23, 2015","true","1.8"," 45 of 64 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","45","64","3","0"

That's it. There's dialogue, but nobody reads anymore. (amirite)\nApparently you're supposed to help this Mummy guy, Ebo, lift the Curse of Mermos (GASP the game title!)\nYou fight ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Cool. But that's about it. Sure there's a shop and all, but there's only those 5 items. Two of the items aren't even items.\nThe glyphs are alright IMO. They add a little bit of risk to the game while still adding worthwhile benefits such as life regen or more health at the cost of agility.\nCool ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. So, lets get down to the gameplay. If you're using a mouse and keyboard... So sorry. Controllers are fine! They work great with this game and almost every review besides mine has the controller influence it.\n\nI'm gonna get down to the other stuff. Clipping.\nI'm not talking about "Oh I can go through one of the pillars in the main room" clipping. I'm talking game breaking clips.\nYou can go through the wall behind Ebo at anytime. It's literally not there. You can go through any gate you want (closed or not) with these clips, but the cost is you can't continue your game any further. It will literally keep you in the room you are supposed to be in forever (whether or not all the enemies are killed).\nThe game is solid until you screw up with one roll and end up through a gate you aren't supposed to be behind.\n\nNext thing. Saving.\nThere is none. I quit (after i broke my own game testing the clipping and such) and restarted, expecting to resume from where I had left off.\nNo. That is not a thing. You WILL have to restart if you quit.\n\nConclusion:\nThe game, if you don't break it, is solid. Great for controllers, but not for keyboard users such as myself (luckily I had a spare ps3 controller just lying somewhere). The story is straight forward with little interruptions, but the gameplay is repetetive. I give this game a 4.5/10","June 24, 2015","false","0.9"," 50 of 81 people (62%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","62","50","81","22","3"

It's a simple, easy-to-learn hack-and slash game. I'm not sure if it is endless or not (I got bored at around wave 30-35) The upgrading aspect was fun at first but after the 3rd upgrade or so it was just the same old because there were no more extra abilities but then glyphs were introduced which are pretty cool and/or unique.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/halted/recommended/352160/","halted","Haltimus Prime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/halted/","201 products in account","I went through and played the game until wave 29 and just couldn't take it anymore. I was having fun at first but by the time I got to wave 11 I started getting very aggrivated, it's not hard or anything just annoying. Enemies spawn right on top of you so you have to constantly roll to not get hit, this is not good game design. I appreciate that you guys released it for free so I can't really complain I guess but I found myself asking "When is this going to be over"? I don't mean that in a good way either, I was genuinely annoyed by playing this. There is no point to having melee attacks at all in this either, you take way too much damage when attempting to do so and I ended up just using the bow instead. By the time you get the charge shot you realize just how broken the combat is as well, since you can't aim with the second thumbstick you have to use the lock on system which you called strafing for some ungodly reason. How about calling it what it is instead. I didn't know I could lock on until the sixth wave because of it when you decided to put a tutorial message about it in the upper right corner of the screen. You can't call those videos in the beginning a tutorial either, they just show you gameplay with no real description of whats going on. It's a good effort for a student project but if you're going to be doing game design when you get out of school there are a lot of things you need to take into consideration from this project. I honestly do not see a point in this game being released on steam other than to show off your hard work which is probably just copied and pasted from source that is already available on the web. Anyway, back to the lock on system, you'll miss more shots than you'll hit due to having to use it and since you can't aim without moving it makes things much more difficult than it should be. I don't mean difficult as in hard either I mean controlwise this game is garbage. In the later levels you'll find yourself rolling around the entire map until all of the enemies spawn and then leading them single file into your charge shots... this is not fun. If the devs go back and fix a lot of the things in this game for the steam release then I could definitely recommend this but as it stands with the shoddy mechanics and not being able to save your progress for later then I can't. The game isn't very long, two hours at the most but having to play all the way through in one sitting feels like a chore with the mechanics the way they are now. With all that said, I still say good work to the devs because this is great for a school project but I just feel like there should be more to the game than there is for it to really gain traction here on steam. A for effort, D for execution.","June 24, 2015","false","1.9"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","27","49","5","0"

And first and foremost, it is highly recommended that you try this with a gamepad (It seems most bad reviews are related to it being hard to play on keyboard and mouse).  Once you get that out of  the way though, you are left with a simple, yet very fun game. It has nice progression, and the combat yet simple is a very good example of an action rpg  dungeon crawler of sort, it is tricky and the monsters AI is good.\n\nIt is totally worth picking up and playing, A bang for your buck, but since it's free that's even better, no?\n\nHighly recommended, if anything but to support great indie devs.","June 24, 2015","true","0.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It is simple, it is free and it is exactly what it presents to be.\n\nHowever, even though this game is free (saying this for the third time), it just seems....it lacks the desire to keep on playing the game. Graphics are outdated, but the gameplay is solid. The story doesn't really matter (as there is no true story behind it)\n\nBut I can not recommend this game. Not in the current state. Add more customisation. More classes? More weapons? More beasts to fight on, and perhaps different locations? I haven't played it a lot, true, but it just doesn't seem be worth my time.

But, there is a big problem with these weapons, on the one hand, the melee weapon is too dangerous because you will need to keep your health as high as possible at all parts of the game and getting into your enemies face is not a smart idea what so ever, so it is greatly unrewarding and even punishing to mostly use a melee weapon. And on the other hand, the ranged weapon suffers greatly because of the aim system in the game, now you would think that you would aim by moving your mouse BUT NO you have to use a mechanic called "STIFE" in order to aim, and boy, is this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• annoying, it is almost impossible to aim with this mechanic, lets move aside that it would 99% only aim for the closest enemy, when you try to fire a channeled attack with the crossbow, which is so important when defeating enemies (especially healers) it just wanders around before you attack and shoots at a nearby wall. COOL.\n\nThis makes the game almost unbeatable, I do not see any point of having this stupid - ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• mechanic instead of aiming with your mouse. To add on that, THERE IS NO SAVE BUTTON. There are 30 stages in the game, most of them take about 3 to 5 minutes and this game is really time consuming, and when the game does not allow you to save your progress, well good luck with that. It sure must suck having to spend 2 hours to get to the boss just to get your interenet disconected and to not having any checkpoints or saving methods is sure fun.\n\nIn conclusion, I liked the game BUT I think there are some great improvments to be made.\nFirst thing is to either repair the stupid mechanic of strifing to actually work, or even a better option would be to make you able to aim with your mouse.\nSecond thing is adding up a saving button, or a checkpoint of some sorts (that saves your progress even if you exit the game).\nThird thing is I think this game should add a difficulty scale, I see no reason repeating this game for now, it has only one map and "quest" so in the same difficulty there is no reason to repeart it, The game is so easy until the couple of last levels, you should be increddible dumb to die before that.\nAnd my last suggestion, add on maps and "quests", with a new boss, new enemies and a completely new area.\n\n6/10 for me.","June 24, 2015","true","11.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Can't beat that, also, NO ADS, it is 100% free.\nIt's cute, it's got a great atmosphere. The music, sound effects, artwork. It all comes together to make a great little game. It plays almost exactly like Burn Zombie Burn, except with more technical enemies, and ALOT of running around. It has a great difficulty curve, and culminates in a very natural "boss" encounter and puts all of your skills to use, I wish more games ended like this one, instead of using some weird cookie cutter boss that does not relate to your skills. I loved how the game makes you develop these natural strategies for dealing with the different enemies, and I felt like I was definitely getting better at the game the longer I played it.\n\nNeutral things\nIt took me about 90 minutes to beat, in one sitting. I died twice. I'm pretty good at twin stick shooters, so your mileage may vary, but that is pretty short.\nCould be shorter, given the amount of enemies, but I wish there was either more enemies, or a different level set, then just the 1 room. Also, after getting all of the artifacts, there's nothing to do for 10 levels other than wail on enemies until the final boss.\n\n\nBad Things\nThe control scheme really needs some work. I played this using a PS4 controller, and OMG my right thumb hurt. The game is described as a twin stick shooter, but you never use the right stick ever. It's more of strafe, and JAM the fire button as fast as you can, or the melee button. After 30 levels of doing that, in one sitting I now have a thumb cramp. I don't understand why the ranged weapon doesnt have some kind of basic auto fire on it, with the ability to fire more when you tap the button. Also, why isn't the melee button bound to right stick, and then have the charge up be bound to a trigger, instead of using the same control scheme as the ranged.\n\nI didnt even attempt to play this using a keyboard and mouse, so your mileage may vary, but I highly recommend a controller, plays VERY well with one, control scheme not withstanding.\n\nSo Form Review score is 8/10\n- Great graphics\n- Great atmosphere\n- Great gameplay\n- Fun!\n- Free!\n- /Kind of Short\n- /Controls could use a bit of work","June 24, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It should be a large open field, with hoards of enimes, instead of a small, ompact room with 100 enimies per wave that die in a few hits. To be honest, the description of the game given by the creators is crap. I got the game so I could play it with my friend, but I couldn't get the multiplayer option to function.

Ah, a review on, "Curse of Mermos," seems like a good idea.\n\nCurse of Mermos, a game where you're a Young Archeoligist, where you come across the tomb of... Eto, Epo? I forget, anyways, It's pretty much a Game where you go through 31 Waves, the 31st being the final wave and you get Upgrades along the way. You also have to collect 4 Artifacts along the way, which triggers another wave, so don't get the item until ready. There are also two items of Value, Shards & Souls, Shard are used to purchase Glyphs that help you along the way, while Souls can be used to Purchase Potions and upgrades for your Axe, Bow, Speed, and Health.You have an Axe and a Bow, which are used to defend yourself. You can Roll around as well and this is where a Glitch comes in, if you upgrade your roll all the way, you can get into ANY area by rolling and I mean ANY AREA, you can roll through walls with this glitch as well, which can ruin the Gaming experience of this game. Let's switch to the topic of Mobs/Monsters, First we have Scarab Beetles, (GET IT CAUSE WE'RE IN THE EGYPTIAN TOMBS HUEHUEHUE) Skeletons, (Original/10) Warrior, (Pretty much there in the near to last waves) Suicide bombs, (Wait what.) Skeleton heads, (AGAIN WITH THE SKELETONS!) Fire Creatures, (FIRE, FIRE, FIREEEEE!) and the most annoying Mob/Monster, Healers. (I can't remember their names.)\n\nOverall, the game gets a 4/10, the effort was minimal, and it needs more Variety.","July 18, 2015","false","1.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","0"

Tabbing it target after target, since you can't do it with the mouse and otherwise the only option to aim is with A, W, S, D. Next to that you have to spam the right mouse button to shoot single bolts (or melee up close with left button) a lot! especially at the beginning. Which again doesn't feel comfortable at all!\n\nAfter about 40 minutes reaching wave 20+ some mobs came in wielding a shield and the only way to hit them is from behind. Which you have to do by waiting for an attack, quickly run behind them and hit. But then I got 4 of them at once, and its practicly impossible to properly hit them without being hit by them, due to the clumsy controls.\n\nIt eventually made me ragequit the game, not because I couldn't beat it. But because my fingers hurt like hell of the shift + mouse click spam and the frustration it brought. I for sure won't touch this game again, the idea is neat. But the controls make this game practicly unplayable.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtimarPWTYk","June 23, 2015","false","1.5"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","12","28","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jujak/recommended/352160/","Jujak","Briggs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jujak/","175 products in account","TL;DR at the bottom.\nFirst off I enjoyed the game for what it is, a neat little hack'n slash game with rpg-ish elements. But the cons outweigh the pros way too much to actually recommend this game.\n\nHere's why:\n- No explanation on how things came to be. The first part of the narrative is missing. You are basically a random guy with two OP AF ancient weapons, a hammer and a crossbow and you lay waste to hundres of scarabs, skeletons and whatnot to help out your best homie Ebo for whatever reasons. Cool story brah.\n- Progress is not saved: once you quit, you quit and everything starts all over again. Unless you plan to finish the game in one sitting ragequitting to someday come back to this game is not an option.\n- Controller use is recommended because the mouse and keyboard is not fully supported / was meant to be played with controller. Sounds fair(?). Curious enough, the right control stick was not used at all in this kind of game it could / should have to allow some sort of free aim while fighting with the crossbow.\n- At the end of each wave you have a little cheer that is around one second long. Sounds short but it's pretty annoying if that's the reason you miss out on some souls (currency dropt by enemies) and you are ~1-5 souls short for your new upgrade.\n- The upgrade system is basic. Very very basic. Weapons and health upgrades have an early milestone which unlocks a charge attack for weapons and the ability to magically carry more health potions.... Other than that there is nothing but increased damage. Glyphs are interesting yet you will automatically choose the one without a malus. Glyphs with a bonus AND a malus are risky and the reward is not all to clear in it's actual worth.\n- As you already have two OP weapons, there is no need for other items. No loot for you. And no experience. So it's a hackn' slash game with rpg-ish elements. But 100% purebred free game (and the crowd goes mild!).\n\nBut to be fair a little pro aspects as well:\n- Starting screen allows you to choose the keybinding, graphics (basic option with no explanation) and the monitor. Neato.\n- It runs smoothly and I experienced no crashes, but it could be because of the low gametime. Who knows.\n- Sounds are decent as well as the music.\n- No annoying ads at all. like / favourite / subscribe\n- While the game itself looks pretty basic it is very much unforgiving if you do not use the talents and options available to you. Prepare to Die Edition.\n\n\nLoveletter to the devs:I would like to see a story, an introduction and a narrative. A personality for the character you are playing and a motivation. Improved upgrade system both souls and shard one. More options in the options (kek), for audio / colourblind / other languages / damage numbers. The implementation of the right stick for free aim while using a weapon. Combination of moves (roll + melee / range) for another new move. Visible upgrades to the weapons and character to counter balance the no items agenda for the character progression.\nCharacter creation(?): male / female, face, hair. I noticed that the dude has brown hair in the icon but runs around with a blonde wig ingame. Leaderboards. If you make the decision to stay on steam and release new games, make sure you implement steam as well (trading cards and achievements). It gives new room, for example challenges and such.\nThe option to run the game in windowed fullscreen. And most important an option to actually save progress.\n\nThat's about it and I would like to try a 2.0 version of it in the future.\n\nIf you read through this brick and you're not convinced or take me for a dirty ol' liar you better check yourself and give the game a try before you wreck yourself... punk.\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Your mom says hi.","June 24, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

And since I'm not that far into the game (and to be honest, i'm not even out of the first room) to tell what those gold things are, I'm gonna assume it's another 'F2P' game that is P2W.\n4/10.

It's in no way memorable or fun, seeing as the game just recycles itself over and over until you want to do your head in with a rock. Thank god this game is free; this review would have been a lot angrier if it wasn't.\n\nYou will only see 7-8 different types of enemies throughout the whole 30 wave game. You've got generic spiders, generic skeletons, generic skeleton  heads , generic mummies, and generic healers; each with only one flimsy attack to defend themselves with. Every enemy gets used so many times that you really have to hope and pray for somthing original to pop up.\n\nAnother thing to question is the game's complete lack of substance. The entirety of it is rinse and repeat: finish a couple waves, retrieve a trinket. Upgrade some stuff, finish more waves, retrieve a trinket. This repeats  FOUR TIMES  until you're left with nothing but filler waves to make the game seem longer. Every wave up to wave 20 is extremely easy; there's never any need to use melee whatsoever (even when the game tells you "You won't escape the tomb without using melee" in a tip). All you really need to upgrade is agility, health, and bow damage. After getting the fourth trinket, the waves are literally  THE EXACT SAME . I quit the game at round 28 because I literally became sad every time a new wave was ready to be played. It's  that  repetitive and boring. The enviornment doesn't even change for christ's sake; you're stuck in the same cluster of confined spaces for an eternity.\n\nBefore I keep ranting on and on, let me just simplify all of this: Curse of Mesmos is beyond bland. Every enemy is recycled to oblivion, the story that the game tries to pull off is non-existant, some attacks never even need to be used at all (despite the game saying so), and if you don't have a controller, you're screwed. This game is not worth your time in the slightest.\n\n","June 29, 2015","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was hoping to spend my leisure playing an interesting hack'n'slash game. I expected this game to be as superb as Path of Exile and I can tell you I was mistaken. If you are looking for a decent hack'n'slash game, well... keep looking. This game doesn't support PC gamers who don't have gamepads and use their mouse + keyboard combination instead. It's very hard to aim and thus the enemies don't yield even during the very first levels. The plot doesn't seem to be clear for me, you feel like the entire game starts in the middle of a tangled story you don't have a clue about. It's literally like finishing someone's unfinished game. Although the game appears to be a pleasant boredom-killer, it's more of a terrible attempt of the authors to come to existence in the games industry. I'm sorry to say so, but this game is a disaster to say the least. I don't recommend it at all.","July 7, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because of its lenght, you could finish it in abut 2-3 hours (my experience) but the replayability is actually enjoyable if you really like the gameplay.\n\nTEST RESULTS:\n\nFunny, time-killer, challenging (sometimes) cute-looking, and FREE.\n\nMy final grade is 8.0 - Really Worth Playing","January 7","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is an okay game. I don't dislike it, it's just that, it's one of those games you play when you are bored. Yeah.\n\nCurse of Mermos, (I will call it CoM), is a game where you fight of waves of monsters, and buy items to help you better fight off these waves. The game is set in the tomb of Ebo, and your only weapons are the Hammer of Horus amd the Crossbow of Neith. You unlock/upgrade your ablities with souls, witch drop off enemies, (This sounds like Dark Souls). As you play, the waves of monsters get harder and harder, with new enemies being introduced a lot. Also, there is no saving feature, so if you exit the game, or go to the main menu, then you have to start all over again. I find this really stupid. You don't even get your upgrades back!\n\nOverall, this is a mediocre game at best. I know some people may like it, and that is fine. It was an okay game. I just don't personally recommend this game to people.","October 16, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
