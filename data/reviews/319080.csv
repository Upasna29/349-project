The graphics are on the lower end and it's definately a lower-budget game. I definately do not suggest getting this game at full price. I do however think that if you have a daughter or son who loves the Disney Princesses, that this game is something they will enjoy.\n\nThe game tends to be a bit repetitive in it's game play, however there's an actual, well-thought out story and many references to your child's favorite movies. A lot of places they'll explore are straight from scenes on the big screen. The customization is also well done and gems are easy to find so it's not taxing on the player to try to stay frugal: I found that I could buy almost all of the dresses right away in just collecting gems in the first area (use the magic twirl "n" near bushes at least 3 times to get all of the gems- you can do this again once you leave the area and come back to keep farming for more gems to shop to your heart's content). The voice acting isn't grating although I did experience some issues on the playback.\n\nKeyboard controls can be changed in the options menu, however for a small child, the arrow keys to move, spacebar to jump, and "n" and "m" to cast spells are easy enough to grasp, as well as easy enough for their smaller hands to reach all keys. Only issue with this default setting is that this is awkward to use this and then toggle the mouse from time to time. However the camera and controls work smoothly, and even the platforming sections were easy enough.\n\nThe game's length can actually give a bang for your buck- even outside of taking time to explore and unlocking each item, each princess has a good handful of quests to do. Unfortunately, the only princess left out of the attention is Princess Tiana, who only has three missions, and can't be unlocked until the very end- doesn't look too well compared to the other princesses.\n\nAt the end of it all however, this games has what feels like an equal amount of up's and down's about it. At first I was going to not recommend this game until I saw the other screenshots posted. Sure, there are a few joke postings there from adults (like myself), but the young players who took pictures seemed to genuinely enjoy the game and interacting with their beloved fairy tale characters. If you can find this game for a good discount for your kid- go for it.","November 19, 2014","true","3.1"," 55 of 76 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","55","76","4","0"

I like that there are pink things and ummm lots of purple things too! I made my own princess at the start and I made her really pretty! She has long pink hair and a purple dress! I want to look just like her when I grow up. Ummmm... you run around and can do lots of things! Like, this one time, there was this really sad flower and it was all alone and I gave it some water and it wasn't sad anymore! This game is really good.\n\nSometimes, I wish I could go into my computer and play with my princess. She is really pretty. We can wear pink dresses and find sad plants and make them happy! Maybe one day I will grow up and be just like her. This game is really good.\n\nI see lots of sad people and I wish I could be like my princess and make them happy.

But it doesn't take long to get used to it. In the end the controls seem fine and I didn't had any issues with it.\n\nThe Gameplay itself is rather stunning for a children game, you can costumize your character and can make it look like anything you want, you can decorate your own room and even have your own garden to look after.\n\nThe resolution can't be changed and stays as the native wii resolution. The Game itself is a Wii Port and not a bad one at it. The Graphics are might a bit pixely but not bad, rather cartoony and cute.\n\nI could run the game fine without any crashing problems whatsoever.\n\nThe only thing I have been missing is personally some Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. I really love Ariel from the Disney Princesses and would off loved a background from her. Hopefully they will add this eventually to it.\n\nAll in all this Game is nice, especially for children, the puzzles are easy for adults and fun for kids. But due to the fact that this game is only 4 hours short I can't recommend it for its full price of 20€. Grab it on sale!\n\nI can recommend this game to any child or disney fan.

Atleast this time you don't have a health bar that goes to 0, does nothing, then just fills again, like the EP PS2 Version. Don't get me wrong - I haven't found a way to lose yet, but that might be a good thing considering the target audience is much younger than me.\n\nFor the target audience the game possesses some unique features, particularly with the entire Disney Princess Series under copyright, you basically can't find these characters in other games afaik. For young girls, and prehaps some boys too, this is a game that is designed to keep them entertained not teach them world class chess strategy. I do feel rather bad that these games get a rather "girly" stigma. Nothing wrong with a boy enjoying playing dress-up in girl's clothes.","January 4, 2015","true","4.9"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","13","20","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/recommended/319080/","the_baka","Powersocke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/","227 products in account","Disney Princess: My Fairytale Adventure is a Disney licensed game about a little mage apprentice and the mishap she caused while experimenting with a spell, transforming all her little sprites into imps. Your goal? Catch the imps, transform them back into sprites again and save various people's days in the process.\n\n\nAnd this covers most of the story, really.\nSo, in the beginning of the game you get to customize your character. You can choose between various dresses, hair styles as well as hair- and skin colours. I think you can even vustomize your name but it doesn't have any relevance whatsoever - naturally, since all the characters are voiced and it's not exactly a triple-A RPG.\nAfter that follows a cutscene in which you see your little princess messing around in her magical garden, casting spells and whatnot. After a little mishap, all her sprites, her little helpers, get transformed into imps which then quickly proceed into your castle, go to the portal room, steal all the portal's crystals and venture into the worlds of five prominent Disney princesses.\nThroughout the story you will help all those princesses through their day with a lot of problems (most of them caused by the imps) while attempting to transform the imps back into sprites and reclaiming your magical crystals. There are five portals in total, making for ten stages (two for each portal).\n\nAnd story-wise, that's about it. Now, gameplay-wise it's pretty basic stuff really. You can move in all directions and you can cast magic. Magic is used to complete certain objectives, make plants grow or shooting down imps. And that's it.\n\nThere are some little extras in the game as well. You can tend to your magic garden and you can decorate your bedroom if you so desire. You can find different kinds of flowers and furniture as well as dresse in chests that can be opened once you got specific magic crystals from specific stages. So in short, the game expects you to not only play through but to play through the stages again to open all the chests to decorate your bedroom and re-fill your magical garden. I didn't do it but there might be some people who will find this appealing.\n\n'course there's also music in the game and it ain't half bad. Thing is: it's the most generic video game music I've ever listened to. It is not memorable in any way, shape or form. But it's much better than pure silence.\nStaying with the audible things, the voice acting is kinda hilarious sometimes and the voice of your little princess is quite ♥♥♥♥♥-y if I may say so.\n\nGraphics and design wise the game is very basic. You can make out what's what but the character designs tend to be sub standard. If you take a good look at Ariel you will instantly notice how disfigured and horrific her face looks in this game. *shudders*\n\nAnyway, there are a couple of things in this game I just can't excuse so easily. Yes, I know, it's a kid's game but that doesn't mean that the female narrator of the game has to tell me tzhe same exact thing every time it becomes applicable. Everytime you engage in "combat" and hunt down imps, she tells you exactly what to do. Every. Single. Time. And it's like that with everything else. I feel like the game thinks I'm stupid and has to constantly remind me of the controls. I know, it's a kid's game but children are not stupid and this is just insulting.\n\nOther than that the blandness of story and gameplay combined with the short play time make for a less than commendable game overall. I mean, I didn't expect much in the first place, just sayin'.\nHowever, game's stable, no bugs or glitches, no crashes. Only thing I'm kinda worried about is the resolution the game runs on. I dunno how I made it through, honestly.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Well... I played it for a laugh. And it provided me with several laughs soooo... it's alright. Yeah why not. I'll give it a solid Loli Princess/10.","May 20","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

However i will admit this is definitely a game for little kids. It is fun though, theres a fairly good amount of variety in the games. The difficulty is very easy, making it a really casual game. The character designs aren't the prettiest, though they did a great job animating each of the princesses worlds.\n\nPros:\n- if you love disney, you'll love the cuteness of this game\n-simple games with a bit of variety\n-difficulty increases each level\n- get to decorate your own room, take care of a garden, and explore the different worlds\n-customize your character with different hair, hair colors, eyes, eye color, and lips\n-can choose your favortite dress style and customize the colors\n-lots of different accessories to choose from\n-so absolutely adorable that I just want to hug it\n-Any little kid, or disney fan, would absolutely love this game.\n- there's different flowers to grow in the garden and you can water, weed, sing to, fertilize and just take care of them. (singing to them is a small mini game where you hit arrow keys to match them).\n\nCons:\n-there's only two levels\n- there's four worlds, so there's only 8 levels, or "chapters" and then you unlock princess tiana's world, and get one more chapter.\n-the games all involve the same kind of goal, you use your magic to stun the imps , or you use twirl magic to get rid of webs after you defeat the imps, and then there's only a few other games (shooting bubbles at other bubbles to pop them, putting puzzles together, and then some other games)\n-the instructions get really repetitive and annoying after awhile, each time you have to do something/play a game. and i didn't find any way to turn them off.\n-after you beat the game there isnt too much to do\n\noverall I'd give it a 7/10 , very cute, but all the instructions get a little annoying, and I got to make my own princess and see my favorite princess. I helped Rapunzel, and that made the game awesome.","June 23, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is 4 princesses to see and each world has 2 chapters in it with different quests. when you finish each chapter you can go back to your own castle and garden to collect crystals and decorate your room and buy things from the wishing well. when you finish all 4 there is a surprise princess level which is fun too. After I had completed everything i went back through each level and made sure i had collected all the crystals and treasure chests as each level has different amounts and different treasure chest. I planted 1 of each flower and by the end i had bought everything from the wishing well, collected every item and treasure chest and had the maximum amount of crystals which is 3000 you can get extra ones by using twirl magic in the bushes and barrels and trees 3 times the mini games are fun too and you can play them seperatly when you start the screen up.
