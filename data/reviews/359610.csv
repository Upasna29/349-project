After a little bit of play time I was really enjoying this game, until the combat sections kicked in. The controls just aren't very responsive and controling your character in combat is clumsy. Before this I was having a lot of fun sneaking around guards, climbing buildings, and scaling rooftops. The issues with the combat would be forgiveable if it wasn't a neccesity and stealth was encouraged, but this segment killing the enemies was a requirement. Another issue is that the keybindings for keyboard and mouse are not well mapped. Video options are limited to resolution, vsync, and fullscreen. Although this game is not graphically advanced so this isn't a huge issue, but more video settings would be nice. That being said the visuals are nice and the presentation is good. The voice acting is alright, I just found that only a few of the voices I heard sounded Indian, but I could be wrong with this assumption. All in all, Assassin's Creed India is not a bad game, I actually do kinda enjoy it. It's far better than Assassin's Creed 3 and Unity, if that gives any perspective. I would recommend waiting to get this game in a Steam sale once it's a little cheaper, despite the already low price tag. Hopefully Ubisoft fixes these issues in a patch.\n\nIf you would like a game similar to this that I would recommend, I would point towards Mark of the Ninja. It has deeper stealth gameplay and is better designed.","January 12","false","1.4"," 287 of 439 people (65%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","65","287","439","23","12"

Yes, the game requires patience, timing, and skill to master, like all AC games. You probably won't be awesome the first time you play. But if you enjoyed AC China, AC India is an improvent over the first. The better you get, the more the levels flow nicely. The levels are huge, and evocative of the classic Prince of Persia game (which REALLY had infamously difficult controls).\n\nThe new protagonist has more combat options and a different set of equipment. The game takes full advantage of all the rich colors and patterns that makes the historical culture of India one of the treasures of the world.\n\nIf you are an Assassins Creed Fan, there's no reason why you should not have a blast playing all the AC Chronicles games.\n","January 14","true","17.9"," 57 of 83 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","57","83","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/359610/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The Assassin’s Creed 2D-esque spin-off trilogy series got off to a somewhat rocky start with its first installment, but Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: India makes a valiant effort to get the side-scroller back on the right track. The stealth puzzler isn’t nearly as big or sprawling as the installments in the main franchise, but tough puzzles and solid parkour mechanics make it worthwhile for fans of the franchise. Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: India makes some vast improvements over its predecessor in terms of style and gameplay while providing challenging 2D puzzles, but still lacks an engaging narrative.\n\nFor gamers unfamiliar with the latest series of Assassin’s Creed spin-offs, this trilogy takes on the identity of a 2.5D side-scroller with some 3D aspects. Each installment takes players to a different location and puts them in control of a brand new protagonist. This time around the protagonist is Arbaaz Mir and the assassin is dodging patrols and zip-lining around India. The game’s setting is the first of many features that help this follow-up stand out from its predecessor. While Chronicles: China was dark and lacked much in the way of aesthetic appeal, Chronicles: India is gorgeous and every backdrop and foreground pops with life and color. The game does an amazing job at making the 2.5D setting feel alive and brilliant. Colonial India is a fantastic setting that is beautiful to stare at while trying to crack the trick to each puzzle.\n\nThe game’s mechanics are built around stealth, parkour, and combat. Players control Mir as he attempts to navigate his way passed armed patrols, guard animals, and other prying eyes as a political romance plays out. The game’s narrative isn’t the best that the franchise has to offer, but the sparse use of cut scenes ensures that the subpar story doesn’t drag players out of the game’s world very often. Players can still learn more details about the world by picking up and investigating items during their adventure, similar to the main Assassin’s Creed franchise, but this is unlikely to be of much interest to players who aren’t history buffs or lore fanatics.\n\nThe meat of the game comes from the puzzles that Mir is presented with. Players repeatedly need to use a combination of stealth skills and parkour to dodge patrols and stay out of site while exploring the world. Unlike the main series, players are railroaded towards each encounter in Chronicles and must study patrol patterns and line of sight before making a move. New skills and items become available as the game progresses and eventually the whole arsenal of tactics will be needed to clear the more difficult screens.\n\nThe game’s puzzles are surprisingly challenging, but frequent auto saves help ensure that failures aren’t more frustrating than they need to be. Mir can’t take many hits or be seen for very long before the mission is failed and players are sent back to the last checkpoint, so players who rush in headstrong won’t find much success. The use of parkour to stay out of sight is very well done, but as new skills are learned it’s possible that some players may start to feel overwhelmed. Buttons take on different functions depending on what position the player is in, so things are a little confusing until players sync with the rhythm of the game.\n\nAlthough Asssassin’s Creed Chronicles: India highly discourages combat, sometimes Mir has to thrown down to make it passed an obstacle. It’s a shame that the game emphasizes and rewards the pacifism technique, because the combat system is actually very slick. Much like the parkour, players need to find a rhythm, but once that is achieved the simple dodge, light attack, heavy attack combat feels very fluid and exciting.\n\nOne of the benefits of the mostly 2D setting is that players don’t run into some of the frustrating awkwardness that comes along with the usual Assassin’s Creed open-world experience in terms of parkour and combat. There’s no accidentally running up a building when you are trying to run through an alley in Chronicles and it’s always clear which goon you are about to land a strike on. The simple side-scrolling layout makes the action crisp and clear and eliminates the confusion that so often leaves Assassin’s Creed players screaming at the screen.\n\nIn terms of 2.5D stealth games, Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: India may not live up to titles like Stealth Inc., but the game definitely offers enough challenging puzzles to be worth the 9,99€ price tag. Dedicated fans of the Assassin’s Creed franchise will get more out of the title thanks to the lore, but it’s worth a play-through for anyone who likes to solve a good stealth puzzle.","January 27","true","39.1"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","25","29","0","1"

The level design is quite good and the backgrounds are nothing short of gorgeous. I would love to see this game in stereoscopic 3D because the art design really is amazing. Even the 2.5D format can play itself well to what Assassin's Creed is supposed to be. There really are a lot of reasons why this game could have been a good match for the Assassin's Creed line.\n\nWhat killed this game for me, however, is the relatively large number of timed missions (which I hate, no matter what game it is) and the number of missions that judge you based on how quickly you play through the level, so they - more or less - are also timed missions. In some cases there were multiple timed or time-judged missions in a row! This is not what Assassin's Creed is all about. I don't care if the developers attempt to excuse this under the guise of a "platformer". The regular, non-timed missions are wonderful to play. But once you take away the ability to strategize how to approach an enemy in your own way, you take away the fundamental reasons that define why we love Assassin's Creed. The timed missions are thrown in there like those pathetic tower defense missions in "Revelations", except the timed missions here aren't optional.\n\nI don't remember if there were this many timed missions in "Chronicles: China", but the large number and frequency of them in "Chronices: India" killed my desire to continue playing or play in Plus mode after I finished it. If the levels in "Chronicles: Japan" are like this, I definitely will not buy it and will instead go back and play "Black Flag" for a fourth time. If I want to deal with timed platform levels, there are plenty of other games to scratch that itch, but that's not why I want to play anything related to "Assassin's Creed".","February 3","false","8.9"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","21","28","2","0"

This game is part of a trilogy that started with AC Chronicles: China and there will be a third game later this year. They didn't release it all of a sudden as a money grab or as a second thought.\n\n2.) No this isn't a full AC game like Syndicate or Unity; it's a 2.5D platformer.\n\n3.) If you understand 2, then you should also know the controls are best with a gampad. I would never recommend using a Mouse & Keyboard for a 2D platformer. Just grap a gamepad off your Xbox or Playstation and use that.\n\nNow for my thoughts:\nI really like these games. There's a lot of stuff people have been asking for in an AC game or speculation as to when and where the next game would take place. The truth is, there's so much stuff that Ubi could keep pumping them out for years and years and people would get sick of them or say they're just milking the franchise. Either way, it ends up a no-win situation for Ubi. I like these games because they explore new areas and possibilities without having to do another long 20 hour game they'd charge $60 for. Maybe people will like one enough they'll explore that setting more with a larger game later.\n\nThe graphics aren't bad. It's a 2.5D game so it doesn't need the most fancy realistic looking stuff. The controls aren't bad either with a game pad. I haven't tried with a M&K but I guess some people struggle with it. I do love the artwork used in the cutscenes and the voice acting.\n\nAs for content you will get a decent 5 or 6 hours in the first play-through. Once you beat it you can do New Game+ where you start with all your unlocked upgrades from the first time through. All in all, I have to say I definitely recommend this game.","January 17","true","4.4"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","27","39","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/359610/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","Thumbs up because it's a nice enough game (the stealth parts are good fun, it has nice art, alright music and the voice acting isn't too bad although not too remarkable either) and to counter the probably numerous reviewers who tend to bash Ubisoft titles only because of Uplay.\n\nStill it probably could've been better. It feels a little short, the ending came rather abruptly, and maybe half of the levels - sometimes in direct succession - are timed-based with you having little freedom in your approaches but encouraging to kill guards to get through them quickly as possible, as they are only rated by your speed and not by how many sightings, alerts or kills you've had (or not) as is the case with the stealthy levels. This is rather a downside because if people have ever asked for stealth elements that feel rewarding and fun it's the Chronicles games that of any AC titles have them (Chronicles: China had such time-based levels too, but they didn't feel like taking up as much space as they do in Chronicles: India). Oddly enough there are even parts where you are mostly forced (!) to snipe enemies down with a rifle, sometimes semi-silently, but still in a rather easy and cheaply feeling manner.\n\nThe timed-based parts aren't too bad, but can feel forced (Has there ever been a Precursor temple in AC that hasn't collapsed after you went through it? They apparently haven't been the greatest of architects...) and they have their somewhat unnecessarily difficult parts particularily when being in the need of tailing a person. I got slight moments of frustration when having to deal with some unprecise moments in controlling Arbazz during those time-based sections but those were luckily rather few and the checkpoints in this game are placed rather nicely. That aside the controls never felt too bad. Arbazz didn't always do what I wanted, or in the speed I had expected, but once you have your route through a section of guards mapped out and know how to do it it's usually doable in a fair manner.\n\nAfter you've completed the game you unlock two modes which may give incentive to play the game again to grab all the collectibles (often coming with little lore snipplets), complete secondary objectives, unlock all the character/gear buffs or to play with increased difficulty. You also unlock a couple challenge rooms in Animus VR environment style which actually look pretty nice and fun to play, but I wonder why they didn't create another one or two main game levels if they had time to do these challenge rooms.\n\nThe story isn't much worth mentioning. There is a some background lore, which can feel a bit messy, but maybe only to the various names tossed in and out. It's your old Assassins-vs-Templars-arms/power-race thing. There were some nice artifact/Precursor ideas which I don't want to bring up because sort-of-spoilers but they remain vague and never translate into something you can grasp too well, before long you've finished the game and can only hope some of it is used in future titles (some of it is in Syndicate, but I wish there was more).","March 12","true","14.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

I will explain the reason for my downvote. It just something which bothers me if anyone else is fine with it then they shouldn't hesitate in giving it a try.\n\nPros:\nGood Artstyle :\nThey have accurately displayed Indian culture more than most of the games out there.\n\nLocalised Voice:\nIts a small touch but the guards talking in Punjabi adds to the feel of it.\n\nGraphics :\nWell there aren't a lot of graphical setings which we are used to see on a PC title. I think for a game like this its enough.\n\nGameplay:\nIts pretty much the same as Chronicles of China so if you enjoyed the sneaking around and platforming in that one, then you will like this one too. Although it will fall short to platformers like Strider and Mark of the Ninja.\n\nCons:\nControls:\nPersonally this is the only con which i feel, the controls feel clunky not as fast as you want them to be.\n\nNo Controller support:\nAgain China had controller support so i dont know why this one is keyboard and mouse only , hopefully they will add that in a future update.  Becasue of the clunky controls it really feels weird and uncomfortable to play with. Hence I am downvoting this. If they fix the controls then will edit the review.\n\nEdit:\nSo they patched the controller support. So its working fine now. the controls are still cluncky, but one can get used to it. Again Chroncles series isnt like a niche AC game. Its more of stealth platformer. So if you are patient and plan you moves then its not a bad buy.\n\n\nHope this helped you .","January 13","true","1.0"," 32 of 59 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","32","59","2","16"

This 2.5D game is pretty and has some good moments, but most of them are overshadowed by general mediocrity and some really poor aspects.\n\nThe controls are the biggest problem with this game, as they never feel very responsible. Some movements are particularly frustrating, such as trying to climb from the ceiling to the platform above. Add some awful timed sections (quite a lot of them!) and horrible combat controls, and you will have an idea of how often you will be frustrated in this game. It's abysmal for a game that focuses on stealth and platforming. Unfortunately, combat still feels like an afterthought and punishment for getting spotted. You never feel like a particularly skilled assassin - your usual silent kills trigger quite a big noise, which can easily alarm nearby enemies. Climax has decided to add some new character types that are even more frustrating and cannot be killed unless you stun them with a smoke bomb, which makes little sense in an Assassin's Creed game. There's also more helix powers this time around, which allow you to quickly kill enemies with one hit or suddenly become invisible. Unfortunately, certain levels force you to use these powers, which isn't great.\n\nOn top of that, the story itself isn't particularly original or engaging. There's some awful dialog and dull voice acting, The repeating lines such as "faster Arbaaz, faster" are quite annoying.  It also feels like the ending comes way too quick - I was surprised to see I finished the game when "the end" achievement popped up on the screen. Once you're done with the story, you can spend more time with the game by starting "new game plus" or play some challenge rooms (there's only six of them).\n\nThe visual side is colourful and pleasant to the eye, but unfortunately there's not a lot of graphic options available and the lack of good anti-aliasing settings is a big eyesore.\n\nThis is a title that can be recommended for the fans of the series who are interested in the lore. Otherwise, there's a lot of better stealth games out there - for example Mark of the Ninja.","January 18","false","8.2"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

What an awesome game. Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: India is the second series in the trilogy chronicle series where you play Arbaaz. In Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: India searching for a legendary artifact: the powerful Koh-I-Noor diamond. With Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: India, you can use smoke bombs, explosive noisemakers, a simple grappling hook, and a whistle are joined by a chakram which can be thrown to cut ropes or stun enemies. New Animus Helix powers allow for instant, on-the-fly invisibility or one-hit kills. There's even a wonderful little puzzle involving a primitive sniper rifle that’s a bit tricky but ultimately satisfying.  If you are looking for 3 games in one (1) Thief (2) Prince of Persia and (3) Assassin then this is the game to play. If is fun, challenging, the levels are amazing. This reminds me a bit like Prince of Persia 2D when it was release back in the 1989/90s when it ran under MS DOS. With Assassin’s Creed® Chronicles: India, there are missions/levels/objectives you have to complete withing a time, puzzles to solve, lots of running and it is just brilliantly designed.\n\nThe storyline, gameplay, graphics and sounds are all of the highest caliber\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nArt Work/Storyline: 10/10\nGraphics: 10/10\nSound: 10/10\nControls: 10/10 (Keyboard and Mouse).\nOverall: 10/10\n\nThere are a lot of complains above the weak controls. Let me say that I played Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: China, India and Russia twice and I have found no problems with the controls. Yes, if this is the first time playing the game, then you will need to get used to it and if you stick to keyboard and mouse like I did, you will not find any problems.\n\nI would strongly recommend before playing this, to play Assassin’s Creed® Chronicles: China first which has an introduction and training missions how to fight, use you Helix power and so on. Then I would recommend  Assassin’s Creed® Chronicles: India second and Assassin’s Creed® Chronicles: Russia last.\n\nSPOILER on the link. If you need help or where to go, check out the youtube link. Use it only if you are stuck. Thank you\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y111OQphDxg","January 29","true","29.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And I say this as an Assassin's Creed fan who has played every game available on PC.\n\nOkay, that was harsh, I typed that not long after smashing my keyboard and my hands were still hurt. Now that I've calmed down, let me edit and clarify why I don't like this game:\n\nOn the one hand, it has beautiful visual (as all AC games do), and I've found Arbaaz Mir to be an interesting character from the comic. I really wanted to like it. But the game disappoints. After the first sequence, I was greeted with Arbaaz and Pyara Kaur's cringeworthy dialogue. (It's not creepy or anything. It's just that I can really imagine Henry Green facepalming at his dad's jokes.) But that's okay. Maybe I no longer found the character charismatic, but the game could still have something else to offer. So I continued.\n\nI desynched more in this game than I have in any other AC game. It crossed from 'challenging' to 'frustrating' in a few sequences. Every tiny second of mistake or deviation will make you desynch. There's little room for different play styles. I'm a Brawler in these games, but this one no longer has that category, unfortunately. (It's replaced by Silencer, where you take out guards in a non-lethal way, which is a lot like Assassin style but more time-consuming.) This results in lower points and fewer abilities rewarded, which makes the game even more frustrating.\n\nUnlike China, which offers solid backstory (in the database) to a little-known character, India offers little for the character of Arbaaz. I was at sequence 7 and collected database entries, yet I didn't feel like I know much more about him. So there really wasn't much for me to continue.\n\nI'm aware that my review is highly subjective, and that there are people who enjoy it, people with more patient and less desire to deviate than me. Still, I cannot give a thumb up for this one, due to how frustrated I feel with it. This is the first AC game I can't bring myself to finish, and I've played most of them.","January 14","false","7.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","0"

I however quite enjoy this game, it's visually stunning and reminds me of Prince of Persia a lot. It's easy and fun to play, although the controls can be kinda clunky sometimes. It's great when you want to play something that's not particularly heavy and serious or complicated. For me, that's most of the time. If you're like that, and like PoP, you'll probably enjoy it; unless you're another self-entitled, close-minded asshat who frequently jumps on the "it's cool to hate things" bandwagon. I think it's great Ubisoft have tried to challenge the norm somewhat by using beautiful and unique art styles, exotic settings that are actually interesting, and characters who aren't just straight white Western men. Obviously their target audience of intellectually stunted, culturally insensitive adolescent troglodytes will disagree but, that's just something I and anyone else who enjoys this and games like it will have to put up with.","January 12","true","4.7"," 115 of 243 people (47%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","47","115","243","22","19"

That is, until I reached an impassable bug on the second level, at the hanging weights puzzle. While jumping from the rightmost weight to the leftmost, my jump doesn't clear the gap. After trying it several times, I looked up a video of someone doing it, except their jump goes far enough. I have tried to replicate this at least 50 times but cannot get the jump to reach no matter what combination of button presses I use.\n\nWas planning on writing a full review and doing a video but cannot experience the full game due to this bug, hopefully it can be fixed and I can change this to a positive review.","January 12","false","8.9"," 43 of 96 people (45%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","45","43","96","8","1"
