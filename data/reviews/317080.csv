Ban you from making comments about them and their lake of skill coding. This game like all their games so far is unplayable and is finished in their eyes. Made me feel like I've been mugged. It's just stupid how crappy this game is.\n\nThis is my only negative review on steam. This will be removed so they can continue to sell this title. That is so wrong and I find myself disappointed with valve for allowing it! I can only assume that now that steam allows refunds this company will disappear very quickly. 30 odd hours and I never made it around the track once. There was no point as I could never make the controls work well enough to play.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Ghost%20Machine","August 16, 2015","false","31.2"," 73 of 77 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","73","77","2","6"

I'm not sure about that, but it's definitely a contender.\n\nI have never driven cars that handle like they do in this game.

Sometimes they will be driving straight ahead and just randomly fly up into the air doing flips.\n\nThese details plus the rest of the game content is not impressive, they basically need to redo the entire UI, all the game modes, everything.  Just start over.\n\nSince it's early access I look forward to updates, and every time I see a patch roll out I'll check back to see the progress, and update here if I see any glimmer of hope.","December 31, 2014","false","0.5"," 46 of 61 people (75%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","75","46","61","14","0"

I know this is not an AAA game, so i didn't expect anything. But they really did no effort to try harder i guess...\nThe game doesn't have licensed cars, i'm ok with that. You can identify the cars as real models in real life nonetheless. I started the first race selecting a Nissan Silvia, when the race loaded the car that i was driving was a R34 Skyline. And of course, i was "WTF?". I was in 1st place when in the last lap the counter changed (with no car passing me) and i suddenly became 11th. And again, WTF!\n\nOk, i loaded the second game selecting an M series BMW. The race started fine. When i crashed the first time the car started... i don't know how to describe... literally break dance in the track. (See my screenshots). Then it didn't stopped, it fell off the ground in the map miasma, then respawned, started break dancing again, started to fly around the track and so on. This lasted for three minutes i guess. Then it fell off the map again and respawned in the start line.\n\nSo... If you want a few laughs, this is the game. If you want something similar and less buggy try SHOFER Race Driver. It's way better than this game. I don't see any mark in this game saying "Early Access" so i suppose this is the final version, so no thanks.","October 12, 2015","false","0.3"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","0"

MS Revolution will go down as one of the most unremarkable and forgettable titles around.  It felt like going back in time to a playstation 1 game, the graphics are blotchy and outdated, even on the highest settings.\n\nThis game offers nothing that the title suggests, there is nothing revolutionary about MS R.  The game's weaknesses are all too evident:\n\n- Laughable AI\n- Stone Age Graphics\n- Dull Engine Sounds\n- Horrible Car Physics\n\nIf you truly are mad enough to still buy this broken and hideous game then at least do yourself a favour and research it on the net.  Look up all the videos you can and then decide whether you're still keen to invest in this game.  I decided to ignore the bad reviews  posted, now i'm $14 dollars down and left with a driving game that has been uninstalled.\n\nDon't pay attention to the amount of time spent on this game, i've spent far more than what is recorded.  I never play online, when a game downloads i disconnect from the internet to play all my games offline.

After seeing the pictures you can see that the game looks nicely but its a just pictures. The graphics are very poor and badly optimized. Vehicles do not have lights and control is pathetic and it looks like we were traveling cardboard box with the wheels on ice. Besides cars are not equipped with hand brakes. In short, the game looks like a free app on the phone. Cars do not have the original names however look the same as those in the real (Renault, BMW, Nissan and more) but they look too badly. The cameras are strange but the worst looks from the inside because everything is square and not expressive. The game has a lot of bugs and once I managed to get out of the map (exactly the five times I on success). I don't want to describe this game with bad side but this game does not have any good side. Wants to add at the end of it is not worth the price since early access has ended and I have no idea if this will improve the game but if they will work further to improve the gameplay maybe im gonna to change muy opinion but now my rating is 1/10.","January 19, 2015","false","1.9"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","17","21","4","0"

The A.I. is quite frankly, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n• No sound apart from the car engine noise and menu clicks.\n• So many bugs.\n• The XP system is awful, making you repeat the same races over and over just to progress to another abysmal track.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, I'm just glad I didn't waste my money on it.

There are different car tiers you can unlock, ranging from the relatively cheap and slow cars to the most expensive, high performing, fast cars around, but there's no point to unlocking them, there's no drive, you unlock these tiers with experience points, not cash earned trough races and tournaments, and you unlock all the cars of a tier at once, so you don't even have to decide which cars to unlock/buy.

It's still Early Access but it's already a lot of fun. Lots of different cars and tracks to play. The car feel is more on the arcade side but that's the way I like it.\n\nThe developers have wisely chosen to keep the graphics a bit lower so the framerate stays high and it works fantastically. Oculus recommends staying above 75fps at all times and it always was. It was often at 150fps (660ti). This means it's extremely comfortable to play with the DK2.\n\nI can't wait to see how they continue to improve it and what the final game is like.","November 18, 2014","true","0.7"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","8","24","3","0"

I tried to play the game but I feel like It is so horrible that I feel lazy and I won't lose my time to give a try to this creapy game. just a couple of laps in the first circuit and that's it. It is much worse than what comments say. Menus, sounds, gameplay, graphics... everything is so unaccptable!!!! I have bought it on a cheap bundle and I still thing that I paid too much for what I obtained.","October 19, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But this isn't the main problem.\nI hope that the developers improve the game, because now you can play it, yes. BUT IT ISN'T FUNNY.
