That being said I felt moved to do so because I think I have input that may prove helpful to the players and developers alike. I spent a great deal of time watching videos and reading reviews before I made my purchase discision and I must say that in the very short time that I have played and with the promising involvement of the develpers I am confident I won't be dissapointed with spending my money on this game.\n\nWithin the first few moments of battle I started to scratch and itch that I've had for a very long time. I have been craving a fast-paced space rts of a certain type for a long time. Distant Star: Revenant Fleet has a great feel and an excellent balance of fleet combat control and ship modability plus its a roguelike to boot. I would recommend anyone who enjoys the space genre as well as the roguelike genre to consider getting this game.\n\nAs for helpful information, I want to say that after watching several videos and reading many comments I feel that perhaps many players do not have a very solid grasp on the most effective way to play. I don't mean for that to sound arrogant. What I do mean is that the developers have made it difficult for new players to jump straight in. I haven't done the research to see if the features I'm about to suggest are in development but I do feel that if they were they would have been implemented with the transition from alpha to beta. The game offers a excellently executed tactical drop in and out of combat pause system. Understanding how to use this effectively is in my opinion the key to playing the game successfully. On some of the videos I watched the commentators talked about having to constanly be on the move and not being able to activate ship abilities or a sense of not having enough control over what is actually taking place in the battle in relation to the players ships. The reality is that all the control you need is right at your fingertips. The problem is that is never told or shown to you. If a player doesn't intuitively recognise that a certain level of control is necessary and doesn't search for the controls in the menu then their first couple of experiences in battle can sour their opinion of the game. What I'm suggesting is that the developers incorporate a tutorial like experience in the first mission. Instead of dropping you into a battle and just saying survive please add tips that say press spacebar for tactical mode. Then once the player does so add some more tips explaining the benifit of tactical mode and just what the player can do. Features like hotkeys for your ships and their abilites and basic commands like defend this target are an absolute must in this genre and the game has them. It just doesnt tell the player. Because of this I feel like the game is not as unbalanced per say as players believe. I was able to take the starting ship and just a lancer with no additional upgrades to the end of the first sector and through several combat nodes with relative ease simply by utilizing the tools that are there.\n\n--Feature Suggestions--\n1. Tutorials\n2. I would love to be able to que multiple movements for my ships. In other words Holding shift and creating waypoints for my ships to travel along.\n3. I'm not sure if this isn't already implemented in some fashion and I just haven't discovered it yet but I would like to see information about enemy ships. Nothing game breaking of course but just simple stuff for the sake of immersion.\n4. I would like to be able to zoom out just a little bit further. you can't see the max range of the lancer's laser without panning your screen. This left me unaware that it could target a location instead of a specific ship which is tactically useful information.\n\nSorry for the excessively long post and thank you to anyone who took the time to read it.","February 28, 2015","true","5.7"," 143 of 152 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","143","152","5","1"

Yes, I liked it, and it scratches a very particular itch that I haven't really found anything else for (small-fleet-command strategy game).  But I don't feel like it was quite what I'd thought it would be when I purchased it, and, while I'm recommending it, it's with some pretty major qualifications.\n\ntl;dr, it's a good light-strategy game, but I wouldn't call it a roguelike.  This review is going to sound predominantly negative, but I did enjoy the game and do think it could be well worth picking up on sale.  Not sure if I'd recommend it at full price.\n\nSTRATEGIC GAMEPLAY\nFirst, Ithe battles didn't involve the level of strategy I was expecting.  The best fights were ones where I had to watch the enemy chasing my tail, and my tactics involved kiting enemies around to recharge shields and lances, then turning and blasting one of two of them to pieces with my twin Lancers before turning and burning again.  But I honestly didn't feel like many of the missions involved that much tactical thinking.  Maybe I'm just too used to Dragon Age and similar games, or maybe I built the wrong fleet, but I didn't feel like I could do that much with any given ship other than move it around and shoot--which it could do perfectly fine on its own.  My flagship had a damage boost, but with no cost I just popped it every time it came off cooldown; something similar was true for the Dreadnought I picked up later in the game and put a damage-boosting ability on.  My gunship just flew around shooting things, while my Lancers sat in the back and melted priority targets every 10-15 seconds.  I filled up almost all of my hardpoints with passives because they seemed so attractive.\n\nAnd it worked!  I beat the game on my first run.  I'm not quite sure where the difficulty lies; with (a lot of) judicious pausing, I always had my CQC ships circling the enemy to dodge point-targeted weapons and had my Lancers drop their deathrays on cooldown.  Protip for anyone who picks this up: Keep moving and keep pausing.  Since it seems a lot of other people are finding the game difficult, I find myself wondering if either A) pause is OP or B) Lancers are OP, because I used both of those to great effect.  Only one of my ships was ever disabled, and that only happened once.\n\nI wondered if I was playing the wrong type of fleet for what I was looking for, but...it worked damn well, and I'm not going to handicap myself with expensive, tricky ships when I can just snag a couple Lancers and blast a smoking trail across the galaxy.\n\nThe missions I did find actually difficult were the protection missions where a large number of enemy ships suddenly spawned on top of the VIP ship--either in an escort mission where the transports appear halfway across the map from my fleet in the middle of an enemy cluster or in a station defense mission where the entire enemy fleet swoops in from all directions to vaporize their target.  But that's not a fun kind of difficulty, since it's not one that good planning or good tactics can get you out of.  It's just annoying.\n\nMISSIONS\nEvery mission I played was either search-and-destroy or protect.  The ones where I started in the middle of several enemy groups were the most fun, since I had to extricate myself and then figure out how to handle the flotilla trying to jam rockets up my exhaust ports.  The enemies didn't feel distinct from each other: once you've seen one Tech that shoots ion clouds, you've seen every Tech in the game.\n\nThe final battle didn't feel that much better, either--it was a defense mission, then a search-and-destroy mission, then a timed DPS race.  I didn't feel that any of the missions actually tested my resourcefulness, cunning, or ability to learn anything beyond "kill Lancers on sight and don't get in the way of those blue things Rogues shoot."\n\nATMOSPHERE AND PROGRESSION\nThe story's serviceable, and the world is presented with a workable amount of depth--I'm not expecting grand world-building here, and I didn't get it, but I did get a pleasant amount of insight into the universe.  Props to the dev team for that!\n\nI'm kind of curious as to why the Akari are so dead-set on my fleet in particular appearing at Aos, because they seemed to have a pretty significant presence of their own there.  I didn't really feel like I was commanding a fleet--a battlegroup, sure, but not a fleet per se.  This was partially due to the difficulty I had parsing the size of the ships--as far as I can tell, a Dreadnought would have about a 10-man crew at most, which feels off, but the immensity of the space wreckage left me unable to come to any other conclusion.  Where the heck did those things come from, anyway?\n\nFinding the exact same mission in two consecutive systems, and then again in the next sector, also ruined the atmosphere for me (it was an escort mission, for the curious).\n\nI didn't have any real feeling of progress throughout the game, which I can forgive on the narrative side due to the random nature of events.  But my ships really didn't seem to get better, either--I filled up all the hardpoints on my starting ships by the end of the second sector, found another Lancer (filled hardpoint, upgraded weapon) and bought a Dreadnought later on, which immediately filled up its own hardpoints.  After that...there's the veterancy bonuses, which are useful, but honestly pretty dull.  As far as I can tell, they're randomly seeded, meaning I ended up with a Lancer with two more-or-less useless shield upgrades while my other one had three Damage+ upgrades.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf you want a roguelike in space, you're better off picking up FTL.  If you want a tactical real-time-with-pause game, you're probably better-off with Dragon Age or another RPG.  There's just not enough of either of those here to satisfy you if you're looking for that sort of gameplay.  But if you want to kill some time and some spaceships while flying around the galaxy, then pick it up if/when it's on sale.  Distant Star isn't a bad game, and it's worth a look, but--in its present form--it's not that great either.\n\nWHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE\nFor what it's worth, here are my thoughts on things that would improve this game--some concrete, some more abstract.\n-More options for progression.  For example, could we have veterancy upgrades unique to each class?  What about different types of hardpoints for active vs. passive abilities, or gear in shops later in the game actually being better than the stuff in the first sector?  I filled up everything really early, mostly with passives, and nothing ever came up in the shops that looked appealing enough to try.\n-More mission variety.\n-More things to actually test ingenuity and decision points in fleet-building.  The best part of FTL, Nethack (as much as anything is the best part of Nethack), or the like is trying to figure out how to work miracles with scarce resources.  I never felt resources were particularly scarce--the income over the game felt about right, and was hardly generous, but I never felt I actually had to make hard decisions about what to do with my cash.  Heck, I'd even be fine with scaling the initial allowance back a bit and giving some more opportunities to actually build up.\n-As a minor point: having enemy ships that are visible to allies revealed on the minimap.  They don't show up on the minimap until they get in my ships' sensor range even though I can see them right there.","April 10, 2015","false","4.0"," 198 of 238 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","198","238","5","5"

While I still can't recommend the game because of the scaling difficulty I do have to give props to the devs for listening to people and making changes to the end boss so it's doable without having the perfect storm of good luck with upgrades, making options other than "attack them" worth choosing in random encounters, and making top end equipment and upgrades easier to find in shops. My original review is below, slightly edited.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI liked the game at first and I wish I still liked it because it's a great concept and the design is nice, but after finding out something was true that I had wondered about I find I no longer do. I really wish I could just ignore this issue and enjoy the game for what it is but this sort of thing has always been a personal sore spot for me in games.\n\nDifficulty is artificially inflated as you get more ships in your fleet. If you're having trouble and buy another ship thinking it'll make things a bit easier you're in for a bad surprise because it has the opposite effect. Every enemy fleet you face after that will not only have more and stronger ships, but if you buy a Carrier or Dreadnought you'll face a lot of bigger ships as well. You'll go from fighting a couple waves of Gunships, Drones, Fighters, and the occasional Lancer to fighting fleets of Assaults, Lancers, Dreadnoughts, and swarms of Drones.\n\nIt also effectively makes some missions almost impossible to win at, anything that involves defending a station or ship against Pirates you might as well just give up right away because they are almost guaranteed to kill it because Pirate fleets are composed almost entirely of assaults that will melt anything without a shield in seconds, and every ship or station you're supposed to defend in those missions has no shield for some reason even if it's not disabled.\n\nTopping it all off is a final area that I'm sure was supposed to be epic, but is a major pain instead. Let's take a look at the final area.\n\nNeedlessly long map with multiple ambushes and minefields? Check.\nBoss with multiple forms? Check.\nBoss that summons multiple minions at each form? Check.\nBoss with lots of overpowered weapons? Check.\nBoss with huge amounts of HP for each part at each form? Check.\n\nEssentially the boss renders several types of ships you can use a liability because they die very quickly, and one of them utterly worthless because it has very low HP and to fire it has to sit still which means it gets instagibbed. If you thought FTL's final battle was out of proportion to the rest of the game, you haven't seen anything yet.\n\nThe final boss is the only part of the game that does NOT scale to your fleet size and composition so if you want to have even a chance at killing the final boss you are practically required to have a full fleet. Unfortunately this makes every stage prior to the final stage and even the ambush fleets in the final stage itself needlessly difficult unless you know exactly what you're doing, if you only have a couple ships you'll mostly breeze through the game up until the boss then get hopelessly slaughtered. But even if you do have the right ships with the right equipment you're still likely to fail against the final boss because it requires a massive amount of micromanagement even using ships loaded entirely with passives or "fire and forget" skills that don't require you to manually aim or stop moving to use. There is also a time limit as well, ensuring that you can't take it slow and careful. *Boss difficulty has been tweaked since my original review.\n\nAdding to all that you have to buy ships, equipment, and skills from random merchants along the way, and since their inventories are randomized there's no guarantee you'll even see equipment and skills that are useable by the ships you have, and even if you do there's no guarantee it won't just be the same weak stuff that you start with. The randomness wouldn't be so bad on it's own but unless you're fielding a fleet of fully kitted out ships by the time you get to the end you have virtually no chance of winning, and that's hard to do even when things go your way for most of the game. *Availability of better shop inventory has been tweaked since my original review.","January 30","false","9.1"," 73 of 83 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","73","83","0","10"

DSRF was sold as a Rogue "lite" in space, where you'd assemble a small fleet of ships, guide them across the solar system, and then engage in a showdown in a final battle much like the genre definer FTL.\n\nThe Distant Stars, and the not so Distant Stars...\nMuch like FTL, you work your way across multiple sectors, each sector contains multiple jumps, however, unlike FTL, there's only four sectors that you'll be working your way across as you head towards the final battle, meaning your average playthrough is much closer to two to four hours, as opposed to the four to eight in FTL. However, unlike FTL, instead of managing -one- ship with a few upgrades, here you'll be managing a full fleet, each with their own weapon systems (in some cases, multiple weapons systems), sub systems, and passive systems.\n\nThe blend of upgrades means that fleets can in theory be quite unique (in practice, there's usually one generally optimal approach for fixing the deficiencies for each ship, straying too far is a bad idea). The ships too will upgrade with experience, granting bonuses in various ways, again, helping you compensate for their weaknesses or exaggerating their strengths. These upgrades are not exactly anything amazingly unique, but there's a good enough variety per ship to keep things interesting.\n\nOf special mention are the weapon systems, of which there is a serious number, all with their own strengths and weaknesses, allowing for a significant degree of tactical flexibility and nuance within your fleet, this is extremely useful, and can allow for a player to adapt on the fly, particularly if things go sideways and they lose a valuable ship during the course of the voyage.\n\nOf tactics, tactical pause, orders, and mo(ba)ment to moment combat...\nOnce you jump into a sector, the game moves to a top down view of your ships, moving around a two dimensional "pane" of space, with the sun behind it, filtering light through to give a sort of 3D effect. It's rather effective, and pretty. Combat therefore works by ordering your fleet (up to five units) around the 2D map and having them reposition, attack, use specials, cover each other, heal each other, etc. Line of Sight can be used and abused to cover each other (units are solid objects, so weapons will hit the first thing they make contact with), and specials are often "skillshots", which means that moving can disrupt or even cause them to miss.\n\nThis should sound very much like a singleplayer version of most MOBA type games, and that's because in a sense, it is. It carries a lot of the fundamentals of that type of game in the genesis when you're playing the tactical map mode, but you have the benefit of a pause mode that allows you to issue orders and activate specials whilst the pause is set, then allow time to proceed on its' merry way once more, pausing when you need to issue fresh orders. Disabled units will suffer critical damage at first, represented by debuffs that carry over from sector to sector, however, with each critical suffered, the chance for them to be entirely destroyed begins to tick up, if they take too many criticals, well, you may lose a ship altogether, and in this game, that can be a punishing blow, especially late game. Units in this game are extremely valuable, and losing one can be crippling, enough to trash a game and force a restart.\n\nRuthless voyagers in skies deep blue...\nThe A'kari are not a pleasant or amiable lot. Their culture is very warrior caste, and it's very clear as you travel through space that you are just "a side" in the war, if anything it's quite possible that you're the bad guys. This moral ambiguity is both interesting and potentially a downside, the problem with such a situation is that for some players, it's important to have the belief that they're on the "good" side when playing these kinds of games. The A'kari often resort to less than wholesome tactics to make their way through the game (as the necessity of their mission requires), but that will come with a moral weight to it, and if you become invested or put some time into thinking about the lore or backstory of the game, well, it may leave you wondering if you're actually playing for the right side.\n\nReflections in glowing suns and off glinting guns...\nThe graphics aren't -quite- Homeworld Remastered, but nonetheless, they're definitely good enough to pass muster, presenting clearly defined racial ships for both the A'kari and the Orthani, along with a third set of ships for the neutral Pirates. The backdrop itself is colourful and clear, with a good set of nebulae and lighting presentation being well handled and running smoothly throughout. This is a well designed and imagined game. Of specific mention is the soundtrack, which is really, really good. We're talking standout quality, easily worthy of being a standalone OST if ever they decide to release it as such.\n\n... and the fire and fury of the missiles...\nWhen combat takes place, the playfield is colourful and bright, the music sweeps up to an orchestral swell, the explosions are many, debris litters the place as ships disintegrate in style. This game makes space combat look -good-, and does a good job of hiding the MOBA style combat under it's interface and behind the active-pause button, but with the limited number of sectors, and the fact that the game doesn't support the same level of replayability as FTL, this is a game to play in shorter bursts, as a side dish to things like FTL.\n\nClosing thoughts...\nDSRF does a lot right, and in some areas it does break some interesting new ground, however, it doesn't -quite- do enough to break free of FTL's shadow, and it doesn't quite do enough to stand far enough away to net it my unguarded praise. Which is a shame, because there's a lot to like about this game, for people who are big on Sci-Fi and Roguelites, this may prove to be too tempting to miss, for people who are looking to get "into" such games, FTL is still the daddy.\n\nVerdict : Wishlist it, if you're a fan of Sci-Fi, and particularly FTL, give this one some serious consideration.","May 19, 2015","true","12.3"," 81 of 99 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","81","99","7","3"

I played on normal and didn't die until I reached the final boss level. (a bit too easy) It felt pretty consistent through each sector until the very last room, where it really spiked and I was killed before I could even reach the boss (a bit too difficult) but the devs seem to be very active so I hope they will have a second look at this.\n\nBut all in all, I really enjoyed it.\n","July 28, 2015","true","5.8"," 48 of 50 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","48","50","0","4"

To sum this up, you'll jump from point to point and encounter various events (pirates, enemy fleets, dialogue choices, etc.).  When docked at a friendly station, you can purchase new ships and/or upgrades for your existing ones.  Unlike FTL, the action sequences are less crew specific and more about controlling 1-5 ships inside an arena-esque map and activating their individual abilities timely.  Some things do rub me the wrong way: no difficulty setting, encounters/enemy waves tend to be too long, and the battles tend to be stacked against you to the point where you're dancing and running constantly.  I never felt like I was powerful enough to stand toe to toe with enemies in these events.  The right click sound (when moving) is incredibly annoying as well.  Still, $7 is a pretty good value for what the game has to offer thus far...though I'd personally play this more if the game had an easier difficulty setting or at least scaled in difficulty appropriately.  I suppose we'll see if this gets addressed throughout the course of development.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CqwrMH54p0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y5Ak_9fT-4","January 23, 2015","true","7.7"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","46","54","3","7"

But you need to realize that it is pre-alpha, at only version 0.0.0.3. It's very short at the moment, very short. And at least in my case some features appeared not to function as they should. But I'm sure future versions will address these issues as well as flesh out the gameplay.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/9gdTMJ8F4NY\nThe graphic are simple, I like these kind of 2 dimensional top down space games and I like the style.\n-----The music is spacey and pleasant. It reminded of magic carpet of all games with it's (middle eastern?) string instrument sound.\n-----There is some dialogue at each encounter, against the back drop that you are from a dominant space faring faction which is served by other factions and at war with another major faction the Orthani. I liked it.\n-----It would be nice if units didn't talk every single time you give them a command, that is not every split second lol\n\nI haven't played FTL, but I've watched people play it. It basically seems to work on a similar concept. That is between encounters you select your next Star System destination within a randomly generated network of Star Systems. Encounters can be hostile or neutral. You can choose to attack, intimidate or avoid conflict at most encounters.\n-----You also come across shops where can attain additional ships and equipment to fit to them including weapons and active abilities.\n-----There is no fleet control tutorial yet. In combat, ships in your fleet by default fire upon the closest hostile vessel. You seem to be able to prioritize specific targets if you wish. You also tell ships where to move during an encounter. Basically it plays exactly like at RTS.\n-----Most ships other than the Assault class type are very fragile. Usually these weaker ships in my fleet tended to be destroyed almost immediately because I couldn't move them out of harms way quickly enough. Any of your ships that aren't moving or are doing so in a straight line are basically sitting ducks and will destroyed very quickly.\n-----So ultimately my strategy ended up boiling down to flying only assault class ships and kiting the enemies I encountered. This was a very effective strategy. But it wasn't a satisfying experience. Your ships will not move by themselves, without your intervention they will just sit there. You have to constantly micromanage their movements, which potentially is demanding with a progressively larger fleet at your control. Encounters typically consisted of flying circles around a wave of enemy ships until they were destroyed and repeat several times until the encounter is over, there wasn't really any challenge. I wasn't really fond of constantly directing ships, which you must do because of the games pace.\n-----You can basically finish the game in just a few minutes. You can just travel directly to the 'exit' system while avoiding every hostile encounter along the way. And Bob's your auntie, you win!\n-----In the games current state, if want an extended space adventure you need to avoid traveling directly to your final destination. That is visit all the star systems which aren't on the way there.\n-----I had a few technical problems with the game. I couldn't scroll the view to the right with the mouse cursor because the cursor would travel outside of the game on my first screen and into my second screen, I had to awkwardly reach around my microphone with my left hand to scroll with the arrow keys. Shops didn't appear to function properly and I had to fiddle around a lot with the menu to purchase items successfully. You are supposed to be able to pause the action by pressing space however this was completely non-functional for me. Lastly\n-----So I think the game-play needs to be fleshed out to make it more satisfying interesting and challenging, I think most people might agree with that. But personally I would prefer if units autonomy wasn't restricted to firing at the closest hostile ship. Or alternatively if more advanced commands were implemented to reduce the need for micromanagement being so constant. Lastly with pretty much any single-player game I would like there to be some way of enjoying the game online with friend or other people aka multi-player.\n\nI think this a good foundation for a great game.

Objectively speaking, that's true, but it's not as 'roguelike' as people looking for that specific genre might be looking for. As a rogue fanatic myself, I'll be honest with you; It's a roguelike in the sense that it has random world generation and random encounters down pat, along with permadeath and proper consequences for actions that are more often than not your own fault. That said, there isn't as much depth to the management of your fleet as you'd expect, and so I can't really consider this a full-fledged rogue experience. It's more half-and-half than anything, and while some people have complained that it's not really sure what it wants to be, I think the devs know exactly what they're aiming for, and that it just needs some tuning to get there.\n\nThe only real connection it bears to FTL is in navigation between sectors and the fact that it's set in space. The gameplay is entirely different beyond that. So rather than compare it to another game and judge it based on how it measures up, I'm going based on its own merits, and that leaves me with a rather positive first impression. With a bit of polish to work out the kinks, I can easily see this becoming just as popular.\n\nAs it stands, the game is fun. Possibly not worth the heft 19 dollars being charged for an indie game from a company you've likely never heard of, but still a fun title that won't leave you disappointed. If the price were dropped to a more reasonable 10 dollars, or even 5, it would enter impulse-buy territory, and I promise you would not regret picking it up.\n\nThat about summarizes my review, but if you want a more detailed breakdown, I've posted a full review in the Forums here.","May 19, 2015","true","3.6"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","1"

So please, with this 'review' don't expect something that will change your perspective on reality. I'm just going to give you my personal opinon of the game. That's it. If you're looking for someone to tell you all the pros and cons of the game etc, you're looking in the wrong place.\n\nREVIEW:\nI, personally, love this game. And I only just started playing it. I hate how I see people review the game as an "FTL Ripoff". It's not. Seriously. If you think it is, go take your copy of CoD and throw it away because it's a blatant ripoff of Medal of Honor. Or whatever. Seriously, this game may not be the most innovating thing but it sure is very fun at it's current state.\n\nGranted, it's EA so it's NOT DONE YET. This game, to me, has AMAZING potential! And I hope that it fulfills said potential. I want to be able to play this game time and time again and still have as much fun as I am now. That being said, I love games like this. Quite frankly, I wish FTL was a bit more like this game (and I LOVE FTL). And, back to those saying it's a 'blatant ripoff'; no, it's not. There's no crew management aspect of the game. Just because you can jump to different areas in a sector doesn't make it a ripoff. Come on people, you're better than that. I hope.\n\nThe graphics are pretty damn spiffy as well, though I wish there were more options in the menu. All of the menu haha. Asides from that though, I only have one SMALL complaint: I wish the game was a tidbit harder. Not too much harder, but just a smidge. I mean, I'm only in the beginning (my third area past the tutorial) so I may be an idiot haha. Even then, that's not really a complaint.\n\nOnce more, I love this game thus far. It's not for everyone, so please, don't think I'm saying that it is. It's just, in my opinion, like a painting being slowly added onto until it's finished. In other words, It's a work of frickidy-fracking art. Props to you devs. Also, the voice acting on the cutscenes is pretty damn good. Gives it that good ol' sci-fi epic feeling I've been looking for haha.\n\nIn closing, I would 100% recommend this game. Both to support the developers, and because it's just plain fun. Also, devs, please, please, PLEASE, don't bail on this game. I so badly want it to succeed. Hence why I even bothered writing this review. I'm seeing negative comments start to pile up, and for some reason quite a few of them are being a bit too judgemental. In my opinon at least. Anywho, again, love the game. And I hope this 'review' helps.\n\nHave a good day.\n\nP.S. Devs; Seriously. Don't abandon this diamond in the rough. I don't think you guys are, noting the frequency of the updates, but still. I love this game already. And want it to succeed. Have some smiley faces for your trouble. :D :) :3 C:\n\nEDIT: I WAS WRONG. OH GOD IT HURTS! THE GAME IS DIFFICULT ENOUGH! It needs to be harder. XD\n\nEDIT: Yet another edit! Seriously man. This game is balls to the walls hard. I love it though. 10/10, would die 50 times again.","April 8, 2015","true","5.4"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","29","38","6","5"

I kinda regret my decision. I understand it is in the alpha stage which is why I'm really not too mad about paying 7 bucks, but this game is just not what was advertised by the Curators. There were several issues that I ran into:\n\n-Heavily borrows from FTL to the point of ripping it off.\nI can see where they were influenced by FTL. In fact it even has the same basic story, jump mechanic, and star map, which is not that big of a problem. I mean if it ain't broke don't  fix it right? However, unlike FTL this game just isn't very fun.\n\n-Tagged as RTS but it has no strategy\nEvery encounter I came across was being ambushed by an enemy fleet and trying to defend myself after being hit with opening volleys. I soon realized that the best strategy is to just select all of you ships and just have them fly circles around the enemy to avoid their fire while dishing out your own. It works because unless you fly away and run the enemy ships that aren't drones don't move.\n\n-Drone imbalance\nThe enemy drones will absolutely rip your ships apart. If you stand still for even a few seconds, the drones will likely disable or severly hurt at least one of your ships, but my drones merely flew around and most of the time did not shoot.\n\n-Ship targeting issues\nMy ships often targeted drones instead of large assault ships right next to them.\n\n-Pacing is kinda weird\nThe pace of the game seems off. Its too fast to really use positioning to get a tactical advantage, but the ships are just too slow to dodge and manuver sometimes.\n\n-Minor issues\nMaybe a select all button for the ships or the ability to hotkey them.\nSelecting the ships abilities doesn't always work and targeting with them is also unresponsive at times.\nPathing is also poor at times resulting in ships getting caught on random objects.\n\nOverall it is a pretty good idea, but still needs a good bit of work. I do hope they use some more original ideas instead of just ripping FTL off and improve the user interface. I look forward to when it is finished though, but I do suggest people wait a little longer before buying it.","January 25, 2015","false","0.9"," 62 of 100 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","62","100","2","0"

There is not a lot of ships or weapons and random events are pretty binary, so replayability may be very restricted for some players.\n\nOtherwise the game is pretty decent. Nice 2d graphics, good audio and nice gameplay, even if a little hectic. Mechanics force you to use tactical pause a lot, maneuver each ship manually to dodge fire (there is no order queuing) and do a ♥♥♥♥-poor job explaining it to you, so do yourself a favor and skim through some basic guide before your first playthrough (or in a middle of it).\n\nComplains about difficulty are outdated: I've beaten the game in my first try on "regular". First hour was a little too easy but after it, game picked up a pace. I'm obviously played on wrong difficulty for me, but nonetheless it proves, that you can pick a difficulty suited for you.\n\nRandom events seemed to me a little dull. Almost every time you got three options: 1. fight, 2. don't fight, 3. read some story to see if you will fight or just get the resources. It shows that the game is mostly combat-orientated. If your fleet is built nicely you won't need to run away from enemies, and if it doesn't - well, you'll need to win some fights to get resources for upgrade.\n\nOverall I've enjoyed my ~4 hours in first playthrough and I'll try it on next difficulty, but I doubt that I will play it a lot. If you will be satisfied with 3-5 hrs experience - this game is good.

Build your fleet, try to scrape together enough resources to keep them repaired and up to date, and engage in real-time space battles.The upgrades and ship options are dynamic enough that they can drastically alter your combat strategies from hit-and-run, full-frontal engages, to micro-mechanic tech battles. This alone gives each playthrough the ability to be unique, and the procedural universe only adds to that.\n\nThe sole issue with this game at the moment comes from the difficulty balancing on a razor's edge, which is currently tipped toward you dying horribly. The battles are fierce, the economy sparse, and certain missions you simply give up on all objectives and focus solely on surviving. This to me is not a very large drawback, games that are as challenging as this currently is feel incredibly rewarding for even minor achievements: Succesfully complete all mission objectives? Survive a massive enemy force with no ships disabled? Actually made it to the final sector?! Haven't scored a win yet (EDIT: Have now), but I hardly notice because all of these steps along the way feel like wins in their own right.\n\nA game that gets EVERYTHING right but needs minor balance tweaks? Sold. Not to mention what could be done with more content.\n\nEDIT: Balance HO! Early game is now much more forgiving, making it far easier to develop the basics needed for a run. Defense and escort missions in particular are now realistically achievable even with 3 and 4 ship fleets. I think overall more starting money wasn't needed as long as the rewards were tweaked to reflect risk/reward, but it accomplishes the same goal.\n\nIf you were holding back on this, don't. I really couldn't ask for more at this point, the game is amazing.

With each death, you learn more about the units, their abilities and the type of strategy you must employ to win this game. This is not like a space RTS where you can run in and expect to be fine with reserves in place. You must calculate your moves (tactical mode is a huge help), move cautiously and recognize the different units you are fighting against. Prioritzing targets is a huge must in this game. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast in this game.

You can mix and match your small fleet of ships, upgrade their weapons, gain experience, new skills and traverse the galaxy, system by system, experiencing a series of mission types. Each sector in the galaxy and the missions within each system are dynamically generated so each playthrough is a different experience. Story events offer you a range of choices which may affect whether or not you are attacked (or you attack your enemy), are rewarded or the option to upgrade your ships. - Recommended!","February 11, 2015","true","1.2"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","21","31","2","0"

Engagements often take to long and are most of the times longer then they should because of bad design decisions. For example the escort mission - you have to escort a transport ship into a station. The transport ship stops everytime enemies appear and just stands still, without any good reason why. There is also a Circle around the point where they arrive, indicating that they are save inside the circle - but they are not! They need to arrive at the middle of the circle. I lost countless transport ship to this fact and its so frustrating to bring a transport ship into this circle, where it stops because enemies appear and gets destroyed.\nThe game has a few inspirations from FTL (which is not a bad thing in any way), the thing is you cant warp off a mission like in FTL, you have to complete it - and the game doesnt mention why. (FTL Drive needs to charge, interference from enemie ewar ships? Nothing is mentioned, you are simply stuck).\nThe worst thing is when you want to save the game and do other stuff all your ships get critical damage which is unrepairable - another factor which keeps me away from returning to the game simply because I have a huge nerf to my ships just because I wanted to go to bed.\n\nThis game could turn out good. But right now its just frustrating, I dont recommend buying it at this state.","February 22, 2015","false","0.8"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","23","35","0","2"

Game has a very dark feel to it. As for backgrounds, I can say that they serve their purpose, but that's about it.\n\nSounds 10/10: Nothin' to complain about. Units have some weird alien-language responses but they don't get dull or repetitive, which is saying a lot considering just how much you're going to be hearing them.\n\nMusic 7/10: Changes dynamically when battle comes in. It fits the game very well, but I don't think I'd pick up an OST to listen to when I'm not playing.\n\nGameplay 7/10: Units handle well and there is a lot of challenge. Game is difficult, and gets difficult right on th first mission. You are going to need to stay on your toes - enter the Tactics Mode a lot if you want to survive. Game runs very smoothly, haven't had problems with glitches or crashes of any kind.\n\nSome of the mission types feel like they need some more fine tuning - escort missions, especially, and the final mission doesn't feel challenging. Having a lot more mission types would be good.\n\nThe 'procedurally generated galaxy' only applies to the mission progression and options. As for the tactical maps that you end up doing the fighting in, you will begin to recognize them fairly quickly, as there aren't a huge number.\n\nUI 4/10: Some of the tooltips are inaccurate. I still have no idea what 'supply' does. Hotkeys are not listed ANYWHERE - no menu lists, not even in tooltips that pop up - you are left to guess. Weapons/ships/systems don't come with nearly enough information to help you make informed decisions. Example: All I know about Nova Lance II and Nova Lance III is that Nova Lance III has one more I than II. I don't know how much more damage it does, if it has a different cooldown or not, nothin'. I'm just assuming it is better, because III is more than II. Keep in mind that none of this is gamebreaking by any means - in fact, they are minor annoyances only, but it's a lot of minor annoyances.\n\nOverall 7/10: Devs are working hard at quashing bugs and seem receptive to player feedback - so, game is good now, I'm optimistic it will improve. Ideal price IMO is $10.","April 11, 2015","true","14.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

The game became annoying and frustrating farely fast for me. The game is full of little annoying things like, your ship not doing what you want them to do or when you capture and enemy automated repair factory and I still have to pay for the repair or only getting useless modules to buy when you finally get the chance to buy upgrades or having a mission to defend a station where you star far away from the station and the ennemy starts right next to it and destroys it before you ships even start to move.\n\nYou move through sectors by exploring systems in each sector to reach the exit of the sector to get to the final sectors for the final fight. In each system there will be a random event where you usually have the option of a fight. at the end of a fight you get currency sometimes supplies and if you are lucky a module (but rarely a weapon).\n\nFrom my point of view the game is unbalance. Weapons are hard to get so you end up using what ever you can get you hands on. So you and up with an unpersonalised rag tag fleet that looks more like brigands that salvaged what ever they could then the fleet of a nation/empire. The smaller ships becaume useless once you get in the last sector as they blow up as soon as they engage the enemy and it's hard (random/luck) to get the bigger one that can last long enough to get out of trouble.\n\nThe first sectors are so easy they are boring, the last sector starts to be intresting as it's more challenging but the final fight is super annoying and frustrating. Espacially considering you fleet is ill equiped because you couldn't find the good stuff but you are loaded with credits.\n\nThey game was still interesting, but barely got my money's worth.","June 7, 2015","false","9.7"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","29","48","3","0"

I luckily found a station that offered repairs and I was able to get all my ships back into top shape though costing most of my scrap. Instead of heading for the exit i think ill take a few more chances since the danger level is still minimal and i need to gain some more scrap for upgrades. Ok, warp here and the mission is destroy all threats. This shouldn't be too much of a problem. Oh NO theres a battle carrier, torpedoes, shields failing dammit....game over.  And so goes another Distant Star Revenent Fleet run that looked promising and again ended in failure but damn lets do that again!\n\nDistant Star Revent fleet is an addictive "one more mission" rouge type game set in space. At the start, literally,  you are immediatley thrown into battle thats set ups the familiar story and gameplay. The story begins(why was Revent Fleet added?) after an enemy ambush that leaves you as the leader of the last A'kari ship. Your mission is to traveres the galaxy, rebuild and upgrade the fleet (up to 5 ships) and destroy the enemy before they unleash their ultimate weapon that will destroy your homeworld. There are no cutscenes, pictures, voice or video. All information(other than the opening set up) is text based and unfortunante becasue while it's not an original story there are multiple occasions more art work, or sound would have provided some immersion into the world.\n\nIn order to win the game you will have to travel through 5 galaxies and complete roughly 35-50+ missions/warps depending on your courage to reach the end boss. Each galaxy contains muliptle sectors in which you warp your ship(s). This is where you can gain missions to earn scrap, upgrades and addtional ships. Choices are everywhere but the longer you stay in a galaxy the threat level from the enemy becomes higher making each warp to a sector more dangerous. Its that constant gamble that can payoff with more scrap, but also can devaste your run. Oh, and did i mention everything is procedurely generated so no run is alike. Quests, loot, ship upgrades, the galaxy is differet each time.\n\nGameplay is real-time/ pausable combact in the likes of the original Dragon Age and more recently Pillars of Eternity. The combat is excellent and you will constantly be pausing and startegizing your every move, every second. Battles do grow a little monotnaous after a hundred or so encounters but mixing up your fleet, equipment and passives makes each comabt session a dance of survival by number crunching. Each ship whether a tank, support, or heavy(7 different ships to choose) each has their strenghts and weakness and waiting for those countdowns to expire, pause and then position for the kill or to power up a friendlys shield or increase damage is super satisfying. All combat takes place on a randomly genertaed map with broken ships used to block oftern certain passages. Its an attractive background but it could have used some more variety, but hey, its space.\n\nhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/431574499126408855/AA70D9D05AF609AECEAEB70A5A5EA5643146934D/\n\nAs you journey through the galaxy quests, missions and random events will be your source of income and more likely the countodwn to your impending doom. Missions in Distant Star vary from escort, destroy all enemies, protect or retake space stations, or ships to name just a few. As you warp into some sectors you will also be be given a text quests in which you will make a choice whether to steal from refugees, kill traitors, provide resources, etc but from an overall impact i do not know if playing good or evil has any consequnce. On some occasions, where i had helped refugees earlier by providing rations, later gave me a discount from a vendor but i am really not sure.\n\nWhile i wish decisions did impact the world, one of the biggest problems you will face is having enough resources. Each time you warp to a sector you will consume 1 resource. As resources are limited you will occasionally/ randomly warp into a sector were you will be rewarded with a resource or 2 but my biggest issue are the vendors. As i mentioned the game is randomly generated and most vendors only sell one item. One may be a vendor for ships, another for upgrades, or another for resouces and repairs. Its really the biggest hurdle in my opinon especuilly on the harder difficulty as you have to continually warp and take on these missions and gamble  in order to build up your fleet. if you dont have resources it will cripple you in a sense that your ships(randomly) will receive critical damage. In one instance i made it to a vendor to repair my ships(no resources) but becasue of the expense i had no money left to buy resources. As i said earlier IF you have resources available and you run into trouble in a sector you can escape but with a penalty, but you have to have resources.Punishing to say the least.\n\nMake no mistake this is not rouge 'like', or rouge 'light' this is a hard core rouge type game. One death and its the end, curtains, game over man. Its soul crushing, devasting, and sometimes just flat out ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but damn it fun as hell. Distant Star is a great initial offering in a genre that is usually left to fanatsy and side scrollers. Its not as deep as it could go but there is stiil a lot of meat on this bone that hopefully they will be able to build on this success.\n\nA few notes: I play(still playing) the game on hard difficulty on my Laptop with m/kb and Ive never have had any problems playing the game with max settings 1080p.\nThis is by far not my type of game (rougue) but after watching my favority LPer Yippe Ky Ya Mr Falcon i knew it had the things i am a fan of Space, RPG, and RTS/ pause combat and i wasnt disappointed.\n\nAfter posting the review i reached out to the community for possible answers to some of those lingering questions i had and was greeted by a developer of the game who answered them a follows:\n\nIn terms of the minimimal resouces:\n1) The supplies are rare. We wanted to give the feeling of a war-torn fleet making their way across the galaxy. Most sectors should have a supply shop though and those sell bundles of supplies.\n\nDo choices matter:\n2) Yes, some do. Some choices can have good results like open a shop at the node that you might not otherwise access or open a quest line. Others have bad results, like failing a quest chain or costing you credits and supplies.\n\nOn Galaxy path:\n3) No difference in terms of difficulty (they all scale in the same manner), but some in terms of the type of missions you get. Neutral sectors are more likely to have pirate encounters for example and A'Kari sectors may have more defend & escort missions.\n\nPositives\n\nSuper addicting One More turn, one more mission game\nLike Dark Souls death comes fast at first but each death you are always learning on what not to do\nRTS/ pauseable comabt is excellantly implemented and satisfying\nEvery Playthough is different\nDevelopers are active and responsive to questions\nShip variety, upgrades have a good variety and balance\nLove me some number crunching\nConfident one second, next second you are starting over\n\nNegatives\n\nEconomy needs some tweaking.\nResources too rare, and maybe too expensive?\nThe UI could be better.\nBackground is pretty much the same thoughout\nThe game just starts and just ends.\nWeak hints or tutorial. If i take a path through the enemy galaxies, does that pay off more? Are missions different? I dont know at least i dont think so. Does playing good or evil matter?\nJust ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

My 6 and 4 year old sons were providing armchair Admiral support (both of my sons play FTL regularly so they have valuable insight).\n\nSummary review:\nI don't really have a desire to play more Distant Star Revenant Fleet (DSRF) right now. It's not because DSRF is bad. I simply want more from a game than an FTL map clone with some better graphics and  controlling a small fleet of ships. What made FTL fun, for my family, was the feeling that each ship-to-ship combat with crew playing vital role might be your last. What FTL lacked was freedom and openness. DSRF is FTL with better graphics and small fleet to fleet battles that lacks freedom and openness. That may appeal to some people and I would recommend the game to that crowd. I simply want space to feel like space: vast, open, and full of surprises. I want to spend my time with a vast, open, and full of surprises space survival game with RPG elements.\n\nDetailed review:\nDistant Star Revenant Fleet (DSRF) is a 2D space game about your small fleet of 1 to 5 ships moving through space to save your home world. The map and galaxy are straight out of FTL. When you fight it's your small fleet battling one to many waves of enemy ships in real time. The developers added an ability to pause the game so that is nice to pause, asssess situation, issue commands, then resume combat. The battles can be hectic so this is a nice feature.\n\nSome ships don't fire unless you specifically click on that ship, click on the weapon, then click on enemy. Even if your ship has 1 weapon, that weapon doesn't autofire. I would like a toggle option to autofire on a particular ship or fire manually. The toggle autofire or manual would be nice on a weapon by weapon basis or ship repair.\n\nThe developer added the ability to save your progress. Exiting after you clear out a section after a jump incurs no penalty. When I exited after I jumed into a sector (my boys wanted food right then) before I even engaged any enemy I got this message stating I'd have some kind of penalty for leaving mid-conflict. This particular design choice creates a horrible user experience. Sometimes I like to exit a game when I must deal with real life issues and any game that penalizes me for that automatically gets a fail recommendation.\n\nThe maps appear to be randomized as well as the encounters. I do enjoy the options when jumping into sections. That being said I haven't played the game enough to experience the variety and depth of choices. The designers used the layout and theme from FTL where the "galaxy" is really about 8 sections of space with last section having some type of "boss". You jump section to section. Within each section is ~20 systems that you'll jump to. You consume some kind of fuel when jumping system to system. The systems have a difficulty rating from 1 to 10 (10 being highest).\n\nThe ship to ship combat is drag box right click or point and click, you highlight with left click, then right click to move/target. The exception are some ship guns or special modules that require additional clicking. The battles are all real time. You cannot ram into enemy ships you simply pass thru them. Your ships can earn experience and credits after each system is completed. At some systems you can upgrade ships in your fleet (the weapons or modules), add ships to your fleet, or buy fuel.\n\nThe permanent death is nice so you have to play smart. I like the persistent damage mods. The maps are a bit off when playing at 5760 x 1080 but it's playable.\n\nI stopped playing and wanted to update this review after I experienced an annoying design choice and what I think was a bug. When entering a system I was hailed by "pirates" and "cargo" ships / victims. The choice was to leave them them alone or side with either pirate or cargo ships. Since I wasn't presented with an option to kill pirates and then loot the cargo ships (I am at war) I'll talk about the choice I did take. I sided with cargo ships to provide an escort. What happened next was an escort mission that included defeating all the pirates and escorting three vessels (A, B, and C). You escort ships one at a time. Ship A appears on map when mission starts, B shows up after A is destroyed or makes it to starbase, C shows up after B is at starbase or destroyed. The cargo ships simply fly without any care in the galaxy straight into the horde of pirate ships. If I had known this I would have sided with the pirates. If your life / cargo depends on your security escort you had better take commands from the security escort. For the cargo ship to simply fly head long into the pirates is poor design and ignores a realistic option that beings don't ask for help then simply suicide it. Give the player control of moving the cargo ship. Save the developer the labor of creating cargo ship AI in escort duty. Then if cargo ship is lost there is really only one person at fault, the player and not developer AI. I did manage to save ship B and escort that ship to the single space station. Ship A and C did not fare well. A morale aspect or fair reward system would be nice. I'm not sure what was so valuable a cargo that was worth the 30+ pirate vessels (large and small) being destroyed. You would think that at some point morale would fail and pirates would give up or the reward from the cargo ship captain would scale to the risk.  Here is were the bug kicked in...after all that fighting, the mission failed. I never found out what the reward would have been. I completed killing all the pirates and ship B escort (green check next to objective). Failed A and C ships (red in boxes). The mission message said I failed because I failed to escort ANY of the ships to station even thought I did escort B.","January 18, 2015","false","4.6"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","15"

I liked the banner/whatever you want to call it. Nice sci-fi-y name. And only 6.99. So, I thought for 6.99 I might as well see what this game is - expecting another space 4x game (that isn't bad) -\n\nInstead, I started reading reviews and kept running into "It's like FTL mixed with (2D) Homeworld". And that just isn't fair. How am I supposed to NOT spend a mere 6.99 when multiple reviews are dangling one of my favorite games, FTL, and one of my favorite RTS games, Homeword, and saying that this game is like both of those games....in one package... So I bought it.\n\nSo, first off, are the reviews that compare this game to FTL and Homeworld (a 2D version of Homeworld) accurate? Basically, yes. I definitely would compare it to FTL. Homeworld, is a bit more of a stretch since it's basically a 2D space RTS when it comes to combat, but I have no problem with the comparison to Homeworld because of the atmosphere of the game. If you like both, this is worth checking out.\n\nIt is early access, though, so it's currently rather short (replay value is there, though, due to it's roguelike nature). And although I have no experience with Blazing Griffin when it comes to early access, all signs point to them being a developer who is wanting to do early access right. They urge players to join the forums and leave feedback/get involved and they seem genuine. Plus, the price is rather low, so it's not a huge risk. If you're worried about early access titles, throw this on your wishlist/watch list and keep on eye on it. If you like FTL and RTS games and Blazing Griffin does things right, then this will be a title you will want one day.","February 6, 2015","true","0.6"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

You very quickly realize that every map is just a series of triggers where enemy fleets spawn (this doesn't really make sense from a story perspective or a "fun game" perspective), and triggering more than one engagement at a time is sure to destroy your fleet. This basically breaks gameplay down into: Do the same fight over and over again inside a small radius circle (lest you summon another wave of bad guys).\n\nTl;dr: Combat "fun" needs work, while the fights are balanced they're almost always cookie cutter.

Space backgrounds with giant hulks and derelicts that could hold entire star systems bring Homeworld to mind.\nThe music also reminds me of Homeworld soundtrack, sort of tribal, very fitting for the "war of the two peoples" narrative.\nI wish the soundtrack would be available as DLC to buy.\n\nSpaceship upgrades are diverse and fun, no linear progress "more damage and ROF" but actual choices like "more damage but slower reload" or "less damage but you don't have to aim that lance manually any longer".\n\nSpaceships themselves are diverse as well, you have ewar, support, carriers, dreadnaughts, assaults, snipers, brawlers, disruptors, all the whizzbang. Kinda like a flat EvE online ;P\n\nThe strategic map of travel through the sectors is similar to the strategic map in FTL.\nEncounters are less humorous than FTL though, they carry the heavy seriousness apropriate for a Tribe Warfleet on a mission that you can not afford to fail.\n\nThe narrative is very pleasant, no traces of cheesiness, just a grim shadow of struggle against time to reach your home system in time to stop the enemy from deploying the planet killer, that is constantly looming over you.\n\nI do recommend this game to anyone who likes space games.\n\nI personally am not much into flat space games, but this one is a work of art executed with such mastery, that I do accept the lack of third dimension.\n\n\n\n\n\n","February 9","true","2.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Get there from here, risk-reward balancing, final confrontation, random encounters.\n* Ship modding looks reasonably simple, but still provides certain amount of customization.\n* Combat mechanics per se are okay, if somewhat demanding. Expect needing to check the battlefield constantly for statuses, changes in enemy targeting etc. Tactical pause is your friend.\n\nWhat is the problem with the game right now:\n* Clearly, difficulty during the early game is something that will potentially keep you from going - well, anywhere. FTL's gradual increase in difficulty is totally absent here. Wiped out in your first sector? Sure. Wiped out in _tutorial mission_? Not unheard of.\n\nOverall, I guess, I will take the dev's word that they are going to tune this up to more stable playability and recommend. After all, it's a job well done in general, if maybe too rough around the edges yet.

It is a very difficult rogue like/rpg hybrid with a space setting. You explore a map jumping from sector to sector. In each sector you encounter different scenarios and you have some choice as to how you proceed. For example, in one mission I had the option of continuing my mission, joining some pirates, or saving some cargo ships. There are dialogue options and I found some interesting story and fluff missions as well.\n\nI did encounter a few minor bugs which I was going to report but when I checked their bug thread I found the dev had already acknowledged them and said they were working on fixes.\n\nI played two games and got killed in both. The first game I only made it to two areas. The second game I explored about 2/3 of the map before a giant battleship wiped me out.\n\nI hope they work on the rpg and upgrade elements more. When I started the game I only had money to purchase 3 ships for my fleet (you are allowed 5). Later on I had got more money but the fleet screen wouldn't let me click the button to go to the ships screen. There was very little gear and weapons to find and although I was only a couple jumps from the final fight when I died my ships hadn't progressed very much. I'm not sure if I was doing something wrong or if those features aren't quite implemented yet. Regardless, I couldn't buy more ships or do repairs and I got very few upgrades.\n\nThe descriptions for the weapons need more info so we can compare them. For example, I had 3 missiles I could equip on my main battleship. But the descriptions didn't provide things like damage, rate of fire, shield piercing vs. hull piercing, etc.\n\nOverall I think it looks like it's going to be a good game. The devs seem to listen to feedback and are working on the bugs and balancing. It's already a fun game with very nice graphics and a solid framerate.\n\n","March 6, 2015","true","1.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

I was pretty excited about a game that looked like FTL with an RTS engine for the battles; and that’s exactly what this game is, unfortunately it was just executed very poorly.  I'm going to refer to FTL repeatedly in my review, and if you haven't already played that, stop reading, point your search to there and go buy it.  It's a great game and this is but a poor shadow.\nThe good:\nThe RTS engine is actually quite well done.  Graphics are smooth, tactics actually matter, and they’ve done some interesting (although in some cases not very well balanced) things with dodging, cover, and tanking.  Controls are not very responsive, but I can live with that as it makes good tactical choices even more important.\nThe bad:\nThe strategic portion of the game (i.e. the FTL clone) is absolutely terrible.  Imagine if FTL had worse balance, very little choice in the actions available, very few strategic build choices, and no achievements or unlocks.\nThe balance of the game is similarly pretty awful.  I’m all for a hard roguelike, but I do prefer some sort of achievement or progress system that makes dying fun.  Nothing like that here, the game is terribly random and punishingly difficult.  Actually getting anywhere feels more like luck than skill in most cases.\nOverall, I’d say that this feels like a game that was developed by two teams: one reasonably competent and the other with very little game design experience.  I also suspect that the game was probably rushed out before it was finished.  I do note that the developers are still patching it, so maybe it will improve over time, but at the moment I can’t recommend anyone to put either time or money into it.","April 18, 2015","false","14.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The devs are listening to players. This is so amazingly rare nowadays and they deserve support just for that reason.\n2. I want to see more games that are similar to this. This was an attempt at a unique game that unfortunately failed, but I  respect their attempt, and Iwant to see these devs and other devs continue to be supported and keep trying. They may get it right next time.\n\n-Also, writing was pretty good. It wasn't Sunless Sea level, but it was about on par with FTL.\n\nSo honestly, my recommendation is to buy the game, but not play it.\n\nThe last thing that I ask you to read is the following:\n\nTEDIUM IS NOT DIFFICULTY.\nREPETITION IS NOT CHALLENGE.\nPlease remember that for your next game if you read this Devs. I believe you have a lot of potential.\n\n\nFeel free to ignore the more detailed review below. It's a lot of venting anyway.\n\nMore detailed review:\n\nI tried so, so hard to to like this game. It looks like a cross between Homeworld and FTL on the surface, and I kept thinking "Maybe I'll start to understand more about the game, and it'll become fun!"\n\nNo. No it doesn't. There are very, VERY rare occasions where you actually get into the combat. It may have happened like 5 times in 10 hours of gameplay. And it lasted like 30 seconds. So I enjoyed approximately 2.5 minutes of the 10 hours of gameplay I have. (only a mild exaggeration, honestly).\n\nThe combat is some of the most boring, repetitive combat I've ever experienced, and it takes AGES to complete battles even when the outcome is very clear.\n\nI played the game on Veteran because I enjoy a challenge. This game is not capable of being challenging, however.\n\nA challenge isn't "Here, throw 5 more ships at them, and give them all 50% more health." That isn't challenging, because the only thing I have to do is fly in circles THAT MUCH LONGER until I finally wear them down, or I randomly get a ship disabled because the AI is terrible.\n\nNext complaint: AI IS TERRIBLE. Enemy AI: TERRIBLE. Your Fleet AI: HORRIBLE. Mines: WHY? Literally just capitalizing on the poor AI that you put into the game just to cause damage and frustration. That is not challenging. Micro-managing ships around mines is not fun, it is BORING and TEDIOUS.\n\nNext complaint: SAME MISSIONS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER. Capture A B C. Defend A. Destroy B. Woooooooowww. SUCH BORING. WHAT TEDIUM.\n\nI honestly am so frustrated with this game at this point. I tried for 10+ hours to like this game. I tried so EFFFING hard, because I LOVE FTL (check my hours if you don't believe me), and Homeworld was a masterpiece. However, instead of FTL and Homeworld having a lovely baby, they ended up with a mentally damaged child that while somehow well-spoken and mildly handsome, has to be tied up to a post so they can run around in circles to avoid them falling over and smacking their head on the nearest piece of furniture.\n\nI won't even go on about the end fight. Hint: IT'S AWFUL. DON'T EVEN BOTHER.\n\nTEDIUM IS NOT DIFFICULTY.\nREPETITION IS NOT CHALLENGE.\n\nPlease, remember that.","April 30","true","11.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

I bought this game because i knew it was the only other game that is even remotely similar to the game.

I haven't encountered any bugs, except for a visual one.\nThe game plays simply by moving from node to node like in FTl, where different events await you. Some of them are just chatting, some trade, and some will try to murder you!\nAnd oh they will murder you, the game is really brutal, but here is my only complaint I have to make! The game does not give you any idea of what really awaits you, it is a matter of trial and error. In FTl you would see the ship, and sometimes even it's interior before taking up the fight. Here you just know that battle await, you have no idea what kind of enemies awaits. In one of the missions I was meant to fight against pirates, alright, pirates probably suck I thought, and got rekt totally.

And this game is early access so maybe my complaints will go away over time.  However, right now the combat seems to devolve into a slugfest.  There's almost no tactics involved that I can see.  Every combat turns into trying to engage as few enemies at a time as possible, focusing fire one at a time, using almost all cooldowns asap every chance, and basically standing there trading blows hoping your ships are more powerful than the enemy.  The only "tactic" I've been able to come up with is hiding my lancers behind more powerful ships to try to have attacks against them absorbed.  But that is still just a slugfest.  I want to think there's potential, but with the recent addition of a "save" system that actually punishes you for saving if you need to leave the game and come back later, I'm not holding out much hope.\n\nNo, I don't recommend this game.","February 21, 2015","false","0.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Like waxing my cat.  If hard is what you want the get it.  I will look back in on this game in a couple of months to see if it is balanced any better.  Stick with FLT much better game.  FLT is hard but at least it seems that I make progress instead of running from everything.  Well  "running from everything" is the wrong phrase considering that everything is an ambush.  You have to go out and find them.  It is basically a clear the level type of game.","April 15, 2015","false","12.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

This game is lacking in features, depth, and mechanical function. I got to the last level wanting to be done with the game, and that's a shame because there is potential here. 4/10 - make sure to check some positive reviews too because it may be worth your time.\n\nDistant Star: Revenant Fleet is an FTL-Like [is that a thing?], but not really. Really the only similarity is the map and agression buildup mechanic and having limited supplies. There are three main game phases, the universe map, sector map, and the RTS mission map. The universe and sector map are similar to FTL, but with an agression meter instead of the the encroacment of enemy controled space.\n\nThe actual game play is very differant. Many of the mission maps in DS:RF are procedurally generated. Unfortunatly they are also forgetable. There are a number of ship classes with a variety of tactics, weapons, and purchasable subsystems and semi-random level upgrades as the ships get exp. if you run out of supply or go down in a mission ships get "critical damage" which lowers one of the stats of your ship and can lead to destruction.\n\nWhere FTL created a winning combination with pretty fundementally simple mechanics, DS:RF's mechanics just don't hit that sweet spot just right, the innability to set waypoints and some difficulty with point and click targetting and navigation makes most complex tactics a chore and coordination difficult. The upgrade system is a little unsatisfying as well. The biggest problem with the game is that every time I hit "continue" after reading the flavor text at the end of the mission, the game hangs, stalls, and comes to the brink of crashing before finally snapping back after around 20 seconds (assuming you are patient and stop clicking, otherwise it will crash). Almost all of the menues and dialouge boxes do this and it kills the game.\n\nThat said, especially in the begining, the RTS space battles are visually pleasing with lots of detail put into ship destruction. It's extremely satisfying when my lancer beam cuts off part of a ship and it travels through the debris field of it's former allies. the AI is pretty basic and there are no ship collisions so you can neither ram nor block other ships. There are abilities ranging from buff's to heals and debuffs with ships representing healers, rogues, mages, tanks, dps, and "ranged dps."\n\nIf you can catch the game half off it's cheeper than the acrade, but It's also somewhat forgettable. Some of these issues shouldn't have made it to release, but it's clear that it was released in a playable state despite having some intractable bugs just beneath the surface despite work to fix them.\n","July 29, 2015","false","4.6"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","1"

There is no rock-paper-scissors. No intelligence. No way to influence the fight except to click on the skills button a lot.\n\nWhere FPS has actual tactics, this game just has grinding. You grind DPS and then just focus it at enemies and you win. Woop.\n\nEven the jumping from systems and then getting a few choices they stole from FTL but they did it so badly!! There are hardly any different outcomes and the choices are just unimaginative and obvious.\n\nI'm actually pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the positive reviews of this game referencing FTL, I can only imagine those are friends of the game or something.

I began to suspect that the reviews may have been kneejerk reactions that spawned a hate-mob or were balancing complaints that weren't ammended as the developer began to make changes.\n\nI haven't played very long yet-- but I'm really enjoying it! If indeed the game had some issues before I arrived on the scene, they don't seem to be present now.\n\nDon't get me wrong- there's still a pressing difficulty, even on the normal setting. But it hasn't felt insurmountable. Thus far, the only really dangerous situaton I ran into resulted from a silly mistake I made. And even then, I was able to use the Escape option to cut my losses.\n\nCheck the game out. It gets started quickly and doesn't put you through silly tutorials.

The graphics, while polished for what they are, come across as very two dimensional.  Everything looks flat, like paper ships.  There is no 3D or 3D rendered or 2.5D  graphics here.  Models are flat as can be.  The backgrounds use layers to attempt to achieve depth, but this too comes across looking like nicely printed paper moving across other nicely printed paper.  The game overall was quite dark too and just not all that interesting to look at.\n\nThe pace of the game is quite slow as well.  I didn't really feel like finishing my game, but I played through to the end just to try to give it a fair review.\n\nSound effects are average, but the musical score will put you to sleep.  Seriously, if you have trouble getting to sleep, buy the soundtrack for this game.\n\nEarly battles for each level are way too easy.  I know the game is set up this way, but the most interesting moments in this game are when you are overpowered and really need to devise strategy and tactics to defeat the enemy.\n\nOne odd choice was the fog of war.   It just makes this already dark game look even darker, and the viewable area was too small imo.  Enemy ships appear from the fog of war just barely out of weapons range, giving the player a second or so to react.  Not good when you are already engaged with another enemy.  This negatively impacts the player's ability to mount effective strategy.\n\nBattles can be difficult to manage.  I attribute this to the narrow zoom angle of the game.  You cannot zoom out and get a wide view of the battle.  You will find yourself often pausing the action to pan around the battle and issue orders, which further slows the pace of the game.\n\nThe ship types and weapon systems of this game are interesting.  Each ship has specific roles to play, and exploring their strengths while trying to piece together an effective battle fleet was fun.  I also enjoyed the skills system for this game, which helps make every ship in your fleet unique while tailoring them to your play style.\n\nThough I wasn't able to defeat the boss on my one and only playthrough, it was a fun challenge.  I would like to try it again, but there is no way I'm playing through this boring game again.  I would have enjoyed other mini boss battles along the way.  Maybe a massive drone controller to defeat.  A carrier that continuously launches small craft.  A beam ship, and you can maneuver behind rocks to avoid the beams.   Anything.  Mini bosses would be more exciting and they would differentiate each level, instead of each level basically being a clone of the last.  I know, it's randomly generated, but I really felt like "didn't I just do this" at the start of every level.\n\nBasically, as I said, this is a boring game.\n\n","August 23, 2015","false","6.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I apologize for all my numerous complaints but most are valid, I feel like this is such an amazing thing and my money was wasted because the description of the game doesnt tell you about these game ruining flaws (though i guess they wouldnt because then you wouldnt buy it). maybe the devs didnt know?","April 9, 2015","false","4.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I bought it on sale pretty cheap.  It is a small download and I didn't know what to expect to be honest.  This is a simple yet pretty tough game.  It kind of reminds of Masters of Orion 2.  Of course not as long and more simple.  You buy ships, equip them, and fight.\n\nThere are like 10 sectors and each one has so many jump points inside it and an exit.  You can be line to the exit and use as little resourses ( you use 1 per jump) as possible or you can gamble on more points for loot and xp.  Each jump point usually has some kind of decision to be made.  It could simply be a merchant or it could be colonists or stranded allies and your decision will either yeild stuff or a fight or both.\n\nIn a fight, ships are generally disabled and not destroyed unless they have been disabled often and have a lot of criticals.  You can buy off the criticles with repair but it can get costly and hurt you buying new ships and upgrades, so best not get disabled.  IF ALL YOUR SHIPS ARE DISABLED IN A FIGHT THEN GAME OVER.  Yep, you start all over if all ship get shot down.  If you win with just one ship then all are revived but any disabled might get a critical as mentioned above.\n\nThe fights are live and tactical, you have to move and use active abilties to win while staying alive, you have passives as well, some guns are autofire and autohit while others you activate and shoot a location, etc..\n\nI am happy I got the game, it is a good time passer and fun when you need one of those "getaway games"  from playing with other people and dealing with their drama.","September 12, 2015","true","9.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The story is fine.\n\nMusic theme and artwork are well done and will remind you of beloved Homeworld.\nThe game mechanics are based on more recent FTL and unfortunately are not working here.\n\nDeveloper didn't pay attention and did not managed to reproduce the essential part of FTL which is THE PUNISHMENT!\nIn FTL each step can be your last! Each choice has grave gravity attached to it. For example when you find a floating cargo pod you can pry it open just to learn that some furious alien ate your crew member.. or.. you can pry it open to learn that this alien wants to fight for your cause. In order to make wise choice you need to calculate what your needs are and what situation you are in.\n\nIn Distant Star choices are rather flat and boring. You just pick them with little attention just to move forward with the game. Absolutely no excitement.\n\nThe fleet idea is cool, but it is as boring as journey path.\n\nIn general artwork is nice looking but the game play part of the game is seriously crippled.","May 31, 2015","false","2.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"
