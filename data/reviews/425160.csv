I would recommend this game for everyone, who likes challanges, who isn't afraid of going for a level over and over again to beat his/her best time, or for even beat that ****ing level finally. I won't say it will be an easy game, sometimes you might want to kill every person involved in the making of this game, BUT it is a game what really worth to pick up.\n\nWhats good in the game:\nChallanging levels\nPuzzle levels\nGreat enviroment and good looking levels\nSeveral hours of gameplay\nYou can play the levels over and over again and it still not boring\nCute potato shaped bees\nSome secret to discover\netc.\nIf you like indie games, or platform games, or want to rest from the other games, this is a good choice.\nAnd with the developer daily streams  well... almost daily  everyone could feel they were part of the game making.\n\nAfter this project the dev will probably have a lots of other project, so if you free definitely check that one out too!\n\n10/10 would have this game again!","February 12","true","25.4"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","19","20","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsoharley/recommended/425160/","tsoharley","Facial La Fleur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsoharley/","85 products in account","Recursion Deluxe is a quaint little 8-bit puzzle platformer. Gradually ramping up in difficulty over the course of 60 mind-bending levels (that I'm aware of at the time of this writing), the game utilizes gravity switching, reminiscent of parts of LIMBO, and other physics based game mechanics, to allow you to solve puzzles and reach the level exit. Along the way you'll try to avoid hungry zombies and angry bees (NOT THE BEES!), but clever players can not only avoid them, but dispatch them for good, making it much easier to finish the level. Recursion Deluxe should scratch your retro and masochistic itches in equal measure. RECOMMENDED!","February 21","true","3.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I do think different enemy types might have been a good idea since everyone tries to jump on the zombees when they first encounter them.\n\nThe game does get harder later on and the level length continues to grow, the first world definitely feels very short in comparison to the rest of the game.\n\nWe will be fixing the xbox one controller issue shortly, we believe it has to do with an odd deadzone with that controller on windows 10.\n\nYou have me on the basic mechanics though, if you want a game with shooting or wall jumping, that's not this game. We were going more for a puzzle style and wanted to focus on that =)","February 16","true","4.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

There is too much inertia upon letting go of controls that makes landing precise jumps and stopping on a dime tough.\n\nAlso.. it's 2016.  I realize this is a retro inspired 2D indie game... but modifying my resolution through a text file?

The main gimmicks are the non-euclidean geometry and gravity reversal, with plenty of switches, keys and obstacles to make for interesting puzzle solving and platform jumping. It definitely feels like a game I've played before, and yet it kept my attention from beginning to end.\n\nThe game is quite short, but for the price seems about right. The difficulty curve is slow and steady, with most of the game feeling a bit on the easy side, though I do consider myself well-traveled in this genre. Most of the challenge comes from collecting the game's completely optional stars, and dying has no penalty.\n\nRecommended to puzzle fans, platforming fans, and retro game fans alike.","February 18","true","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I've included my full thoughts in video form here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8x3neaGjRc\n\n- Graphically charming\n- Catchy soundtrack\n- Tight controls\n- Excellent level design\n- Enticing 'one more try' gameplay\n\nI feel the level design in particular is worth expanding upon a bit more.  Levels and level progression are designed to teach the player the mechanics naturally through gameplay.  There's no tutorials here, just design that promotes learning.  Mechanics are introduced one at a time throughout the levels, allowing you to both feel like you're getting a grasp on things and feel accomplished when you put all the pieces together to complete a particularly difficult level.\n\nAlso, at $5 it's hard to pass up!","February 19","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So this game was immediately interesting. I have to say though, it does a fantastic job of easing the player into new mechanics and ideas without hindering the flow. There aren't any obnoxious tutorials breaking up the flow or unchallenging "learning areas". The mechanics are simple enough, but the way in which they are put together make for deeper puzzles and encourage lateral thinking. When you die your character immediately respawns and the puzzle is reset, so you're put right back into the game without any waiting time. I can see myself playing this a lot between breaks.

My opinions are my own.\n\nI thought this game was great. For $5, you really can't beat the experience. I felt it was a great idea for a mobile game, but after playing it for awhile it does play fine on PC as well. The concept of shifting between edges of the screen, then also flipping upside down and such is pretty cool and something that is hard to pull off, but Recursion Deluxe does it well. Add in a level editor, twitch plays support and more free DLC/content in the future, this is a great pick up for the low price of $5.","March 5","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The sprites were also great, and the gameplay was fun. I only played up to World 2 before writing this review but I found myself compeled to see World 1 through. I found it difficult to see the spikes at times, so I would recomment adding a greater constrast with them and their surroundings. Also I didn't feel that compeled to pick up the stars so mabye a reward such as a new character would make the player feel more atached to the game with a sense of greater progress.","May 13","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artstyle and aesthetic work well to compliment the core gameplay.","April 18","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
