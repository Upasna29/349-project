"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atlasinvictus/recommended/15390/","atlasinvictus","ATLAS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atlasinvictus/","175 products in account","Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway was an amazing experience and an example on what modern military shooters should do nowadays, yes, looking at you, Call of Duty and Battlefield. At thing which bugs me about modern shooters is that every single one of them has its focus on the repetitive multiplayer where as today most of them play essentially the same, just as the campaign.\n\nWe need more games like Hell's Highway which are not glorifying war but show the human side the soldiers have instead of how many times they can yell "♥♥♥♥ YEAH, AMERICA!" while pulling out the flamethrower to "burn them, burn them all!!!"\n\nThe men you fight along in Hell's Highway feel human and just as in the older Brother's in Arms games, the main focus lies in the single player. If you want to buy this game for a killstreak loaded multi player to "pwn scrubs", you are wrong here.\n\nA roughly about 10 hours long campaign (I played on Veteran difficulty)  will keep you motivated with a nice tactical component to command different squads such as the MG squad or the assault team as Matthew Baker, to surpress the enemy and use the element of surprise to flank clueless and somtimes dumb acting enemy soldiers. The commanding barely gets old and as you hop around different hubs of the hot areas during the war. Those range from wide fields to close battles in troubled cities and villages as well as asylums and collapsed buildings.\n\nThe thing which does get a little repetitive are the objectives you have to achieve using those methods of commanding. Most of the time you find yourself having to destroy 88 cannons and sometimes drive a tank around in which you are mostly safe even on the higher difficulties. Really annoying did those things only become in the end to me, as the game finally came to a closing, during the last hour of gameplay. The story itself kept motivating as protagonist Matthew Baker's mind started to crumble and he realized more and more and war is insanity.\nThe "To Be Continued" in the end was a huge bummer to me though, especially because Ubisoft doesn't seem to care at all about this amazing series which could definetly standout amongst "Call of Boredom" or the recent development of the"Battlefail" games.\n\nIt doesn't need amazing graphics to make a good game. While Brothers in Arms may looked fine back in the day it is quite outdated for the modern standards. Second to none facial animations, horrible lip-synching at times but nice destructability of cover and physical correctness of the debris look damn fine as well as gore and ragdoll of fallen enemy soldiers.\nAlso the sound design is great and as the bullets fly over your head  in cover and the enemies speaking correct German, which is a rare thing to see to be honest. The atmosphere is really great and makes you feel as if this was an episode of the critically acclaimed "Band of Brothers"-TV show. The developers really did a great job in capturing an unique and equally terrifying experience.\n\nOverall Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway is a technically and gameplay wise far from flawless but also an unique and tactical game which definetly gets a recommendation for me, even if solely for the atmosphere and the long campaign.\n\nGrab this game if you are sick of modern shooters and/or glorification of war.","June 28, 2014","true","7.6"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","36","40","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/knetic/recommended/15390/","knetic","K!netic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/knetic/","300 products in account","It's a good game - a strong example of a squad-based shooter. You control the position and focus of 1-3 fireteams, edging your way through battlefields to flank enemies and progress through linear levels. It encourages you to leverage your fireteams because your own weapons are unreliable to the extreme - on par with Counter-strike accuracy. Bullets spray for no particular reason, shots that are dead-on don't always register, and enemies take many shots to take down. While that's frustrating, it highlights that you are not a pure badass. Sure you may mow down hundreds of enemies in a playthrough, but ultimately it tries to knock you down to size with it's iffy gun mechanics - you need to use your squad to succeed. And while it is frustrating to not be rewarded for your own skill, i can understand that sloppy controls make you rely on your squad more.\n\nIt also seems to want to be Band of Brothers, the TV show. The game spends an enormous amount of time showing wooden characters (some of which are obviously derived from Band of Brothers characters, one of which even shares a voice actor) talking to each other about the war and each other. It spins narratives about cursed guns and lost loves which have exactly nothing to do with the game. The first ten minutes (not an exaggeration) is a series of unskippable cutscenes that awkwardly introduce a set of characters which it clearly wants you to be invested in. It keeps introducing new characters who have small quirks and different voice actors, but whom you really don't care about. When it kills off or maims a character, you're clearly expected to care, but there's no *reason* to care; the gameplay (controlling the position and focus of 1-3 fireteams) is identical no matter which characters are involved, and you're aways given replacements who are exactly as capable. Cutscene after cutscene is used, even with "shaky-cam" effects and close-ups of expressionless faces. It's all the more frustrating because this came out a year after Bioshock, a game which is almost purely story-driven, uses the same engine, and yet falls into none of the gameplay or storytelling pitfalls that this game does.\n\nUltimately, it's a fun game that executes a squad shooter very well, despite the flaws. I'd recommend it if you're certain you want a squad shooter, and wouldn't recommend it for any other reason.","May 22, 2015","true","4.4"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

(well i got affected)\nYou play as Matthew Baker which is the main protagonist that you also play as in Road to Hill 30.\nWhile touring the Netherlands, you get attacked by some nazis, well DUH!!.\nThis game is set in World War 2. You get to lead a handful of men, at the least of 3 men and the most of 9 men.\nYou also get to take control of a Sherman Firefly Tank twice in this game.\n\nGameplay\nJust like the previous games, Brothers in Arms is known to be a tactical first person shooter (FPS) you can order your men to take up positions, Flank enemy positions, Surpress enemy fire, take cover behind a huge rock and follow you as you move.\nThere are 3 squads you can control\n\n1. Base of Fire Team\na non special squad which the soldiers only wield M1A1 Carbines, M1A1 Thompsons and M1 Garands\nTip:\nUse this fire team to throw grenades up close to enemy positions and follow you moving\n\n2. Assault Team\nBasically the same as number 1 except this one is more awesome..... Why?\nBecause there's a british guy.\n\n3. Special Weapons team\nthis can be broken down into 2 which are:\na. MG team\nA squad which carries a Browning M1919A6 (Heavy Machine Gun)\nTip:\nUse this squad to stay at the furthest back of your current position to supress enemy fires\nb. Bazooka Team\nA squad which carries the Rocket Launcher (Bazooka)\nTip:\nUse this squad to supress tanks and annihilate poor little nazis.\n\nThe drawback of the gameplay of this title is that unlike its previous titles, this game removes the\nTactical Awareness View and changed with a simple ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed map. My first reaction was WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥IN HELL IS THIS. I guess its just me that i like to see the faces, names and the weapons of my own men and the enemy. The awareness view in the previous games is really cool which shows your position with the exact cutscene graphics.\n\nGraphics\nThis game came out of the year 2008 which i think has remarkable graphics from that period.\nThe graphics are a big jump from the previous games as they transferred from Unreal Ungine 2.0 to Unreal Engine 3.0\nGood grass textures\nGreat water textures\nNice Shaders\nCutting-Edge helmet textures ( You can even see the damned particles of Baker's helmet)\n\nSo you guys might be thinking, "So what of this game makes Ubisoft a bad guy?"\nHere i shall tell you\nWARNING POTENTIAL SPOILERS!!!!!:\n\nThe game ends with a Cliffhanger which is a total nerve-wrecking experience and guess what!\nUbisoft cancelled the 4th installment named Furious 4. UGGHHHH...\nUbisoft has created a franchise which is for me, a revolution in the world of FPS. In which you get to take control of your own people. The story from the previous games would automatically bond the game characters and the players and to have it end with a cliffhanger, Its like opening a road for 30 miles and suddenly, there's a road block but yet, the road looks to be open and safe to go but a block stands in the way.\n\nAnyways.....\n\nOverall, I hereby rate this game as\n\n9/10\nVery Recommended\n(If you are patient and have completed the previous games.)\n\nBAAAAAAAKKKKKKKEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","April 23","true","6.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I played all three of the games at their release dates, and now have replayed all three of them within the past year or so.

The first one, in fact, disappointed me a lot - and that was with nostalgia thinking it was amazing!\n\nThis game held up.

Baker's sanity wanes due to the contention of his men, rumors of a haunted pistol, and the memories of friends lost.\n\nThe combat in HH holds to the tradition of the earlier titles in the series, while adding additional squads and features. Flanking and diversionary tactics are vital, as running into the open while an enemy fires upon Baker or his squad will result in a quick death.\n\nHowever, Hell's Highway is a game that needs some fixing to enjoy. For anyone like myself who gets headaches or feels sick at a lower field of view, here's different methods of how to counter the horrid default setting.\n\n\n--------------\nMethod 1:\nA simple binding to toggle the fov. This will change the fov when pressed, but will zoom out cutscenes, break sniper scopes, and disable zooming in when aiming.\n\nGo to your "Documents\My Games\BIA Hells Highway\SumacGame\Config" folder and open "SumacInput.ini" in a text editor.\nunder the"[Engine.PlayerInput]" section add the following.\n\nBindings=(Name="KEY",Command="fov DESIREDFOV",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)\n\n\nMethod 2:\nChanging the action of the zoom hold command to change the fov. The fov will lower when aiming to zoom in, then zoom out to your desired standard fov on release. This will also zoom out cutscenes and break sniper scopes. I suggest a zoom fov of 60, and a standard fov of 100.\n\nUnder "[Engine.InputActionDefinition]" in SumacInput.ini look for the line that starts with "Actions=(Id=IA_ZoomHold,Alias...".\nChange the line to, "Actions=(Id=IA_ZoomHold,Alias=".ZOOMHOLD",Names=("Zoom"),Command="ZoomIn | fov DESIREDZOOMFOV | OnRelease ZoomOut | OnRelease DESIRED DEFAULT FOV")"\n\nOther tips:\nCreating a bind similar to the bind shown in method 1 set to "fov 63" will set cutscenes close to what they look like normally.\n\nIn the "[SystemSettings]" section of "SumacEngine.ini" you can pump up the graphics. I suggest setting "EnableHighPolyChars=False" to "True" and fiddling around with the MSAA.\n-------------\n\n\n\nLike Far Cry 2, Syndicate, and Rage a good game is held back by stupid issues that can be solved with a few simple tweaks. I enjoy fixing issues in PC ports, so I may be biased, but Hell's Highway is one of my favorite games of the last eight years.","January 1, 2014","true","17.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I read reviews on Steam and Metacritic to see what was popular and Hell's Highway came up.\n\nAfter beating the game I am still not entirely sure if the game deserves a recommendation or not.\n\nFor starters, the game has some glaring errors in historical accuracy, such as German 88's firing at Sherman tanks at point blank range and failing to penetrate or a single such Sherman tank rolling through hundreds of men, tanks and 88's (for some reason there are no other antitank guns in this game, just the 88 anti-air -guns) with ease.\n\nThe graphics (originally designed for the Xbox 360) are obviously dated, with character models warping and distorting uncomfortably and facial animation all but missing entirely. The voice acting is lackluster to say the least, ambients sounds are often missing, weapons sound muted and dull and even the music seems to be oddly off-key in few points (though this part might just be my lack of knowledge showing through). All in all, the game's audiovisual presentation is pretty terrible. Even the ragdoll physics are glitchy as heck (I shot a german soldier in the head and he jumped 50 meters in the air as he died)!\n\nSo far, then, this seems like a no-brainer: an ugly game with bad audiovisual design through and through.\n\nAnd then we get to the gameplay, and here I find myself intrigued. You are acting as a squad leader for most of the game, and that means you cannot just charge the enemy Call of Duty -style, but have to order around your fireteams (up to three at a time, ranging from machine gun team to base of fire team to bazooka team to assault team), setting them up in cover, assigning them targets to suppress and maneuvering them to outflank the enemy. The levels offer a sometimes surprising amount of freedom in how much you can maneuver and the system feels surprisingly good most of the time. I especially enjoyed the frantic tension of emerging into a new area only to observe a german squad marching across a field, ordering my men into position and then watching the enemy spread out into cover as the shooting starts. The enemy AI is also surprisingly good, acting surprised where appropriate, falling back and regrouping into better positions as they are overrun our outflanked and generally putting up a good fight.\n\nAnd then the game shoots itself in the foot again. Several times I had the AI completely glitch out, with my machinegun team or bazooka team simply freezing in place and refusing to move, getting stuck in walls or cover and such. The game hands you a sniper rifle on a few occasions, which immediately results in you, single handedly, gunning down literally dozens of germans within a minute or two, utterly breaking any immersion the game might have had so far. The tone of the game is all over the place, and then, in the end credits, comes the final straw. The story ends on a minor cliffhanger with "To Be Continued" -emblazoned on the screen. This game came out in 2008. I played it in 2016. There are no sequels, and likely never will be.\n\nGame Over.\n\n\nPlaytime: 8+ hours (single playthrough)\n\nRatings (1-5)\nVisual: 5\nAudio: 5\nStory: 7\nGameplay: 8\nOverall: 7","March 30","false","8.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","5"

One to toggle between the teams and one to execute a order which are dynamic depending on what you are looking at. If you aim at cover, they move there, if you aim at enemies they shoot and if they are close enough they will use hand granades as well.\n\nSuppress, advance, flank and kill is the most common tactic. Every enemy has a icon over their general location which makes giving orders easy. While the enemy icon is red, they are a threat and can easly shoot you. If the icon are gray, they are supressed and you have a easier time advancing... and so on.\n\nThe gameplay is great, fun and works fine. The story is trying to be like the HBO series Band of Brothers, but considering the shorter time a game has to tell such a story it becomes very cheesy.\n\nI would recommend it if it goes on sale again.","May 31, 2011","true","7.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It feels dumbed down and more "Call of Duty"-esque compared to the previous titles. The health system is absolutely ridiculous. It seems to calculate an average of volume of fire directed towards you instead of actual hits. This leads to strange situations where you are completely behind cover but can still be killed. Also actual combat is nowhere near as satisfying. One of the great things about the previous titles was that shooting someone was actually a challenge. It felt very realistic. This title scrapped that and went with your typical FPS style combat where you are basically 100% accurate 100% of the time. If you were a fan of the series before you will likely be very disappointed. It definitely feels very arcadey now.\n\n5/10","December 6, 2014","false","5.5"," 7 of 29 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","7","29","0","0"

Unless they rerelease the older ones and fix some mechanical issues with the games and flesh them out more this is pretty much the best BIA game.  Thats not saying much as this game screams bargain bin abysmal. It is lacking serious polish and there are points in the game where Im left asking "Is something wrong, wheres the rest of the game?" Especially common with sounds and facial animations. Things will be happening and there are either no sounds for them or the sounds are not correct or are so off.\n\nShooting dousn't feel great and feels pretty vanilla if that makes sense, the voice actors are pretty terrible but atleast they have a real sound crew doing the tech work in this one (unlike the first game where it wasn't unheard of to have VO redline/sound awfull). But they still sound like crap because the actors suck. Story can be pretty confusing and fragmented in weird ways aswell.\n\nIts basically a cheap bargain bin WW2 game that. Thats BIA. I feel like for the BIA games they just copied mechanics of other better games and especially when they were popular. When Socom/Freedom Fighters and COD were popular they made the first two games, when Gears of War and shoulder high walls became popular they put that into the game. But honestly the cover mechanics make this game better, one of the issues in earlier games was that you couldn't go third person and get a feel for whats going on very quickly, so you could either look at a wall then pop out or risk being shot and just stand there.\n\nThe damage system is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. I don't think you need to get shot to get hurt, but its so terrible I can't describe it. You regen health though but its not like that makes it better. You have to hit the enemies and work to get shots to hit their mark but they can just spray all over the place and still hit you.\n\nAI is terrible, especially friendly AI. They either path in the way of fire or they decide to run around like headless chickens even though you gave the order to stay where they were. Its about on level with Road to Hill 30 give or take.\n\nI would say the game as a whole objectively and as a game is better than Road to Hill 30. Its atleast easy to shoot people once you learn the system, and its otherwise given a bit more polish. Unfortunately its still not a polished game and is only a bit better in general than the older ones but its that extra bit that makes it a playable and enjoyable video game.\n\nBIA is a bargain bin series, which is unfortunate as there are points that you can see a gleam of something great shine through in production or writing, but then it falls apart when a character is looking at you with a look that makes you think hes holding back maniacal laughter right after a character died.  Its this kind of stuff that makes it impossible to care about anything in this game aside from the base combat. Also your squad can die, but they respawn at the next check point, which also makes you not give a ♥♥♥♥ about characters since they die over and over and over until they die in the story.\n\nThey also tried some weird F.E.A.R. like situations where its supposed to be spooky but its just stupid and the enemy AI and gun play show themselves as terrible when compared to FEAR (which is one of the best FPS in terms of gunplay and especially AI).\n\nMan,  I don't recommend this game, but if you want to play a BIA game this is the one you ought to. Its still pretty below average though but its not as terrible as the older ones.\n\nIf they remade the games they could easily make them great though. Add some more polish and make the existing systems make logical sense. It wouldn't take a terribly large amount of work to make Hill 30 into a great game but it would take money. Which is fairly obvious with these games they didn't want to spend money, they wanted to put out something quick that would make a profit off current trends then move on.\n\nFor what its worth I kinda like it. Not enough games let you command units whilst directly controlling your own character. But its certaintly not a objectively and mechanicly good game. Its okay at best.","April 28, 2015","false","6.9"," 4 of 23 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","4","23","0","0"

Too short.  I would have liked to have had more time and gameplay on this wonderful third installment\n2.  Too much cut scene.  The gameplay was too darn good to keep being interrupted by cutscenes.\n3.  Too muc time spent trying to create a spooky storyline about post-traumatic (or in the midst of traumatic) stress disorder, i.e. shell-shock.  Though I know this is a topic worth pursuing it just took too much away from the movement of the story and the gameplay. (like the whole "chase the kid through the burning building" shtick = way too much)\n4.  Situation awareness is different from BiA1 an BiA2 - which is odd b/c that was a HUGE asset in those games.  Here all you get is a bird's eye view of the terrain; a map - it just isn't as much fun\n\nNow for Kudos:\nThis is game is so worth playing.  Great effects, graphics are fun, good characters, excellent squad-based action, fairly smart AI, fun guns, good reproduction of the terrain.  Really excellent and enjoyable game.  Like I said, just too short.\n\nI would have added another installment of BiA2 individual maps, or quickplay, as that was a huge fac bonis benigne in the last game, and prbbly would have had more terror of tanks action b/c those sons of ♥♥♥♥♥es were pretty awful.  This game avoids major engagements for the less known and more individual skirmishes that occurred during WW2.

In fact, it can be quite boring. There were times where I was hoping for a real challenge, such as playing a level where I would have to use stealth efficiently\n-The game restricts gameplay to cover and squad-based FPS mechanics, and tank levels (these I enjoyed, but they don't last long and there are only three).\n\nThere is no justification for these main issues, it's simply rushed and poorly managed game design.\n\nThe visuals are... well, they vary. There were moments where the game made excellent use of the Unreal Engine's lighting, shadow, and occlusion effects (really really impressive for a 2008 game). However, the textures feel so flat and grainy, and vegetation barely looks passable. Then again, the character models are amazing, the development team really outdid themselves with the main character models.\n\nThe story, granted, is really, REALLY slow (boring) and broken at first. But as you further progress, it unfolds into a powerful and emotional story, with quite a few unexpected twists and turns. It's damn near a masterpiece. Hell, it even felt like I was playing scenes from Saving Private Ryan.\n\nMost of the bore from the story came from the questionable voice acting at the beginning of the game... I'm not going to hide this... it was bad. The narrator (protagonist) at first sounded like he was shouting his story at you, and the rest of the characters sounded like really cheesy 90s video game sidekicks. Oh yeah, it's pretty bad. But for some reason, not even an hour after the game, the voice acting and scripting improved incredibly fast.\n\nAfter that one PAINFUL hour, I really got into learning more about the main character, Matthew Baker, and the challenges he must face on the battlefield. And I have to give the developers credit for a really important aspect of the story's progression: character interaction. For once, in a really long time, I cared about the characters. This one particular scene in the game was so emotional, I actually started tearing up. Damn good job, THAT is proof that the developers cared about their characters. Games need to attribute human feelings to them, and this game is exemplary in that sense.\n\nOverall, the experience I had with playing the game was OK...\nPretty much the only thing that kept me going was the story's progression, I always wanted to know what would happen next. And I genuinely cared about the game's characters.\n\nHad this game not been rushed or simplified, it would've been a fantastic title.\n\nConclusion:\n6.5/10","January 22, 2015","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You also really need to use your head unlike simple run N gun gamleplay. To sum it up: graphics is impressively great for a six year old game, the storyline is really great. I won't say the gameplay is repetitive because it's so unique something you won't find in many other games (only in previous BIA's). The only remotely like games, in the sense of gameplay, I can think of are the Hidden & Dangerous series, which has really flawed squad tactical system, decent game though.

BIA HH continues where BIA:EiB left off. This is part 3 of 3\nSo you have Brothers in Arms Road to Hill 30, Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood, and Brothers in Arms Hell's Highway. Apparently there is a supposed to be a sequel but It got cancelled or something.\n\nOnto gameplay\nThe game is a FPS with squad control mechanics. If you played the other BiA you know what Im talking about. You setup your squad behind cover and try to flank the enemy. Only in this game they removed the Health system from the player, instead you have in place a sort of Aggro where when you start to build aggro your screen will turn red and then you will die when it turns too red. The AI do not try to flank you, as you are the one always trying to flank them.\nEvery now and then the game will zoom into an enemy you killed and show their deaths. eg grenade ripping them apart or a bullet ripping just a corner of the backside of their head. (Note I never saw anything like this in unreal I only ever saw head parts come off or heads explode in other games. Seeing parts of the head get removed instead of the entire thing makes this game unique. UBISOFT really put time and effort into this game.)\n\nThe weapons in this game are solid. You get Iron sights when you are not in cover and sadly Over the Shoulder sights when in cover. You can carry only 3 weapons with 1 always being the Colt 45 pistol. The weapons in the game are the MG42(You want to lay the most suppression? This is the gun for you) The M1 carbine, M1 Garand, M1 Thompson, M1928A1  Thompson, Kar43, Kar98, MP40, STG44, Panzerschreck, BAR, and the M3A1 Submachine gun.\n\nOn some of the levels you get to control a Sherman Firefly that has an MG and a 75mm cannon.\n\nI just finished this game, I will admit I cried for some of the characters. War is a terrible thing, but this shows what it does to some of the people in it.\n\nI definitely recommend this game.\nAlso as their should be a sequel due to To Be continued I think it was cancelled as it was about the time UBIsoft was working on ASSaSSins creed ;.;\n","March 13, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

COD 1 had a long campaign (unlike the ones now) and had a good story.  When I started up Brothers in Arms, the game looked amazing for a '08 game.  When I finally got to shoot a gun, the recoil felt amazing.  Unlike most games where recoil doesn't do much especially if you have a controller, this one even with controller makes it hard to control.  The story is actually really good.  The storyline does not glorify war like most games.  This game makes war feel bad. While there are a few funny parts, war can take a toll on someones mind.  Overall, I would give this a 9/10 so far.  Its a really good WWII, I just wish there were a couple more or update the previous games.","March 20, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Installing this was a great decision. I liked the how tactical the missions are rather than mindlessly shooting, it really starts to make you think when you are forced to restart because you carelessly got your squads wounded. Multi is dead, but it doesn't matter, the clear focus of this game was the single player. The single player campaign has nice characters and you really start the see the relationship each character has with another as you go deeper into the game.","August 21, 2013","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This is a fairly linear, old-school WW2 shooter, with a cool squad factor.  Beware of have far away you are and the path a squad might take though.  I've had them basically commit suicide by running through enemy lines, rather than behind something.\n\nYou are part of a glider team that lands in Holland sometime after D-day, and basically have to move forward and  clear out a lot of Nazis.  There is also an interesting back-story that unfolds, involving the main character's engraved .45 pistol.\n\nAs far as the game mechanics they are pretty much what you would expect with standard motions, weapons and shooting.  Strangely, there is no jumping, except for valting over a cover item.  If the game  recognizes an item as cover you can also vault it.\n\nAs far as the cover,  pressing Q benind a solid wall or other solid item like vehicles will put you in  in a temporary 3rd person cover mode, and you are crouched behind the cover item.  Using the arrows allows you to  move behind the cover or lean out to shoot.  This mode also give you a a much finer cross-hair for aiming, and a much steadier aim.   This is kind of  cool, but also has a  drawback, as you can' t control how far you lean out (or up if behind a wall).  So when shooting from cover you have to expose yourself to multiple enemies.   The method is to take fire until the view is starting to get pretty red, then go back into cover before dying-- and hopefully killing a Nazi or two in the process.  This is a little lame and would be much better if you could lean just enough to sight in on a single enemy, depending on the positioning.\n\nAnother really lame thing is that when sprinting you can't change direction very much with the mouse.  You can use A and D keys to kind of swerve--, but you basically have to stop sprinting to make a normal turn.  This is very weird to get used to, and I can't imagine what the  developers were thinking. Another weirdness is that while in cover and being flanked it is easy to get "stuck" to the cover.  The only way to get off is to move directly backwards, and that is easy to  forget when under fire.\n\nStill, in spite of these negatives, this is a pretty fun game, especially for the price.\n\nIf you think you would like an old-school, ww2, squad shooter with a decent story then skip a fast-food lunch and you'll have the cash for this game.  Bon Appetit.","February 6","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got WaW at the same time, I eventually hated WaW because of it's campaign being so terrible and Russian bias bs. But I actually loved the multiplayer even though all the weapons sucked. I actually preferred it over Brothers in Arms because it was so different. But then I played more of the game. I fell in love practically with BIA, it had a zing to it. It was different from all other shooters at that time. It had heart and wanted to give a lot to the player. I really related the game to Band of Brothers which was a war movie series made by Steven Spielberg. I felt the story in this long intense series was well deserved. It was upsetting that such a wonderful game has been left a cliff hanger for 8 years now. It is a great shame. But as of recent they announced the Battle of the Bulge and it will be coming sometime in spring next year. It is rumoured that it will happen but the company spoke of it. To end the series.\n\nI would give my left leg to finish this game. It was a near emotion roller coaster that was covered by great gun play and even better animation then WaW at the time. The multiplayer was fun on BIA and I actually enjoyed it. I really did. I truly felt it was fun realistic war simulation, but let's not go to far, the game is not ARMA. But the game had a lot of good physics and the engines were great back then, some how the graphics still hold up after all these years. I really think the game will look amazing if the next one comes, the fact is I would not be mad if the next had the same graphics. I loved this game either way. I just wish this game was not so underrated. If it came out before WaW it would of been really big and they may of had the final in 2010, but it was forgotten and that furious 4 trash was scrapped. But none the less.\n\nI love the game and I played it on a Xbone360 for the longest time and enjoyed it because it was a game that everyone enjoyed and loved to the death. It was a great game and sadly enough I was one of them kids who replayed his missions over but proudly. I was one person who would never stop loving this game and I think it did it's job in the name of gaming and showed us all that we should hold on to faith and there is a lot to see. It is a game about real troops, showing a American point of view in the war, and it is something to be proud of. It never shows German or British because it is not our business to show such. We only can see the gravity around us and watch them get shot.\n\nI will not spoil anything because some new comers still could be there and can still see a great game in action. I would be damned if I spoiled this game to anyone.\n\nSo, fathers, brothers, saints and sinners, play this game for a real man of WW2 collection.","December 13, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Loved it then...love it now. Terrific graphics and swell cover system. Make use of the squads you're afforded in each mission. Depending upon the mission they are a bazooka squad, assault squad, heavy infantry squad or macine gun squad. In each mission assigned you use them to you're best advantage moving them to flank your objective or you flank and let them provide covering fire.\n\nAs you progress and have the oppurtunity to work as a sniper (don't miss that sniper rifle in other missions as an option...comes up handy). Also a tank commander in several missions. Always fun to blast the living daylights out of stuff.\n\nSo if you're looking for some thing better than the old Medal of Honor or the older Call of Duty stuff this is a fun game.\n\nOh..did I mention a very engaging story line. I don't think it is necessary to know the whole backstory of the game series.

Multiplayer is permanently down forever because it uses gamespy, so it's only singelplayer. Story is decent, and you can control multiple squads. Only serious problem other than no multiplayer is the bindings. Mouse 2 isn't iron sights, it's squad direction and secondary tank fire. So if you want to change either, you have to change both. Happens with other keys as well.","January 31","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Matt Baker to blow some Nazi heads off. Using Unreal 3 and new cover-combat with your cover being shredded before your very eyes, this game looks and runs amazingly. If you like World War II shooters and/or tactical first-person shooters, then you will enjoy this game. With the intensity of WWII, commanding small squadrons, the power of firearms, the vulnerability against firearms, and the cinematic shots of the final opponent being blown up or shot in the head is an incredible experience that closely relates to the HBO series: Band of Brothers.\n\nIf you like action, drama, WWII experiences, tactical combat, challenging first-person shooters, and captivating stories, then look no further than Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway.\n\n+ Welcoming to newcomers of the series\n+ Captivating story\n+ Well rounded cast of characters\n+ Fantastic voice-acting\n+ Soundtrack\n+ Graphics and physics\n+ Cinematic moments in battle and cut-scenes\n+ Tactical combat\n+ Smooth shooting mechanics\n+ Destructible cover\n+ Easter eggs\n\n- Ending leaves more to be desired, literally","December 19, 2011","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the combat and the cover system which implements into the game very smoothly. Commanding your troops is Fluent and simple and they respond fairly well. This game is definitly worth the full price of $10 (thats how much it is where I am) or what ever price it is for you. If you arent sure but happen to see it on sale, buy it because its cheap and you will most likely love it.","June 6","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
