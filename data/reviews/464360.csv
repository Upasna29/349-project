Deathwar Redux puts an Indiana Jones/Rebel Galaxy spin on that, and brings in other kinds of mechanics to make the game interesting(the warp drive/fuel system, nebulas, keeping upgrades). It did a great job of being its own kind of game, yet still relates to other games i loved. so i give it an 8.5/10\n\n\nThat said there a few small things:\n\n-occasional sound bugs, music stops playing, SFX stop working\n-maybe i missed something, so this could be inaccurate, but i'd like to see more story with Kent and Vasquez\n-the game isn't skimpy on content, and story, but as an EV Fan, I'd like more story lines.\n\n\nAll in all, i enjoyed playing this game, and definitely recommend it to a like minded gamer(Read: loves EV like games)\n\nTo the Dev,\n\nyou created a great game, and you have a fun platform. I'd love to see how you expand on this story. I'll be back if you do.","May 2","true","16.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","2"

It may be in early access, but the game is complete and will only expand on what exist and get better during this period.\n\nThis game touch a few genres and make winks to classic cult movies and games with its tongue-in-cheek dialogues and encounters, and also making use of with its artwork. This last aspect may not be the finest but it really does it works portraying familiar worlds and characters. Here you can see aspects not only other great space sim games, but also from games of the adventure genre: the main character is an Indiana Jones wannabe and those colorful yet shady space stations will give you this bladerunneresque feel...\n\nEven if there are elements made with nostalgic purposes this is a game that stand on his own. It is well made technically, the fighting AI is great and provides you with a decent challenge, the fact that there several ways to earn money avoid grinding, the big open world encourages exploring, and the history is compelling and makes you want to play the next chapter to see how the plot evolve. Oh, and that soundtrack is a score! it is very varied, but it all sounds great. Sometimes adding to the retro half of the game and sometimes to the half futuristic.\n\nAnother aspect to take into account is that the devs are passionate and really eager for feedback and ideas to keep expanding the game.\n\nSo if you like old school spaceships, adventure or 2d games in general, this is a must have to your collection!","May 3","true","29.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

Ever since their release on itch.io (is that the right site?), this game has mesmerised me in how simple a space game can be but still have such a great depth. There is so much charm here, so much fantasy and comedy that just mixes in the perfect fashion.\n\nMy hours here on Redux are low for now, hoping that with all these great games coming out that I can still find the time to be in awe of this super simple, super deep space trading game.\n\nSo don't be discouraged by the tongue-in-cheek comedy or the seemingly crude artwork (the artstyle totally works, seriously give it some time!).\n\nDo it for yourself. Do it for space games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skatchnev/recommended/464360/","Skatchnev","Skatchnev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skatchnev/","89 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nVery enjoyable game from the get-go. I love the atmosphere and I love how the world progresses and feels like it evolves throughout, with headlines and news articles going on as things unfold around you, when in stations the seperate semi-visible other portions of the stations with vehicles and whatnot, and the intercom calling out new intakes of Stock and depertures etc. You can totally imagine this being a viable and real world and it's amazing.\n\nStory so far is pretty great, can't really say anything without spoilers but it's pretty interesting but sometimes it may be confusing as it ends up progressing whilst you're not doing "story missions" where sometimes it just does stuff as time goes on.\n\nSettings and whatnot are very good, for youtubers / streamers you can avoid the ballache of editing and copyright strikes from a basement dweller thanks to the devs including the option to disable copywrited tracks in the settings. And my personal favourite, you can check to turn of vocal music and only have instrumental, which I absolutely love and it makes the experience much better. Graphics options are plentiful for allsorts of various options and crap if your system has trouble processing some stuff.\n\nOnly negatives I can think of are the map is a little strange and doesn't auto-update nebula spots, you can't really set a course to an undiscovered star system, and also the scavenging mini-part is very short and I feel it would be really exciting to expand upon. Honestly haven't looked much/at all into the development so far so take this with a mound of salt, but the salvaging / inside of ship stuff would be super cool to have more details and exploration towards.\n\nCombat is very fun and basic, maybe be somewhat hard to figure out at first, and honestly battles seem to lean in favour of whoever can turn the hardest because if they can auto-manuever you you're pretty ♥♥♥♥ed, even in a pretty heavy ship, unless you got missiles or something. I stick with tiny ships haven't gone into heavy stuff much tbh.\n\nAside from that, a very fun game to hop into and play for a good few hours. I'd say honestly 7.5/10 But definately leaning towards more an 8-9/10 and especially when this becomes more improved in the future, I seriously can't wait it's been very fun so far, just feel the 'little things' are missing here and there. Maybe a more interactive environment or making the place seem more alive rather than the same few NPC's standing still in stations, explore inside derilicts / wrecks / ships / stations further, that sort of thing.","May 27","true","7.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

There are lot's of NPC's flying around in-space, bantering and moving around in stations which makes the game feel alive.  The artwork colorful and thoughtout, though for some sprites I felt that a finer grain of detail would be an improvement, but isn't really an issue that hurt my experience at all.  There's lots of stuff to do, from mining asteroids to doing courier missions, to bounty hunting pirates, to looting derelict spacecraft.\n\nI'm pretty satisfied with this game for the cost, so far I've sank in a few hours and it's been a lot of fun.  Looking forward to future updates.  Definitely recommend if you're looking for a fun space themed game.","May 5","true","9.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It has all the top-down real-time space stuff you could ask for in a large open-roam universe, trading, quests, combat and even some adventure. The trading is simple but well implemented, stuff is worth more in different systems and you can play the market to your benefit while steadily upgrading to bigger and bigger ships. The quests are also well-done with the usual variation, combat, delivey, discovery, salvage, mining, bounty-hunting, etc. The combat is like a souped-up version of Asteriod, control your momentum, dodge the enemy's bullets and missle while firing your own.\n\nThe games main strengths lie in its writing and its music. While every station is much the same format of bar, hanger, trade and job areas, each character you encounter (and there are so many) has a little dialogue tree and intresting things to say. In fact, the adventuring and dialogue trees are great in that they call back to old choose-your-own-adventure and point'n'click adventure games while meshing into the actual space-flying-around-part. Also the music is great, up-beat and catchy pop for flying around and suitable instrumental stuff for the adventure parts.\n\nThe main weaknesses of the game came from it's Early Access nature. There aren't as many resolutions as you'd hope, there's no option to change the controls from flying with the arrows to flying with WASD (a personal bugbear of mine) and some the story quests aren't as flexible as they should be. For example, in an early story quest somebody was gunning for me and, being out-gunned, I ran away to another system. I was then treated to a little pixel cutscene implying I killed the guy I ran away from.\n\nAll-in-all though, a solid, quirky game they may actually end up sucking away hours upon hours of your time.","April 29","true","0.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Maybe buy this.","May 28","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The atmospehre, mechanics  and visual all mesh really well and the game feels vast and highly enjoyable.","June 1","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
