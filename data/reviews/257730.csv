This is not a Magic the Gathering clone that keeps track of the numbers for you. This is not a simple basic TCG built around your favourite MMO mythos. This is an actual strategic masterpiece that requires use of both advanced planning and bluffing mechanics.\n\nIt is free to play, in the true sense of the word. At no point are you required to spend large amounts of money to get a collection started.  After two hours of the campaign, you should have enough cards to make a deck of any faction, and won a few free boosters along the way.  Meanwhile, you can acrue Infinity Points by playing, which are awarded win or lose.  You can then use these points to buy more boosters or enter the Rift Runs and win more cards! And there is a trading system already in place, so you can trade cards you do not want for those that you do without hoping to open the super mega mythic rare i-win card in a random pack!\n\nSo while your collection would certianly grow if you spend money on the game, it is not impossible to walk away with a complete playset of everything without spending a cent!\n\nThe point is, it's different to the other exciting games out there now, and risk-free and worth the look of anyone with even a passing interest in the TCG genre!\n","February 7, 2014","true","545.2"," 388 of 440 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","388","440","0","4"

Lots of interesting cards, various rather original factions with their own strategies and nicely animated cards. (EVERY CARD IS ANIMATED!) As for the free2play - well I never spent a dime on it and still had a lot of fun. You earn a decent amout of ingame currency just through the campaign, challenges and just normal games. Plus you get free cards and booster packs for wins and for levelups. It certainly could be better - but compared to basically every other online CCG on the market it's pretty good.","September 5, 2014","true","87.8"," 178 of 207 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","178","207","0","2"

Ive been hooked ever since. The little business card with the code advertised the game to me as having amazing animated cards, but it was the level of strategy in the game and unique mechanics which immediately grabbed my attention. Since then I have played ALOT and have still not yet gotten bored because every game is different. The cards and mechanics combo with each other in a way that rewards creative deck building and making bold and creative plays in game.\n\nThere is always alot of discussion around free to play and pay to win and everyone has their own perspective. I believe that this game is one of the more truely free to play games out there. This is for two good reasons...\n- First, I have built a full collection as well as pre-ordered many packs for the upcoming expansion and given away many cards including rares all while being almost entirely free to play. (I did purchase some alternate card backs/sleeves)\n- Second, certain cards are powerful and rare but extremely powerful decks are able to be built without any 'valuable' cards at all. The emphasis on player skill and in-game decisions means that this game could never be pay to win.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone interested in trading card games and would advise playing before comparing to other games like MTG and Hearthstone because Infinity Wars has many unique features and I believe a bright future!","February 9, 2014","true","919.8"," 161 of 187 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","161","187","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/critickitten/recommended/257730/","critickitten","CriticKitten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/critickitten/","94 products in account","If you want the short version, skip to the bottom.\n\nThe game is relatively fast-paced due to utilizing a simultaneous turns mechanic, with both players completing their actions at once.  This establishes a very engaging experience in which both players have to try and guess at what the opponent will do, and how to respond.  The game also allows for a great deal of strategy, utilizing both a "health" system akin to Magic or other TCGs, as well as a morale system (which effectively functions as a second health meter, except it drops from losing troops in battle), multiple combat zones, and an initiative system.  There is definitely plenty of depth to be had in this game.\n\nThe game is also very good about rewarding every portion of your progress.  There is a leveling system which gives you free cards when you level up, and you also get free cards from completing various achievements (termed "quests" in your profile window) such as beating the AI in training matches multiple times, completing the (very short) campaigns for each faction, and beating Academy challenges.  And the game even allows you to construct your own decks for facing off against players or AIs.\n\nSo why am I not recommending this game?  Well, I should be honest.  This is perhaps one of the first times I'm actually NOT recommending a game, it's simply not something I do often.  So I want to be perfectly clear: this game is fun, but there ultimately is one MAJOR flaw with its design structure.\n\nNo, before you say it, it's not that the game is Pay To Win.  On many occasions I actually beat players using mostly starter-level cards.  And some players have done quite a lot with their starter cards and worked hard to become top players.  But with that said, the community needs to be more honest with itself: newer, free players are definitely at an inherent disadvantage compared to players who have spent lots of time and/or money on the game.\n\nI'll try to explain, since that sounds like it may contradict what I said before.  Again, I'm not bashing the game, and it does make some effort to give you lots of cards to play around with.  But it's not nearly enough.\n\nIn my experience, completing every single campaign mission and PvE fight possible only leveled me to just below Lvl 9 (there are 50 levels).  So it's relatively clear the game is trying to encourage you to face other players.  I had no problem with this, so I started playing some matches against other people.  But I quickly began to realize there was a problem: they had WAY better decks than I did, filled with cards that were in many ways significantly better than mine....and I had no way to prevent them from beating me into the dirt, no matter how well I understood the game or how well I played.\n\nI can recall several matches in which I played my deck's strategy out perfectly, and even outplayed my opponent for the majority of the game, only to fall behind and eventually lose because they kept pulling out cards that I'd never seen before, cards I had no access to, and cards that I had no defense against.  And yes, I can tell the difference.  I played several folks who were just a lot better than me....but also a number of people who clearly were not, who ended up beating me anyways because their deck was full of cards I couldn't combat.\n\nI recall one particularly egregious match where my opponent was being repeatedly outplayed card for card.  Every time he made a move, I was predicting and countering it.  I got him down to a mere 5 HP, while I still had 86, and I had multiple creatures in play with Flying (he had nothing that could block Flying).  So imagine my surprise when he started employing cards that I'd never seen before, turned the match around within a few turns, and ultimately won.  Not because he was "better", mind you, but because he was using cards that I had never seen and had absolutely no hard counter for amongst all of the starter and booster cards I'd received from PvE content to that point.\n\nI made an honest effort at the Rift system, too, but ultimately it's got that same problem, but worse, because the players in that mode are clearly superior to the ones in normal queue matches.  The gap between a newbie and a veteran is simply too great to overcome, even if you get pretty good at the game relatively quickly as I did.\n\nNow, let me return to a previous point: the PvE content only gets you to around Lvl 8 or 9, which doesn't yield you nearly as large of a selection as you'd think in terms of cards to build your decks with.  And to make matters worse, while the game does allow you to buy booster packs for free (using an in-game currency obtained during matches), the booster packs are prohibitively expensive.  15 cards costs over 5k points....and running all of the PvE content in the entire game only netted me about 5.5k or so, and losing a PvP match nets you less than 100 points per match.  So in order to gain enough points to buy a 15-card booster pack, you have to effectively run over 50 regular PvP matches.  Which is by no means reasonable.\n\nI've seen former and current players who even admit to this being a major issue with the game, so I know I'm not imagining it.  One particular testimony came from someone who (at the time) was a Top 10 player.  He admitted that he got there by spending lots of real money to build a good deck, and after that, he was beating people right and left.\n\nSUMMARY: No, the game isn't technically P2W.  You can earn cards for free if you have the patience.  But if you purchase cards with real money, you are saving yourself countless hours of grinding, and you ultimately WILL perform much better than you would have if you'd tried to play with just the freebie cards that the game gives you.  No amount of personal skill or TCG experience can overcome the significant gap in deck strength between a veteran and a new player.\n\nYou will either pay for better cards, or you will have to grit your teeth and lose a *lot* of matches in order to earn them for free.  I chose the third road: After several matches against opponents that I should have beaten, but instead lost to, I finally gave in to my frustration, closed the game, and uninstalled it.  The core game is a lot of fun, but it's mired in the "grind" of obtaining new cards and the game's significant balancing issues.  If the above stated issues are resolved at some future point, I might be persuaded to return at that time.  For now, it's a no-go for me.\n\n\n\nEDIT (Nov 4): The game is effectively dead at this point.  The devs are still trying to update the game to the best of my knowledge, but the player base has declined dramatically since I first posted this review.  There are very few people still playing this game at this point, meaning your queues will be longer and you'll be seeing the same opponents even more often than I was back in January when I wrote this review.  At this point, you're better off investing your time and money into one of the card games that's still going strong, like Hearthstone, than spending it here.\n\nIt's a shame, too, as I had hoped the game would turn itself around and I might be able to reverse this review one day.  But it seems they never did, or at least, they never improved enough that they felt compelled to try and bring people back.  So I'm pretty much calling this review finished, and I likely won't update it any more beyond this point.","January 18, 2015","false","20.8"," 199 of 255 people (78%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","78","199","255","9","25"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lolisauce/recommended/257730/","lolisauce","LoliSauce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lolisauce/","183 products in account","To give a little perspective on my opinion, here's a quick brief on me.  I come from a game design background, having gone to an art school for it.  I played TCGs heavily for a period and followed competitive play of friends, which led to a big interest of card game R&D.  I also had a half decade of national-level competitive fighting game play that defined my love for the mental aspect of any competitive game.\n\nWith those things in mind, I love games that introduce new concepts into a genre and take great care in implementing them well.  To my great pleasure, this is exactly what Infinity Wars has accomplished.\n\nTaking full advantage of the digital format of the game, Infinity Wars has incorporated a few huge advantages over the average card game:\n1. Simultaneous turns.\n2. Deck commanders.\n3. Animated card art.\n4. A non-exploitative Free-To-Play business model.\n\n-1-\nSimultaneous turns is my personal favorite addition into the genre that really makes a massive change in the dynamics of a turn.  It serves two major purposes.  First, it reduces down time while waiting for your opponent to play through their turn, which keeps both players a lot more active while playing and speeds up games to a degree.  Second, it enforces a major element of prediction over reaction.  What your opponent may play and how you want to play spells or move/rearrange your creatures is always an important part of the flow of battle and ultimately who wins.  In addition, there is an initiative that swaps between players each turn that allows one player's spells and attacks to resolve first.  Simply put, this one feature puts Infinity Wars on a completely new level compared to all other card games, and I absolutely love it.\n\n-2-\nCommanders also serve two important purposes.  First, the faction of each commander determines what cards you're able to place within that deck.  Having 3 different factions in command gives you a lot of options, whereas three of the same faction gives you access to all tiers of cards within that faction.  Second, the commanders are simply extra playable cards from the same list of cards you would build the deck from, yet they exist outside of the limitations of the deck.  For example, setting up a deck with commanders that cost 1, 2, and 4 cost cards, when you know your deck has a majority of 3 cost cards gives you a huge advantage in the reliability of your first few turns.  It would allow you to simply play your command creatures if you didn't have anything better in your hand, helping to you overcome the inherent randomness of card games.  Command creatures also count as being in play, allowing you to use character abilities from the command zone, yet also being slightly at risk to creature removal in the process.  Interestingly, the command setup often broadcasts what to expect from the opponent, so that both players understand what they're roughly up against.  It's simply a wonderful concept all around.\n\n-3-\nA major marketing point for the game itself is the animated card art.  Now, having come from an art school, I can tell you that a lot of the early card animations were very rough.  Flash-esque element manipulation, simple things like colors glowing in and out, etc.  With each consecutive set, though, the quality of art and animation has simply skyrocketed.  The next set's card previews left me in awe and craving more.  And despite a tremendous amount of time and effort going into each card's art, they don't skimp on the amount of content that each set delivers.  That, to me, is truly impressive, especially considering the they're such a small team.\n\n-4-\nAnd finally we reach their business model.  Now, I have to admit I really dislike what the free to play model has become in the current gaming climate.  It often encourages a lot of exploitation of the player, detracting from their fun as much as possible without actively pushing away players, in order to influence addictive spending.  Much to my relief, Lightmare has not only eliminated the biggest pitfalls of free to play design (the pay-to-win stuff), but also actively rewards free players by allowing cards purchased with the in-game currency to be tradeable with others.  They also have a rudimentary master and apprentice system that rewards both players with free cards for playing together.  It even incorporates a very rewarding draft mode that allows players who manage good runs to get high rarity free cards and even potentially receive their whole draft deck for free.\n\nThe only reason the game doesn't receive a 10/10 is that the game is still fairly new, and has a number of planned updates that are absolutely necessary to eliminate a lot of bugs, open it to more playable platforms, and expand on the overall longevity of the game.  As those are incorporated, I can confidently say that the game will grow to be be the best possible card game I can imagine.\n\nThanks for reading along, and I hope you join us all in the wonderful experience it offers.","October 26, 2014","true","287.9"," 139 of 172 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","139","172","4","4"

It has simultaneous turns (which means, you and your opponent decide at the same time what to do, so it has much more pace than eg. MTG DOTP and triggers many more mind games)\n\n2. It has different zones of play:\n- Command (where you put the cards you build your deck around, also they define the pool of cards you can include in your deck)\n- Support (where your creatures you just played are placed due to summoning sickness, you can also pull already in play creatures back to it in order to dodge spells affecting ATK and/or DEF zone)\n- Attack and Defense (The two players decide at the same time, if they want to attack OR defend)\n\n\n3. It has different modes:\n- Infinite (you can play every card that has ever been "printed")\n- Ranked (it takes a while to be playable for a beginner, you play a best-of-three with a sideboard to get a better rank that provides special cards at the end of each season, also some cards are restricted)\n- Pauper (every card BELOW rare is allowed [there are common, uncommon, rare, epic and legendary])\n- Draft (you pick one out of four cards 40 times [plus the command zone picks], it's not really recommendable for a start but incredible fun if you know the pool a bit)\n\n4. Each day you get a reward for logging in and for playing three games (those can be common cards up to legendaries, it can be any card in game)\n\n5. Every card is obtainable without spending any real money\n\n6. The cards are like GIFs, with nice artwork and all do have an animation to admire\n\n7. The new campaign mode provides many essential cards for further deck building for free just for crushing bots\n\n8. It has a win option that eg MTG does not have: reducing the so-called Morale of the opponent. It has 100 points, just like the "normal" health bar and can be reduced by killing enemy creatures.\n\n9. Last but not least: the community is just great. I've played more than 1000 matches and i was insulted ONCE, true story. Also the Lightmare Forums are really recommended here, where people can exchange about eg. deck building, certain card mechanics and also are able to have direct contact with the Lightmare Staff, who always answer every single (yeah really) question [thx Teremus btw].\n\n\n\nSo.. What's actually bad about IW?\n\n1. Cards obtained from Log In Reward or LVL UP boosters are not tradable. Only the ones you bought with IP (you also gain them by just playing fortunately) and the ones you won in draft. There is no forging system or else [yet].\n\n2. There are some bugs sometimes, that can make one really angry tbh. But the LM staff is quite aware of those and does bug fixes regularly.\n\n3. Cards you do not own yet are not displayed.\n\n4. It can take some time to gain a booster from IP in the beginning.\n\n5. The saddest point: the community is not that big yet. Though I'm quite sure the community will become bigger, because the game is just awesome and one can see the effort Lightmare puts into it.\n\n\n\nFinally I have to say: for people who don't play TCGs usually: give it a try at least. It's obv the most exciting and challenging TCG there is atm (admittedly I never played Hex).\nFor people playing MTG/HS or else: this game has a unique playstyle, it's more modern than MTG (you don't depend on drawing islands), it's more challenging than HS: join the community already, what are you waiting for? :D","June 23, 2015","true","240.0"," 66 of 80 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","66","80","2","5"

Long review ahead.\n\nMost people view reviews to see if the game is worth their time so I will give my opinion on that.\n\nTo begin, first and foremost about game optimization.\nYou are required to make an account on the game's platform, which can be done through the main menu quickly without need to confirm or verify or anything such. Aside that the game crashed once while I was playing it after 6 hours, but reconnect was instant and I didn't lose anything. It also crashed when I hit the quit button but it quitted normally in some seconds.\n\nNoteworthy I really like the artwork of the game. Every card is basically a good quality gif of anything from primeval creatures to alien demon entities in a serious anime style(actually very close to Attack on Titan animation if you ask me) which I personally like.\n\nSecondary and most important, if you have experience with other TCG games you will probably like this as it combines many interesting features and comes out as an innovative title. It may be weird, unbalanced, easy to lose track but these qualities apply to most leading TCGs currently(YGO/MTG etc) as long as you are not familiar with them.\n\nTo give some insight into the gameplay, without analyzing the strategies or the cards(yet):\nYou have a deck of 40 cards(by default) of creatures and abilities, the creatures have a mana cost, attack and defense values, and their own effects, while abilities sport their own mana cost for their effect. By default the mana progresses simply like hearthstone.\nDisclaimer: I am pretty sure that it's not called mana in the game but just Resource but it is easier for me to type it and reference it this way.\nSo every player starts at 1 mana(resource-bah) and they get 1 per turn capping at 10 to play their cards with. The creatures funtcion like Hearthstone as well, as in their health does not regenerate after combat and any changes to their stats usually remain put if increased by an effect. Worth noting that killing a creature that boosts the health of others can result to the death of other creatures(as in MTG) something that does not happen in Hearthstone. So this seems pretty basic but the core gameplay is where it takes a twist.\n\nEvery player has 4 zones, the Support Zone, the Assault Zone, the Defense Zone and the Command Zone(if I get any name wrong plz don't flay me). When you "play" a creature it appears in your Support Zone, acts as if it has entered the battlefield and is subject to effects of your and enemy creatures(but not spells yet). It cannot swap zone at the same turn. On your turn you can indefinitely move creatures from your Support Zone to either the Defense or the Assault Zone(you can also indefinitely swap them). When you have done so and played any spells if any both players click ready and each player's Assault Zone tries to beat the other player's Defense Zone, in a fashion of the leftmost card attacks first.\nYou can change the row in which your creatures attack which is very important in the game. A tricky part is that abilities constantly update. If my 4/4 that gets +2/+2 when an enemy dies kills the enemy's attacking 2/2, its ability procs and it becomes a 6/4 evidently tanking an infinite amount of 2/2s. And such abilities exist in abundance in the game.\n\nA versatile part is you can retreat everything you have back to the Support Zone again indefinitely. There is no limit to how you move stuff you have already summoned so if you suspect your enemy is about to bomb you you can massive retreat and such. Many cards heal/boost the ones adjacent to them every turn and keeping these in Support Zone is the ideal way to activate their effects.\n\nThe last and most interesting zone is the Command Zone. Kinda familiar with how commanders work in MtG, from your deck you pick 3 cards to put in your Command Zone. Any cards. They are not subject to targeting abilities but they are subject to area of effect spells(boosts or damages), their passive/active abilities can trigger and if you pay their cost you can instantly put them in your Assault or Defense Zone. The possibilities with that are endless.\n\nThe winning condition is, two winning conditions by default which has never been done in TCGs I have seen before. By that I mean that every player has 2 bars not one, Health and Morale. Health is the damage when you get attacks while undefended(or when enemies slip past your defenses) and Health is 100/100 when most creatures start with attacks between 4-8, however that does not make the games longer as pretty much anything ends up boosting itself. Morale is again a 100/100 bar. Every creature has a morale cost, which is how much morale you lose if the creature dies. If your Morale or Health drop to 0 or less, you are ded. Since combat happens at the same time for both players however it's very easy to do draws, with both players putting nothing on defense and going for the face.\n\nThe campaign(8 missions per each of the 8 game factions, makes sure you reach Level 7(You can play online after 4 and Ranked after 10), and it also makes sure you get the basic cards of every faction, try some premade decks while at it and get some extra packs of pre determined cards and 1 random booster per level.\n\nSpeaking about the campaign here is a faction overview:\n-The Red Dawn Army(Red Colour) a lighter version of Warhammer's space marines that try to blitz their enemies out or boost their own stats for quick attacks.\n-The Genesis Industries(Blue Colour) a faction utilising Droids that boost each other and Artifacts that have good active abilities while they stay in your Support or Command Zones.\n-The Warpath(Green Colour) the big huge bulky high mana cost trampling creatures(nothing impressive but their art is very nice and cute).\n-The Awakened of Avarrach(Yellow Colour) a horde of robot zombies that focuses on its creatures constantly dying which boosts everything else they have and/or killing enemy creatures with effects that transport them to your Support Zone rather than the enemy's graveyard.\n-The Verore Cult(Purple Colour) your everyday evil wizard researchers that bomb the enemy creatures with spells while their own creatures grow stronger the more spells you cast sitting in their Support Zones.\n-The Exiles(Pink Colour) literally a faction that references Warhammer again being what you would expect from Tzeentch's demons. They focus on Exile X keyword which means if you discard a card and then pay X something happens(usually that card coming back as a stronger demon tentacle abomination).\n-The Dragon Descendants(Teal Colour) are a gimmicky monk like race with cool animations that remind the Avatar series that focus on defending and healing to destroy your enemy's Morale.\n-The Overseers(White Colour) my favorite faction*reasons* that consist of anime-like busty angels with blazing halos and pistols outfitted in tight swimsuits(there are also some unsettling male cards) and well, just every single gif from this faction's collection is epic on its own specific way. Their specialty is death from above.\n\n\nFor those who just want to check this out, play the campaign and explore the innovation, I definitely recommend it. If you are experienced with TCGs you will like it or at least give it credit for being brave to do stuff like that, if you are not into TCGs I am sure you will find it confusing but the Tutorial is there and every card explains what its ability keyword means the first time you look at it. The story has some considerable plot as well!\nVery Recommended(7.7/10)","November 14, 2014","true","178.2"," 63 of 78 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","63","78","0","1"

Now, it is like almost all other free to play games in almost all respects—you have to pay to play and it’s full of promises that are never delivered.\n\nI have sunk a considerable amount of time in this game and have heard and read a lot about debated topics and other babble from the developers, so this short review has a good foundation. To start, I will list the cons, which dwarf all pros in such a way, now, that it’s hard to even fathom why I got hooked on this game in the first place.\n\nThere are very few events that would equate to something like a double xp weekend in most games. When I say few, I really just mean one major one, which they called golden ticket weekend/ week. This only happened once some time last year—mind you, I have been playing this game off and on for almost two years. Also, from what I have heard, there may have been an increased IP (game currency) weekend once or twice since its inception, but I didn’t even notice it because the bonus was so small.\n\nHaving something like double IP weekends or more golden ticket weekends would give the game a bit of an edge because you would have something to look forward to. I must say though, at the start, it seems you do have things to look forward to. For instance, I used to look forward to getting a free pack of cards when I leveled up. However, when you reach level 40 or 50, the free packs stop, and you get to level 40 or 50 in this game pretty quickly. That all said, even if they started to put more bonus IP weekends and the like in the game, it still wouldn’t be enough to make it a worthwhile game.\n\nAdditionally, there are several bugs, and they are extremely annoying ones that have been around since the start of the game. The most annoying one to me is trying to actually trade a card with someone. If you are able to get a trade session going on the first try, consider yourself lucky. For me, trading is the most important aspect of a “trading card game”. If you complain to devs about it, they will say, “We will be getting new servers soon.” But their definition of soon is going on years and is probably really never.\n\nAnother bug(s) is that there are a number of card glitches that have been around since its inception that really affect gameplay dramatically. For instance, my favorite card "Tome of the Dead" (a fairly powerful card for the sleeper faction) often times freezes the current match when its ability procs. Also, on top of this, they frequently make ninja changes to various cards and, also, take them out of play with no warning. Like right now, a few cards have been “temporarily” disabled for the past two months because they are supposedly not working as intended.\n\nThe few expansions they have had for the game has done very little for actual gameplay. If anything, it has gotten worse with each expansion. The same cards continue to be way superior to others, they don’t think about trying to make weak cards stronger (and more desired) with the additional cards and their effects, and their way of trying to balance the game for each expansion is nerfing the heck out of cards that you have more than likely paid good, real money for. For instance, if you are at all familiar with the game, Demon of Fear and Shikana were once great cards but now are pretty much obsolete with most deck builds. Yes, some changes are expected, but many changes and drastic ones, like these, should not happen, especially with a pay to play game. This approach, ultimately, has ruined all metagame and made the game quite boring. Basically, you are stuck with only a few deck builds that are viable for ranked play.\n\nThey have been selling the same premade decks of cards since day one. Therefore, all cards in those decks have pretty much no value. Anyone who buys those decks are really wasting their money. On top of that, they arbitrary rotate each deck to be on sale, which is extremely annoying to me for some reason. Why don’t they offer a small pack of random foil or gold cards of a certain faction (or of all factions) or even arbitrarily create small packs that have a higher chance of having a certain rare card? They also have the same cheesy avatars, card backs, and battlegrounds since day one. It’s aggravating because I know they could throw in a 1000 avatars in the game easily. They could also up the avatar rewards.\n\nWeekly quests are a joke. They can be completed in an hour. These quests used to, at least, give out foil cards if you completed them. Now, I know they don’t give foil cards like they used to anymore, and I don’t even think weekly quests even work currently. I’d have to check.\n\nNo one wants to trade. This is because, for instance, one gold foil aleta card is worth more than 200 regular rare, epic, and/ or most legendary cards combined. So, being dead honest, trading is obsolete by the time you hit level 20. Once you have the cards for a deck you want, which is pretty easy to do, the next step is getting those pretty, shiny cards. Though, there are only two ways to do this: you can either buy them with real money on some illegitimate site through PayPal (or through eBay ) for a crap ton of money, or you can swindle newbs as they are trying to build their deck (this is way harder to do, however). I once tried getting a particular card this way and I literally spent two months in trade chat looking for a particualr gold-foil rare card and, finally, gave up because I was unable to even find someone who even had it. What is disturbing, however, is that the devs seem to promote this behavior by letting players advertise and auction off cards on their website forums. As dubious as this may sound, I truly believe devs withhold cards in game so they could sell them on their forums for outrageous prices through some alias.\n\nPlayers say that you may find gold-foil cards, which are the most rare kind of cards other than platinum-foil cards in preorder packs, in packs of cards or doing rift runs, but I have bought well over 500 packs of cards with real currency and (mostly) ingame currency and played countless rifts since the game has released and have yet to see one in any pack or for any reward. So if you are wanting to try this game out for the trading aspect of this “trading card game” keeping in mind the dificulty and the severe rarity of decent cards that card collectors would want, don’t unless you are willing to dish out some serious cash and put up with the numberous bugs.\n\nMoreover, this game still lacks player base, and it is due to the issues I have brought up so far.\n\nThere are several other issues with this game, such as their idea of adding new factions while dropping old ones. However, right now, I don’t even think this game is worth writing a good review for…even a bad one.\n\nAnyway, I’ll come back to edit this at a later time perhaps. (update 9/9/2015: most problems still exist and more have been added. If the game ever gets better, I will change the state of this review.)\n\nUpdate 11/15/2015: The game is still in a state of decay, and Devs have completely abandoned the game--will update if they decide to return.","April 25, 2015","false","844.1"," 163 of 238 people (68%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","68","163","238","11","16"

It's something most digital card games could have, but only few actually seem to do. heh, and effects like having cards with flying ability float... it really breathes that extra bit of life into those card games.\n\n\nAs for the game itself, it's pretty straightforward. There was this youtube tutorial... but I totally skipped it. I'm not fond of video tutorials, rather have a written guide. But neither was necessary, it just takes a few rounds and a test build deck to figure out how things work.\nThere's also a few tutorial matches you can play to learn the ropes.\n\nGameplay;\nThis is a multifaction cardgame; meaning that, much like MtG with their different elements, this game has different factions. And ofcourse each has their own way.\n\nThe way you choose your factions is by giving creatures of that faction a commander position. This allows them to be on the table and use abilities, but they're not directly on the battlefield. Some cards seem to need more than one commander and only a max of 3 commanders allowed, so for the really powerful stuff you'll need to choose.\n\nResources on the other hand are automatically added; rather than needing resource cards, you get incremental RP each turn in the game.\n\nThe "battlefield" consists of a commander field, support field, and combat zones (defense/offense).\nYou can freely move your creatures around each turn, even their attack order can be sorted. Support field is where you can place creatures outside combat, it's also where most creature cards start.\n\nPlayer turns go in 2 sections; preparation and turn resolve.\nBasically, each player prepares a set of moves, and then that turn is set into motion.\nRather than turn based and being able to interrupt the other players' turn to use instant abilities, they have to be prepared up front. This does make it harder than waiting for the right card, you also need to be sure your target will become or will stay available when you aim for them.\n\nApart from PvP, there's also a campaign available. It's best to start off there with the first few levels of each campaign, as you get a starter pack from each one.\n\n-\n\nI haven't been playing much yet, so I can't say much about the balancing issues some people have been talking about.\nEither way, as this is still a beta, I'm sure eventually the whole set will get balanced eventually.\n\nAll'n all, it's been pretty good so far.","April 5, 2014","true","8.2"," 48 of 60 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","48","60","0","5"

Most of the times there is only one play which makes sense. So it becomes rather dull after some games.\n\nSolforge was fun, but after the release of new Cards (looking at you duskmaw,Bramblewoodtracker,Rage and Broodqueen)\nI started to dislike it.\n\nWell to get to the Point. i saw an Trailer about Infinty Wars and got interested and started playing it.\nAfter nearly 2 week now im doing a little resume of what i experienced.\n\nGood Things:\n- A Campaign which tells you a bit about the lore of infinty wars and how the game work in generally. Completing the campaign grants cards for each faction. These freely granted cards are competive and are a foundation for every deck.\n\n- Legendary cards have the same power level as Common or Uncommon Cards. Legendarys are often more flashy or highly expensive lategame cards. But are not clearly better versions of an common or uncommon.\n\n- You have many options in every turn. thinking about 1 or 2 minutes for planing a turn is pretty normal.\n\n-Cards have an Animation.\n\n-Nice Background Music\n\n-Skill is a huge factor in the game. Both players plan on the same time, then their action resolve at the same time.\nWhich means you must guess what your opponent is up to.\n\n-has an Draft Mode (Called Rift run). Which allows you to Construct an Deck from Random Cards. Same Chances for everyone. The entry fee of an Rift runs seems fair.\n\n-A Trading system, You can trade every card which you did get from boosters or which you did win in an Rift Run.\nYou dont have to pay in real money for it. Cards in ingame currency are also tradeable.\n\n-No Pay to Win. Everything is accessible  with ingame currency and Real Money\n\n-Free  Cards for logging in , leveling up, and playing 3 games each day.\n\n-An Ingame Ladder for Ranked games\n\n-Ranked Games are best of 3\n\n-In Ranked Games you have an sideboard. This means countering popular decks is possible. This also means its less likely to just have one dominant deck\n\nBad Things\n\n-If you have many units on the field targetting gets rather complicated.\n\n-You cant see cards which you dont own. So you must rely on other sources on the web to see cards you dont own\n\n-Some small bugs and wording errors.\n\n-There is no Gamelog.  So cant resume and analyse a game afterwards.\n\n-Some Animation could look better. Like when all characters attack for example\n\n-Would be cool if some of the unique cards had some special sounds when summoning them. (Like in Hearthstone)\nSo when you summon that big scary Demon Lord , there should be some kind of Sound effect.\nOr if u change the Location of the Battfield the Background soundtrack should change.\n\n\n\n\nSummary: The graphic and sounds of Infinty Wars are good, but Hearthstone shows that there is still some room to\nimprove in that regard. Gameplay wise on the other side its the best Card Game i played so far.\n\n\n","February 17, 2015","true","163.2"," 62 of 84 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","62","84","0","3"

You do need to put together a card collection, but I'm having no trouble doing so just by leveling up, quests and daily log-in bonuses.  And then putting together different decks and trying them out is a blast. Lots of combinations.  And if you don't have a deck you like, they offer weekly decks you can use to compete with that are strong.

It's addictive, wether you count that as good or bad. And as someone who played Yu-gi-oh and MTG for about 6 years, I can say that this is the best TCG I've ever played. So this is my perspective as a diehard fan and avid player.\n\nPros:\n\n- It's free to play. Not much more to say there.\n\n- The Card art is phenomenal. Each one is fully animated (as seen in the trailor) and the artists do a fantastic job taking          their time on each one to make them perfect.\n\n- The playstyle is unique and innovative. Simultaneous turns is perhaps my favorite part about this game, and what seperates from every other TCG I've played. It allows for players to use a prediction skill and creates the most skill-based plays and combos you can imagine.\n\n- The community is fantastic. Players are helpful towards one another and the devs who hang around in the global chat do a wonderful job making sure new players are fitting in and having a good time.\n\n- There is a quest system where you can unlock achievements for winning games, or even just playing a lot. These quests have reward cards and other vanity items to make yourself look way more pro when you play. Which, at least to me,  is really awesome.\n\n- There is extensive lore behind the game and the factions within (as seen in the trailor, there ar several factions that you can think of as  "types" of cards in yu-gi-oh or "colors" in magic). The lore is well written and the community writes fanfiction for it all the time on the game's forums. https://www.infinitywarsgame.com/#!/\n\n- There is a great set of campaigns for each faction that allows you to get a starter deck for that faction to play with and adapt.\n\n- Lightmare has recently implemented a system of weekly free decks that players can use without having to actually own the cards. This is great for new players who want to develop strategy and see new ideas, or even for older players to just have some fun.\n\n- There are already several fantastic sets of cards available for purchase at the store with in-game currency or irl money, as well as starter decks preorders when applicable. New sets are released regularly and are heavily hyped with previews and sample cards given as rewards proceeding the release.\n\nCons:\n\n- Not a whole lot of players yet, or at least not as many as this game deserves. This can lead to taking a few minutes to find a game sometimes,  especially when you reach higher rankings, though I have never taken more than 3 minutes to find a game myself.\n\n\n\nNow for some other info that will only matter for a couple weeks. From november 21st to december 12th the preorders are available for the new set, Order.  On the weekend of the 28th-1st, there will be a double IP/XP weekend. So, if you were thinking about joining this game, now is probably the best time to do it.\n\nLastly, Teremus, the community manager for this game (also known as the beloved/dreaded Terror Moose) streams this game very every saturday.  In particular, during this double IP/XP weekend he will be streaming with another dev and some of the top players of the game to review some unseen cards from the new set, Order. On regular saturdays, he just messes around with the community and plays for fun, and he's always willing to help people out. If you don't know how you feel about this game yet, I encourage you to check his stream out on saturdays. http://www.twitch.tv/infinitywarstcg\n\nThat's just about it for me. I fully and wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes TCGs. 10/10. Enthusiatic thumb-up.  5 star quality. However you wanna say it, it's amazing.","November 25, 2014","true","816.3"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","26","33","4","2"

Unfortunately it is plagued with problems and I am getting tired of waiting for it to get better.\n\nCard balance is terrible; there are 8 factions,  yet every single competitive deck has at least a splash of Cult of Verore. I can understand why, they have all of the direct kill spells, and a very easy board wipe that has no counter play. Sorry, when you bring up that Mass Death has no counter play, the designers of the game say "just don't attack or defend from turn 6 onwards", thanks for the advice. This game's card balance is one of the worst out of all the tcgs, you just see the same decks with the same cards over and over again.\n\nThe user interface is buggy and slow. It is often impossible to understand what is going on due to being unable to click on cards to see their text. Games drop out often or just flat out stall, leaving you to have to forfeit a game to be able to load a new one. I highly doubt that the game will ever be optimised to be able to run on a tablet like they have claimed, the game is just too much of a memory sink.\n\nAbilities and cards do not operate how their text is written, you often have to play a test game when you get a new card just to figure out what the designers mean. The timing of how cards operate is never logical. If you are playing against an opponent with a card you have never seen before, you have to loose to that card just to see what it does. When a new set comes out, the process of learning the mechanics of a whole bunch of cards happens again. You could look all the new cards up, but what is written on the card doesn't always represents what happens in the game. The latest set Ascension has some terrible offenders: Anti-Air Array kills incoming flying creatures, but those creature still do combat damage from the graveyard, the card Descension turns a creature into a demonic dragon, but has the Consume ability, despite not being mentioned anywhere on the card. I haven't played against all the new cards yet, who knows how exactly they all work.\n\nLastly I am going to talk briefly on the very touchy subject of pay-to-win. I don't know what you may consider pay-to-win, but I am going to only consider the most basic interpretation, that if you pay money, you will get an advantage in game. OK, so I was about two weeks into playing daily, I had got the hang of the game and started to play competitively. I stalled out at about 800 rank due to the people I was playing having better decks. I figured I had to get some better cards. I couldn't trade cards because the free cards you get aren't tradeable. I could buy a booster using winnings from playing games, but that takes about 47 games at a 50% win rate. I eventually relented and spent some real world dollars. OMG, literally overnight I went up to 1100 rank. Within the week I was sitting at 1450. I'm now starting to slow again and I have to decide if it is worth spending more money to remain competitive, especially with a new set with all new powerful cards that I can't afford.\n\nInfinity Wars is a good game, with unique gameplay and plenty of strategy. But for a game that is nearly finished its beta, it doesn't feel even close to ready.","June 18, 2014","false","95.8"," 44 of 68 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","44","68","2","3"

People that complain about it being one either didn't play enough or are just salty about not being good with the mechanics of this game.  I would actually argue that it is a bit too easy to obtain cards in this game without really paying anything.\n\nThe draft mode makes it incredibly easy to obtain cards and it's not difficult at all to at least break even, given that you are at least somewhat decent at the game.  This makes me wonder how Lightmare plans on staying in business when they give away cards so freely through the various rewards.\n\nWith that said, this tcg does have a very different spin from the other more classic card games and is not quite to my liking.  The simultaneous turn is interesting but the mindgame it provides causes some imbalance between the factions and may cause some frustrating gameplay experiences.\n\nThe community for this game feels like it's full of elitist card gamers that are too cool for other more mainstream games.  Overall my experiences with my opponents have been mostly negative due to bad manners.  Regardless, I am fairly impressed with the community manager's passion for this game and I would recommend this game eventually when and if it does become more balanced.  For now the small elitist community itself and the somewhat mediocre balancing is keeping me away from this game.","March 15, 2014","false","128.9"," 89 of 149 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","89","149","0","5"

It kicks MtG and other cards games (Hstone) butt by far.\n\nOverview\nThis is a Free game that manages to give a balanced and challenging experience while avoiding P2W (Pay to Win) altogether. It also has a great community of players, moderators and developers, who get in touch with you to help you out right from the start if you need it.\n\nPros:\n+ It's Free! You can play this game for free, or you can choose to spend some bucks on it to get more cards. Even if you don't want to spend real money, you can still get the same cards by playing and earning in-game free currency, or by trading cards with other players.\n\n+ Real TCG. There's a reason TCG are called that way, Infinity Wars lets you trade your spare cards to get the ones you want, be it for building a better deck or just to complete your collection.\n\n+ Animated cards! Each and every last one of the cards is animated. I dare you to find another free online card game that offers you the same (100% animated cards). Not only that, the artwork is just amazing, professional artists work on this game and the quality is superb.\n\n+ Competitive, challenging and balanced gameplay. Infinity Wars has many factions you can play with, they are all balanced and they can all beat each other in many (I really mean it: many!) different ways. The amount of strategies and combinations is endless, and two people using the exact same deck can still use the cards in very different ways to win.\n\n+ Good card collection starting. When you make an account and start playing, after you go through the tutorials (Training and Academy), you can play the Campaign, and you'll be rewarded with an entire pre-made deck of each faction when you complete each campaign. Not only that, you get a free 15-cards booster each time you level up. As if that wasn't enough, you can complete quests to get even more cards, and you also get a free daily card just for logging in, and another daily card after playing three games. It's incredible the amount of cards this game gives you for free.\n\n+ Store. When you play you win free in-game currency which you can spend on the in-game Store to get more cards. You can also spend real money if you want, either to get more cards or to dress up your battlefield and decks.\n\nCons:\n- Some minor bugs that are still being worked on (in fact there's a patch coming tomorrow as I write this, so you can see it's actively being worked on). These are not a huge problem, and after some patches nowadays they are hardly noticeable at all. I expect to see them all gone in the future, not only because I've seen patches actually 'work' when it comes to fixing bugs, but I've also talked to some of the developers myself and they listen to what you have to say if you want to report a bug.\n\n- Addictive, you'll find yourself wanting to play moar and moar. You have been warned.\n\nSeriously, there's hardly anything bad I can say about this game, it's that good. Otherwise I wouldn't have give them a 10 score.\n\nConclusion (rating: 10/10):\nIf you like TCGs, if you have ever played MtG in real life and miss the feeling it gave you the first time you played it, then you NEED to play Infinity Wars. It's a rock-solid card game, and the sooner you start playing it, the happier you'll be.","October 29, 2014","true","012.1"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","24","34","0","0"

I like it better than Magic or Hearthstone.  The simultaneous turns, attacka and support lanes, 3 "commander" cards (aka 3 cards you guarantee to have playable, dont need to draw), make this game have incredible depth.\n\n-You can trade cards wiith other players - really good.  I hate how in Hearthstone I can only disenchant.\n\nThe superficial, but still important, graphics and theme put it over the top for me.  I love the animated cards, art, and kind of science/fantasy fiction lore.\n\nThe combos you can perform are many, unique, and very clever.\n\nThis game will become more and more polished as time goes on.  It is not as clean as Hearthstone atm.\n\nThere are a wide variety of match formats (although I pretty much just play standard and standard ranked)\n\n2v2 is in the works (cant wait)\n\nGive it a shot.

But what really sold it for me is you could get EVERY CARD by just playing the game and without spending real money. Now you can only get a handful of cards without spending ridiculus amounts of cash. This makes some of those competitive hearthstone people look like cheap skates. I remember distinctly (I was a beta tester had the game longer than most people who play) that the only advantage monewy gave you was advancing faster and getting some ALT art cards. Now unless you are willing to pay money you can only get the first 100ish cards released (most of which are total crap and have direct upgrades in thier own faction). I have nothing against you playerss who choose to spend money on games, I myself have spent money on F2P games and bought DLC but having to spend money to stand a competitve chance is just ridiculous.","May 7","false","245.4"," 34 of 53 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","34","53","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacetank/recommended/257730/","spacetank","SpaceTank","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacetank/","181 products in account","So, what is Infinity Wars, and why should you try it over any other TCG? First off, let's get this out of the way: the game is pretty complex and your enjoyment of it may vary depending on your TCG experience.\nEither way, the basic game mechanics should be familiar: players have a health meter, draw a card each turn, cards have a resource cost, you get 1 resource per turn. (I will not be using the game's own terms because there's no point in doing that if you have never played it).\n\nThere are creature cards, spell cards, artifacts and field/location cards, which all work in a similar way to MtG's equivalents.\n\nCards have attack and defense values, and they do not gain their defense back at the end of the turn. Now, here's the part that sets Infinity Wars apart from others: the zones and simulaneous turns.\n\nLet's start with the zones. You have a Support Zone, a Defense and Assault Zone and a Command Zone.\n\nThe Support Zone is where a creature will go if you play it from your hand. Call it summoning sickness if you want, it's what prevents you from playing it on the battlefield right away. You can keep a creature there for as long as you wish, and you can also retire your active creatures there at the start of your turn.\n\nThe Assault and Defense zones are where creatures attempt to attack the enemy's health or defend their player respectively. When attacking, you have to go through your enemy's defending creature pool if you are to deal damage to them. If the enemy has 5 creatures and you have 4, no matter their stats, you will not manage to attack his health (assuming all creatures don't have some form of text that changes that).\nHowever, the opposite is not true. If you have one 1/20 creature defending and the enemy attacks with 20 1/1's, everything will die at the end of the turn.\n\nSo how does battle work? The answer is pretty simple: it is done automatically. Once you place your creatures on one Zone, they will all attempt to attack or defend starting from the leftmost creature. You can change the order or the Zone during your turn at will, but not after the automated battle has started.\nBefore I continue, I have to mention that one player gets Initiative each turn alternatively. You will see what that means very soon.\n\nAnd that's where the simultaneous turns come in. While you were planning your trades to be statistically in your favor, the enemy has been doing the same. When you both click "end planning", spell effects will be triggered first (and, if both players used a spell, the one with the Initiative has his trigger first), and then, if any creatures are left alive, the battle begins.\n\nIf you are a little confused by this, don't worry, the battle phase is very easy to figure out once you actually play the game. As a side note, you can get amazing trades if you position any creature that gets buffed correctly. If you have a 4/4 that heals itself for 2 every time it kills something, it can kill an infinite number of 2/2's.\n\nRemember the Support Zone? If you think that an enemy is going to use a spell that kills one or more of your creatures, you can retreat your vunlerable creatures back into it for the turn, and the enemy is going to completely waste his spell.\nThis creates a lot of "mindgames" during matches, and you feel incredibly satisfied when you manage to outsmart your opponent in such a way.\n\nThe Command Zone contains any 3 cards in your deck that are chosen prior to the game's start. They are revealed to both players to make the mechanic more fair. Their cost is the same, but you can put them directly into the Assault or Defense zones without making the transition to the Support Zone. If you do not do that, they stay in the Command Zone. So how can you use that to your advantage? Apart from playing powerful cards quickly, you can let them build up stats if they have a passive ability (+x/+x for every creature that dies, for example) or activate their abilities safely (pay x: deal x damage to a creature, for example).\n\nFinally, there are two more small mechanics that make the gameplay more varied: cards have a Morale cost, which is a secondary resource. When a creature with 2 morale dies, you lose that morale. If you have 0 Morale, you lose the game, exactly like your health. This is useful if you are running a defensive deck that doesn't have much damage, and makes tanking and stalling strategies more viable. The last mechanic is the Trading Post, where you can use your leftover resources to shuffle a card (or your hand, on turn 1), draw a card or increase your max resources by 1. This means that you have always something to do with your resources even with a bad hand, and it also means that some cards can cost more than 9 resources (which is the normal maximum) and have absolutely gamebreaking effects.\n\nNow that we're done with the game's rules, let's talk a little bit about the game itself. It has a client of its own (like LoL, for example) where you can play, buy packs, edit decks, see your achievements and tweak the settings all in one. The client is a little slow, and I have often encountered some bugs if I click things too quickly before they load properly. There are also some minor connectivity problems, but most of the time you are not going to lose any of your progress. My biggest gripe with the UI is the deck builder, it seems really clunky and counter-intuitive to me. Also, more customization options for text size would be welcome.\n\nYou can play a wide variety of game modes, ranging from an impressively large campaign with voice acting and a storyline (something a lot of TCG's shy away from) to a ranked mode and a rift run (which is something like random draft, or Arena in Hearthstone). There are some free decks to choose from each week, and some of them can stand on their own against custom decks, which means a newer player can have a shot even if he hasn't accumulated many cards on his own. You can buy packs with in-game money or real money, and the pricing model seems fairly standard. There is also card trading, which is a major plus for me.\n\nThere are multiple factions in the game, and their gameplay mechanics and art style are really varied and interesting. All cards also have Purity, which means that you need to have at least x of a certain type of Commander to be able to play them. For example, the most extreme rush cards would require 3 Flame Dawn Commanders. Some of the game's 9 factions include:\n\nWar40k-inspired demons that have chaotic and destructive discard and exile effects.\nCold and calculating machines that buff themselves or deal long-range damage.\nAnime-style tech angels that fly over your defenses and ascend to higher forms.\nMechanical zombies that eat creatures so you can play them yourself next turn.\n\n\nThe card art is really cool and fitting for each faction's ideals, and so are the animations. Some of them even go as far as telling a small story in a few frames, which really shows the work put into each individual card. Speaking of which, there are a LOT of cards in the game, I am stil discovering new ones every day.\nThe battlefield in which you play in is 3D rendered, and can even change if you play a Field card.\n\nThe music and sound effects are not exactly brilliant, but you will probably not notice them anyway, as anything too distracting would've been detrimental to the game.\n\nAs a final thought to close this colossal review, if you are somehow still undecided, I have to say that this game deserves to be tried at least for its attempt to introduce new mechanics to a fairly tired genre. It has MtG's complex mechanics, strategic battles and card trading while also boasting nice visuals and a free-to-play model.\n\nI'm glad I found it, and, even though it's not perfect, I think it deserves way more recognition.","December 9, 2014","true","34.8"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","24","36","0","0"

Losing your first 3 matches will mean a return on only 25% at most of the entry fee as in-game currency regardless of the pay-in method.\n\n- The deck you make in the on-entry drafting mode is highly expensive, costing up to 30 times the entry fee and requiring 15+ wins in a row with that deck to make it viable to buy.\n\n- You will make only a fraction of the entry fee back for the on-entry drafting mode unless you win 10+ games in a row.\n\n- There is no obvious player matching system and is done completely at random in all PvP modes leading to repeat matching with a single player in some cases even if you have lost to them several times in a row.\n\n- Booster packs are expensive requiring 35-40 constructed wins to get 15 new cards or upto double that with losses.\n\n- Seems to be trying to force players to buy premium currency in order to get new cards or play in on-entry drafting PvP mode.

Too bad it is ruined completely by a terrible business model.\n\nThis game uses the antiquated "trading" system, instead of the newer crafting system that a lot of TCGs use today.  Your progression in the game is essentially in the hands of how much you want to sit in chat and ask to trade with people, and then expect them to want an arm and a leg for the cards you want.  Ohh fun!\n\nIn the beginning you get a lot of cards very quickly from achievements and the single player campaign, but once that is over with then you can expect roughly a week of playing casually to earn enough to buy one booster pack.  That's right.. a whole week of playing the same basic deck over and over just to get one booster which will likely not contain anything you need for your deck.\n\nDaily events offer single, random cards instead of money, so don't expect to be able to rack up money quicker through daily quests like in Hearthstone.  Also there is nothing you can do with duplicate cards except trade them (if they are tradable, which a lot of your cards will not be).\n\nI cannot say much about the matchmaking system, because I sat in the queue for about 15 minutes before I gave up and went back to playing against the practice bots.\n\nFor me the game just feels a bit bland, especially since it takes you (and the RNG gods) quite a while to progress into a deck that you like or have interest in.","May 25, 2015","false","20.0"," 47 of 81 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","47","81","2","15"

Why you may ask? Because this game is not a pay-to-win game like many free games are. Much like League of Legends, each victorious match rewards "IP" which can be used to purchase booster packs, profile icons, etc. Of course, you can straight up buy the things with real money too.\n\nAs for the fun of the game, it's quite unique in its playstyle, offering advanced strategy, and several campaigns! There is no penalty for losing, which encourages players to continue matches until they win and level up. This game is extremely generous with its reward system, offering cards at the drop of a hat, which can and will further expand your deck!\n\nAll in all, if there was a 1-10 scale i can rate this game at, it would ultimately be 8.5 out of 10. A very good game, and definately worth trying, even for those who are not into card-based games!","April 26, 2014","true","19.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

But a lot of "little" details killed this game.\n\nThe good:\n- Gameplay: simultaneous turn, very unique, quite attractive when you understand how it works.\n- All cards are animated, and the design itself is acceptable, some cards are pretty awesome like Nyx, Avatars ...\n\nThe bad:\n- Unfriendly UI. Until now, I still have no idea to add a player in my ignore list, or find a guy I just met and all I remember is just his name ... A lot of "extend" options in this game will be perform via command line, which I think is very very unfriendly !\n- Terrible matchmaking. In the past, IW had an option named "Only match me against new player". A lot of my friends, they just pass lv 4 to enter PvP's area, having around 400-500 cards in their bags, with a little of decent  rare cards, they've to fight  against a guy with nearly 1000 hrs in this game with all kind of highest stuff. Imagine what happen when an ordinary man throw himself to a modern tank, the same thing happen here. Thanks God, they removed that options, but seem like the problem still there. A friend of mine, he is lv 16 atm, but he still have to fight a dozen of "tank" players like that.\n- Bug: trade - bug, in a normal games - bug, in a ranked game - bug, in a draft game - bug.

They game hands out cards reguarly and in all fairness used correctly common cards can be just as effective as rare or epic ones.

And that's me saying that so it means a lot. Lol.  I've played practically every MMO and online TCG/CCG that has been released. Infinity Wars offers great gameplay, an awesome community, and environment everyone can enjoy!\n\nAlright, let's start off with the negative to get all you bum-whats out of the way.\n\nNegatives:\n\nPeople complain about earning packs and grinding... Let's get this straightened out. So you play a match against someone who has obviously paid for their cards, you lost, and no you are that angry little girl in the corner. Oh well, one match you lost, big deal!\n\nHow you can get free cards:\n\nCampaign. You get a free introduction with a solid base of what you really need to make a deck. These are great trial decks to have some fun with the cards you already have.\nDaily rewards- I logged in and received SOL.\nLeveling up- Free 13-15 card packs?!?\nVictory of the day\nMaster & Apprentice System- a pack with 3 free cards for every match you play together\n\nOther negatives-\n\nThere are some minor bugs people complain about, even though they get squashed, but sometimes they can take a little time to be addressed.  Grinding takes too long\n\n\nAbout the grind: What other game already gives you so many cards, ways to earn them and the fact now you can grind, which is optional to earn DECKS mind you, and packs you want. Research about the packs and decks before you buy them! Buy a deck, not a blister pack!\n\n\nNow on to the positives:\n\nThe community is spectacular.  People are very helpful and will always point you in the right direction. Some people will provide you with free cards knowing they want you to enjoy a greater time.  There are often tournaments, and great communities you can join as well to "enhance" ;) your gaming experience.\n\nThe gameplay. Nothing, and not one TCG or game I have played has ever come close to this. From the commander zone combination along with an assault/defence, simultaneous turns/resolves. They offer two ways to win. By either health or morale. You have an option on how you want to defeat someone along with drawing them or 'double' explosions.\n\nThe developers/management: They are very close to the players that make the game. Teremus and Schumi are great people that always answer all questions, even the less logical ones. They hold conversations and not only answer questions, upon other duties expected by them. (hopefully?) xD\n\nMusic. The music is nice. +\n\nThe shop.  Decks, mats, card backings, it's all included in a shop for a reasonable price. For $20 you can walk away with a deck and 2-3 packs sometimes.  There is no place to buy singles, but you can trade for those easily.\n\nResource Pool- You have your resource pool. So want to complain about luck? Pay 3 resources to shuffle a card and draw 1. Pay 5 to draw a new card. 9 to gain a new maximum resource.\n\nAnd there are cards that change the tide of battle. This goes in to the whole mentality of bluffing, when to play certain cards and when not to.\n\nMy community. {SSC}SoulSobriety Multi-Gaming Community is just SOULicious.  We bring players closer together, have a great time, create tournaments, and our very own website.\n\nNow let's get real. We all know I wrote this interesting and lengthy review knowing that you, the reader, would read to the very bottom just so you could see my recruitment message. Outplayed!  In all seriousness, I would have babies with the game, it's staff, spend the $20 if need be, and call it a day.\n\nInfinity Wars 2014 (psst it's 2015): Animated Trading Card Game deserves a 9/10.  This game provides a unique gaming experience, that will not only keep you coming back, but wanting to see more from the game. Thanks for the management who made this happen along with the developers. I can not wait to see what you will bring us in the future.\n(I never write lengthy reviews like this unless I really appreciate a game >.>)","January 14, 2015","true","165.5"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","23","38","2","0"

I dealt with the matchmaking that threw my deck made out of the meager cards you get from the campaign against decks that have actually been put together with a serious strategy in mind. I accepted that you would have to grind for hours to just get a single randomized 15 card booster pack. After all that, what finally led me to uninstall it was the wonderful discovery that some cards have incorrect text, which led me to lose a draft battle that I spent half of the in-game currency I had earned in my 7 hours of playing just to get into.

Simultaneous turns, honestly I do not know why people complain about this because the longer you play the easier it is to know EXACTLY what your opponent will do.\n\n2.) New game, there are not too many cards like in magic the gathering meaning you still have a chance to learn all the cards and learn about new cards as they come out.\n\n3.) Although the community is small the community is extremely kind, I have gained 1/4 of my collection via gifts, new players get plenty of advice and gifts thanks to the community.\n\n4.) The A.I. is decent, although it needs alot more improving, it is easy to grind out IP with the A.I. and its a great way to test new decks.\n\n5.) The game is BALANCED, some might say other wise but honestly all the factions are balanced.\n\nCons:\n\n1.) Like I said the community is small which causes PvP match searching to take 5-120 seconds usually (sometimes even more).\n\n2.) Most players in the game have maxed out and for new palyers this can be a problem because when searching for games it is likely you will play a player with better items than you.\n\n3.) There are still a few glitches, although most are just annoying visual glitches some are actual card glitches although from what I have encountered none are game ending.\n\n4.) Drafting in the game is great but when you loose 3 games you get 5 random prize boxes that usually give IP or cards, but you can buy the deck you do not freely get the cards and the price is kind of high.\n\nI hope this review helped, my in game name is efefrs and good luck!\n","November 23, 2015","true","458.7"," 37 of 65 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","37","65","2","0"

The simutanious turns allows for more thoughtfull and smooth game play while also adding a steep learning curve that rewards players who pick up on subtle tricks. It is far from a pay to win game as it generously gives players free cards and points for them to either buy booster packs, full size theam decks as well as a option to draft. The animations and artwork on the cards are incredibly well done.  That said the meta for this game is rather stale as decks are mostly comprised of the top players decks which makes playing rather repeditive. While there are some minor to annoying bugs in the game suchs as a endless turn bug. The biggest issues stem from the company and player base who file every match breaking bug and exploit as acceptible because its a beta. That one line is used over and over again for what seems to be every issue. The exploiters are the worst batch of the bunch. They constantly use bugs and glitches as a means to get easy wins. From abusing knows issues in the client to play cards for free, using the command zone to use desyncs to bend the way cards work. While there is a report player option is rarely seems to accomplise anything as alot of exploiters climb to the top level of the ranking system. While many bugs are regularly patched the system still doesnt punshing long term exploiters. This game is good if you into a lack of diversity for a almost nonexsistant ranked system and only want to play the casual match here and there.","August 20, 2014","false","675.0"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","23","39","0","0"

Then I  strongly recommend you to give Infinity Wars a try. This game involves strategy and preempt what your opponent strategy is planning and counter it with your own. Though still in BETA, i am already immersed by the game play. The cards are all animated and the artwork on the cards are beautifully done.\n\nThe campaign teaches you how to play with different fractions and while learning about how different fractions works. By the end of each campaign, you get a set of basic core cards to start your deck. If you wish to improve your deck, you can get free booster pack by leveling. Win or lose, you still get experience points and infinity points to redeem more boosters!! Finish the campaign and you will rougly know how this game work..\n\nThough there are some minon bugs and glitches, I am pretty sure the developers are working to fixed them. Even thought its still BETA, I am confident this game will be fun and addictive to all TCG players. Especially opening of booster packs!.

If you, like me, love strategic fantasy card games, you will probably spend hours playing this fun game too.\n\nThe gameplay, balanced factions, and tutorials are all there and high quality, and this game is FREE!.  You can pick from the undead type faction, the beasties, the mechs, the angels, the demons, the defenders, the fast attack warriors, and the nuker wizards types (not their 'in game' names).  There are also some interesting choices everyone can use from a large pool of neutral cards too.  The factions are creatively themed, like the defenders have a water samurai vibe going.\n\nIt really gets interesting because you can combine up to 3 factions in any one deck.\n\nThis game is full of mechanics that add to the player's satisfaction.  For example, when you make a deck, you pick 3  commanders that can be any creature card and you start the game with those 3 cards in play, in a designated area.\n\nSo your awesome 3 best legendary creaturecards that you got lucky and drew from booster decks? Yeah, you start every game with those.\n\nAnd as if satisfying deep strategic choices are not enough, the developers added very impressive artwork for each card!  Honestly I enjoy all the beautiful artwork almost as much as the gameplay.\nAnd if unique fantasy artwork isn't enough, the artwork is also animated!\n\nYou unlock plenty of cards playing through the campaign, which includes 8 missions for each faction.  Also quests unlock you cards.  Wins and losses generate you in game points which can buy boosters too.  Also playing games gives you experience, and at the time of writing this I think you get a booster for every level you gain.  So it does not feel as griindy as say, Hearthstone.\n\nI would recommend this game even if it costed money.  But is doesn't.  So pick it up and go have fun.\n\nedit: wanted to add, played this game over 150 hrs, new patch coming soon, and I haven't changed my mind.

Add in that this game is ridiculously affordable for a TCG and can be played for free while still amassing a large card collection.\n\nMagic definitely has richer, deeper, card library (as is to be expected) but in the playing of the game the tactical choices are both more numerable and more impactful. Out is the feeling of being beat by a more expensive deck or being screwed by a bad mana draw. In is the feeling that strong choices can overcome better decks or bad draws.\n\nHearthstone has a super polished presentation and fantasic developer but after that Infinity War has it beat on every front. So much so that there really is no reason to compare the two, it is like checkers and chess. I compare it to Hearthstone because the developer support has been Infinity Wars' biggest issue.\n\nInfinity Wars' had a fatal flaw, however. The developers had begun a game they lacked the resources to maintain and grow. The bug list was/is extensive. Many promised features had been shelved. The game seemed to have been abandoned and the player count began to decay. I stopped playing for months at a time. I would not have recommended investing in this game at all but everything has changed.\n\nA new partnership has been announced (information on the game's forums) and suddenly this game has surged forward again. The main bugs are being tackled and a new plan to relaunch the game is underway. Players are returning and optimism is high. This game is a gem. It is the best TCG I've played and every replacement I've looked for since has left me unfulfilled.\n\nWhile the game still needs a lot of polish and improvment, the new injection of engery and resources from the developers has my hopes high. Try it for free. Play the rather basic campaign mode. Trial some of the free decks in pvp. I think a lot of you will agree:\n\nThis is the best puffy TCG ever made.","February 16","true","633.1"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","13","21","0","0"

On the one hand, the game itself is incredibly unique, and the card animations are awsome. I enjoy the simultanious turns and the stategies it allows. I alos enjoy how incredibly dirverse the purity mechanic can make the game. Finnaly (for the positives, atleast), the command zone gives decks a huge boost of consistancy while also letting certain factions (Exiles and Cult of Verore come to mind) disrupt decks easily via removal that can target the command. It opens up a huge avenue for strategic gameplay.\n\nWhat I dislike it the catering to specific playstyles. Since first picking up the game a while back, I have seen the developers systematically remove control options, especially for my favorite faction: Descendants of Dragon. Their defensive playstyle and alt wincons have been attacked again and again, as has the standard control faction: Cult of Verore. Meanwhile the rush factions, like Order of Solace and FlameDawn have seen nothing but buffs.\n\nOverall, I think that if Lightmare had treated all playstyles equally, I would be playing Infinity Wars instead of writing this comment. As it stands, the decks I like either no longer exist, or have been knee-capp'd so hard, they can't win games. What a waste of so much potential.","February 13","false","104.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This leads to many bugs and the client crashing somewhat often, as well this leads to that it can take quite a while to find a match with somebody. And if you find a match, the server just might be so desprate to pair you with someone that they match you up against someone much better than you.\n\nHowever, the rest of the game is amazing. The animated art for the cards are badass and really convey the feeling of whatever character/faction they are, the game is fairly balanced (although the sleepers faction has gotten ♥♥♥♥ed over quite a bit in the past, much to my dismay).There are a lot of diffrent cards with diffrent effects that allow for plenty of theory crafting. And if you do not like creating your own deck ideas and combos, every week there is a rotating array of free decks for new players who don't have real decks or for people looking for inspiration for their own decks.\n\nAlso, even if you do face mostly the main stream decks (well, as main stream as they can get with such a low player base i geuss), you do also face quite a bit of unique decks, or at least less main stream decks. The game has never really been as broken as MTG has been at some points where there is like only a few decks that work and all the rest are just trash.\n\nThe game also has a fairly unique deck building system where comanders take a big, big part as they directly alter what cards you can even have in your deck. Its also quite fast pace. Certain decks like a red charge deck will either have won or will start losing by around turn 6.\n\nAlso, turns are done at the same time as your opponent. This means that everything you do has to be proactive instead of reactive. If you want to counter a spell, then you have to predict that your opponent is going to use that spell this turn, and use it this turn, before they actually cast it. This does lead to a format where control decks are not quite as oppresive since you can't just auto-counter everything another player does, you have to predict their actions and not just blindy counter, as well as create a mind game. I can't tell you how many times i have been sitting on that last turn. Both players are just a hit from death, and i have to predict exactly what they are going to do.\nBecause of how combat works, you dont directly decide who battles who, rather every creatures does battle with the next one in line untill there are no more attackers or there are no more creatures to attack and they deal dmg to the enemy player.\n\nAll in all, this is a great card trading game, that is actually free isntead of freemium may i add. This game is a lot like league of legends in this aspect. U can get every single card in the game. no matter how strong just by playing the game.

That stated i have log over 50+ hours into the game and have nothing to show for it.\n\nYou get a decent number of cards to start and they are good enough to build a good deck or two but with the arbitrary baring of ranked play until you have reached level 20 (and with 50+ hours of grinding i never did) and the draft system being time sink at best and gambling at its worst there is not much you can do except random PVP battles. the fact that you can’t trade your starting card or all the packs you get from leveling up, and the fact that you need on average 50 games to get 1 booster of 15 cards, makes it so that your card library gets stale fast and your deck options dwindle to those that can get you to level 20 as fast as possible.\n\nWith the new update coming in the packs will cost more for less cards, and the much needed faction packs will be un-accessible to all players who don’t or can't spend real world money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadjester/recommended/257730/","dreadjester","DreaddJester","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadjester/","321 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo I've spent some time with Infinity Wars and I'd like to give some initial impressions of the game.  First off let me tell you this game is deeep.  It's so deep that after eight hours of play my head is still swimming in all the tricks and strategy of the game and I'm fairly sure I still don't understand all of it and I know for certain that in multiplayer there's sharks down there that do.  If you want a challenging card game with loads of strategic possibilities this is the game you've been looking for.\n\n\nWith all that depth comes a fairly steep learning curve that's thankfully helped along by some training missions.  The training missions are pre-established, stacked deck games that will teach you the basics of the game.  I found the training missions to be very helpful in understanding the game play although at the same time somewhat frustrating as the computer metagames things that, in my opinion, no real player could anticipate.  In some instances of the training mission the computer downright cheats to teach you your lesson, doing things that are absolutely outside the rules.  In the final "test" of the training mission the computer starts up with cards that could never be on the field of play until many turns into the game in a real game.  It's frustration to the max as it's nearly impossible to defeat the last test without playing some of the real game to get more and better cards to build a better deck.  It nearly made me rage quit the game forever.\n\nOther forms of solo play are a campaign mission for all the games factions, which will keep you playing in solo for a while, and several bots to challenge.  Then of course there's the PvP play where you go head to head against another real player.  Personally I have not yet done PvP and I'm fairly sure there are some other game modes in there that I haven't seen yet.\n\nSo what is the actual game play like??  Well if you can imagine, it's as though Magic the Gathering, Yugiou, and Texas Hold 'em got together in a funky three way and had a child.  There's the normal getting packs of random cards to collect with which you build a custom deck of your own with. Creature summoning, fighting it out with creature health and life scores, keep your own heath up, and summon spells and enchantments.  Fairly standard concepts if you've ever played other card games.\n\nThe first unique thing about this game though is that turns are taken simultaneously.  That's right, while your planning out what you’re going to do next so is your opponent.  Once you both hit "end turn" what you both did happens in a particular order.  This allows for some interesting game play and a bit of bluffing from time to time.  You'll find yourself trying to second guess and plan ahead for what your opponent "might" do.  This plays on the way there are 3 zones for your summoned creatures to be in, support, attack, and defense and that some cards target one of those areas specifically.  If there's a creature in the zone you targeted during your turn your good to go, but if your opponent has moved that creature to another zone your spell card basically fizzles.\n\nThe other interesting thing about this game is the morale bar.  The morale bar starts at 100 points, same as your player health.  Each time one of your creatures dies you lose a set amount of morale based on what that particular creature's morale loss is.  And then there are cards which will boost or reduce yours or your opponent’s morale.  Should your morale reach zero you will also lose the game.  It's sort of like having a second health bar that gets reduced by other means and gives more depth to how you set up your deck and how you go about winning the game. It all makes for some interesting and different game play than any other card game you'll find.\n\nThe next question; is this a pay to win game?  So far as I've seen at the moment I'd say no.  Yes there are random packs and decks you can buy with either real money, or credits you earn while you play the game.  If you choose to keep it free it will take you longer to get a larger selection of cards from which to build your deck from and thereby your deck may initially be weaker than say someone who'd played the same amount of time yet spent real money on cards....  But keep in mind that even in a real world card game like Magic the Gathering or Yugiou I could go down to my local game store and plop down tons of money to buy boxes of cards right now, or buy more slowly as I have the extra money.  In that respect it's not much different than real life.  Also remember that these packs are random, so even if I gain them though play credits there's always the possibility that I may pull out better cards, or cards that are more important to me, over time than a person who plopped down a ton of real money to buy them.  Finally there's also a lot of player skill to factor in.  Even if you have an incredible selection of awesome cards there's the question of can recognize and build a viable deck with them and even if you can do that can you use that deck to win?  I've seen many a player in real world card games that had a great deck, but they had no clue how to use it properly.\n\nSo at the end of the day is this game good??  I'd say yes, it's a lot of fun and something I intend to continue playing.  Is it better than say, Hearthstone, the other popular online card game right now??  I would say that the answer to that depends on what you want in a card game.  Comparing the two is a bit like comparing checkers to chess.  Hearthstone is also a great game, but is much more simplistic and straightforward.  If you want an easy to understand, high speed card game go with Hearthstone.  If you want a deeper, more challenging game go with Infinity Wars.  Personally I think I enjoy the depth of Infinity Wars more.","March 23, 2014","true","10.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Honest, I do.\nBut after playing for a few weeks, I kind of want to quit.\n\nPROS\n- It really is free-to-play; yes, you can spend money if you like to more quickly get what others can earn through play, but it is by no means required. And the people who plunk down money won't necessarily get what they want; you buy booster packs in the game store, and it's random what cards you'll receive. You could spend tons of money, but it may never get you the cards you're after.\n\n- Um...it's a very pretty game?\n\nCONS\n- The learning curve isn't very high...but the deck-building curve is. Unless you spend lots of money right up front, you'll lose. A lot. for at least a week or two. Once you start earning enough points to start getting new decks, you can build something worth playing that might actually win.\n\n- The game is severaly unbalanced. There are certain card-factions (and you have to choose from the various factions; you can't build a deck with just any card you like) that will simply run roughshod over others. There are cards that cost far too little to play that either generate tons of creatures all at once or make creatures flying which makes them very difficult to block or kill.\nUnless you build a deck specifically to counter these effects--and you have no idea if your opponent will be playing a deck you need to counter in this way--you might as well concede every match right away when you see one. Angel decks and undead decks are the worst for this.\nThe game is far too often either no challenge at all or unwinnable; there is very little in-between.\n\n- Unless you do a lot of trading with other players, it is very difficult to get certain cards. I've been playing for weeks and while there are cards you see during the tutorials, they've never come up when I've purchased a booster pack. Getting new cards is more often than not a lot of been-there-done-that.\n\n- The interface has a tendency to be quite clunky, especially the chat windows. If you accidentally close a chat window with another player while playing, I've found no way to re-open it. If you want to communicate with another playing after a match is finished, you'd better start typing to them before you go back to the main menu or the chat box will disappear.\n...though there isn't a lot to chat about, anyway; most players will just throw internet abbreviations at you rather than speaking English ("gg" is most common), so it's very difficult to build any kind of community or get to know anybody you're playing matches against.\n\n- The time between rounds during the game, the planning stage, can seem to drag on and on. You've finished playing your cards and you're waiting for the other player to finish planning...but it seems as though they've either gone to the can of AFK in some other fashion, or they're reading the text of the cards AGAIN (even though they should probably be familiar with their own deck), or maybe the server is delayed...you've never sure which. But it gets to the point where shouting, "Oh, come on!" at the screen starts to feel quite reasonable.\n\nSo, basically, while there is a lot of potential to this game, it has a lot of flaws that eventually makes playing more stressful and frustrating than fun.","October 1, 2014","false","87.4"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","1"

But I was still a bit skeptical b/c being from a company I had never heard of I was not sure if it was actually going to be another "pay to win" set up, for the more casual players. I was very happily proven wrong when it came to the "pay to win" scenario. A lot of times in TCG's the most difficult part is acquiring the more hard to get cards: Epic, Legendary, Mythic cards etc. Well what Infinity Wars does to help you acquire cards is give you a booster each time you level which is incredibly helpful, as well as offer an in game trading option with other players.\n\nAlso for those of you that enjoy drafts, this game does it right. It is similar to MTGO and Hearthstone where as you pay a buy in to draft, but achieving the buy in amount is very easy to get. You could play against bots for half an hour or play in ranked matches, or even play with a friend to earn in game currency to quickly buy yourself into a draft. My favorite part about the drafts is you have a chance if you are successful enough to get your drafted deck for free, but you also have the option of purchasing the deck regardless of your success in the draft as well.\n\nFor those Hardcore TCG gamers out there that want a competitive ranked ladder in either draft or constructed its here in this game. And yes even though it is still in the earlier stages it is very well thought out, and adds a very unique gameplay experience to turn based strategy. The community in this game is very interactive and friendly as well. The global chat within the game allows you to converse with other players about strategies, trading, and practice.\n\nOverall if you enjoy TCG's I highly reccomend "Infinity Wars". A very fun easy to enjoy gaming experience.","March 31, 2014","true","114.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ug/recommended/257730/","Ug","Planeforger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ug/","1413 products in account","This one has a lot of promise.\n\nIt's a fairly traditional MTG-esque card game, but with some significant differences:\n\n(1) turns are simultaneous;\n(2) you pick three characters from your deck to be 'commanders' (whose abilities you can use even if they aren't in play);\n(3) there are three zones of play - attack, defence, and support. Attackers can only hit the opponent's defence zone, and vice versa. The support zone protects characters from most harm.\n(4) all movement between zones happens simultaneously with the other play - so you declarae attackers without knowing what the enemy will block with.\n\nThese elements adds a huge amount of prediction and bluffing into the mix. Do you rush in with your unstoppable walrus in the hopes that they don't add more defenders, or do you move him off the battlefield to dodge a possible death ray? Do you cast Stumble on a character, knowing that if they don't attack, the spell will fizzle?\n\nAdding to that, players have both health *and* morale to worry about. Producing twenty cheap blockers may keep your fortress intact, but evey time one of your characters die, your team takes a hit to their morale - the more legendary the character, the bigger the hit. Some decks specialise on being so defensive that the opponent's attacks sap their own morale. Hit 0 morale, and you're out of the game, regardless of how much you're winning.\n\nThese core mechanics strike a fine balance between accessibility and depth. You won't need to spend half an hour reading all of the opponent's cards, but there's still much more going on in every situation than you'll ever find in something like Hearthstone.\n\nThere's great variety between the game's seven factions. One has discliplined samurai and patient monks. One has uzi-wielding angels. One has bears. Every card's art is actually a looping animation, and while each faction focuses on a few different mechanics, you can mix up to three factions at a time (foregoing some of the more dedicated members of each group).\n\nSo yeah, it has a lot going for it, especially for a 'free' game.\nAs for the cash shop...well, the singleplayer campaign gives you starter decks and additional cards for all factions, plus you get a free booster pack every time you gain a level. Points earned can be spent on drafts, which also have pretty great rewards.\n\nEventually, you may want to buy some new packs/decks, and they're all...not terribly priced. They're also not entirely essential, since legendary characters aren't necessarily 'better', they just add more options. All-up, this one is certainly worth a look.","September 10, 2014","true","25.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

It has a fully realized backstory, voice acting in the campaign, and some lovely art.\n\n-Sound: 7/10 The sounds and music in the game are vibrant, although the music could do with some more variation. The obvious sound for a match being made is a great boon to those of us who alt-tab out during the interminable waiting times between matches.\n\n-Gameplay: 4/10 The actual cardgame mechanics are well done, built to be quick, accessible, and with a surprising amount of depth. The tutorial explains things very well, and the game gives you several starter decks for completing the campaign mode. You're given more cards for winning many matches and leveling up. It should be a fun game! This is ruined by a terrible matchmaking process, pay-2-win kiddies, and ranked play being restricted until you have essentially put hundreds of hours into the game. At the time of this writing I am level 19, with something like three hundred matches against other players, with another two hundred or so against bots. I am not yet high enough to play in the ranked matches.\n\n-Graphics: 5/5 Graphics, to me, have a lower impact on my total review score as I do not need ULTRA GRAFIKS to enjoy a videogame. Considering that it is a card game, though, Infinity Wars has lush graphics, with 3d effects for the battlefield and animations for all of the cards in the game. I almost wanted to keep collecting cards simply to see what the animations were for every card. They range the gamut from beautiful, to amusing, to even touching.\n\n-Replayability: 2/10 This is a big sticking point with me. Normally, a card game like Infinity Wars would, theoretically, have a much higher replayability rating, but the matchmaking service is just, just awful. There's no level-tied matches and it is ENTIRELY possible and MORE THAN likely that your level 2 using a starter deck can, and will, face a level 50 player using only cards he spent real money on. I have also waited more than ten minutes for a match, and no one wants that.\n\n-Cheese -5/-5  Cheese is a special rating for me. It's a sign of how much the game is, for me at least, ruined by the Cash Shop. There are some games, like Rust, where the Cash Shop is only for cosmetic items. This game is completely broken by the cash shop. For about 20 USD, you have enough of their premium currency (Did I mention the premium currency? No? Well it's there. BIG TIME) to afford several store decks and booster packs. It completely wrecks the balance.\n\nTotal Score: 13/30 I cannot recommend this game. Although there is fun to be had, and I really do enjoy the gameplay, the overwhelming presence of the cash shop, horrible matchmaking, premium currency, and lack of any coherent system for tiered matches ruin it. Do not pick up this game, unless you can stomach either playing against bots, spending real money on digital cards for a 'free' game, or being beaten constantly.","November 11, 2015","false","88.6"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","18","33","2","4"

Don't get me wrong, its is possible to play and win without paying at all, but investing money in this game can potencially gain you a huge adventage.\n\nHowever, its not too hard to get more cards (just not as good), most of the commons and uncommons of the Core 2013 booster pack can be obtained, just by playing through the campaign. And When some achievments (non-steam) is unlocked, players somtimes / often will get a couple of cards (~10). And In game currency can also buy player some cards. For 15 cards packs (which garenteeds 3 uncommon and a rare) cost players around 5250 IP(In-game Points) *NOTE each win gains player around 150 IP, each lost will only award the player for 75 IP (to get a fifteen cards deck requires around 35 wins) or 300 LP (~3 USD).\n\nOr players can also start with a "pre-made" deck which  defined each factions. (Players are strongly recommended to finish the campaign before purchasing any one of them, due to the fairly high pricing at 12, 950 IP (87 wins) or 750 LP (~4.80 USD).\n\nI recommend beginers to spent ~20 USD first and buy ONE deck, and 7 packs  of 15-card booster, that should start player off in the game. (NOTE* please check this site http://infinity-wars.wikia.com/wiki/Infinity_Wars_Wiki  to determine which 15-card booster you are purchasing.) DO NOT buy Core 2013, player will gain most of those cards within campaign.\n\nFor cards you want, however did not have the luck to fetch them from the booster, no worries, players can go on the Trade Channel (the second option of chat box channels in the lower left conor of the window) and the common language is looking for (LF), want to trade (WTT) [Trade out]. (NOTE* players are required to be at level five or above in order to invite a trade, however, players can message the other trader to invite instead)\n\nGood luck for fetching cards! Enjoy the game!

A few points (some large, some small) that seperate Infinity Wars from other major TCGs such as Magic and Hearthstone:\n\n1) Both players take their turns simultainiously, once both players have locked in their actions for the turn (you cannot see what your opponent decides to do until the turn happens) everything unfolds at the same time, making for fun and balanced (no 1st or 2nd turn advantage to exploit) game pacing.\n\n2) The 3 combat zones, and command zone (4 zones total) in which cards can be moved around make for great strategy.  You must utilize the zones to your advantage, as well as bluff and use mind games to keep your opponents on their toes.  Your opponent might be pulling their hair out because of your use in manuevering your troops between the support and attack zones, leaving them unable to be dealt with.\n\n3) All the artwork on the cards is animated!  This might seem like a superficial point, and well it is, but it's something that Magic is unable to do, and Hearthstone only does on their 'golden' cards.  In Infinity Wars all cards have artwork that has some level of animation to it, giving them a little more personality and depth.\n\n4) It's still in beta!  There's still so much more in the works that it's amazing.  Even as is the game is a blast to play, yet in the future the game will only bloom and become even more robust and smooth in both gameplay and functionality of the UI.\n\n5) It's FREE!  Much like Hearthstone, this game can be played with zero dollars of investment.

Don't get me wrong, its is possible to play and win without paying at all, but investing money in this game can potencially gain you a huge adventage.\n\nHowever, its not too hard to get more cards (just not as good), most of the commons and uncommons of the Core 2013 booster pack can be obtained, just by playing through the campaign. And When some achievments (non-steam) is unlocked, players somtimes / often will get a couple of cards (~10). And In game currency can also buy player some cards. For 15 cards packs (which garenteeds 3 uncommon and a rare) cost players around 5250 IP(In-game Points) *NOTE each win gains player around 150 IP, each lost will only award the player for 75 IP (to get a fifteen cards deck requires around 35 wins) or 300 LP (~3 USD).\n\nOr players can also start with a "pre-made" deck which  defined each factions. (Players are strongly recommended to finish the campaign before purchasing any one of them, due to the fairly high pricing at 12, 950 IP (87 wins) or 750 LP (~4.80 USD).\n\nI recommend beginers to spent ~20 USD first and buy ONE deck, and 7 packs  of 15-card booster, that should start player off in the game. (NOTE* please check this site http://infinity-wars.wikia.com/wiki/Infinity_Wars_Wiki  to determine which 15-card booster you are purchasing.) DO NOT buy Core 2013, player will gain most of those cards within campaign.\n\nFor cards you want, however did not have the luck to fetch them from the booster, no worries, players can go on the Trade Channel (the second option of chat box channels in the lower left conor of the window) and the common language is looking for (LF), want to trade (WTT) [Trade out]. (NOTE* players are required to be at level five or above in order to invite a trade, however, players can message the other trader to invite instead)\n\nGood luck for fetching cards! Enjoy the game!

A must try for everyone.\n\nEdit June 2015 : After I don't know how long in development, the cards are exactly the same. There is no new content and everything has stagnated since I first tried it in alpha. It has good potential but it's stuck in the early stages.\n\nPROS\n1. A simultaneous action system where players play their cards and actions at the SAME time.\n\n2. Morale system is interesting.\nIt provides another way to poke at an enemy, although "Deal One Damage (DOD)" to a life pool would be just as effective. Currently, only designed for defensive play.\n\n3. Command, Support, Assault, Defense zones provide variety of play.\nCommand provides a camander zone that cannot be directly attacked. It is similar to the Heroes in other Trading Card Games. The only difference being commanders being expendable in this game.\nSupport provides an area for troops to get buffed/choose the right timing to appear. This is a fantastic idea as it improves the efficiency of resource spending e.g. summon a pair of 3 costs creatures one turn after another but bringing them to the battlefield on the same turn together.\nDefense and Assault zones help with tactical movement. Unit order affects how efficiently you use your tropps. You can even swap troops between zones. Even simple actions such as choosing who goes first is important.\n\nTrading system is fantastic. As compared to other online TCG games which do not provide a trading system to maximize profit e.g. MMDOC, Hearthstone. This is a great boon to players who play Infinity Wars. +++\n\n\nCONS\nToo few combinations. Most of the cards follow specific themes so strategies are quite same e.g. mass zerging, death leveling, evolution. There are a lot of repetitive cards e.g. Demonic Disciple for Exiles, Invincible Defender for Descents of the Dragons, Endless Horde for the Sleepers, Undending Drones for Genesis, Verore Death Worshipper for Verore, One of Many for Warpath\n\nNo hidden/trap cards.\n\nStill in alpha mode. Spell targetting a card uses an ugly red crosshair. There is no verification of the target for certain spells e.g. Assasinate. You have to remember which card you clicked on. This makes it very difficult for multiple spells as you will not want mistakenly casting 2 spells on the same card.\n\nFew minor graphic problems e.g. Using Great Wall partially covers the view of the left most card. Rewards for campaigns have no image, Flame Dawn 4 just a "loading image" text. Rewards still can be collected. Opening rewards are very slow.\n\nHalf-finished campaign. E.g. A few stages of a campaign tend to be repetitive.\n\nCard animations do not really add to the game. Mostly "hand waving".\n\nRecommendation\nConnect the PC game with the mobile market. An online TCG would be better served on Iphones, Ipads plus PCs.","February 16, 2014","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/buttpisser69/recommended/257730/","buttpisser69","nerdfury","http://steamcommunity.com/id/buttpisser69/","59 products in account","I’ve played a couple of digital card games extensively (Shadow Era, Hearthstone) as well as dabbled with a few others (Solforge, PoxNora, Kingdoms CCG).  Out of all of these digital card games, I would say that I have only truly loved Shadow Era’s gameplay mechanics, so when I read about Infinity Wars on Steam, I was hesitant, as history demonstrated that I was inclined to dislike a TCG more often than not. Furthermore, after I downloaded Infinity Wars and jumped into the tutorial, I felt even more hesitant, because I found its simultaneous-turn system and multi-zone battlefield confusing to learn.\n\nI cannot stress enough how glad I am to have fumbled through the tutorial and AI campaign missions. As a result, I discovered a true strategic gem – a gem in beta with much more polish than many other digital card games which have been fully released. Sure, Infinity Wars has gorgeous animated cards, a delightful music score, and engrossing atmosphere/lore with 8 distinctly different factions [8, not including the Star Trek factions]. That’s super. But what sells me are the game mechanics. Unlike most other digital card games, the battlefield of Infinity Wars is divided into multiple zones (command zone, support zone, assault zone and defense zone). You can move your characters between most of these zones, and certain destructive spells only work on your opponent’s characters when they are in certain zones at a certain moment in time.  In addition, turns are taken simultaneously, which results in plenty of wicked mind-games going on between you and your opponent in PVP. It sounds a bit complicated, but trust me -- it’s awesome.\n\nIn other digital card games, I sometimes felt frustrated at not being able to draw a major card in time (major = integral part of my deck strategy), or felt the frustrations of pay2win and lack of balance. Infinity Wars addresses the first concern with the command zone mechanic (3 “commander” characters, or characters which are integral to a deck’s strategy, are available at the start of the game, and you can play them on the actual battlefield or use their abilities as soon as you have the resource [mana] for them). Furthermore, my frustrations of getting a “bad draw” are mostly quelled by the trading post system, in which a player can obtain extra cards, or swap out cards, by paying resources. I don’t feel that Infinity Wars follows a pay2win business model at all – you can actually build a competitive deck fairly quickly. You receive a large selection of cards by completing the academy (training) and campaign missions, and earn cards by playing each day and completing achievements. Very rarely have I seen a card played by an opponent in PVP that screamed “IWIN” (you know what I mean). In other words, I think the game is pretty well-balanced for a beta. There are favorable and not-so-favorable matchups depending on which faction(s) you utilize, of course.\n\nI think that strategic-minded gamers will also love deck-building in Infinity Wars, as you can combine cards from different factions to create a truly unique deck that’s perfectly suited to one’s individual play-style. Furthermore, I love that there are many different ways to win, aside from the standard “destroy the opponent’s base”. Certain factions lean towards playing a certain way to win, and mixing complementary cards belonging to different factions in order to reach such a win condition is incredibly fun. As soon as I discovered there was a super-defensive faction that was based on Ancient Chinese lore and obtaining board-control in long, drawn-out games, I was like, “OH HELL YES, THEY TOTALLY MADE THAT FACTION WITH MY INTERESTS AND PLAYSTYLE IN MIND!” (I’m referring to Descendants of the Dragons). I splashed my Descendants deck with some complementary healing and buff cards from a different faction (Warpath), and soon enough, rainbows were shooting out of my nostrils (that’s a good thing).\n\nI do want to make a comparison to another digital card game before I conclude. However, I don't want to ramble about Hearthstone too much.  I want this review to mostly focus on the intrinsic qualities of Infinity Wars, but I have to stress how multi-dimensional and in-depth Infinity Wars is compared to Hearthstone. The complex bluffing games essential to Infinity Wars, multi-zone battlefields, as well as the creative freedom of its deck-building system, just makes Hearthstone seem so one-dimensional in comparison. In other words, Infinity Wars truly feels like a battlefield, with 3 commanders accessible from the get-go which complement one’s unique play-style and desired win condition. As long as it is financially feasible, I hope that Lightmare, the developers of Infinity Wars, will continue to develop their game with the more "strategically-minded" niche gamer in mind, as opposed to making “catering for the casual masses” their number one priority.\n\nOf course, Infinity Wars has its flaws. I encounter numerous display bugs each day, and I think the user interface needs much refinement (why can’t I sort my cards so I can easily differentiate between my soul-bound and tradable cards?). That said, I strongly feel as though Lightmare are on the right track. From what I’ve seen, they’re a cool company that truly listens to community feedback (you’ll see them actively participating in discussions with the community, even outside of the official forums and Steam).\n\nIf this gigantic rant makes one reader (who is interested in strategy and/or digital card games) think "Hey, Infinity Wars appears rather complicated at first, but I would like to approach it with an open-mind and check out the game mechanics!" -- I would be very happy.","June 14, 2014","true","93.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This one takes it to a whole new level. This card game allows the player to have multiple decks that consist of each faction, except one cannot mix the cards with two different factions in a single deck. The way you get cards is easy and you do not actually have to spend money to retrieve them. Just play the game such as the campaigns for each faction and there is the start of one of your decks. Most of the other card games that were back in the 90's and around 2000 started to rot away slowly.

Infinity Wars, in my opinion, is a phenomenal game. The strategy needed to play well, the aesthetics of the playing field and cards, and the overall flow of the game just feel natural to me. I will admit, it was somewhat difficult to understand at first, but that's somewhat understandable. However, after playing with the game a bit, crafting a deck, and playing around in the different modes, I was hooked. One of the most important things to do if you want to learn how to play this game well is to do the puzzles that the game has provided. Not only can they provide you with prizes after beating them, but they also give you tips and tricks as to more advanced plays that you can incorporate into your own play style. If I could make one criticism, it's that it is somewhat difficult to accumulate in-game currency to purchase card pack or decks, especially since the developers rarely, if ever, give out premium currency for free. However, at this point, I'm just nitpicking. So, to conclude, this game is great once you understand it, and I hope that whoever's reading this will pick up the game and have an infinitely good time.","May 13","true","66.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its a fairly interesting game with a zone-based playing field--which I found to be very odd for my first launchings of the game, but just goes along with the inital foreign feel. Considering that perticular mechanic, it doesn't feel like an extra or poorly thought out part of the game. Actually rather helpful, especially in later devised strategies.\n\n-Interface/Menus-\nThey're a bit clunky, and selecting your deck might require creative thinking if you've got a long list. Rest assured that there aren't any major issues, but you will come across some small and slightly annoying ones. Shouldn't be too much trouble though.\n\n-Tutorials & Campaign-\nI went straight to the campaign. Tutorials? They exist, and are actually interesting, but I went right to the campaign. Honestly, it didn't matter all that much which one I went into first. Each does a fair job of explaining the game mechanics. Although the campaign will at times expect you to follow through with a very spesific action that doesn't always "click" until after a breif rage, but that isn't nearly as awkward as the voice acting I experienced when I first played about 3 months ago. The male voices, spesifically, sounded increadibly forced--like the devs themselves decided to try their hand at it without any prior forethought (which wouldn't surprise me at all if I was told that's what happened).\n\n(Story History)\nThe campaign itself, after seeing screenshots of previous versions, has apperently been changed and updated various times along with the new content presented, but you'll enjoy at least a few moments of it as you tackle its different missions.\n\n-Player Base-\nSmall for a Free to Play game, but just below average for a Virtual TCG like this one. Most of the time your matches with other players result in nothing but silence. Other times you may come across someone increadibly helpful, or you may come across a complete ♥♥♥. I'd suggest simply keeping cool, calm, and collected and you should be fine.\nThe block and report button are one in the same, so that should save you some trouble.\n\n-Current Status-\nThere is a point to playing the campaign, however--as it gives you starter decks for 5 of the 8 factions. Recent changes in marketing and management are enducing the game into a period of self-enlightnement. It isn't quite sure what kind of buisness man it wants to be when it grows up, so you may find it difficult to secure a solid idea of how you might go about securing the remaining 3 factions without a core deck until the identity crisis has passed.\nAlso: note worthy that recent patches have made the game a bit buggy when it comes to getting into a match--this'll certainly get a lot of complaints but I don't expect it'll be a problem for very long.\n\n-Gameplay-\nThis is a game in which players will need to level up to unlock the more advanced mechanics of the game; game modes spesifically. The leveling system itself seems to not be rock solid. What I mean by that is a player that starts playing the game in one 6 month period may have a slightly different experience with leveling up as a player that starts in the following 6 month period. Various changes to such mechanics happen from time to time after enough feedback is taken in by newer players--that's right. They listen to new players and try to help 'em out.\n\n(Complaints)\nOften, complaints are heard reguarding a dwindeling player base. Now I'm no expert on fuzzy terms like that, but there are enough players that you're not waiting around 5 minutes at a time just to get into a match.\nWIth that said, the player base is predominatly "veteran" players, as I've been hearing. Basically, how the complaints put it is that: "I was looking for a multiplayer match with a good fight in mind, and I didn't ****ing get it!"\nWell, yea. That's how it is. I've been playing for over three months and I certainly have those moments, so it isn't just noobs that have them. You won't always get a match that is as satisfying as you'd prefer it to be. One mistake and you loose the game, which is certainly infuriating. That isn't to say that perfect games don't happen. Even loosing can be satisfying when you are your opponent are evenly matched in luck and in card strength.\n\n(Cards)\nMost of the complaints focus around being out-gunned and outmatched though, so I'll address this as well: The delux, bad-♥♥♥ cards are really freakin' hard to aquire as an FTP (Free-to-play) player. Those are "Epic" and "Legendary" quality cards. The top two teirs. Trading or dumb luck are the only two ways I see myself getting Legendaries, but I've amassed a small fortune of Epics, so it's possible be at least a 2nd teir player without destroying your actual small fortune of pennies, nickels and dimes.\n\n(OP Cards)\nThere are plenty of cards out there that you'll soon learn to hate, but I'll give you a fair warning that none of them are quite as bad as seeing your entire force, or your soldier that you raised from a 4/2 on turn 1 to a super bad-♥♥♥ 8 turns later, get completely whiped out by Oblivion or just outright removed from the game by The Calamity. Those two are the worst board wipes. No further comment.\n\n(Faction Mechanics)\nI won't be talking about factions, because I'd rather you get to experience the full terrific experience of encountering a faction that you thought you knew all about, only to leave you staring blankly at your screen wondering what the heck just happened.\nCombinations of 3 factions at most in one deck are possible, but only by haveing single faction decks can you use the most powerful cards of that faction (which you'd come to better understand after playing).\n\n-Trading-\nI'll mention a mechanic about cards here so you don't go into a trade with a big promise just to find you don't have it... wait, what?\nA good amount of the cards you initally recive will be "Soulbound." Basically, you can't trade them. They're yours forever. Enjoy your pile of cards you can't get rid of.\n\n-Currency-\nTwo types:\nInfinity Points (IP), is your main in-game currency. You'll get this when you win battles. You'll usually spend it either on card packs or gamble on playing Rift Runs with it.\nLightmare Points (LP), is the bought currency to (currently) buy most of the customization aspects of the game, and everyting that IP can do.\nI hit on this earlier under the -Current Status- heading about the game going through a buisness related identity crisis, so the use value of LP points can only be determined after waiting to see if more changes are made to the shop or not. Each currency has experienced favoritism in the past, which players have both loved and hated. Curretly, LP is being favored in the shop (which can change at any time), so there'll be a bunch of hater reviews poping up about that I'm sure.\n\n-Conclusion-\nI know, I KNOW, I left a bunch of stuff out. I tried to hit the big stuff here though, so cut me some slack.\nHere's a short Pro/Con list:\n\n+Pros\n=The game is well balanced (as balanced as it gets with 8 unique factions).\n=Interesting/Familure mechanics, factions, and cards\n=Fair Turotrials/Challenges and introduction-style Campaign\n=Expansive deck-building and card-collection system\n\n-Cons\n=Collectors may rage at difficulty of finding Legendary Cards\n="Unbalanced" match-making may upset newer players\n=Story, while helpful, is very short\n=Updates vary in severity and scope and may mess up long term spending plans","March 19","true","412.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The lore is amazing, very thematic, the gameplay mechanics and strategy is something I've been craving for. It's kinda like picking up FTL for the first time. You never knew you had a niche to fill until you played it. All this coupled with a community manager that appears to get no sleep because he seems to be everywhere willing to answer questions. Out of all dTCGs, they are the underdogs/sleepers and I'm rooting for them.\n\nTips:\n\n\nPlay through the campaign because you get a ton of cards and when you're done you should make a good determination what deck you start out with. Make it a good choice depending on your play style, because you usually get a super rare card for the initial superbooster pack/deck. Play a few merge deck matches so you can get a grasp of what other cards do and build up your xp/card collection. You can literally get by with your starting cards and mass a huge collection just by playing matches, heck they give you cards just by logging on everyday. Some of the top players have put in little into purchases other than vanity items to support the devs.","February 14, 2014","true","74.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Hooked.\n\nYes, it's neat that the cards are animated I guess, but not a big deal. The mechanics of the game, however, are a big deal; and are an incredibly unique take on TCG. (Yes, TCG - you can trade!)\n\nThe biggest things that caught my eye:\n\n'Command cards' - three unit cards that you pre-select when making the deck that start off in the corner, revealed. You can tailor specific opening strategies around this, and there are tons of possibilities here. And you don't get screwed over by bad draws, because they're always there at the start.\n\n'Trade post' - Speaking of bad draws, the 'trade post' function not only allows you the usual 'mulligan' at the start of the game, but also gives you the ability to spend otherwise unused resources on drawing new cards or even swapping out cards you don't need to draw new cards (for less resources). This is an AWESOME mechanic for bypassing those games where you're basically twiddling your thumbs as you draw useless land cards in magic.\n\nIt's actually F2P. You get a lot of usable cards from playing through the campaign, and you accrue a decent amount of generic in-game currency to purchase booster/blister packs easily. After a single day of playing I was able to afford a couple of blister packs and I was quite happy with that. One could probably afford a booster pack maybe once a week? Depends on how much you play of course.\n\nYou can trade. (Well, aside from the starter cards you unlock in campaign mode at least.) I had given up hope that a card game would EVER let you trade, after all the CCGs I've played.\n\nThere's much more I'm forgetting, and there wouldn't be enough space anyway.\n\nTL;DR: It's free, it's actually got a good F2P model from what I can tell, and it's worth your time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hexperiment/recommended/257730/","hexperiment","ONE (Hexperiment)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hexperiment/","161 products in account","After wasting crap load of time and money on MTG, I decided to return to TCG once Digital TCG started rising again (i.e. Hearthstone).  Hearthstone didn't do it for me because it was one of the most casual ♥♥♥♥ I've ever tried in my life.  So I looked for a better alternative.  Then I found Infinity Wars.  I'll cover IW in two main aspects: F2P and Gameplay/Strategy potentials.\n\nIs it F2P?\nI think the game is pretty fair.  Firstly, yes you can actually TRADE cards in this game.  You can buy Lightmare Points to buy booster packs but you can also earn IW Points to buy booster packs.  You earn IW points from playing games online, including private games with your friends.  How many games does it take to buy a booster pack?  I think it is around 30-40 games (Just a rough estimate, haven't done the math myself), assuming 50% win rate.  But there's more.\n\nWhen you start the game, you will have to play some campaigns.  They will teach you about each factions and you will earn starter deck of each faction when you complete first 3 or 4 missions of each factions.  Also, any games you play, you get experience points for your account and you will get a free booster pack every time you level up.  Every level requires more experience than the last but in the beginning you will level up often and you will be showered with booster packs.  But there's more.\n\nThere is a thing called daily rewards and weekly quests.  Every week, you will be given 3 quests.  It can be just gaining certain amount of experience or playing some amount of PvP.  You get one random card for each quest you complete.  You will get 1 random card for logging in daily and you will get another random card for playing 3 PvP games.  So assuming you are diligent, you get 2 cards per day, another 2*7+3 = 17 cards per week.  And these are truly RANDOM cards.  I've gotten couple of legendaries just from logging in every day.   It's pretty rare but it's really nice when you get them.\n\nI also need to note that free cards you get from daily, weekly or levels are SOULBOUND, meaning you can't trade them.  Only the cards you get with Lightmare or IW points are tradeable.  I think it's fair considering how many cards they pump into you and you don't want to screw the trade economy.\n\nSo in summary,\n1. 2 cards every day (untradeable)\n2. 3 cards every week (untradeable)\n3. 1 booster pack (15 cards) every level (untradeable)\n4. In-game points you earn to buy booster packs (tradeable)\n\nGameplay/Strategy\nIW is definitely unique.  I'll cover them in sections.\n\n1. Simultaneous turns\nMost card games are turn-based but this game has SIMULTANEOUS turns, meaning you and your opponent plan at the same time and things happen all at once.  This means you have to plan according and predict your opponent's moves instead of waiting for them to make a move and react.  If you played MTG, then you know about saving that kill spell in case your opponent buffs a creature into a raging hulk or saving that counter-spell in case he casts some devastating spell.  Not in this game.  You have to predict them coming.  On the other way around, you can dodge certain spells by moving your characters in and out of the battlefield.  This adds an element of mind-game.  Instead of casting spells and hope that your opponent doesn't have an answer for it, you can move around it, dodging, baiting and calling shots.  It really depends on the deck but some games can be very intense.  You don't just play your strategy and hope your opponent doesn't have an answer to it.  If you know they could potentially counter you, you can find a way around by baiting.  This is only possible in Digital TCG so it's taking full advantage of the digitalized TCG!  This fact alone is worth checking this game out.\n\n2. Deck building\nAlright, magic has 5 colored factions but IW has 8?  (There's 2 more factions for Star Trek series but I won't cover that here)  And you can only have up to 3 factions for each deck?  What's up with that?  Well, IW is different in a sense that your deck will be based on 3 cards and they are called Commanders.  Every deck has 3 commanders and their faction alliance determines how you build the deck and each faction has their unique strategy and combining them.  You can build a pure faction deck and play to its fullest strength or you can make a deck of hybrid factions, playing with jack-of-all-trade playstyle.  You aren't just limited to 3 factions because there is a card that allows you to play any factions.  ANY character card can be a commander.  The 3 commanders are placed in the commander zone at every game and you can play them whenever you want, provided that you have enough resources.  Most of the time, you can play the character's ability from the commander zone so you can even build a deck around that entire aspect.\n\nIf you played MTG, you know well about resource management.  In IW, you gain 1 resource every turn so you rarely have to worry about being mana-screwed.  The commanders are like lands in a sense that they determine the color of your deck.  There are characters and spells to boost your resource to get ahead early so there are some resource management in the game.  Your deck should be consistent with your intended gameplay every time since you won't get mana-skrewed very well, provided that you balanced the resource curve.  Consistency is the key because I really hated getting mana screwed in MTG.  Honestly I think that is one of the major design flaws of MTG.  MTG is more flexible with deck building in a sense that you can have any color and any cards in your deck provided that you have the lands to support it.  But ultimately you have to buy those 20 dollar rare lands to even make your dreams possible.  I miss the potentials in MTG but not that much.  Coming from MTG which has beautifully balanced 5 color scheme (each color allies with 2 while opposing one), I felt kinda iffy about the whole factions thing, especially since the devs seem to intend to add or subtract them in the future (super not sure about this but there were 7 factions in the beginning but now there's 8. 10 if you include the non-canon ones) but I learned to love the lore and each faction is quite fun to try.\n\nIn summary:\n1. Simulatneous turns for mind-games\n2. Commanders and 8 unique factions for intersting deck building strategies\n3. Basic resource management so you won't get mana screwed most of the time","September 21, 2014","true","116.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Also on the bottom right of the UI is an auction button (allows card draw & resource schemes) & at the bottom left is the undo button.\n\ncons: the game requires you to create a login profile (why not just auto link with the steam account?), player vs player multiplayer modes has to be unlocked by completing single player challenges & leveling up your profile first (you need to be at least lvl 10 to play ranked constructed, although it's understandable due to experienced ranked opponents), few missing sound ques, the AI sometimes doesn't make the smartest decisions (& some campaign levels are trial&error), storyline is forgettable, when you close the chatbox during a multiplayer match there is no way of getting it back (& no way of reestablishing contact with previous opponents), ive experienced a few deck loading bugs\n\nOverall, after playing for almost 2 decades of Magic: The Gathering & many other card games, Infinity Wars is by far the most compelling of all card games ive played. This is a must play for MTG, Hearthstone, Yu-gi-oh, etc. players - who long for a better card game that offers depth, easy to learn, customizable, streamlined online multiplayer ; but leaves out the pay-to-win BS, terrible UI & menu interfaces, & frustrating/inconvenient multiplayer experience.\n\nInfinity Wars has my highest recommendation and a must play!\nOne of the most fun CCG experience out there.","October 9, 2014","true","90.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Im not saying the developers of this game are lazy, i have seen the game after all, i just think they should take some time and focus some of the development for the linux version. People already love the game, so if a game changer has to wait, i think its safe to say its best if anyone can play the new release. plus if memory serves me correctly, this runs off java and some unity. guess what? those both run on linux! 2/10. if i was developing a game, i wouldnt leave a platform behind, not even in beta testing. thank you, and once this gets a linux release, ill change my review.","March 10, 2015","false","126.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Infinity Wars is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic culmination of the perfect TCG for strategic like minds. Lightmare achieved great success in creating an innovative and pleasurable card game from its competitors; (Hearthstone, Hex, Duelyst, Labyrinth, Spellweaver etc.) The only dysfunction was in the management and disappearance of any sort development or communication to its players. That really hurt the already dwindling player base and left much of the community angry. We felt quite disrespected and discouraged. However, in the past months bugs have gotten squashed and patches are cleaning off the dirt they let collect. They're redeeming themselves and I have hope that the process will not stop.\n\nThings I want to see-\nNew card set\nIncreased player base\n2 v 2\nRevamped campaign\nSeason Ranked Rewards\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeICIgsxJXPm4qO-nVMz3EQ","May 10","true","889.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's cyber-punk on crack; Robots, demon-infused robots, robot's molesting demons, undead trying to eat the humans who are watching demons getting molested ... it's all here and its fresh and interesting genre for TCGs that is highly reminiscent of Warhammer 40K (which is definitely not a downside)\n\n4.

It has its own niche of a playstyle, quite similar to Yu-gi-Oh (a game which I absolutely adore).\n\nThis game has a lot of potential and I love the way the game itself plays out. Granted I have my disagreements with some of the gameplay elements, but you can't love it all. It certainly doesn't break my Hearth like Cardstone does though. It doesn't try to kick me when I lose by also giving me nothing from card packs. That's of course after Cardstone opened a fresh wound with RNG and poured salt in it. Enough of Hearthstone though.\n\nWith a heavy heart I must say that I sadly can't recommend it to almost anyone I know. The artstyle is good, I love the design, but the battlefield, the animations and the soundeffects are sub-par AT BEST. They're simply horrible. Calling them stock would be doing them too much justice. There are top notch free sound effects available out there and this game doesn't seem to be using any. Either that or my game is just broken. It really erodes away the sheer gameplay potential of the game as its feel is so dull I can't force myself to launch it.\n\nOnce the animations and more importantly sound effects are fixed, the game will be MUCH less annoying. Right now it just has a complete lack of visual and audial charm.\n\nI know it's hard designing quality animations and fitting proper sound effects, different ones for each card, also making the game much bigger in the process, but if it's done in the future, I'll change my view to a Recommend.","February 12, 2015","false","26.0"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","10","18","3","6"

Currently, I don't think there's a better TCG on the market than Infinity Wars. I'll just make a few comparisons with the ones I've been playing in the last few months.\n\nHearthstone is a finely polished TCG and as far as graphics goes, it's my top TCG. However, you have a fairly limited amount of cards and getting new ones is a chore. I can't honestly say it's pay-to-win, but it definitely pushes you into buying stuff because of the slow pace with which you get new cards. A real campaign does not exist, but you can buy a couple of missions for a steep price and finish it in a day (if you're slow). What pushed me over the edge and away from this game was the lack of rewards - when I beat challenges on nightmare difficulty and was simply returned to the main menu. It was at that moment that I said "awwwww, forget it".\n\nHex is advertised as a revolutionary take on the TCG genre and it promises a lot. Promises is the key word here since there is almost no PvE content. Also, Hex still feels like just another MTG clone but with a god complex. In time, it might show itself as THE TCG game, but gamers (and everyone else, for that matter) don't particularly like waiting long for promises to come true.\n\nFinally, we come to Infinity Wars and to the reasons why I consider it the best TCG currently on the market. Let's do this one with pros, cons and neutrals.\n\nPROS\n+ playing board elements differ from the standard MTG&clones layout\n+ simultaneous turns make it less likely for you to wait for a slow opponent\n+ every card is animated\n+ a lot of achievements\n+ cards, of course. You get cards for logging in, playing 3 games in a day, finishing campaign missions, winning PvP matches, levelling up and god knows what else. The least I got was 2 cards a day. DId I mention that you get a whole deck of cards (40) for finishing the first 5 missions of a campaign?\n+ every non-cosmetic item (and some cosmetic ones as well) can be bought with the currency you earn from playing games\n+ you have additional options to utilize if you don't want to spend your energy on cards (shuffle and draw a card, draw a card, increase max resources)\n+ PvP mode where decks are combined does a good job of eliminating P2W\nCONS\n- automatic zooming when you click on a card\n- not being able to zoom in on a card when making a deck\n- if you or the enemy have a lot of creatures in a single zone it's almost impossible to target the creature you want to target\n- you have to visit the forums to learn enough info to make a valid deck (e.g. I overlooked card purity and every deck I made was illegal before I read the rules)\nNEUTRALS\n- card art (some are good, some would look better static)\n- a lot of factions\n- no cards have their own voice\n\nAll in all, it's the one TCG that gives me a sense of accomplishment every time I play it (and even on a bad day). Except for some things that were overlooked (like the lack of zoom in your card library), it's everything I've wanted from a TCG. Plus, it's free.\n\nGENERAL SCORE 9,0/10.0","October 4, 2014","true","340.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can say for sure infinity wars brings something unique to the table not knowing for either side who will be attacking or defending untill after you've made your moves and plays ads an incredible strategic depth to it. abilities more or less not resolving on an "instant chain" really i think leads to a more healthy game environment(like l5r) than the judge heavy play of magic or similar games. i will say that the strategies that are truly viable in each symbol of infinity wars are unfortunately fairly limited for now .... but it really hasnt had that many booster sets yet give it time and i think each set will add new victory conditions and play styles.\n\nAs to the free to play  / pay to win. I can firmly say as a free player i have never felt like i couldnt compete even right after i finished the tutorial for all factions you get a lot of cards to work with and it doesnt take long to build at least 1 competitive deck, I like where they are going with thier model you can get more cards faster for money, you can but aestetic upgrades for money, they could probably use some in game currency booster options for real money. but on the whole you can indeed play this game 100% for free and have just as much chance to get rares and build a great deck you just wont get packs as fast as someone dropping real coin on it.  The aestetic upgrades are things like backgrounds for your decks while you play, and deck backings. i could maybe see them marketing custom special animations or special animated art for the cards as well ... almost like a "skin" if you will.\n\nLastly deck building is honestly a pleasure as you pick your commanders it automatically filters the cards out to match the "purity" of your deck so you dont have to sift through a mountain of cards and/or accidentily put an illegal card in it. theres a format checker so you can check to see if your deck is legal in a given format. as well as a built in cost breakdown for your deck so you can watch your curve, a abilities/creatures/artifacts/locations split that not only tells you how many of each you have in deck but splits them up in the deck building screen so if you need to make an alteration things are fast and easy to find.\n\nTheres all my pros now to the cons.\n\nthe game is young ... you will run across some things that young ccg's have such as cards that dont work 100% as printed(sleeper hakeem) and cards that are too strong in given meta like the location for dod that cant be targetted and wins them the game in short order, there are precious few cards to counter it since its a location that cant be targetted so its "too dependable" a strategy there is not a full meta yet so combo decks tend to be king especially if they revolve around non creatures to win.  there is definitely rush mechanics(combo) with flame dawn, but control isnt quite there yet as a meta strategy and is almost exclusive to the dod for viability. reanimator works, but the games real problem is that aggro doesn't work, the threat that one could play an aggro deck keeps the more rediculious combo decks out of cycle in most ccg's, sure killing things on the board works but ONLY in the context of going for a quick combo damage victory and scrapping the few early cards in your way(verore/flamedawn). aggro can't target enough things by default to be a viable deck strategy theres no "combobreaker" style play yet that works in competitive, its just too hard to get to support row and command center and in the exiles case your hand. They also have situations where most of the colors dont specifically play well with others and 1 or 2 play really well. beasts only really target friendly"beast" cards, but the robot faction seems to be able to pump anything under the sun, verore and exiles seem the same way it seems silly why anyone would choose the second in either pairing over the other because they then have to bridge the hurdle of ..... "my cards dont help each other in 99% of cases how do i make this a cohesive deck strategy" while the first pair are so cohesive with anything they could just throw about anything in there on sybol or in neutral symbol and make it work somehow. I wish they would hire me as a card / rules designer i think i could do a lot for them mechanically.\n\nall things summed i would give it a 8/10 very stable game if you're tired of how rediculious the rules are in magic and you dont like stack based games prefer a more strategic feel like l5r as opposed to a solotaire combo vs possible combobreaker style of play like magic. you will like this game. if what you want is to spam 10 cards in a row that your opponent can't do anything about because he didn't specifically sidedeck against you and then proclaim you win. this is probably not the game for you.","October 4, 2014","true","162.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The battlefield concept is interesting and adds a lot of depth to the strategy and tactics of these games.\n\nBut I feel like the game doesn't give you enough alternatives to earn in-game cash to buy cards. I'm also not happy with the game's matching ability. As a starting player without even a PVP badge on my first PVP games, it kept matching me with someone that had gold badges on everything and kicked my butt thoroughly every single game. After my third match in a row with this guy I gave up playing for a while, and soured my first experience with PVP in the game.\n\nSecondly, even though I've completed all the available single-player content, i don't feel like I have enough cards to field a viable deck in PVP unless I'm in pauper mode. So if you don't mind playing in pauper mode (and can find opponents in this mode), or if you want to spend the cash on one of the pre-made decks, you may be frustrated during your initial play against real players with full decks.","September 23, 2014","true","35.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In my honest opinion, Infinity Wars is pretty unique considering how hard it is to make a TCG game that seems fun and not as dull or repetitive as other games.\nINNOVATIONS: Simultaneous turns\nUnique effects that range from invincibility to ground units, to attacking if destroyed another character, etc.\nUnique character abilities that range from a LARGE variety of things\nA 4 Zone field which are Attack, Defense, Support and Command.\nALL cards are animated\nArtifacts and Locations that allow a deck built around them\n9 different factions, and more added as time goes on\nThe command section which allows expensive cards abilities to be used without putting them on the field\nAs you may see, it doesn't seem much. That's because it's too hard to write down without boring you with an extremely long list of excessive text which you or may not even read. But moving on, what you're actually looking for\nPROS:A very good Free To Play model and is by no means a Pay to Win game\nAn infinite number of builds can be created due to the large variety of cards\nA well balanced game compared to other TCG for not letting different factions have too much power over the other\nThis is not a brain dead game. An example of one would be, but not limited to Rush Down Hunter from Hearthstone\nThe staff is actually very responsive to the community and constantly listens to any suggestions\n\nCONS:The layout of the game may confuse new players\nThe game looks pretty complex to new players\nHard to start getting into without playing at least 1 complete story line for Campaign for cards\nBots are in this game (the bad ones that exploits game mechanics), but the admins will be removing them\nHave to wait 6 minutes for a person AFK in a game before kicking them and giving you a win\nHave to wait 3 minutes if a person DCs before able to claim a win\n\nCONCLUSION: Overall, I would say this is a well made TCG which gives a more military like spin to TCG as well as giving off a strategic mindset with all the new abilities, artifacts, locations, and effects, the only problems would be new players trying to get in to the game, and the AFK/DC system. The rest of the problems were made by part of the community that create bots to exploit the game to get rare cards.\n\n","September 17, 2014","true","33.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Normally, I would avoid games that have aspects of 'drain-your-wallet-to-get-the-cool-stuff' but I'm happy to report that after only 5 hours of playing, I have a few epic cards, and I'm really enjoying myself.\n\nGameplay, for the veteran MTG player, will feel very familar.  I like the layout, which is animated all pretty-like.  The cards themselves have great artwork, and it's not that hard at all to get a hang of the rules.\n\nThere's a few glitches or maybe issues that I'm not quite understanding -- when I play a location, the playfield seems to change to .. just a field.  The fortress disappears, etc.  Maybe that's cause I'm playing a nature/green/whatever factioned card?  Anyway ..\n\nDeck construction is cool, but the instructional video shows a completely different layout (a more useful one) than what I got.  It's a bit of a pain to have to scroll through cards instead of being able to sort them by cost, abilities, faction, etc.  I'll have to look more into that, I'm probably just missing something.\n\nOverall gameplay is quick and fun.  The AI for the campaigns is challenging, but I'm really looking forward to some PvP duels.\n\nHighly recommend this free game.\n","February 15, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You could probably spend hours if not days just planning out an ideal deck for whatever adversary pokes it's nose around the corner.  Even if you don't, there's plenty of starter decks, booster packs, and individual cards you'll earn over the course of your Infinity Wars career that will keep you coming back for more.  I like the unique card system, and the way you've built it the system would probably work for nothing else but this game.\n\nGraphics are rather intriguing too, with only a handful of effects but hundreds of animated pictures for your cards, not including all the flavor text.  Everything is designed well, looks great, and best of all, makes you wonder what sort of crazy new animation lies on the next new card.  However, some of the animations I must say seem a bit...short...or bland, to the point they almost don't need to be animated in the first place.  And adding in a few alternative effects would help, like different ways for the fortress to be destroyed depending on the severity of your win, how you won,  and so on.\n\nI'll score this game out of 20 for graphics and out of 30 for gameplay for a total of out of 50.\n\nGraphics get 16 out of 20 for the aforementioned cards that really don't seem animated.  Try working on those and the score will definitely improve.\n\nGameplay will get the following scores:\n\nControls: 10 of 10.  Really well designed card control system, which allows you to choose to either play the card immediately or look at its information before playing.  In addition to this, allowing you to see the new cards played is always welcome to help you strategize better, and keeping both people blind until they hit the End Turn button is a very good decision, very sensible.  The commander concept also adds in a rather clever twist.\n\nCompetition: 8 of 10.  I cannot rate multiplayer simply because there is no way to account for every player in the game.  I can however account for the Campaign mode.  Which is very good.  Campaigns slowly progress in difficulty, actually a little too slowly for my tastes.  I'd like a little more challenge before I hit mission 20 or so please.  Other than that keep it up here.\n\nConsequence: 10 of 10.  I cannot praise the card system enough in this game.  You will definitely be rewarded for returning and grasping a further understanding of your cards and how they work in conjunction with each other.  Learning which commanders you need for your deck and getting cards every time you get victories, level up, or do something noteworthy is a definite plus, which will keep you coming.  There aren't any real punishment as far as I've seen, which to me is good for a card game like this, since it's not meant to be a hardcore experience.  Outstanding.\n\nAll in all this game gets 44 of 50.  And that's a score I'll raise a glass to.

If you are tired of the liniear games and crave a little more stratedgy with the same kind of learnign curve you would expect from magic than I would say this may just be your game.

Not by a long shot but they need to make money so stop complaining.\n\nIt should still work but use code: 2145F while signing up for a few free cards.\n\nNote: You can also play against the AI in a long campaign.

Over the months, many changes happened, and this year, I have seen a lot of less players than usual.  It is beginning to take a long time to get into a game since no one is around anymore.  I am going to tell you the good sides of this game when players are on.\n\nGood parts of this game if players actually play the game.\n-Of course, less time-taking on finding a game.\n-More ideas from feedback.\n-Better chance of finding glitches that everyone hates, which contributes to the hate of this game.\n-The trading community would be more thriving.\n-Less chance of a new player competing against a Pay-to-Win player with major experience.\n-An overall strong community.\n-More interesting features and updates would have greater appreciation.\n-More people could help new players entering the game.\n\n\nSummer 2014-The Ascension update comes out with a whole new faction to play around.  The Overseers, one of the most game-changing factions.  Hundreds of new players were around and everything was just great, until the new faction was too overpowered for everyone to handle (Try out my old 2014 rebellion deck, which completly devastated the overseers).  Soon, since there were so many players complaining about this problem, the creators got the message quickly and balanced the faction when Order came out.\n\nHere are some of the bad things in this game.\n-Pay to Win (Mainly because only the Pay-to-Win players still play the game).\n-In-game issues, causing both players to sometimes immediatly get kicked off the game.\n-The shop.\n-Takes too long to find a game.\n-The uncommons are more powerful than rares.\n\n\nTo make this game better, everyone interested in Trading Card Games should give it a try, which could make a whole lot of new players joining the game, concluding in the increase of gameplay and feedback.

I disregard decking as a legitimate method of winning because it is simply not as practical.\n\nInfinity Wars resolves this issue by adding the morale pool in addition to a life pool. This addition of a morale pool creates more opportunities for creative deck building. A defensive deck is as legitimate as an offensive build. The simultaneous turns also improves the flow of the game and creates some interesting possibilities.\n\nThe Gameplay is solid and the Free to Play structure is done well and allows a player to enjoy without paying, although buying items in the store is tempting for the same reason I have amassed giant MTG collections.\n\nThe art direction is visually pleasing and the animated cards communicate the idea of the art well, both humorous and serious  ideas come across well.","June 3, 2014","true","15.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Of all the Card games I played, this one brings a new, unique play that is not seen in any other Card game before. This game involves a simultaneous action on both players on same phases: Both players draw a card at the same time, both players plan out their approach and tactic in the game and both players will see the results of their planning. This Card game is very fast paced and and you don't have to do all that waiting for your opponent to finish and start your turn. Also the music you are immersed on during gameplay and even during the menu gives a nice feeling towards the animations of the cards.\n\nThis is not a P2W. You will also be given free booster packs as with everyone else and a chance to do so everyday with your daily wins. Also, after playing through the campaign, you will be given a starter deck of their respective factions so you won't need to do alot of collecting for a pure faction deck as it will be given for you. And the achievement system also allows you to get more cards alot of the campaign achievments give a free card.\n\nThis game does have it's bugs and glitches, but it's still improving. It will get better, in time.","April 4, 2014","true","41.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Of course like any card game some cards are much better than others, but devs look to be active in keeping the game as balanced as it can be.  Able to earn a decent amount of cards if played regularly and have bought card packs from the 1st expansion and was able to build a fairly solid deck.  The biggest fault in the game is not auction/trading house, but just a trading channel.  This to me is the biggest reason I would rate this about a 6.5/10.  If they are able to add a solid auction/trading house would not hesitate to give it a 9/10.\n\nThere is a bit of a pay to win, but enough solo that seems to be expanding so you can still get to a solid level to compete against others, just a tad bit slower.

I disregard decking as a legitimate method of winning because it is simply not as practical.\n\nInfinity Wars resolves this issue by adding the morale pool in addition to a life pool. This addition of a morale pool creates more opportunities for creative deck building. A defensive deck is as legitimate as an offensive build. The simultaneous turns also improves the flow of the game and creates some interesting possibilities.\n\nThe Gameplay is solid and the Free to Play structure is done well and allows a player to enjoy without paying, although buying items in the store is tempting for the same reason I have amassed giant MTG collections.\n\nThe art direction is visually pleasing and the animated cards communicate the idea of the art well, both humorous and serious  ideas come across well.","June 3, 2014","true","15.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I can say it's definitely a fun game. The gameplay itself i unique while not alienating players who've tried other popular card games . They also add a lot of personality and life to cards by giving each of them an animation. The game is still in beta, so there are kinks they need to iron out, sometimes when adding a new card to your deck it might be marked illegal the next time you log in and you may need to take it out and put it in again, and sometimes it may take a while to find a match; but these are minor complaints that I'm sure they'll iron out in the future. Also, the game isn't Pay 2 win; their are know major cash shop items that give you a major advantage. Sure, you can buy card packs with real money, but your better off just buying them with the in game currency, it doesn't take that long  (plus you get a free card pack when you level up and sometimes as a daily win award.)

In fact, I have only played Yu-Gi-Oh! and gave up on it since xyz, tuners, six samurais appeared and became OP af.\n\nThis game can be really stressful while in a match due to its mechanics requiring you to re-arrange, bluff, plan, manage resources to fully make use of your turn, and when you're against a more experienced player, you'll always be thinking "omg, he might put it back to support zone... should I still target that card? cuz it might be a waste, but if I'm wrong, I could lose the game" This can be really annoying at times and I personally rage quitted some matches because it stresses me out XD\n\nAt one point, it will make you think that a faction is way op compared to another one, but I don't think that's true. Each faction has weaknesses that you can take advantage of. Maybe I haven't played long enough to actually see the unbalance between the different factions but so far, I think they're just fine.\n\nThe game is not pay2win. I haven't spent a dime yet, but I can say I am doing fine even if I use a deck filled with only common, and uncommon rarity cards. You don't have to spend real money to get the higher rarity/better cards, but might require a bit of a grind. Booster pack cost 5,250 Infinity Points (free in-game currency) which is a fair price considering they guarantee you to get atleast 1 rare. You don't like the rare you got? You already have the certain card? then don't be afraid to go to trade chat and advertise those cards you don't need. Chances are, there's one person looking for that certain card of yours. Winning a game (without totally running over your opponent) gives about 150 Infinity Points and 500XP. Every level up gives a free booster pack, but the cards are soubound. There's a free card for logging in daily and completing your first 3 matches of the day (cards from daily log in and match rewards are soulbound).\n\nThe devs, mods, and admins are active in global chat. The community is not bad. Ask a question, they would answer. I have no idea about getting support about bugs on purchases though, since I haven't experienced it yet.\n\nThere are still bugs (It's a work in progress since it's still beta). The cards are animated which is cool and the art is great too. The characters and the factions themselves have stories and they all connect to each other.

You can get lost in the deck builder for hours, and it even lets you edit the starter decks.

The grind for new booster packs can be a bit long after you finish the campaign however if you aren't looking to spend money. If you love card games though, Infinity Wars is a must try.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brunhilder/recommended/257730/","brunhilder","Alice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brunhilder/","28 products in account","The card game itself is pretty excellent from a design perspective, which itself is quite a feat when it comes to electronic card games. Most of them are just tacked on after a terrible exploitative business model. It's better than games such as Magic the Gathering or Pokemon as it leaves open much more strategy and bluffing. However, like all e-card games, it has a terribly exploitative business model where the idea is to frustrate the player as hard as possible into buying packs. This comes in the following forms:\n\n-You earn packs as you "level up" and complete campaigns. However, all these cards are locked from trading. This means they're useless unless they go in a workable deck for you personally. "Binds on equip"-style crap has bee cancerous since it was invented and needs to stop.\n\n-The conversion rate (in AUS dollars) for pack prices puts them at the same per-pack price and sometimes slightly higher than popular TCGs when purchased by the box. Anyone familiar with TCGs will know what I mean here. For everyone else, just know that in-game currency and real life money to spend on packs is heavily skewed out of your favor. Even with a fast deck, it takes 50 games to earn one pack of 15 cards.\n\n-The absolute monotonous grind. How would I know, given that I only have 4 hours on record? I watched my girlfriend play this game for 40 straight hours and her collection is still small, and of that maybe a tiny fraction is tradable. As tradable cards are only gotten through packs you buy expensively with real money or grind forever in-game.\n\n-The new patch is going to make it even MORE grindy by lowering the initial pack cost a small percentage then dropping it from 15 cards to 5. Each card was previously worth 350 ingame currency on average but will now cost 600 currency on average. Screw that garbage.\n\nIn short, it's just a time sink like every other e-card game. I hope a competent company buys out the IP and fixes most of its business model problems. That, or I hope they make this an actual physical card game which can be done easily with a few tweaks.\n\nI haven't even mentioned how glitchy the client is. Their garbage collection algorithm isn't worth crap as graphical elements from windows you accessed previously carry over sometimes to new windows which makes annoying artifacts.","February 29","false","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game is easy to get into but also has a lot of depth, simultaneous turns allow for extra mindgames and whoever can read their opponent the best wins. Cards take full advantage of the fact that the game is digital so there's a lot of interesting and unique abilities to discover.

It strays the furthest from the MTG formula (unlike hex) without turning into a tabletop strategy game (scrolls/coc), and without oversimplifying the game (solforge/hearthstone). The addition of simultaneous turns and the division between attacking/defending/standby/command zones and their units makes this a really, really fun game with lots of opportunity for mindgames. There are a lot of strategic choices to be made in this game.\n\nThe other great part is that it is also contains all of the key components that make for a great digital card game:\nCan you use one copy of a card in multiple decks? Yes.\nCan you trade with other players? Yes.\nBots? Yes\nDraft? Yes (and AI drafting practice!)\nCampaign? Yes.\nLeaderboards? Yes.\nGame modes? How about a whole separate set of cards for playing with a Star Trek theme, future themes on the way, and queues for Star Trek games, standard deck games, mixed/"infinity" deck games, merged deck games (both players combine decks and draw from combined pile), and you can queue for all of those modes at once with different decks for each, or play draft...\nCross-platform? Mac/PC for now, upcoming iOS/Android, possible WP8/Linux support\nPay to win? Hell no! This game THROWS CARDS AT YOU. If you finish the campaign you are a loaded, deadly weapon. Unlike other games in the genre, doing something as simple as finishing the single-player portion will give you a deck for every faction in the game, plus the bonus cards you earned along the way for leveling, making achievements, etc...You will be able to immediately make decks for any faction to your own design, no grind required.\nShiny and fast to play? Yes and yes.\n\nThe only drawback is there are still a few beta bugs in the system, rendering bugs or deck-picking bugs during campaign, but they're all easily worked around and FAR from anything that should stop you from playing this game.\n\nPlay this game.","May 6, 2014","true","24.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

(Hearthstone being the most popular as to exclude it) And other tcgs come close to it imo such as Hex : Shards of fate, Solforge, M&M, MTG; Although out of these i found that Infinity wars did not seem too convoluted in its system design; it was easy to pick up but hard to master. This was due to the almost gambling like turn system; where each players turns ended only when they accepted it. And when this happened, both players turns happened simultaneously. So in this perspect you can place some of your more valuable cards in safer zone. Pre-emptive moves among other intresting targeted spells would play together in this mash of motions.\n\n2) The reason that it was easy to pickup and impossible to master was the fact that you were given the basic deck of cards from each faction upon completing its faction campaign. (more of an extended tutorial if you will) Which served as your barebones skeleton of to which build upon; and if you so fancied the starter deck expands upon this. Although it feels more like an intermediate deck of which stacks on your barebares campaign deck. It was also very plentiful with the amount of card packs it gave early on. (as level up gave card packs) Thus by the time you hit around lvl 10 you should have had plenty of cards of which you felt were very strong to compete with. And as the TCG mantra goes; more cards; more possiblities.\n\n3) The meta of the game very deep and rich to say the least. This is because certain deck types almost always counter another deck type. And thus you had to either make you decks strengths more apparent, or your weaknesses less apparent. A good deck can get you carried higher in the ranks but as peoples understanding these inherent ideas grow; decks became harder and harder to counter. And thus there was always this arms race of sorts to pump up the RNG gods (random number game = equivlent to lady luck)\n\n4)As stated earlier the reason this was not pay to win was becuase you were given the barebones of which to work with. And given pleniful amount of packs which slowed down as your cards grew from level ups (higher level = slower level up). Meaning that your earned currency to buy cards become more valuable and thus the payed currency. But this was fine as you will have amassed more cards when this spike occurs. Although the missing powerhouse in your decks made you crave more cards as a result.\n\n9/10","October 30, 2014","true","214.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game is easy to get into but also has a lot of depth, simultaneous turns allow for extra mindgames and whoever can read their opponent the best wins. Cards take full advantage of the fact that the game is digital so there's a lot of interesting and unique abilities to discover. Overall I think that this game should be more popular, but I guess the skill ceiling scares off new players (especially people who have never played TCGs before), also be ready to clean your schedule because Infinity Wars is very addicting :)","September 9, 2014","true","18.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Forgive me if some of the dynamics reviewed are nothing new to a veteran gamer, as this review may be more helpful to the former.\n\nFirst off this is a very enjoyable game, especially starting out. The tutorials are generally very helpful and progressive, moving you further along the game's style of play, which can also be said about the campaign. There are around 8 factions that you can start out with at any point, and upon completing mission 3 of that factions' campaign you will get a starter pack (not as full as a starter deck, which you can buy for about $7.50 or a significant amount of in-game currency).\n\nI found the campaign to be very enjoyable, relatively challenging and scaled very well for difficulty. It can be easy at times, and then when you reach a mission where you might be struggling, as you reconsider the situation and/or play some of the other faction campaigns - and get their starter deck (for the missions allowing a custom deck) - you can progress. The campaign and academy missions tend to be "puzzle"-like as the situation remains generally the same and the AI will play relatively the same each turn, so it is rather predictable.\n\nThe downside to this "puzzle" style of the campaign is that it encourages trial-and-error for a repeat the "puzzle" attempt against a predictable opponent. Once you complete the campaign, unless you want to bore yourself to death playing scaled down AI, your only other options are pvp (although additional difficulty levels for the campaign are promised in the future). And pvp differs significantly from the campaign since players or their decks are not as predictable, although there is still a degree of predictability, which you build on as you become more experienced.\n\nAnd perhaps veteran card gamers may second this about such games, but you'll soon realize that pvp games are generally a matter of paper-rock-scissors, trying to guess your opponent's moves, which result in triumphant victory or devastating consequences for doing so. At times a miscall may be the end of the game or just a harsh blow, for either opponent. This brings an additional challenge since often you will have to make calls about whether to defend or attack, go "all-in", etc. Generally ability cards amplify such dynamics, as certain cards, for instance, may eliminate a deadly character if you can "call" or guess what part of the map they will be on.\n\nThe rock-paper-scissors style is augmented by the "luck of the draw" from your deck. Granted, if you can't get certain cards you need for a given situation, you may be SOL. And this is where building a custom deck can introduce another aspect of strategy. You can choose from 40 - ~110 cards to put into your deck, but obviously the more cards you have, the less chance of getting a card you may want, or need for a certain situation.\n\nGiven the starter decks as a free-to-play player, you will generally be pretty limited to common and uncommon cards with a few random rares that will depend on your luck - as you will get free booster packs as you level (a nice feature). Thus the game becomes limiting around level 10 or so, unless you opt to buy more cards with real money or take your chances (again back to that damning probability factor) opening boosters with in-game money - you'll probably only have enough money for 3 or so, which means you'll only get about 3 more rares and 9 uncommons. So as a free-to-play player, you're custom decks will be very limited, and this will probably restrict your play in pvp. Ergo, playing infinite or normal will pitch your deck against any other level players' - whether newb or high-rank. As a newbie I felt constricted to the pauper and merger options. In the former you can only use common and uncommon cards to build your deck, and in the latter each player merges deck with the option of choosing between each player's commanders.\n\nThe last game type is called rift. I thought this style was quite novel and interesting in that you get to pick a card out of a roll of 4 from most cards in the game. You do this 40 times for a deck of 40 cards, and the machine rolls will adapt to your previous choices. Again, however, this seems like it can be quite damning as you are very dependent on the rolls that you are given/ For instance, in my last deck I received mostly "common" type cards in terms of stats and abilities, while I ended up playing against others who had seemingly better rolls, based on their stronger cards. Veterans will  probably argue that it also depends on knowing which cards to choose given limited options, so that you can augment your deck for a certain play style. I would not disagree with this, but I still think the rolls can be quite variable. Additionally, the downside of this option is that the AI is very dull and unchallenging, while the pvp costs a buy-in of real or in-game money, which can be quite expensive. If you do decently enough - again both based on you're draft and rolling luck, as well as your skill - you can get good rewards, or make slightly less than coming out even. And perhaps if you get a terrible roll, you will get nil rewards, which can be quite punishing given your ante.\n\nSo if you can tell from my lengthy review, I quite enjoyed the game and would highly recommend it to anyone who would like to play a well-balanced free-to-play trading card game, if for nothing more than just doing the campaign. At the same time, I think that after the campaign, if you try to break out of the "newbie" category, you may find that you hit a plateau which requires heavy grinding (take for instance playing around 50-80 games to unlock a booster pack, which will likely only bring you 3 novel cards of which only 1 is rare; or around 140-180 games to unlock a starter deck, which, really, will only benefit you by giving you 3 cards or so that your starter deck lacks in order to actually leverage that faction's strengths on a starter level) to build a more advanced, flexible, and competitive deck, at least as a free-to-play player.\n\nPros:\n+ Interesting, well-balanced, enjoyable factions with competitive strengths/weaknesses\n+ Enjoyable campaign that can be challenging but encourages progression\n+ Best free-to-play perks and balanced system that I've encountered with an online trading card game\n+ Multiple game types and game options\n+ In-depth strategy system\n\nCons:\n- Limited pvp match selection, i.e. you may face a newbie or a veteran regardless of your level in unranked play\n- Ranked play and matches outside of the "newb" categories require more balanced and competitive decks which can be challenging to unlock - in other words I felt a gap between newb progression and advanced play\n- Significant aspects of the game rely on luck and probability\n- Free-to-players may hit a plateau when they want to break out of the "newb areas"\n- After the campaign AI become very unchallenging\n\nThanks for reading and I hope this review was helpful. If you disagree with something just remember that this is just one person's opinion.","October 26, 2014","true","115.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You choose 3 commanders, of whatever faction you wish, but depending on which cards you want to use, you will need a minimum amount of that factions commanders. An example would be having a specific faction card, lets say (Genesis) that requires you to have 2 of its factions commanders. For this card to be in your deck, you need 2 of those 3 required commanders to be of that faction, in this case Genesis. This allows for unique deck creation as you can have 1 commander from 3 different factions, allowing you to use faction cards with a required commander cost of 1, making it a unique and versatile deck. Or if your like me, use three commanders from the same faction and gain access to its extremely powerful cards.\n\nVery noob friendly with a long and informative tutorial that is completely optional to do, but I would highly recommend completing the first two sections to make sure you understand the game. The third is for more advanced play, and can take upwards of an hour to complete, due to learning how to use special game mechanics.\n\nTo make sure you aren't getting destroyed, multiplayer VS people is disabled until you reach level 4, which will take roughly 1:30 - 2:00 hours to finish.\n\nThere is a long campaign that is interesting and very fun, which allows you to play every faction in the game to better learn its playstyle and get comfortable with the cards they command. Or if you feel like killing computers for that much wanted experience, just play the AI over and over until you reach the required level.\n\nNo Pay 2 Win, you can pay for decks and booster packs with real money or use the in game currency to buy cards. (like most online TGC) If you do choose to sink money into IW, the prices are very reasonable and you get a good amount of cards added to your collection.\n\nLow player base, as its probably not very popular with the current kings of cards being MTG and more recently, Hearthstone.\n\nIf you were to ask me to explain Infinity Wars in a sentence, it would be (Its like the middle grounds of Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering: animated cards, complex at times, simple to learn and very fun to play)\n\nPersonal Rating: 4/5","April 22, 2014","true","20.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

The different factions each represent different deck strategies that you're probably familiar with. The flame Dawn Army is your Big Red Aggro deck, playing a lot of fast creatures to win the game before your opponent can stabilize. Genesis Industries is a robot synergy deck that lets you play cheap guys who eat each other to get bigger. The Warpath uses really cheap big guys to smash through your opponent's creatures and in to the win zone. The Cult of Verore is a control deck that makes it's own creatures stronger by killing yours. The Descendants of the Dragon is a turbo fog control deck that uses all kinds of defenses to frustrate your opponent until you literally win the game by draining his morale or playing a giant unstoppable dragon. The sleepers of Avarrach is one of the best, coolest and most viable zombie decks of any tcg I've seen. Using recursion and graveyard effects to help you amass an overwhelming horde of the undead. The Exiles are demons who reward you when you discard cards from your hand or sacrifice creatures.

And I first thought this when I first played but this game has its own distinct feel. First of all, you have cards, every turn you get usage point. You start off with 1 which you get less powerful cards but each turn goes up by 1 so soon enough you will have very powerful cards but like all card games, its all about setting a foundation. The board is set up in 2 areas: The left is your defense zone (or your opponents attack zone), you put cards there to stop your opponents from killing you but if you don't put any cards there to stop your opponent you will get hurt. The right is your attack zone (or your opponents defense zone), its the opposite of your defense zone. If you put cards there you will fight the other opponents cards but if your opponents cards aren't there then you hit the player if you get its HP to 0, you win.\n\nGraphics:\nAs the title says, this game is animated. And the animation is pretty nice, it has its distinct feel and fits this sci-fi atmosphere. I like it, definately when the cards have a little clip in them.\n\nControls & Smoothness:\nThe whole game uses the mouse, you  drag cards out but I found that you have to drag the cards out precisely it won't work.\n\nMusic & Sound:\nThe sound effects are pretty nice though I find a huge lack in music variety and nothing stood out.\n\nDifficulty:\nI found that the campaign was very limited to its playstile. As this is a card game, everybody plays the game differently but if you want to pass it you have to be full on offense and no defence if you want to pass the campaign. Which I found very annoying as your meant to develop your own playstyle.\n\nFun Level:\nI found this game fun when you were playing your own way which was really fun but the campaign would throw away a lot of players as there is only one type of style to beat it.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is great and really has a twist on the card genre, but until they can fix the muddled campaign, its hard to recommend this.\n\nPro's:\n- Nice animations\n- Free\n- A nice twist on the card genre makes the gameplay awesome\n\nCon's:\n- Awful and muddled campaign\n- Lacking soundtrack\n\nScore: 5.2","September 13, 2014","false","1.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Albeit the fact that the new single player is a bit more user-friendly, it's not so hard hitting--you are babied into playing Infinity Wars. Also it is much smaller than before. Multiplayer is good for the most part. You get cards when leveling up and you can also buy them.  However, don't expect to get anything besides cards for free. Card backs, game textures, and avatars all require you to spend real money for them, which is a big con compared to games like Hearthstone. A few pluses to mention.

Tfw burned out of Hearthstone and then finding out that this game has less RNG and way more strategy than "get topdecked / Rag-sniped and lose". The trader menu alone is top tier, you can spend 3 mana and discard one card to draw a card or spend 5 mana to draw a card. You are rarely ever in a situation where careful planning and card knowledge do not benefit you in some way, even in the most yolo aggro decks.\n\nThe purity deckbuilding system encourages more than just picking the best neutrals; most neutrals are outclassed in some way or another by a faction-specific card, some of which require you to spend more than one commander slot on to use. Your 3 commanders (appear in your command at the start of the game to be used when you have the mana) can be any character card from any faction, however, picking 2 Flame Dawn commanders for example gives you a Purity 2 Flame Dawn status allowing you to use Purity 2 cards from the Flame Dawn faction. There's a whole lot to consider when deckbuilding, as having commanders with passives/pay-to-activate effects can give you some great strategies without having to worry about whether you topdeck them or not. I played 2 Birds of Prey in a Purity 2 Klingon, Purity 1 Flame Dawn deck (dat Star Trek TNG card set gets me so ♥♥♥♥ing moist) and ♥♥♥♥ all over the campaign missions  vs. Sleeper faction easily by using a combo of Flying dudes, single target removal and defense golems, bypassing the Endless Hordes. Your deck can contain as many of the "unlimited characters" as you want like the 5/4 Flame Dawn charge minion and 4/4 Endless Horde (+1/1 for each horde in graveyard) and your deck can be anywhere from 40 to 100 cards.\n\nThere are a ♥♥♥♥load more of top tier features like how each card has a dope animation and how the game went through a fantastic UI update since release. Also its free, but you will probably be spending about $25 on cards like I did anyways because opening packs is even more gratifying than masturbating furiously in a dimly-lit public restroom while listening to a cacophony of loud grunting and plopping sounds from the next stall, desperately wishing to explode in a satisfying, gooey mess of your own filth, majestically defiling your own form both physically and spiritually as the boisterous bowel movements of your crapper compatriots flood your soul with metaphysical feces, leaving you in a spectacularly breathtaking mess, only able to squeeze out of your soul the oral and vocal movements of several words: "Infinity Wars 2014, ♥♥♥♥♥."","November 23, 2014","true","46.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","1"

I did get into a game but out of like 3 games 3 crashed to title...\n\nCard art is fine, It cool how they are animated but i don't care much about that I'd rather have a good game mechanics.\n\nUnless I missed something in the campaign, which seemed to serve as a tutorial, I was still confused about certain mechanics. also combat can be confusing, instead of just showing QUICK FLASHING SLASHES AND BIG NUMBERS I want to know what did what damage to what and why. I understand that there needs to be a balance and generally this is made for faster games. But I found it confusing as to how they attacked because it doesn't really give you a chance to understand it.\n\nThe "stack" like from magic is extremely odd, because both turns are "at one time" the priority is passed from player to player each turn. Maybe I just didn't give it enough time but I didn't like how it seemed like using spells on certain turns were completely pointless.\n\nI respect that they are trying to do something different from magic and all it's "clones" but unfortunately I guess I just don't like it. I don't like the "defense" and "attack" zone. I guess it adds depth, but I just find it annoying and most of the time kind of slows down the pace of a game that is primarily won by card value, not strategy value.\n\nSeems like Tyrant (that game that used to be on Kongregate, probably still is)\nbut honestly I liked that little flash game more then this.\nI mention it because they are so similar and possibly was inspired by it.\n\nIf your gonna go for simple and fast paced do it like Tyrant IMO\nand I know you can say "well your complaining that this is just a simple game where you throw better monsters down"\nyes that's true and Tyrant WAS that exactly. but I got the feeling it didn't really pretend to be something it wasn't.

Between the account creation issues everyone is experiencing, and the actual gameplay itself..  it's just not worth it.\n\nFirst, the gameplay itself..  it's ok, but it's SERIOUSLY flawed.  The game has no built in "counter" system.  This is rather hard to explain, but the BEST way I can describe it is by telling people to imagine the old Super Nintendo Mario Kart vs a Friend.. the first one to get smacked by a power up... lost.  It's the same here.  The first player to plop out a stupid amount of 10/10+ creatures in rapid succession ... wins.  Period.  There's nothing  you can do about it.  Decks are 1 dimensional this way as well, as there is no point trying to get creative.. just create dozens of mega creatures (Which ANYONE can do... even with the worst possible deck.) and swarm the opponent.  Honestly, it's hard to describe properly unless you experience it for yourself.\n\nNow, in OTHER cardgames, the Matchmaking system will provide a check and balance to this..  not here.  First, you wait an average of 10+ minutes for a single game.. and then it  pairs you (just starting out..) against a guy who's spend $4-500 in cards.  You get smashed in 4 turns.. (about 3-5 minutes.) back into the que for another 10+ minutes.  Repeat.  In fact, in the 8 hours I have played.. I have not played a single other "newbie" player.  Just people with a bunch of gold medals, custom avatars, custom cardbacks, custom battlefields and decks full of Rare powerful cards.  It's INCREDIBLY frustrating, and basically forces you to flush MASSIVE amounts of money to compete.  (Which yes, of course, is a staple to any cardgame.. but here they practically wave a banner at you screaming "BUY CARDS OR YOU'LL NEVER ENJOY THE GAME HAHAHAHAHA!)  The matchmaker woes continued for me as I played the SAME player 4 GAMES in a row.  ..  well.. it TRIED to anyways.. after he completely stomped me in 4 turns the first go round, I didnt waste my time on subsequent attempts, just immediately quit out.\n\nThis game, while cute for a VERY short time.. just isnt worth a long term investment.\n\n5/10","December 13, 2014","false","7.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

There are plosives, lots of mouth and tongue clicks (aka mouth noise), and every voice sounds like it was recorded on totally different equipment. Most likely they just hired low cost voice over people from the internet, and each one is using a different standard of equipment. Acting is also sub par. I would have rather had no voices that distracting, low quality voices. Additionally, there are various typos throughout the system. The most obvious one I saw was the word 'availiable' (yes, with two 'i's) in the opening tutorial. Nice.\n\nOn to game play, I'm a long time TCG player of various games, and this one is just a cheap knock off of Hearthstone, which is already a fairly boring game for those who are used to more complex and exciting games like MTG. Game play itself is marred by a very confusing turn system (which is unexplained and un-intuitive to new comers). I found myself stuck on the tutorial level where it says 'attack with all' and there is simply no button that says 'attack' or 'proceed' or 'go'. The fact that I have to carefully scan the screen for several minutes, check the options menu, and finally just give up shows a complete failure in this aspect.\n\nIt's pretty clear the developers here only cared for making shiny graphics and animations, and cared nothing for the audio, the user interface, or even proper spelling.","May 28, 2015","false","0.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","4"

This game should be talked about far more widely. If you enjoy magic or any similar card games, please try this out, it needs far more love. It is free to play, but not pay to win, as a glance at the store can tell you. The in game currency is handed out pretty regularly, the only pay exclusive items are for appearance (card backs, backgrounds). The campaign itself is wonderfully well made, with the the early stages teaching you how to play the deck the campaign is based around, and later stages relying on you coming up with interesting card combinations to win an otherwise one sided fight. The art is great, the game balance (as far as I can tell so far) is damn well done, and the updates seem regular. Please give it a try!\n\nUPDATE: As an update: 2 months in of playing it practically everyday, and it still hasn't gotten old. Finished the entire campaign, which teaches you rather well how to play each faction and various deck strategies they use. The AI opponents are rather dumb once you play against them enough, but PVP is very fun, and not the least bit stressfull. Even if you lose, you still get way more experience and cash than the AI would give you, and its very quick and easy to play the 3 games you need to get the second free card a day. With weekly quests to give you more free cards, and the 2 daily ones having a chance of being anything from a common to an epic (got 2 already this way), it never feels like you're stagnating. You can always build new decks and try new strategies, it doesn't hurt you to lose (in unranked anyway), and if you don't feel like that, there are always the rotating decks to try out, with varying difficulties of use. So to reiterate, if you like card games, play it!","December 3, 2014","true","51.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

You gain 1 resource a turn so no screwed games due to lack of resources. Pretty Balanced for as new as the game is as every single card has a use in a deck from what I have seen. The ability to have 3 commanders can be a little overpowered as some of them should be banned and not be commanders IMO. But I think its an upgraded version of hearthstone with a much larger selection of cards but instead of having class restrictions you have race restrictions which you can still create hybrid decks. Solid size enviorment I havent had any trouble finding a game in constructed or limited/draft I havent had to wait longer than 10 seconds for a game. Overall great game if you enjoy these type of card games and I strongly reccomend to anybody who enjoys hearthstone as its a step up. Game needs more advertisement though I think it has potential to be the best of its kind. Also message me if you enjoy this review and I can give you a reference code to play and it would help me out a ton :)","March 8, 2014","true","16.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The idea of simultaneous turns makes it more of a game of skill than look. That coupled with deck building, a huge number of different cards and "captains" that allow you to start off with 3 cards of your choice allows this game to feel a bit more skill based than many other card games I have played.\n\nI highly suggest checking it out. It's f2p with every card earnable in game, it's got a huge campaign and more cards seem to be added all the time.","April 3, 2014","true","17.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game has more of a  strategy and prediction aspect with their simulatneous action phases. Infinity War's has an extensive card collection already and enough factions to keep people interested. Overall I really enjoy this game, especially for anybody that felt Hearthstone may have been a bit to childish or not competitve enough it seems as if Lightmare will be supporting the competitive community in their game.\n\nThe rules are fairly simple and easy to pick up especially for anybody used to playing tcg's such as magic. The Art on the cards is great and while some of the animations are a bit lack luster some are also fantastic. Playerbase is beyond great all of the older players are helpful and support the new players with what they can and I haven't seen any rude players yet.

The game has more of a  strategy and prediction aspect with their simulatneous action phases. Infinity War's has an extensive card collection already and enough factions to keep people interested. Overall I really enjoy this game, especially for anybody that felt Hearthstone may have been a bit to childish or not competitve enough it seems as if Lightmare will be supporting the competitive community in their game.\n\nThe rules are fairly simple and easy to pick up especially for anybody used to playing tcg's such as magic. The Art on the cards is great and while some of the animations are a bit lack luster some are also fantastic. Playerbase is beyond great all of the older players are helpful and support the new players with what they can and I haven't seen any rude players yet. Lightmare is being very open and clear about their plans for the game without giving to much away which I like as well.\n\nOverall : 8.5/10 would definatly give it a try!","February 21, 2014","true","67.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm a MtG veteran (over 10 years of playing Magic the Gathering) and I never saw a PC card game made so amazingly good.

Although playing for free in Heartstone was perfectly possible it's nowhere near the complexity and strategic depth of Infinity Wars.\n\nI'm in total amazement, how small group of people could make something better than Blizzard.

Its quite easy to get into but seems to require deeper thought to master.  For a F2P online TCG, obtaining new cards is systematically well done and is even as simple as playing through the starting tutorials, campaign missions, and of course online multiplayer.  So far, the rewards for each match (win or lose) are plentiful including tokens that reveal single cards and booster packs as well as in-game points that can later be traded for more cards (boosters and decks).  I am only at level three and have already obtained about 5 or so uncommon and 3 rare cards, not to mention over sixty commons that seem to all be quite useful.  As a former player of both Yu-Gi-Oh (simi-competitively) and Magic The Gathering (more casually), I must say that it is immensely refreshing to play Infinity Wars.  The mechanics are fun and intuitive and the turn structure makes for much room to outsmart your opponents and keep them guessing.  In attempt to not spoil the game and all that it has to offer, I will simply say give it a shot!","February 25, 2014","true","48.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You gain 1 resource a turn so no screwed games due to lack of resources. Pretty Balanced for as new as the game is as every single card has a use in a deck from what I have seen. The ability to have 3 commanders can be a little overpowered as some of them should be banned and not be commanders IMO. But I think its an upgraded version of hearthstone with a much larger selection of cards but instead of having class restrictions you have race restrictions which you can still create hybrid decks. Solid size enviorment I havent had any trouble finding a game in constructed or limited/draft I havent had to wait longer than 10 seconds for a game. Overall great game if you enjoy these type of card games and I strongly reccomend to anybody who enjoys hearthstone as its a step up. Game needs more advertisement though I think it has potential to be the best of its kind.

The idea of simultaneous turns makes it more of a game of skill than look.

I prefer IW to heartstone. because this seems to have a bit more depth.\n\nI find the diversity in IW a big pro. Also not necessary to buy any cards - because you get quite some free booster packs by achieving stuff (single player campaign, pvp games, by logging in every day and/ or playing three matches).\n\nThere are a lot of different gameplays (merged for example merges both players decks, rifting which will build a deck befoe you start - and with that one you need to keep winning as much as possible, before losing 3 times).\n\nI did purchase some booster packs to help the development - and to enhance my chance on a few cool cards. But really it's completely playable (the campaign) without any purchases - just finished the campaign.\n\nApart from the regular cards, there are also star trek:tng cards - you do need to purchase that if you want. But apart from adding ST:TNG to your deck it's just cards, that you don't really need  of course.\n\nThe selection of cards to build a deck could be better, but since the game is only in beta - i imagine that this will improve in the next period.\n\nAll in all - if you like trading card games, i highly recommend this.

Infifnity Wars is an amazing tcg with new inivative mechanics combined with astounding animated are for each card. the turns are taken simaltainiously with both players having the same amount of rescources at the stard of the match, this game features a double win condidtion style of players which alters which faction and type of deck you play. This is what seperates this game from other tcgs.\nhowever it has 1 shortcoming- you need to spend a lot of time with this game to get anywhere in a pvp ranked envornment  (Without spending Money) this is because of the in-game Currency nothing really wrong with it except the average game win gives you 150-170 IP (Infinity Points) which would not be a problem if it were not for the OUTRAGOUS cost of a free to play pack at a whopping 5,400 IP which would mean i would need to win around 40 pvp matches to get even one. leveling gives you packs but with increasing amount of XP you need they are few and far apart. the paid price is reasonable at a $2.50 ratio and when you perchase the paid currency it gives you some IP as well depending on how much money you spend.\nyou could do an endless grind to get packs but the game feels like its pushing you to become a paid user and if you dont you fall behind because new sets are released at an average rate and cards that you own may become useless. also the cards you earn with Leveling up cannot be traded. trading in this game is hard to do because of the tier list that are mademany poeple ive traded with use different tier lists so card value feels non-existant at best.

If you're looking for a genuine free to play game, this is one that you'll enjoy. While I can say that it gets a little tedious at times trying to get the packs you need for new cards, but that's where I like the 'Master & Apprentice' system, it's basically a system where you can play with someone you've met, or invited to the game to be either your Master or Apprentice, and for each 15 minutes of play in game with that person, you both get a 'blister pack', you also gain all the rewards of playing an actual PvP game, but you get to play it with a friend!

As a ccg it has some interesting features, bearing familiar elements for those adept with ccg already. There are 7 main factions, a unallied faction whose cards can be included in any deck, and of course, the amazing Star Trek expansion.\n\nDeck building is virtually unrestricted - a legal deck must have three 'Commander' cards, which determine the types of cards you can include in your deck, and at least 40 cards.  Each card has an affinity cost, and as long as you have enough generals of the appropriate type in your command slot, you can put that card in your deck. A maximum of three copies of any card can be included, but you can break that rule by also putting those cards in your command zone (protip). There are also unlimited cards, which as their nomiker indicates, can be included in any number.\n\nNow where IW excels is that, while rare or epic cards can seriously affect the battlefield, some of the most effective decks I've run or come across use common, or even unlimited cards. I've had marked success in both ranked mode and tournament play, which are single pvp battles. These are further restricted by set types, including five different types of deck restrictions. Within these, if you are concerned about pay-to-win decks, there is even a merged deck mode, which shuffles both players card sources together, theoretically limiting the effectiveness of people with scads of cash.\n\nHowever, the game is balanced enough (imo) to not require such drastic measures. The draft mode as well is extremely fun, and also (if you do well) seems to be the best mode of earning the in game currency. Drafting players select three commanders from 3 4 card choices, and then draft a deck from cards that will come up in the same 4 card options. This means 0 wait time, as you are not dependant on other players to make desicions, you just draft, and then can queue up for matches at your own convenience. 3 losses and you are out, but the better you do, the more you earn. Once you accumulate 3 losses the game offers you the choice to purchase your deck, with cost reductions based on how well you did, and taking your entry fee into account.\n\nAnything purchasable in the game can be bought with the silver coins you earn from playing the game normally (infinity points) or by purchasing Lightmare points (terrible name) with actual cash. While grinding infinity points, apart from draft, is sloooooooooow, (more o's are really needed, but just imagine them) that is hopefully due to the fact that the game is still in Beta. No good getting people all jacked out too soon as of yet is the reasoning I figure. That being said, after beating the campaign mode, the tutorial/challange mode, and participating in 2 drafts, I have close to 600 cards. That's a lot of options.\n\nThis game packs in a ton of great features for being free. I downloaded it about a week ago, have a full time job, and have still logged 50+ hours. I have not regretted the ZERO dollar investiment, and it's pebbles to download. I run it in windowed mode with an average pc, and can still do whatever else I like while I destroy people in pvp. If you like strategy games, get this. If you like ccg, you are actually missing out if you don't start playing this. Immediately.\n\nThis is already way too long (most have you have stopped reading) but if you still are, one final note. I have spent all my in game cash on booster packs of Star Trek, b/c hell yeah Star Trek. So far I've managed to peel Commander Riker, Data twice, and mother-trucking Q himself. Now I ask, and tell me true - Why WOULDN'T you want to play a  card game where you can play WIll Riker and beat people down with him? Why?","May 18, 2014","true","240.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Then I gave Infinity Wars a dedicated afternoon, and that's all she wrote.  Now it's Infinity Wars and nothing else.\n\nWhen you first start playing you don't realize how many subtle mechanics there are that really allow a deep level of strategy and custom deck building.  Once you do; however, you quickly come to appreciate how intricate and sophisticated this game can be (and I mean that in a very good way!).  There are also a TON of cards and card combinations, so anyone who enjoys building a unique, custom deck is going to be in hog heaven.\n\nWhen you do give this game a try don't be put off by the generic feeling tutorial and beginner campaign decks.  These are simple on purpose I believe to ease beginners into the game.  Once you have the basics under your belt try searching the web for some custom deck ideas.  You'll quickly see the amazing amount of different ways you can put together a devious combination of cards to wreck havoc on your opponent.\n\nAnd did I mention the daily log in rewards, quests, tournaments, ranked play, leveling rewards, etc. etc.?  This game has a lot going for it to keep you engaged, and it's an indie title too boot.  You can't lose on that!\n\nSo, in summary:  This is a fantastic game, and if you should definitely give it a shot.  I'll bet you'll be hooked in no time.  :)\n\nAnd feel free to hit me up for a game anytime.","July 13, 2014","true","185.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Imagine fusing competitive pokemon with its simultaneous turns (leading to prediction wars, 50/50s, and a very intense experience) with MTG (factions with very different tools that work together to create hundreds of possible strategies).\n\nOk, so currently its not the most balanced game ever. The exiles faction is bothering many players with its RNG elements. HOWEVER this is not as serious a problem as many take it to be. This is not like Magic where any deck that isn't OP will never win. You can get by with a limited card pool without dropping $100 plus. This game is completely free to play. I haven't dropped a cent on this yet, although I do plan on doing so at some point to help out the developers.\n\nSpeaking of limited card pools, those without a lot of Rare/Legendary/Epic cards can play "paupers" where only common and uncommon are allowed, or merged, where the two players divide their decks amongst each other. These have really long queues, however.\n\nThere are a lot more features coming soon too, and IW2015 will be expanding on the already existing game.

There are various modes in the game and plenty of cards to boot. You have a chance of getting a free card or rarely, a booster pack of 15 cards in it every day just by logging in and an extra card by playing the first 3 games of the day.\nThe campaign mode of the game focuses heavily on strategy and bolstering of player skills so that you are fully prepared when you face PVP. In PVP there is also a random draft mode where you pay a moderate amount to enter. Once you enter you create a 40 card deck to face off against players and after each you gain rewards. But after 3 losses you are out of the game and you have the option to purchase the deck you created. The more you win the cheaper the deck becomes at the end and after a certain number of wins you can even get the deck for free.\nWhat is also great about the game is that all the cards are obtainable without spending any money.\n","March 23, 2014","true","44.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While it does fall under the Free to Play card game model of buying boosters to get cards, what this game does that many others don't is that it gives you plenty of cards to play with even if you don't purchase them. This is done by playing through the in-game campaign that unlocks a starter deck for each faction AND while you level up from playing, you get booster packs with each level (this is true up to my current level of 7, a booster at each level)\n\nThe free boosters are offset with the stipulation that the cards unlocked through free boosters and starter packs cannot be traded for other cards. This means to trade cards you must purchase them either through real cash or the in game currency LP (Light Points). As of now, I have bought 2 packs with real money and last night was able to buy my first pack through LP. I have to say that it feels satisfying, knowing that people do not get penalized for not spending cash on this game. People who do won't necessarily have an edge over other's, they just have more odds of getting Rare, Epic and Legendary cards through means of buying more packs.\n\nAs for gameplay, I really like the feel of the game. There's 2 ways to win; Destroy their base or get their Morale to 0. Destroying their base is typical: assault them hard enough to break through their defenses. Morale gives a different spin on things where with each loss of a unit, they lose a certain amount of Morale. If Morale hits 0, they also lose. I found this to be particularly interesting when I won a game through this way without actually trying. I had a decently strong offensive built and the only way my opponent could survive was through mass small units of defense that were just there to block my attacks, they also respawned each round. They held off my offense for quite a long time but with each unit that died, they lost Morale. Ultimately, they saved their Fortress but lost so many units in the process, their Morale hit 0 and I won. I thought that was pretty neat.\n\nPvP seems to be a good mish-mash of different decks and styles of play. Some seem to counter others better. I'm no pro at games like these but I enjoy them and I'm hesitant to play PvP since I, like most people, don't like to be dominated in any game. In my experience thus far I've won more games than I've lost and what's better is you learn certain tactics by seeing how others play this game.\n\nAs with many card based games, there's a lot of rules you have to digest, but if you stick with it, go through the Campaign and Academy modes, you will learn a lot and have a hell of a lot of fun playing this game. I can't recommend this game high enough.","February 17, 2014","true","91.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Simultenious turns system is quite fun and works perfectly on PC. All the cards are animated, it satifies players when you play a powerful dragon card and see it actually flying into the battlefield and dominate everything!\n\nCompared to other TCG games so far, MTG has an outdated UI and it's really annoying to click 7-9 times a turn due to the instant spell system. It works well in offline game but doesn't fix the digital TCG game.

On the one hand it has excellent game mechanics and in terms of strategic depth it's probably the best card game I've seen (including magic the gathering - also if you liked magic you will almost certainly love this game!).\nThat said the game doesn't have the largest player base anymore (only a few hundred people at a time now a days) and there are some noteworthy issues with it.\n\nRating of IW:\n\nMechanics: 9.5/10 (and I don't think I'd give anything a 10)\n\nStrategic Depth: 9.5/10\n\nBalance: 6 (it's not horrible and the margin by which it tends to favor certain builds isn't actually that big. But the meta has felt pretty similar for a long time).\n\nWelcoming to new players: Game 1/10; Community 7-8/10. This game takes a lot of time to really get into. It's a great game but expect to put many hours into it to get a feel for the mechanics, tricks, meta, etc. (To give a rough idea I'd say you need to spend about 20hours on this game just to get a decent feel of it).\n\nDeveloper Responsiveness: 6/10\n\nBugs: 5/10 (They aren't horrible, you can still play the game and most often don't run into them, but do expect to lose matches occasionally (around 1 in 50?) due to bugs that aren't going away anytime soon).\n\nF2P: 9.5/10\n\nSo with regards to the mechanics/strategy. This game uses simultaneous turns and resources automatically increase up to 10. The resources thing is nice (particularly if you are coming from magic, no getting land sc***ed or mana glut) but it's really the simultaneous turns that make this game stand out. Both players que there turns at the same time, on a given turn one player has priority and priority switches player each turn. The order of play is as follows: upkeep and comes into play effects, premeptive abilities, regular abilities, attacking and the other player defending (each of those resolves for the player with priority and then the other player and each player gets to que the order in which their cards happen within those phases) - although it's a lot more streamline when playing it than what I just described sounds.\nSince both players turns are qued at the same time and resolve without either player being able to react to them this introduces a lot of bluffing into the game. For example "Which zone is this character going to be in? One were they can attack or defend or back in support where they are safer from my opponents removal cards?" A lot of the game has to do with correctly and consistently anticipating your opponents actions and winning a game has as much to do with deck construction as it does with accurately predicting your opponent (depending on the match the second one of these can be more important.. especially in draft formats).\n\nCards: Cards are quite diverse and comprable to magic the gather in terms of the range of their mechanics. (Noting that magic has something like 20 years on this game, so more like magic back in the mercadian masques block).\n\nWelcoming to new players: The community is pretty friendly and will generally be pretty nice to players (well, maybe not if a player is complaining to them about something that they aren't really the person it should be taken up with, but in general). That said the campaign and challenges (a.k.a. tutorial/single player) is pretty short and it takes a very long time to build up ones card pool. So starting out you will probably lose a lot. Try rift runs because at least then the card pool is statistically the same for you and your opponent, but you won't have the experience with the game that they do and still don't expect to win that much for awhile. Harsh I know, and lots of players (both new and old) have given feedback on how to improve that aspect but,\n\nDeveloper Responsiveness: This is a game by a small indie company. They have a community manager and player support person (a different person for each of those). Both of those people are pretty on top of it and I do feel like the developers work pretty hard on the game behind the scenes. Also generally they do actually look at player feedback and address it... eventually. I've made several different suggestions (on rewording particular cards, new card ideas and various other things) as I've played the game and I've usually seen something addressing what I've mentioned (text being fixed to make it more clear, cards to fit slots that certain factions were lacking, etc). That said don't expect a quick response to anything that requires input on the devs side of things. My general feeling is that between coming up with new cards and fixing stuff that their small dev team is a bit overwhelmed and while they will get to stuff eventually it might take a few months - really pressing stuff is faster, but don't be surprised if this thing you feel like is really pressing isn't pressing enough to get addressed quickly.\n\nBugs: The game is peer to peer, meaning that desyncs will happen and when they happen lots of things will get screwed up and sometimes the match will just freeze (in game this is refered to as the endless turn bug/glitch). Most often this doesn't happen, but expect it to happen about 1/50 matches on average and when it does happen expect it to either cost you or your opponent the game. This might eventually get fixed, but from the communty managers responses/how long people have been complaining about it, I wouldn't expect it to happen anytime soon (maybe in a couple of years?).\nThat aside the game isn't that buggy, usually there are a few issues after a patch but they tend to get resolved within a few weeks and aren't too major (things doing a little bit different things than what the cards say, UI scrolling being a little off, etc).\n\nF2P (free to play): You get IP (in game currency for playing dependent upon how long you play (ip gain for a match caps at 5minutes into the match)) and eventhing in the game can be bought using IP. Also IP works out to being something like $3-4/hour in terms of spending real money on packs. Which is a pretty good rate considering that your getting that for just playing the game. That said, when starting out you will run into people who seem to have all the cards and be able to do these decks that you don't feel like you'll ever have the cards for. In general those people have been playing for a long time. It requires a lot of time and/or money in order to get a good card pool and whether or not the person has been spending money or not if they have a good card pool they have probably played for quite some time (notice my almost 1300hours on the game and I didn't start until this game was advertized on steam). The game does favor more experienced players, honestly less in the card pool issue (since there is a built in draft format that is a lot of fun and honestly better than ranked play, at least in my opininon), more in the fact that it's a deep strategy game and it takes time to learn how to play and then a lot more time to learn how to play well.\n\n\nOverall it's a great game, with some notable drawbacks, but I'd still strongly encourage checking it out if you have time. It's more one of those games to play for awhile, get a good feel for and then come back to it now and then (I strongly encourage long breaks from it when you get bored with it).","August 12, 2015","true","492.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But other than that its worth every card you play.","September 9, 2014","true","15.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Also this is a long ♥♥♥ review.\n\nThis is a great TCG, To start with you get a free card or even a booster when you log on, and after 3 games you get another card/ booster. You also get a booster every time you level up (A booster of 15 Cards) and your 1st 10 levels are faily fast to obtain. You also get a starter deck for each faction for getting 5 levels into each campaign and a booster for each mission finished. You also get a faction booster (Generaly 3-5 Cards) every time you level in a faction.\nSo right away you get a hardfull of cards within the 1st few hours of gameplay. Not to mention if you were to buy the boosters with real world money they have great value (In my opinion) It also only take a few hours of gameplay to get a large booster with ingame currency.\n\nNow for gameplay.\nThe gamplay in Infinity Wars is like gameplay that I have never tryed in a TCG, when building a deck you have three commanders and those commanders limit you to what factions you can use in your deck. Turns are done at the same time with one player having prioraty in a turn for spells and attacks to go first. you also have two ways to lose a game, one being health and other being moral. health is lost by you being attacked directly and moral is lost by losing creatures.\n\nThere are 3 battles zones. (Attack, Defence and Support) Attack zone is used to attack your opponents fortress. Defence is used to defend your fortress and the support zone is were most creatures are summoned to. while creatures are in the support zone for the most part they cannot be attacked and they cannot defend. but there are many cards that get around this.\n\nThe 7 factions in Infinity wars all have there own style of play. one faction may be a direct assult to the enimy base while another will use more spells then creatures. another relys on its grave to grow in strength.\n\nover all this is a great game I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys MTG. The game also has a great community that will be happy to answer any questions you may ask.","April 24, 2014","true","22.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This is not. At a time when f2p companies shill out insults like "dungeon keeper" and refer to gamers as "whales" to be harvested for money, Infinity Wars stands out as a small glimmer of hope. You can unlock everything you need to get started by playing the campaign, they give you a free card daily, they let you earn IP points toward deck and booster purchases that you earn just by playing, and they even give you a handful of free to play decks that are rotated weekly just in case you are too lazy to build your own.\n\nThe game mechanics are solid but are a bit hard to explain, there are other reviews that have covered them in depth so I'm just going to say the way the game plays is unique, functional, challenging , and fun. The campaigns are easy to blow through and give a reasonable back story for the game world. The multiplayer community as far as I have seen have been friendly and are generally good sports.\n\nJust try it, it isn't like you will lose anything by doing so, and I have a feeling you will be very pleasantly surprised if you give this game a chance.\n\nEdit Since my initial review they have massively dumbed down the campaign so that aspect is now unfun and provides no backstory.","January 13, 2015","true","128.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

On the one hand it has excellent game mechanics and in terms of strategic depth it's probably the best card game I've seen (including magic the gathering - also if you liked magic you will almost certainly love this game!).\nThat said the game doesn't have the largest player base anymore (only a few hundred people at a time now a days) and there are some noteworthy issues with it.\n\nRating of IW:\n\nMechanics: 9.5/10 (and I don't think I'd give anything a 10)\n\nStrategic Depth: 9.5/10\n\nBalance: 6 (it's not horrible and the margin by which it tends to favor certain builds isn't actually that big. But the meta has felt pretty similar for a long time).\n\nWelcoming to new players: Game 1/10; Community 7-8/10. This game takes a lot of time to really get into. It's a great game but expect to put many hours into it to get a feel for the mechanics, tricks, meta, etc. (To give a rough idea I'd say you need to spend about 20hours on this game just to get a decent feel of it).\n\nDeveloper Responsiveness: 6/10\n\nBugs: 5/10 (They aren't horrible, you can still play the game and most often don't run into them, but do expect to lose matches occasionally (around 1 in 50?) due to bugs that aren't going away anytime soon).\n\nF2P: 9.5/10\n\nSo with regards to the mechanics/strategy. This game uses simultaneous turns and resources automatically increase up to 10. The resources thing is nice (particularly if you are coming from magic, no getting land sc***ed or mana glut) but it's really the simultaneous turns that make this game stand out. Both players que there turns at the same time, on a given turn one player has priority and priority switches player each turn. The order of play is as follows: upkeep and comes into play effects, premeptive abilities, regular abilities, attacking and the other player defending (each of those resolves for the player with priority and then the other player and each player gets to que the order in which their cards happen within those phases) - although it's a lot more streamline when playing it than what I just described sounds.\nSince both players turns are qued at the same time and resolve without either player being able to react to them this introduces a lot of bluffing into the game. For example "Which zone is this character going to be in? One were they can attack or defend or back in support where they are safer from my opponents removal cards?" A lot of the game has to do with correctly and consistently anticipating your opponents actions and winning a game has as much to do with deck construction as it does with accurately predicting your opponent (depending on the match the second one of these can be more important.. especially in draft formats).\n\nCards: Cards are quite diverse and comprable to magic the gather in terms of the range of their mechanics. (Noting that magic has something like 20 years on this game, so more like magic back in the mercadian masques block).\n\nWelcoming to new players: The community is pretty friendly and will generally be pretty nice to players (well, maybe not if a player is complaining to them about something that they aren't really the person it should be taken up with, but in general). That said the campaign and challenges (a.k.a. tutorial/single player) is pretty short and it takes a very long time to build up ones card pool. So starting out you will probably lose a lot. Try rift runs because at least then the card pool is statistically the same for you and your opponent, but you won't have the experience with the game that they do and still don't expect to win that much for awhile. Harsh I know, and lots of players (both new and old) have given feedback on how to improve that aspect but,\n\nDeveloper Responsiveness: This is a game by a small indie company. They have a community manager and player support person (a different person for each of those). Both of those people are pretty on top of it and I do feel like the developers work pretty hard on the game behind the scenes. Also generally they do actually look at player feedback and address it... eventually. I've made several different suggestions (on rewording particular cards, new card ideas and various other things) as I've played the game and I've usually seen something addressing what I've mentioned (text being fixed to make it more clear, cards to fit slots that certain factions were lacking, etc). That said don't expect a quick response to anything that requires input on the devs side of things. My general feeling is that between coming up with new cards and fixing stuff that their small dev team is a bit overwhelmed and while they will get to stuff eventually it might take a few months - really pressing stuff is faster, but don't be surprised if this thing you feel like is really pressing isn't pressing enough to get addressed quickly.\n\nBugs: The game is peer to peer, meaning that desyncs will happen and when they happen lots of things will get screwed up and sometimes the match will just freeze (in game this is refered to as the endless turn bug/glitch). Most often this doesn't happen, but expect it to happen about 1/50 matches on average and when it does happen expect it to either cost you or your opponent the game. This might eventually get fixed, but from the communty managers responses/how long people have been complaining about it, I wouldn't expect it to happen anytime soon (maybe in a couple of years?).\nThat aside the game isn't that buggy, usually there are a few issues after a patch but they tend to get resolved within a few weeks and aren't too major (things doing a little bit different things than what the cards say, UI scrolling being a little off, etc).\n\nF2P (free to play): You get IP (in game currency for playing dependent upon how long you play (ip gain for a match caps at 5minutes into the match)) and eventhing in the game can be bought using IP. Also IP works out to being something like $3-4/hour in terms of spending real money on packs. Which is a pretty good rate considering that your getting that for just playing the game. That said, when starting out you will run into people who seem to have all the cards and be able to do these decks that you don't feel like you'll ever have the cards for. In general those people have been playing for a long time. It requires a lot of time and/or money in order to get a good card pool and whether or not the person has been spending money or not if they have a good card pool they have probably played for quite some time (notice my almost 1300hours on the game and I didn't start until this game was advertized on steam). The game does favor more experienced players, honestly less in the card pool issue (since there is a built in draft format that is a lot of fun and honestly better than ranked play, at least in my opininon), more in the fact that it's a deep strategy game and it takes time to learn how to play and then a lot more time to learn how to play well.\n\n\nOverall it's a great game, with some notable drawbacks, but I'd still strongly encourage checking it out if you have time. It's more one of those games to play for awhile, get a good feel for and then come back to it now and then (I strongly encourage long breaks from it when you get bored with it).","August 12, 2015","true","492.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Gameplay/mechanics are ok but somewhat overpowerd all over the place. Games can be really short cause a 40 card deck is used > faster pulls > faster good cards > faster game. The Cardart is average at best and the "animated" part most of the times is a joke... a really lame one. Please take my low gametime into account on this review.\n\nSo the Gameplay and Coremechanics of this game pretty much allow for the same things you would except of a cardgame. Control, aggro, ramp, graveyardaction, you want a certain heartstone/magic/yugioh deckstyle? you can build it. At first glance i really really liked this but i wondered why the games always turned out to be very short. Well only 40 cards in your deck so if your used to drafting and get your core combo going fast the game will end fast. Doesnt mean its easy to win. It's not cause its a lot more "poker"-type to play cause the turns are resolved simultanously. you might be casting destructionspells on the enemy killercard... and he just pulls it back to base the same turn. he saves his card, you get nothing for yours. Nice!\n\nThe reasons i wont be continueing playing and recommending this to any of my friends are simple. The cardart looks like the lower average user of deviantart has created it. I didnt see any card where i just zoomed in on it and was yawdropped by the art. Then there is the "animated cardgame" thing... the battlefield is a bad 3d type and the animation mostly consists of slight breathing movements or fast resovled 3 or 4 single frames. lame and also not of the epic looking kind. Also bad seems to be the way of card requisition. over the 4 hours gametime i had i managed to buy 3, yes three! cards with the influence points i got. yes i got boosters through quests but those where the starter quests. so there is no longterm benifit for this game. you just wont get cards in a good manner of time spent/card.\n\nnot recommended\n\nDont think this review was helpful?

A few days ago it was announced by the developer that they had parterned with an as yet unknown company to help with distributing and attrackiting more players to the player base. There is a very small player base, which makes it hard as a new player to participate in a "fair game." There is a significant advantage to those who have amassed a large card collection to use. There is very little fun in being utterly decimated in PvP and receiving minimal xp for losses. The AIs are not challenging if you are familiar with card games and do not provide the a satisfying difficulty. It may be worth trying this game in the future once there is a larger player base.","December 30, 2015","false","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Until you select the card you don't know what they do, it's no on the card icon. It just shows part of their name (only part of the name) and a big <quanity> number covering 70% of the cards' images. Makes it hard to tell which cards are which.\n\n2.) Sometimes hovering over statuses listed on cards will tell you what they do, other times they won't, it depends on the card, Made learning the game much harder.\n\n3.) This one's more Personal preference, but the cards are listed in a single-file row; I greatly prefer multiple columns of rows so I can see more than 11 cards at a time.\n\nThese three things just compacts into an unenjoyable deck building experience for new players like myself, I believe.","February 5","false","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The semi-scripted AI games and tutorials were VERY enjoyable, having been balanced in designed to provide a reasonable experience. However, PVP play is a different story.\n\nAs it is, PVP strategy is mechanically dictated. To win, you must build a deck that exploites -unlimited- (no limit on how many you have) cards enhanced by force multipliers and extermination cards. There are minor variations amongst factions, but they don't alter the basic formula. Once you've got the deck, you just repeat the pattern of play they enable. If the decks are evenly matched winning or losing is mostly a matter of who screws up the formula. Robots will probably enjoy it, I don't.\n\nI'd suggest limiting  the -Unlimited- class of cards (drastically). Force multiplier cards should be limited to one per turn and should affect only a single targeted card. No more every allied card in play gets +3. And no more every enemy card in play dies. These simple changes might add some subtlty to game play and reward strategic thinking rather than encouraging systemized, predictable, turns.\n\nI found the PVP matching system inadequate ... Clicking the -Only match me with other new players- button is a bad joke. I was consistantly matched with advanced players using sophisticated decks.\n\nAll in All I think you can find Better CCG games to spend time with.","April 12","false","22.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you're looking for something fresh that is not a yet another reskin of MTG with minor gameplay changes, give this game a shot. It's only 1GB and it's free, you're not losing anything if you don't like it.\n\nEven though the playerbase is pretty small right now, the other players are really newbie friendly and the game itself lets every player access 5 ''competetive'' decks for free each week, meaning that most of the time even if you are matched with a veteran (and you will, trust me) you still stand a chance.\n\nThe mechanics are very hard to compare to most online TCGs out there, but they probably come closest to Duels of Champions, with more flexible lanes, the ability to mix factions and, most importantly, simultaneous turns. This means that you not only need to plan your own turn, but also predict what the enemy will do! Once youre both done, all the actions will be played in order, meaning that it's possible to literally dodge out of spells way. There is also a ton of cards available, which is extremely impressive given the fact that they're all nicely animated.\n\nGraphically this game is the best looking one out there, even Hearthstone doesn't come close with it's production values. Each card is animated and while on some it's just a minor detail, some are truly impressive.\n\nThere is quite a lot of grind to get cards without paying, but it's possible, especially if you play the draft mode. The developers are working on a solution to it, so you may want to hold on for a bit if that really puts you off.\n\nDownsides? Well, the playerbase is quite small right now, meaning that you'll run into strong players a lot. Personally I like that as it's a proper challenge and I'm still doing just fine, even though I only started this week. Does take a lot of practice and reading though as well as some imagination when you need to guess what they'll do next.","June 19, 2015","true","14.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

For most cards you have to wait until your next turn after playing it before you can place them on the "battlefield".\n\nSo basically... you put down all the cards you can each turn, and then put them all in the attack zone, and then hope your units are stronger than whatever units your oppenent has.\n\nThere is "a little" strategy as you can move your cards around so that someone with a large amount of hitpoints gets attacked first, or perhaps you can sacrifice someone with low hitpoints so that your stronger units take less damage.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo basically.... it's a game of "who has stronger cards wins" and it's very hard to recover if you start to fall behind...\n\nIn a way it reminds me of old-yu-gi-oh, where you place all your cards in attack position and just overpower your opponent. However, in YuGiOh you at least have plenty of other cards that can counter this style of play, but this game feels a bit mindless.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThings I did like though:\n+ Animated Cards are a nice touch and bring cards to life\n+ Visually the game looks great in all aspects\n\nThings I did not like:\n- Story is awful, and is very hard to follow what is happening\n- Voice Acting\n- Not enough depth in the card-game\n- Lots of Microtransactions everywhere you look\n\n(I did not play this game very long so take it with a grain of salt)","December 31, 2015","false","0.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

They can even be found in chat,\n+ Simultanious turns means little idle time while in a match,\n+ It never feels grindy, and if you decide to pay with real money the prices are quite reasonable\n\nCons:\n- Limited playerbase, I have no idea why,\n- Game is not without its (minor) bugs,\n- While you do get a lot of cards to start with, they are mostly commons and uncommons, you will need to spend a lot of time trying to get rarer cards and cards that you need,\n- Card base is nowhere near as large as MTG, but to be expected from a relatively new game.\n\n\n\nLong, did Read:\nGreat for a free to play game. Playing thru the campaign gets you around 600 cards (easily enough to make a decent deck) and enough IP (in game credit) to buy another booster pack. It never feels grindy and it is fun regardless of what cards you own.\n\nAfter you have completed the training and campaign there is a solid match making system in place for when you want a challenge. On top of that, if you feel that you can't make a competitive deck with your own cards there are weekly free decks to borrow. While the game is definetely a true free to play (you can get all the cards without paying a cent), you will notice the strength of decks of more seasoned players. The main issue isn't the game itself, but the fact that few people have heard about it. Having said that, the AI is puts up decent fight and if you are prepared to wait a lil while to find a match, you are in for a treat!  Alternately invite a friend (it's free) so you don't have to wait to find a match!\n\nEdit: Spelling","February 26, 2015","true","40.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

You gotta buy cards with real money. You kinda can't have a card game that's free and still have trading value and a economy. Well you probably can but let's just infinity wars does it decently enough. It's a card game that focuses around factions or "Purity" as it's called in game. unlike some card games, you don't take turns, you place down your cards and then hit ready and hope you played it right. This makes the game not so heavily RNG based and a bit more skill based.\n\nUnfourtunately it has it's cons.\nIt uses in-game currency which is just a big no no in my book. It's also a big grind to get cards without paying. a REALLY big grind. You get a big sized deck everytime you level up (non tradable) but because the game is faction based you may only get a few cards you like or none at all. You can only have 3 of every card in your deck. This means once you get more then 3, the rest are worthless. There are "infinite characters" which you can have as many as you like till you reach the cap point of 100 cards per deck. Trust me, you'll get alot of dupes.\n\nIt's still a great game and has a nice community. If you can get past the micro transaction part of it, it's a nice game.\n","April 23, 2014","true","62.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","3"

Infinity Wars seeks to be truly unique by taking full advantage of the digital space, doing things a normal card game cannot easily do. We see basic things like animated cards and persistant health amounts, but we also see the major gameplay element of simultaneous turns, where both players plan out their turns, then once both players hit End, they resolve at the same time. This creates a game where you have to consider what your opponent might be about to do and predict their plans.\n\nAs said, I have never had more fun playing a card game, and I suggest giving it a look.","January 17, 2015","true","361.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

As an avid fan of Star Wars Galaxies TCG, Magic the Gathering Online and Might and Magic Duel of Champions I gotta say Infinity Wras comes in close as my new second favorite on this list.\n\nThe most important reasons why I recommend this game in short:\nYou get a ♥♥♥♥ ton of cards just for playing and fullfilling achievements (called Quests in the game).\nYou can actually buy booster packs and decks with the ingame currency you get rewarded after each match (never seen that in a TCG before). So you can theoretically completely free load on this game and just play your way to a good deck.\nThe most rewarding PvP format (Rift Runs) is played using a draft deck the plaer puts together from random cards drawn by the game. Thus it isn't P2W.\nTurns are made simultaniously and hidden, which adds a nice layer of bluffing and calling bluffs to the game, which I haven't seen in other TCGs before.\nEach faction has it's own specific uses and strategies. Making fun combinations of up to three factions makes for a lot of fun deck possibilities.\n\n\nLike SWTCG Infinity Wars has etremely nice AI challenges:\n\nYou start out with some turorial missions that introduce you to the important gameplay elements of the game.\n\nThat is best followed b the academy challenges that introduce you to some advanced strategies and gameplay elements in the form of pretty tough endgames that require you to find the right combination of playing your cards in order to win within or survive that one turn.\n\nThen there are the faction specific campaigns, that give you the back story of each faction, introduce you into it's dominant strategies and reward you with a nice starting stock of cards that belong to that faction.\n\nWith those crads you can put together your first own decks and test them against AI opponents in five difficulties.\n\nThe only thing missing are 4 player vs. AI missions like SWGTCG did.\n\n\n\nThe core of the game like in any TCG is PvP play though:\n\nIn "Normal" mode you can look for games in four different deck formats:\n"Core": Only cards from original Infiinty Wars factions can be used (no promo stuff like the Star Trek cards)\n"Infinite": Any card can be used in the deck\n"Merged": Any card allowed. Before the game starts both player's decks are combined and shuffled together, so both play with the eact same cards.\n"Pauper": Only common and uncommon cards.\nIn "Ranked" matches you play a best of three against another player with a deck.\n\nIn "Rift Runs" you put together a deck from random cards presented by the game. The cards are drawn from the collection of all cards that are in the game. Then ou play matches against other Rift Runners until you lost 3 times. The more matches you play the better rewards you get at the end of the run. And on top you can buy the whole deck you used for the run, the price get's lower the more matches you won on the Rift Run.","February 19, 2015","true","173.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The simultanious turn system is absolutely invigorating and forms a whole new way of thinking about which cards to play.\n\nThe game has a tutorial system for playing and learning the functions that will tell you what the phase or type of card is and then put you in a partial game to use the new fuction or type of card and allow you to learn without shoving information down your throat.\n\nThe free cards for the day can be both REALLY awesome or a common, but it is one of the few games that stay true to the "consistant login yields better rewards." Somedays I will literally login and play three games to get both free cards, others i'll get on and just play and get them along the way.\n\nWhile the levels themselves seem to have no purpose, every time you level up you are rewarded with a free booster pack (untradeable cards however.) In-game currency can be used to buy booster packs that do contain tradeable cards.\n\nPotentially my favorite thing with this game is it's ability to hold true to "No One Deck Wins" (similar to MTG)","March 28, 2015","true","125.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game is unplayable without restarting ever few matches, and even when playing it's really clunky. Building a deck is a major pain that takes forever since you have to add cards some cards in an obtuse way to get them into the deck, and if you're unlucky your deck just won't save, or card sprites will stick to the window, or you won't be able to add/remove cards from your deck.\n\nThe unranked play is an absolute joke. I played two games, went up against people that either grinded for hundreds of hours to buy the cards they had, or dropped few hundred dollars to make incredibly strong decks. I, on the other hand, had only the cards the game had given me for completing 19 campaign missions, and a deck that was legal and possibly decent if it didn't go up against decks that were stacked with Uniques, epics, and rares. The ranked play is locked behind level 10, which is a bit ridiculous and generally just turns me off of the game entirely.\n\nThe campaigns are okay, but generally they just give you a deck and put you up against an AI, tell you very little, then assume that you can use whatever trick or gimmick of your deck to beat your opponnent's deck. It's unintuitive and generally a slog, though some missions are fun, most are very boring or luck based.\n\nThe game could be amazing, it really could be; but at the moment it's a broken mess that I will not be revisiting anytime soon. This game is not fit for release, do not pay money into it until you've played at least a few hours and experienced the many bugs and glitches the game has to offer.","September 23, 2014","false","8.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It isn't as polished, I've run into bugs with where text is, the campaign broke and asked me to choose decks instead of using the set one for some missions, some card text is misleading (I've seen one card whose 'in play' actions trigger in the command zone and another that doesn't), but none of it is deal breaking. The animated art is of varying quality and some is rather amauterish. Sounds are good, though not up to the high standard of Hearthstone, there seems to be no voice acting outside of the tutorials.\n\nThat seemed fairly negative, but now for the good. The simultanous turns work well, preventing constant pauses to ask whether anyone wants to react without leaving one side completely still. The different zones work well into that and add some interesting chance for outplay. The F2P aspect seems pretty good, giving cards or letting them be bought more easily than Hearthstone though as reward cards are untradable and trading bought (whether with earned ingame or paid for currency) cards adds some hassle, especially for low value cards.\n\nEDIT: After some more time with it, and a bit of money on it I still recomend it despite some of my fears coming true. I feel like I cannot put together a good deck for ranked, but am hopeful that with a bit more time cards I get from daily, weekly, xp and IP earning will fix this. Some cards are bit useless or autoinclude, and looking into the history high level play has been dominated by single decks but there is variety lower than that and it appears to be improving a little. Rift runs, the versions of arenas, don't give very good rewards for decent runs, my first was a 3-3 for which I got back 800 of my 1000 IP enterance fee and an uncommon card- which seems OK except I didn't seem to earn IP at the end of matches so in reality lost at least 600 compared to playing normal games for just one uncommon. You can buy your deck at the end, but without massive wins the cost is very high. Doesn't seem worth it IMO.","December 19, 2014","true","154.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

When i was introduced to this game i loved the art and moving animations. Like Hearthstones gold cards except each card has one and its more in depth. What i love mainly is the different factions with there own awesome cards. I.E demons,robo-zombies, techno, beasts, and many more even cooler ones.

Despite its glaring flaws, Infinity Wars is fun and engaging for those who enjoy Card games.\n\nPros     Fun and refreshing gameplay mechanics for experienced and/or jaded card game enthusiasts.\nFive seperate constructed formats, two of which are aimed at new players with limited card pools.\nHas a small and shockingly friendly community of devoted players who are more than willing to help new players.\nDecent draft mode\nThe fully animated cards are beautiful\nKinda free to play\nCons    The price to buy the deck made in a draft is ridiculous (oh, but it's free if you win 30+ times in the draft without losing 3 times! Good luck!)\nMay be too daunting for players who are unfamiliar with card games.\nStill has a few bugs, some of which are extremely frustrating.\nDespite an extensive in game tutorial and campaign mode some game concepts are difficult to grasp.\nDifficult to earn enough "IP" (in-game currency) to get more cards, especially for new players who can't win easily.\nSeems to have issues matching players against players with equal skill level, probably because of the small amount of players\nIf you are looking for a perfect, completed card game to play you may need to hold off on playing Infinity Wars. However, if you can overlook some bugs and a little bit of grinding to get enough cards and skill to keep up, it will be a rewarding experience for a card game fan in search of something new.","April 4, 2015","true","37.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That game is just spam flying to win.)\nOn Day 5 I got Lightmare Points (Their version of the buyable currency that most Free to Play games have) for simply logging in. Conveniently enough to buy any of the 15-card booster packs, and not actually too far off being able to afford some of the fancier items like full decks and card backs.\nHaven't run into any bugs either, despite what other people have said about the game.\n\nBiggest complaint is that, yes, the matchmaking system does seem a tad iffy. One game I'm up against a guy with an overwhelmingly powerful deck, the next I end up fighting somebody using the most basic of Flame Dawn units, so that could do with some work.\n\nOverall though, it's worth a shot if you like card games.

The strategies are diverse and the gameplay rewards players who are good at anticipating their opponents moves. The game is free and rewards you with enough free cards that you can have a great deal of sucsess without putting money into the game. I have been on the top 100 leader board for several months now and have only spent $20 on the game.\n\nThe one thing this game is lacking is a large community to support it. My hope is that the sheer quality of the game will attract more players.\n\nFor that reason, if you are on the fence about trying this game, I strongly suggest you give it a go.

The rules are very simple but the depth of complexity due to all the different cards and factions is vast. But it all comes down to skill anyway. A good player with a bad deck can easily beat a bad player with an amazing deck.

It is fun. If you are tired of the simplicity and repetitiveness of meta card games like Hearthstone and MTG, then this might be the breath of fresh air you are looking for. Infinity Wars' mechanics are complex, it will take you a couple hours to get used to how some abilities work, and how the board layout works. The way you play and how you play are unique to IW, and I love it. I've played a lot of hearthstone and I've seen a lot of the same decks OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. This game will not do that, at least not to the extent of other games. Every strong deck archetype has a counter, and each archetype can be played in different ways.\n\nThe mental game is also unlike any other card game. Guessing what your opponent will do with what he has in play is a big part of being good at IW, and I think that is a huge plus and adds a lot to the game.","February 11","true","99.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That game is just spam flying to win.)\nOn Day 5 I got Lightmare Points (Their version of the buyable currency that most Free to Play games have) for simply logging in. Conveniently enough to buy any of the 15-card booster packs, and not actually too far off being able to afford some of the fancier items like full decks and card backs.\nHaven't run into any bugs either, despite what other people have said about the game.\n\nBiggest complaint is that, yes, the matchmaking system does seem a tad iffy. One game I'm up against a guy with an overwhelmingly powerful deck, the next I end up fighting somebody using the most basic of Flame Dawn units, so that could do with some work.\n\nOverall though, it's worth a shot if you like card games. Some of the animations (Timely Strike) are hilarious, and all of them are well done.\n\nExtra Edit: I crashed the game by summoning about 50 Inter-Dimensional Phase Bots and many Genesis buffers.

Its edge lies in almost endless possibilities of combos reserved on your choice of cards in your deck.\n\nCons:\n-Matchmaking is pretty much who's currently online in the game, since you don't know how many players are in there.\n-You end up battling the same player over and over again for about 3-15mins while looking for a normal game or ranked.\n-most game modes are there for show\n-Prices of decks and booster packs by IP are discouraging to play more.\n-Cosmetics are only purchaseable by LP. Only chance to get cosmetics is through pre-order\n-A lot of imbalances and glitches (common since it is still in beta)\n-Too many cheesers who will end the game in about 8turns as if they are cheating\n\n\nPros:\n-Solid community, since the devs and mods are practically online everyday to chat. Hence, they can improve the game through direct feedback and players will get their news faster and gain a heads up on what's being added/fixed in the game.\n-Wide range of strategy to choose from be it defensive or offensive type of battle as their is a Morale mechanic to the game.\n-Great and humorous artwork. Its animation makes it an eye-catcher to new players and veteran players alike as if you want to collect them all.\n-There's a rift run mode practically the same with Hearthstone; but it gives you an opputunity to buy the deck (hence getting the cards you need or that might come in handy)\n\nOverall, I recommend this game. If I were to rate it, I guess it's an ok game of 7/10.","June 26, 2014","true","599.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is different from MTG in many ways.  The first is that the turns are taken simultaneously.  You play all the cards you want either from your hand, or move them around the battlefield.  When you have made all the changes you would like to make you hit end turn.  Your opponent has been doing the same thing on his side.  Once both players have hit end turn the turn resolves, with abilities resolving before attacks.\n\nAnother difference is the gathering of resources to be able to play cards.  In Infinity Wars it automatically increases each turn, there is no need to play resource generating cards.\n\nScoring is also different.  In Infinity wars you have what amounts to two different damage counters, one for your fortress and one for morale.  If either one reaches 0 you lose.  If one of your creatures attacks unblocked it will do damage to the fortress.  When a creature is killed its morale value is deducted from its owner's total.\n\nThere is an Academy which will teach you how to use the different types of cards, with Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced areas.  When you complete all the sections in an area you are presented with a graduation challenge to help reinforce the subject areas.  There is also a single player campaign that will help you to learn about the different factions.\n\nThe game is currently in Early Access Beta, and there are a few glitches.  I have not run into any that make me want to stop playing.  As you play you earn rewards which can be turned into additional cards and booster packs.  You also earn experience points, and along with experience points Infinity Points.  The Infinity Points can be used to buy additional decks, and booster packs.  If you want to get extra cards faster you can purchase them using funds in your Steam Wallet, but anything you can buy without funds by using Infinity Points which you earn by playing.\n\nThe game is now out of beta, and in full release.  There have been some balance changes, some good some not, but it is still a great game to play.  There are also new expansion sets which add more cards to the game.","February 22, 2014","true","96.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game reminds me of magic, not In a ripoff way, but In a good influnce sort of way. it's good to have a foundation somewere, and face it, even if it's not had any influence from MTG, fanboys are gonna rage hard simply because It's a card game where you attack people. I haven't played the game long enought to report any bugs, but for now, with the interesting tactics thrown in, I'm going to give this beta a 7/10. It's free, so download it, what have you got to lose?","May 5, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

I've played 33 hours since i discovered it a few days ago, for saying that its still in beta its an enjoyable TCG and i may be slightly addicted already :)\nI would highly reccomend, and have, to anyone and everyone i know.\nLightmare are doing a great job and i cant wait to play the finished product and im enjoying the improvements that come with each patch.\n\nThe only complaints i have, and they arent even really that, are things that people have mentioned previously...\nPVP matches are a bit hit and miss with levels not being filtered or taken into account and the Exhiles need more cards to really be a functional standalone deck. I've only ever encountered one bug and it wasnt that big of a deal either. But its beta at the end of the day and i'm LOVING this game.\nGreat job guys!","May 14, 2014","true","86.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

This is due to the fact I had been playing a lot of Hearthstone and wanted something different. I had tried other TCGs and CCGs but I could never really get into them. I then came across this game and the fact there was simultaneous turns and deck commanders which peaked my interest. And if I'm honest, I'm happy I downloaded this as it is very good.\n\nI like the simultaneous turns as it adds a little more strategy to the game itself. As you have to try and guess what cards your opponent might play each turn. The turns themselves are timed so you won't feel like you are waiting an age for the next turn to be played.\n\nThe battlefield itself is a nice touch as you have 4 zones: Defense, Assualt, Support & Commander (More on that in a little bit). Defense and Assault do what they say, Defense is where you put cards to protect your hit points, Assault is where you put cards to attack your opponent. Support is where most of your cards will be placed when they are played unless they have an ability that lets them be played straight away. As in most cases, you are planning for your next turn and where you want the cards you just played in the Support zone to go. All the zones can be seen by each player so this lets you plan ahead or try and guess where you opponent will play their cards.\n\nThe deck commanders is also an interesting idea and for this game, it does work. You can choose to have 3 commanders all from the one faction or a commander from 3 different factions. Keep in mind that this can change how much of a choice you have when creating your own deck. As if you choose to only have 3 commanders from one faction, then you can only choose cards from that faction. Adding a different faction commander lets you use that faction. And they can also be played like normal cards. So if you don't think you have anything in your hand that is suitable, you can play one of them instead. And try and change the outcome a little or a lot.\n\nThe commanders themselves are placed in the Command Zone of the battlefield where they lie in wait for you to use them. They can go straight to the Assault of Defense Zone so long as you have enough mana to play them. And they are in full view always so your opponent knows that they are there. During each turn you have to decide where to move your cards, should you keep it in your assault zone and try and take out some more of your enemies health? Or do you think you need to boslter your defenses a little?\n\nYou have two sets of hit points as well: Health & Morale. Health is your typical bread and butter health of any TCGs and CCGs. Morale is something a little different. Nearly all cards have "Morale", which means when it gets destroyed, you will lose how much morale that card had. If you run out of Morale, then you also lose regardless how much health you had remaining so that is something else you need to keep an eye on whilst dueling.\n\nThis all probably sounds confusing but there is a an option in game to help you practice and learn the rules of the game and even a campaign in which you earns cards for each faction as you progress through it. And you get a free card every day you log into the game. It is only once a day it happens so don't expect it every single time you log in. There are also quests that once completed, give you cards to add to your ever growing collection. New cards are also released nearly every week and new sets of cards are released every few months. And you can also trade cards with friends. And the developers have said that: "THERE WILL NEVER BE EXCLUSIVE CARDS THAT ONLY A SELECT FEW CAN EARN." As pratically everything in the game can be bought with Infinity Points (IP) which are automatically gained from playing matches and cost no money. In fact most things in the store (aside from cosmetic touches) can be bought with IP. So you never need to buy anything with real money... ever.\n\nNext we come to the animation which I just love. Each card is fully animated and all look amazing. I coud happily spend a lot of time in this game just looking at the cards and most of the time I do. Also included is the option to play weekly free decks given to you so if you are finding it hard to create a deck that helps you win matches, try one of the free decks and see if that works for you.\n\nBut before you go headfirst into your 1st PvP match, I suggest you play the campaign 1st, this will give you an idea what to expect from all the factions in the game and what cards you might find.

This will probably be the only time i will ever rate a game this high, but right now when you compare this game to ANY CCG/TCG pay or free this out does it every time. So that being said i'm reviewing this game from a card player point of view so lets go\n\nPros\nLOTS of cards and growing\nBy doing the campaign you should walking away with around 700 cards for all factions.\nEach faction feels like own/very different from the others and mixing factions can give cool results\nEvery turn, you and the other player all do things at the same time, with players switching priorty each turn.\nAll the cards are animated on top of (foil,platinum and gold cards)\nEach day you log in you get a free card of random faction and rareity (no quest or money a day and yes this is good)\nAnd if you feel the decks you have are just took weak, every week there are 5 new decks premade for you to play in most the modes of the game\nThe devs are pretty cool and interactive with everyone (also very busy always updating and working on the game)\nCons\nPlayer base is not as big as, i myself would like.\nIf you are used to games like Hearthstone or not used to CCG/TCGS you might have a harder time with the skill curve in here\nIt does take a little while to be able to buy a single pack with in game currency\nthe matches take a little longer then a match in Heathstone\n\nWell that is pretty much it for my review. I really with i could of been critical and sound a lot less like a advertisment for the game, but really this game is easily the best out there right now and there is no reason if you like card games to not download this and give it a try. Also for those who might be mad at me for using Heathstone as a comparison a lot, it is the top played card game right now. So that would be this games biggest competition and more people played Hearthstone so they will no more of what i'm talking about in the regard.\n","November 27, 2014","true","23.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So that being said i'm reviewing this game from a card player point of view so lets go\n\nPros\nLOTS of cards and growing\nBy doing the campaign you should walking away with around 700 cards for all factions.\nEach faction feels like own/very different from the others and mixing factions can give cool results\nEvery turn, you and the other player all do things at the same time, with players switching priorty each turn.\nAll the cards are animated on top of (foil,platinum and gold cards)\nEach day you log in you get a free card of random faction and rareity (no quest or money a day and yes this is good)\nAnd if you feel the decks you have are just took weak, every week there are 5 new decks premade for you to play in most the modes of the game\nThe devs are pretty cool and interactive with everyone (also very busy always updating and working on the game)\nCons\nPlayer base is not as big as, i myself would like.\nIf you are used to games like Hearthstone or not used to CCG/TCGS you might have a harder time with the skill curve in here\nIt does take a little while to be able to buy a single pack with in game currency\nthe matches take a little longer then a match in Heathstone\n\nWell that is pretty much it for my review. I really with i could of been critical and sound a lot less like a advertisment for the game, but really this game is easily the best out there right now and there is no reason if you like card games to not download this and give it a try. Also for those who might be mad at me for using Heathstone as a comparison a lot, it is the top played card game right now. So that would be this games biggest competition and more people played Hearthstone so they will no more of what i'm talking about in the regard.\n","November 27, 2014","true","23.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Despite its glaring flaws, Infinity Wars is fun and engaging for those who enjoy Card games.\n\nPros     Fun and refreshing gameplay mechanics for experienced and/or jaded card game enthusiasts.\nFive seperate constructed formats, two of which are aimed at new players with limited card pools.\nHas a small and shockingly friendly community of devoted players who are more than willing to help new players.\nDecent draft mode\nThe fully animated cards are beautiful\nKinda free to play\nCons    The price to buy the deck made in a draft is ridiculous (oh, but it's free if you win 30+ times in the draft without losing 3 times! Good luck!)\nMay be too daunting for players who are unfamiliar with card games.\nStill has a few bugs, some of which are extremely frustrating.\nDespite an extensive in game tutorial and campaign mode some game concepts are difficult to grasp.\nDifficult to earn enough "IP" (in-game currency) to get more cards, especially for new players who can't win easily.\nSeems to have issues matching players against players with equal skill level, probably because of the small amount of players\nIf you are looking for a perfect, completed card game to play you may need to hold off on playing Infinity Wars. However, if you can overlook some bugs and a little bit of grinding to get enough cards and skill to keep up, it will be a rewarding experience for a card game fan in search of something new.","April 4, 2015","true","37.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I came in to the game, honestly expecting it to suck. I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only was the game fun, it was easy to learn. As the title of the game shows the cards themselves are indeed animated and there is a lot going on besides just the standard "lay card on table" gameplay. I find the fact that there are quite a few modes to play and a large number of themed factions another thing this game has going for it. So far there seems to be a good amount of players but only time will tell if that will last. You have some say as well after all, you should try it you might just find a new favorite.","February 20, 2014","true","10.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You should know however I only played a few TCG online and only 2 in RL. Maybe thats helpfull for other ppl without TCG experience.\n\nI want to point out the 3 factors why I love this game so far:\n- Interesting mechanics\nThis game is very different to other TCGs. Its a great advantage, IF you like this. You have to try it out (not only for 3 hours), than you can decide. Imo it has a fresh mechanic that enables various interesting aproaches and mindgames.\nBe aware that you have "learn" some effects first, but they are rly well described ingame, also you can see this helptext every time you hover over the cards (also during a game).\n\nEvery game you wanna play longer HAS TO HAVE ITS STRENGTH IN THIS AREA!\nIf the mechanic is to simple, you wont play it that long. In this game, you discover interesting moves and synergies as you play erverytime.\n\n- Great community\nI dont know what decides how a community acts, but for this game the community is a big plus. You will need the ppl for two aspects. As there is a complex mechanic, its always good to get some helpfull tips, new ideas and such. This community will provide it. There are many friendly ppl who help all the newcomers if they have some questions or need some input for their decks.\nSecond, this is a trading game. Ofc not all ppl are the same, but I met so many ppl that not only provided FAIR trades to newcommer, no, they also made trades in my favor because I still have a rather small collection in comparism to others. This is the second important fact.\n\n- F2P\nThis is probably the most important information for ALL F2P games. There is and will always be a debatte about the "fairness" of a given game in the F2P aspect.\nFirst, you can start very smooth and will get ALOT cards as a new player FAST. You are also guaranteed to get some better (rarer!) cards during that periode. IF you are lucky, you get ever more rarer cards instead. However, as in every TGC, if you have 100 cards in the end, you will only have a few rares, no matter if they are "rare" "epic" or "legendary" using the ingame-terms.\nSecond, you always get free cards for login, daily wins and quests. Again, some of them are fixed, some of the prices are random (your luck decides!).\n\nThat means, if you start out, it compares to the fairest F2P games that are currently know. Why is there still a debatte? Because there is the midgame part. Imho this is the part where changes are needed. You have 3 problems after the early period (remember, this starts to happen after 150+ hours, THEN you enter the midgame periode.\n\nFirst, level ups are getting more and more harder (you need more exp for every level) and the highest lvl is currently 50. I am at lvl 27 myself. If you are a more or less casual gamer with only a couple games a day, you will start to feel it. That means the free booster (15 cards) will come on a greater periode.\nSecond, the boosters with ingame money are fair priced, but again as casual it takes some time to get them.\nThird, you can only trade with cards you have got with ingame or real money. So, you get less free cards, but you cant earn ingame money faster. This is the point where alot ppl write the "negativ" reports about how P2W this game is. Dont believe them. I am at this lvl NOW. I have some very competiv decks where I got a good win rate. You can also play "rift-mode" if you are at least decent to earn free cards, then you pick you cards and play vs other ppl with picked decks where your and their own cardpool is irrelevant.\n\nThere are some ideas how to "smooth" this period of play, and the developers are currently discussing this intern. So I guess we will see some improvment on the midgame. So far, IW falls of the highest fairness lvl during this time, but its still nowhere near P2W.\n\nSo, this are the three big features, where I wrote the most about F2P, but i think its important to know. There are some negatives ofc, so I will just list them here:\n- Midgame needs more F2P input\n- DEVs should focus abit more on fixes, less on new content atm\n- DEVs should learn from patches and DONT do them on fridays :)\n\nHowever, TRY IT OUT YOURSELF for some time (at least 25H+), its F2P after all!\nSee you on the battlefield.\n\n","June 16, 2014","true","268.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Ofc not all ppl are the same, but I met so many ppl that not only provided FAIR trades to newcommer, no, they also made trades in my favor because I still have a rather small collection in comparism to others. This is the second important fact.\n\n- F2P\nThis is probably the most important information for ALL F2P games. There is and will always be a debatte about the "fairness" of a given game in the F2P aspect.\nFirst, you can start very smooth and will get ALOT cards as a new player FAST. You are also guaranteed to get some better (rarer!) cards during that periode. IF you are lucky, you get ever more rarer cards instead. However, as in every TGC, if you have 100 cards in the end, you will only have a few rares, no matter if they are "rare" "epic" or "legendary" using the ingame-terms.\nSecond, you always get free cards for login, daily wins and quests. Again, some of them are fixed, some of the prices are random (your luck decides!).\n\nThat means, if you start out, it compares to the fairest F2P games that are currently know. Why is there still a debatte? Because there is the midgame part. Imho this is the part where changes are needed. You have 3 problems after the early period (remember, this starts to happen after 150+ hours, THEN you enter the midgame periode.\n\nFirst, level ups are getting more and more harder (you need more exp for every level) and the highest lvl is currently 50. I am at lvl 27 myself. If you are a more or less casual gamer with only a couple games a day, you will start to feel it. That means the free booster (15 cards) will come on a greater periode.\nSecond, the boosters with ingame money are fair priced, but again as casual it takes some time to get them.\nThird, you can only trade with cards you have got with ingame or real money. So, you get less free cards, but you cant earn ingame money faster. This is the point where alot ppl write the "negativ" reports about how P2W this game is. Dont believe them. I am at this lvl NOW. I have some very competiv decks where I got a good win rate. You can also play "rift-mode" if you are at least decent to earn free cards, then you pick you cards and play vs other ppl with picked decks where your and their own cardpool is irrelevant.\n\nThere are some ideas how to "smooth" this period of play, and the developers are currently discussing this intern. So I guess we will see some improvment on the midgame. So far, IW falls of the highest fairness lvl during this time, but its still nowhere near P2W.\n\nSo, this are the three big features, where I wrote the most about F2P, but i think its important to know. There are some negatives ofc, so I will just list them here:\n- Midgame needs more F2P input\n- DEVs should focus abit more on fixes, less on new content atm\n- DEVs should learn from patches and DONT do them on fridays :)\n\nHowever, TRY IT OUT YOURSELF for some time (at least 25H+), its F2P after all!\nSee you on the battlefield.\n\n","June 16, 2014","true","268.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It lacks Hearthstone's puzzle element and simplicity, there's just not the same feeling of trying to predict and counter the opponent's strategy. The simultaneous turns helps with this a LITTLE bit, but it's just not good enough. Also, cards aren't as easy to come by without trading. And in comparison to Magic The Gathering it just doesn't have quite the same level of depth and option that MTG's massive amount of cards has.\n\nBut I'd still put this as miles better than any other TCG!

I was expecting something with boring minimal strategy like Hearthstone, but what I got is a system akin to Magic the Gathering; it's just as complex and engaging with a few of its own unique mechanics. I appreciated the tutorial battles, which had minimal hand-holding while still explaining everything very well. The few AI battles I’ve had outside the tutorial so far were challenging enough to be fun, but not so challenging that I felt like the AI was cheating. I look forward to learning more about the system and building my own decks!","February 13","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've played this a lot on and off for a couple years since when I've tried other TCGs such as Hearthstone too. And my final conclusion is that Inifity Wars is the best digital card game out there. Here's why:\n\n- F2P model is fine. Free cards every day you log on/Play you first few game/Complete Quests & Acheivements\n- Incredible art on the cards\n- Brilliant universe for the cards... it's creepy and enthralling with a great take on the undead\n- Final Fantasy grade soundtrack\n- The deepest strategy out of any TCG I've played by far\n- Simultaneous turns (Less waiting around and it allows for more complex strategies)\n- Wonderful, imaginative faction/classes which are MIXABLE in each deck you create.\n- Massive amount of cards and strategies\n\nThe only cons that I can see really are:\n\n- Why isn't this game getting more attention?\n- Although the game itself is very tight, the program and gui itself could use a little work.\n- The menu system could be better, smoother and streamlined etc.","August 24, 2015","true","261.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some of these succeed, while others do not.\n\nFirstly, and unfortunately most importantly, the game is genuinely free to play. It isn't Heartstone free to play, where non-paying players need to grind for years to accumulate the same quality of cards as someone who spends $1000. IW lives up to its name. A new player has the potential to build a competitive deck from just the cards he receives from the tutorial, and initial booster packs ('soulbound packs'). Those who choose to spend are able to gain platinum cards (just shiny), better artwork, sounds, effects, etc, and more cards to play with, BUT THESE CARDS ARE NOT NECESSARILY ANY BETTER. They are just more options to explore should you get bored of using the same, but highly effective, strategy every game. No cards are locked behind a pay-wall, although if you want to build a deck with 10+ legendaries in it (that is NOT NECESSARILY BETTER THAN A DECK WITH 0 LEGENDARIES), be prepared to pay or grind.\n\nThere isn't much to say about the artworks or effects. If you like them, great. If not, you don't. There's no option to turn them off, but then again, we aren't playing Microsoft Excel.\n\nThe community is also extremely active, for its size. It is certainly no Heartstone, which has the publishing collosus of Blizzard behind it, nor is it Yugioh, where even in my relatively small town there are frequently 20-30 player tournaments with prizes. The developers, too, are frequently active on the forums, and this game has been patched at once a month since I began to play. I say this with absolute confidence; if this game has a larger player base, it has the potential to lead the market with its innovation and new ideas.\n\nWhy, then, do I NOT recommend this game for you?\n\nIt's free, so there's no harm trying. But as you progress beyond Puffy the Fish and encounter more and more cards and combinations, you will realise one serious flaw in the game design. The devs have shown they are not a money laundering scheme, and genuinely wish to see this game develop into something for the gamers to enjoy. They design and maintain their game with all the best intentions, but unfortunately in this case it does not equate to results.\n\nInfinity Wars has a unique turn system unlike Heartstone, MTG, Yugioh, etc. I remember something similar in some Marvel DC comic card game ages ago, and that is that both players have their turns at the same time. Not only is this extremely confusing for new players (this, and the copious amount of addon-systems that are needed as a result, to determine things like card resolution order, etc), it is also fundamentally incompatible with their card design, which follows a far more traditional MTG/Yugioh approach.\n\nIn short,  the cards for this game do not match the rules for this game. It is like eating Butter Chicken Flavoured Ice Cream, driving to work in a $2999 bottle of wine eating your favourite hamburger while diving into a beautiful coral reef. Oil and water don't mix. Or, for a more contextual example, like throwing a pokemon card into Yugioh. What are energies??? At best, this system leads to frustrating gameplay, where both players are reluctant to do anything out of fear, that they will incorrectly anticipate between two WHOLLY VALID courses of play and thus screw themselves over for the rest of the game. At worst, this creates massive imbalances in the game due to some cards being overpowered in the context in which they are placed. For example, 'draw 3 cards' is a common effect in pokemon. Put that card into yugioh, and it will completely break the game.\n\nThe game has a great community, great ambitions and has the potential to change the face of TCG games. However, this is no easy task, and despite the best intentions of the DEVS, clearly indicated by the fact that the game is not pay to win, the gaping flaws in the game's current fundamental design will not allow it to provide a largely positive experience.","September 9, 2014","false","444.5"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","2"

They can't fathom the fact that they spent hours, if not days, planning their starter decks with a few boosters for the perfect play and still lose. (Read the most helpful review, the dude lost because his opponent outplayed him so he posted a Negative review lmao!)\n\nI've not once ever seen a paper TCG/CCG that you can't get s**t on for playing basic, common, starter-deck, builds. All the way from Magic to Yugioh to Pokemon. If you didn't expand your deck and you build strategies, people will take advantage of that and beat you. Starter decks are literally what they say, it's just that start. They aren't meant to be the most optimal decks straight from that bat that beats everything else with a few clever moves.\n\nBuilding successful paper decks have always taken a great amount of time, energy, and sometimes even money. People love to be hand-held through every game now a days. They rely on streamers and youtube to actually enjoy a game, but they have no idea how much fun everything was when none of that stuff existed and you had to travel out of your computer seat and search for those NEW cards. Sometimes even get in your car and drive for an hour to a tournament to see those cards you've never heard of before because your friends or yourself have never picked them up from boosters. It was all part of the adventure and charm of these games.\n\nI truly do enjoy the game even when I get my butt handed to me because it's a learning experience. Each time I lose to an opponent, I learn how to counter them a little bit better. I learn the pacing and when I finally do get those cards I want/need, I will have everything in my wits to beat them and man is it rewarding as heck when you do.","June 28, 2015","true","30.4"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","11","24","0","2"

My honest opinion is that it felt rushed if solid, giving it a very mediocre launch.\n\nThere are no big changes so I can't find my revised review changing all that much. Several much-needed card fixes were implemented, but that's not what should set a gold release apart. The truth is there's no point in adopting this game at all as it sits, if you played beta you're not missing anything. If you have to pick up this game might as well wait for 2015. That's when most of the launch features a TCG should have wil be implemented.\n\nThe game is barebones at the moment. It didn't launch with any kind of card recycler or revamped rewards system. The developers think that's fine, I find it a grind. Even something as basic as a tournement mode didn't make it into release. The truth is they're still on a player-to-player system and, you guessed it, serverside matchmaking won't be making it until the year after release, and dysincronizations and endless turns are still very much a reality. Current plans for IW 2015 make this feel like Beta Mk 2 not Ver 1.0.\n\nI'm out of room. Can't recommend.\n\nRevised Review 5/5/2014\n----\nSo, I decided to give the game a more in-depth review at the behest of some of the developers. My main review is mostly still intact, so I'll detail where it changes and my new experiences with a month worth of play. Despite what Steam says it's over 40 hours (I dont' play with Steam in online mode a lot).\n\nLike I said before the game has potential that's almost all it's working on. I saw that patch .96 was live so if convention is to be believed it's very close to release, so I don't buy that, "It's beta" excuse everyone from the developers to the community likes to foist on you. It's way too close to a 1.0 version for that to be a sufficient. Still, if you're a person who like to play games based on the promise of what they might be (a la Dwarf Fortress or something). I'm not really going to convince you. I'm here to report on what exists. I can't critique things that don't exist.\n\nThe AI is horrible (They've "got plans"). I beat the most difficult AI routinely and draw it out if I'm lazy. I think I lost once to it because I wasn't paying attention. You can beat the AI with just about any deck you can put together. The campaign serves as less of a story and more as an extended tutorial to get you cards.\n\nThe bugs and glitches are still pretty bad. At .96 you'd expect most of the core modes to be at least pretty solid, but Rift Run (there version of draft) didn't work right for about two weeks I was there. Every patch seemed to make the game worse. While they'd fix some things they'd introduce two issues for every issue they fixed. Some people tell me that's "how development goes" but I'll let you realize who paradoxical that is.\n\nSpeaking more on the modes. Rift Run (again their Draft) is actually an exercise in how much money you're willing to pour into it (thankfully not real world money). At one-thousand Infinity Points (the free currency) it's actully quite cheap to at least make sure you have ideal commanders, cheapinging the spirit of the mode.\n\nThe factions: The game is pretty strong, it still feels really random to me, but you learn a few tricks. It still does feel like you're throwing cards. One faction (their first post-core faction) is basically unplayable by itself and is generally in need of reowrking. It's been through one already. That gives me pause to invest in the next non-core release, Ascenscion.\n\nThe only way to get free card packs after a while becomes leveling up. Which is fair. They don't have to give you free packs for everything. You get a few single cards for weekly quests and the fee card for your daily login and first three games of the day, which makes sure you get a card for participating, but the leveling up is purely geometric in scale (one more thousand exp to level up) in scale. You get one pack no matter how much it actually took to get to the next level. So the rewards remain the same while you're doing more work for the same thing. That naturally make leveling up a grind. If you're the kind of person who can do PVP all day long with no change then more power to you.\n\nIf found the community by in large hostile if you didn't toe the general opinion. Any critique of the game is met with "It's in beta' again remember they're at version .96, that's almost release, or it's met without outright nastiness, which I suppose is just the nature of the beast when you're dealing with anything over the internet. The inablity to take and evaluate criticism is only going to hurt the game in  the long run. They'll probably say bad things about me, but I don't really care.\n\nThere are a few other small issues that give me pause to invest anymore time into the game. A sale was held on a deck recently. The sale was in LP (Lightmare Points the real-money currency) and not Infinity Points. I asked around and that wasn't something done before with both currencies being slashed for the sale. That smacks of riding the P2W line. So be careful if you do decide to adopt this game.\n\nAll in all, I still cannot recommend this game. It's an okay TCG and it's probably the best F2P digital traiding card game I've played recently, but remember that the lesser of two evils is still evil. These are my opinions, but I did not enjoy the first time I played it, and I did not enjoy the month I spent for this review. There came a point where I wanted it to succeed, but if I'm going to play a game I don't want to feel like I'm just hitting my head against a wall, which is exactly what Infinity Wars feels like, except the wall has spikes.\n\nI'll be making a final review when it hits release. Though my expectations are markedly low.\n----\nWhile this game has a lot of potential it falls down in a few key areas one would expect a trading-card game to flourish in. Turn length is painfully long and busy, and their are far too many mechanics to keep in mind as you play. Including what order your creature cards are in and where they are on the zone.\n\nWhile the simultaneous turn mechanic might seem like it speeds up gameplay the uneeded general complexity of the game at large keeps it from being effective. Also, the simultaneous turn resolution (though there is initiative to keep in mind as well) gives the game a painfully random element beyond simple luck of the draw. It felt more like I was throwing cards at a brick wall and seeing wich ones took rather than leading an army in a grand strategic victory. Instead of skillful counters and repostes it feels more like you're constantly punching in the dark at one another.\n\nIn this regard the mechanics of the game shine a light on a dominant strategy that shouldn't be so dominantly effective in this genre as to be the go-to strategy: The rush. Rush decks are the majoiry and the game tends to punish slightly slower than rush decks. It makes the game feel stale and samey.\n\nThat being said collecting cards is fun, and the game does offer up many rewards. If you can get past the cumbersome mechanics progress feels nice. The cards are animated with looping gif-like pictures on each and every card which is pretty, but also fees gimicky. Battles aren't fought in any cenematic way. Cards bump into each other doing their damage. The factions are fairly distinct and the art is nice with shades of Warhammer 40K in a blend of sci-fi-coated fantasy.\n\nThe game is in beta now, but as a representation of what we can expect it leaves a lot to be desired. The lovely if pointless card animations and promise of what are supposed to represent battlefield style engagements are marred by stilted and random mechanics. There are no doubt better card battle games one could be playing.","March 31, 2014","false","15.1"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","6"

Recently I started playing Hearthstone which I love but it doesn't have TONS of depth or strategy. Then, I remembered reading about Infinity Wars so I hopped on Steam to check it out. I love it! With the multiple zones, multiple factions and being able to win by dropping either the health or morale of your opponent, the amount of strategy in this game is ridiculous! Though, the amount of options does add a bit of a learning curve, the tutorials and Campaign are a great way to learn the game before jumping into PvP. Added to the fact that you get a decent amount of cards from the campaign and leveling up you don't actually have to drop any money to enjoy it! I might end up spending some real money down the road but as of now I don't think this is as Pay 2 Win as other F2P CCG's. Add the fact that you can trade (unsoulbound) cards with your friends and you have the formula for an awesome as hell Free 2 Play TCG! Download. Play.

This game is not very well balanced, more a Pay To Win, and I have played other games, like Magic The Gathering and Might & Magic: Duel of the Champions and there new player actually has some chances to win in PvP. This coupled with slow game look up process makes me want to switch to other games rather than spending time waiting for game to start only to get some experienced PVP opponent with deck that kills me in sometimes even less than game start waiting time (not sure if the player base is so small or whatelse..)\n\nPros:\n- Nice graphic\n- Animated cards\n- Variety of cards and sides you can take on (each having it's own weaknesses and advantages)\n- Many campaigns (and you can get some free decks by doing them)\n- In-game challenges & achievements (who doesn't like them)\n- Background story\n- Rift Run - seems to be interesting concept. Played only once, but that seemed to be giving some chances to new players (considering you can pay the entry fee that is). It does make you draft your deck from random cards, so you don't have to have them yourself.\n\nCons:\n- Slow PVP matchmaking - on average it takes couple of minutes to find a game. Not once, I was able to get myself some coffee or even eat something while waiting for game to start and when returning, it was still trying to lookup.\n- Bad matchmaking - in 9 out of 10 cases I have been playing opponents with lots of gold or higher medals on profile, meaning they did spend a looot of time in PVP (and the game) polishing their decks and getting lots of cards\n- Pay to win - some say you can get cards - sure, you can get. It's a slow process though and you have to play really a lot of games to get some. Mainly you get them by playing campaigns, and that's the easy part, but you don't get anything too fancy. Sure, you get also in-game money, but it trickles like from closed but leaking tap and again, play A LOT and you can eventually get few cards - still though, if you want to go PVP, you better consider spending some money to get better cards.\n- Still has bugs - didn't see anything major, more like a cosmetic and graphical mainly on claiming rewards where you may need to claim same twice or the interfaces are overlapping (reward claim interface with others)\n\n\nAll in all, over Infinity Wars I would much more prefer for example Duel of Champions where matchmaking is way better and some seasonal player can actually get chances to win without spending real world money and get some fun rather than just waiting to be pwned.\nIf you're only going to play Infinity Wars occassionally, then rather look for an alternative.\n","September 28, 2014","false","28.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","4"

Being digital does allow Infinity Wars to do some pretty cool things that aren't possible with physical TCG's - like simultaneous turns and actively creating cards during gameplay. The simultaneous turn system adds an interesting, poker-esqe level of strategy. It allows you to guess, or force, your opponent's moves rather than simply react to them. There are several factions from which to build decks, but each faction seems so lazer-focused on a single mechanic that there is little room for building a "unique" deck. This will probably improve as cards are added over time, and it doesn't keep the game from being fun in the meantime.","April 18, 2014","true","12.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

All you have to do is complete achievements and earn the ingame currency. Since you earn every time you win a battle (you earn in PVP even if you lose) it is easy to just keep buying boosters until you get the cards you want.\n\nThe bad side?\n\nThere are some bugs that prevent a game from completing (rarely).\nThe matchmaking can be a little daunting but I think this may be because of the lack of players.\n\nAll up, a great card game that is an enjoyable alternative to MTG with some surprises.","April 15, 2014","true","102.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

With many gameplay options including campaign and PvP you can be playing for hours on end without realising it. With each achievement and level up you are rewarded with a random booster pack of cards which can be used to build your own deck combinations. However, PvP can be somewhat unfair with a chance of your first game being against someone at ANY level for example a level 20 vs a level 5. I would recommend Infinity Wars to people who like trading card games and don't care too much about being pitted against someone 2, 3 maybe even 4 times your level.","April 22, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

Getting beyond the set standards and being successful in a genre that has been dominated by a single entity for years even more so.  But what Infinity Wars does great isn't beating anyone, but offering a new, fresh perspective in a universe filled with enough lore to write a full book series.  The stories of the factions are rich, they each have their own unique play style, and game mechanics offer a new look at card game strategy that you wouldn't see anywhere else.  This may just be a beta, but I constantly find myself saying "One more game" far beyond the point that I should have gone to bed.  A truly amazing experience, and definitely a highly recommended one.","February 24, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

So I'll just start from here:  the game is FANTASTIC!  I'd never heard about this until it popped up in my 'reccomended for you' section, and I am super glad I downloaded it.\n\nInfinity Wars is a digital TCG where every card is animated and have many cool mechanics.  The mechanics involve similar tropes to what you've seen in other TCG's, but what sets IW apart is it's gameplay where players take their turns simultaneously and then have the turns resolved to see who was able to 'predict' their opponents mathups better.  It's difficult to explain without actually playing the game, and you will probably be destroyed several times before you even feel like you're making progress.  But when you do manage to beat somebody, oh boy does it feel good.  The sense of accomplishment is huge and makes me want to keep playing forever.  With several modes of cinstructed to the Hearthstone-Arena-type draft, there is something for everbody.\n\nNow, there are a few drawbacks to the game, but the devs appear to be doing a good job of getting things ironed out and making the experience better and better.  You will occasionally have a few graphical glitches when trying to view cards, like words from the previous screen you were on popping through, and a couple small minor things, but those are not very major and can be easily looked past IMO.  The biggest drawback you may find is the amount of people that play the game is fairly small, so it can be difficult for new players like myself to get involved in the game because we get destroyed by those who are better than us.\n\nOverall, this game was a hugely pleasant surprise for me, I'm gald I decided to play it.

The different factions are quite different and fun. But this game has HORIBBLE BALANCE none of the factions themselves are op but there is a handfull of cards that are ridiculously overpowered and the main reason for this is because this game lacks removal for continuous spells,locations and units in the support or command zone. It is very stressfull when there is a building that allows me to only attack with one unit per turn while they use a card that spawns one unit in ther defence zone each turn and there is NO cards for either of the factions in my deck that can remove it. Il reccomend this game but be warned that the balance is a nightmare.

The decks are set up to easily counter each other, too. Warpath and Green Dragon beat Flame Dawn, Sleepers and Venore beat Genesis, Flame Dawn and Warpath beat Exiled, Sleepers and Genesis beat Warpath. The list goes on. So if you meet a player that has a deck that counters yours, good luck.\n\n-Negatives aside, the game is pretty okay. Pretty basic. You gain resources each turn to play creatures and abilities to overcome the opponent. Nothing extremely spectacular, so far, besides the idea of animated cards. The campaign is pretty easy until the last battle of each faction.\n\n-The game itself isn't really Pay-to-Win, it's more of Pay-to-get-a-head-start. Any card you buy with real money can be earned either through login rewards, or battle points.","May 13, 2014","true","69.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"
