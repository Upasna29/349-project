Altho the mass amount of menu screens makes it look daunting, A few games in and it just gets easier to use and navigate. Currently it is spring training and after playing the first 5 games of the season on the game it really feels like baseball is back in real life. The detail and numbers that goes into this game is incredible! I will definietly be buying OOTP every year now. Great game and I strongly recommend it","March 22","true","41.1"," 42 of 44 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","42","44","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mretsam/recommended/402430/","mretsam","mretsam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mretsam/","388 products in account","Out of the Park Baseball (OOTP for short) 17 is a text based baseball simulation.  It contains features for historical gameplay, single player gameplay, custom universe/leagues gameplay and online multiplayer gameplay.  The game allows you to take an active role in developing rosters and teams, or managing them.  This is done through being a General manager, a manager and even play as the commissioner(you are able to play all three at once, or any combination of the two).\n\nOOTP 17 offers new features over previous editions.  They now have full support from MLB and MLBPA(obtained through licensing), so you will have accurate rosters, faces(done through facegen models) and with no worries that they will disappear.  Simulation speed has been increased as the new code is allowing the use of multicore processors, which is a huge benefit.  The AI also has been enhanced to be smarter in how they draft players, manage players, and develop teams.  They will also make decisions depending on your goals and strategy.  These are just some of the major changes that OOTP has offered over previous editions.\n\nOOTP has one of the strongest modding communities around for sport simulation games.  The community greatly enhances the vanilla gameplay.  For instance, historical gameplay has accurate rosters, player attributes, statistics and settings for the era you choose to play(you can play from the grass roots of baseball, negro leagues, or any specific season).  You can choose to play it as a single season campaign or start a franchise and build your league from the 1880’s to whenever you choose to end(the starting point is up to you!).  The community also offers tools to develop uniforms and baseball caps, and there’s literally thousands already pre-made for you to use if you want to choose from them.\n\nThe gaming modes available(and some of this is a repeat of above, I apologize), are single player, and multiplayer.  Single player modes allow you to play out single exhibition games with modern and historical teams.  You can play as MLB teams, which will have player accurate rosters and attributes.  You are also able to create your own fictional leagues, which is a massively popular feature for many players in the OOTP community.  You can start from any time frame, and you can customize the league to fit your needs or gameplay style(there are many sliders to adjust to your likings, and needs).  Regardless of the league, the game will track and keep a massive history of your statistics as your world/league develops.\n\nThe game also features multiplayer gameplay where you can compete in leagues against others, which will put you against the most difficult of opponents(or easy, if they don’t know what they’re doing ;) ).  The league will track statistics as if you were in a single player franchise.  Many leagues out there have dedicated websites where you can follow the action of the league as it unfolds.  It is really a neat feature.\n\nThe development team is very active and proactive in fixing bugs and glitches within their games.  You don’t have to worry about issues going unnoticed or fixed, and they are very open minded to additional features they may have fixed(as long as they are deemed reasonable of course).  The best way to suggest and fill out bug notifications is to use the main forums on their websites, which is ootpdevelopments.com .  The community is also very helpful in helping new players learn and teach players about the game(I myself have helped a few players learn the game of baseball and the workings of OOTP).\n\nIn conclusion, after 2000+ hours of OOTP 16 gameplay, and 1200+ hours of OOTP15 gameplay, I can honestly say this is the best addition to the series to date.  I have never had a game give back so much in value then what OOTP has.  It is simply the best baseball simulation on the market(possibly the best sports simulation as well).  The game is very polished, and if you are a baseball fan, or a sports fan, I highly recommend that you take a chance on OOTP17.  You will NOT be disappointed.\n\nThis game is a 10/10 for me.  I hope to see you on the field!","March 22","true","413.5"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","44","50","0","5"

I really didn't. I liked a lot of different sports but I always thought baseball was boring, archaic and more an excuse to sit outside, drink beer and gawk at the occasional on-field event.\n\nBut then, for whatever reason -- I didn't have much else going on -- I started to watch baseball, because it was always on, pretty much every day, and it started to wrap itself around my brain in a pleasing way. Baseball is low-intensity matched with extreme peaks and valleys of emotion.\n\nMore importantly -- Baseball is a long continuous set of calculations based on the manipulation of variables in series after series of problems. Every at-bat, every pitch, every inning, every game is a test of odds and outcomes based on the pitcher, the batter, the fielders, the field, the weather, past results obscuring present values... Baseball is a worthwhile flux.\n\nSo - OOTP 17. This is the most advanced and ridiculously satisfying way to run your own personal baseball simulations. So maybe I should rephrase - Do you like Baseball as a concept? Because you will love OOTP.\n\n(Also this year they added little moving pawns to the broadcast view, so it's starting to get satisfyingly similar to half-watching an actual baseball game.)\n\nFor those already owning OOTP 16 and mulling an upgrade I would say - the engine runs much faster this year on x64, some under the hood stuff has been nicely tweaked, bells and whistles (the pawns) aren't nothing, and of course, I feel pretty good about supporting this developer, given their track record.","March 26","true","45.2"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

There is a 3D mode to put a little bit of animation to your imagination)  Guide your team over decades as a GM, manage your team pitch-by-pitch, or do both.  It's entirely up to you.\n\nIf you're like me and in every baseball game you've ever played you've found yourself saying "but wouldn't it be great if it had (X) in it?"  Well this is your dream game.  Whatever your X was, every time, since Triple Play Baseball on NES, this game has it.  And more.  It has literally everything in it that baseball has in it.

The only negative I can think of is that I imagine the learning curve is fairly steep (although I've been playing the series for 11 years now so I forget how it was to pick up).\n\nA must have for any baseball fan.  10/10 (year, after year, after year)","March 22","true","114.5"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

I have to say the level of detail from every single aspect of the game is present in this title. I was astonished how the attitudes of the players could effect the teams just like they do in real life. That is just one example. THERE ARE SO MANY TINY DETAILS. It must have been painstaking to research and input all this information into the game.\n\nTo top it off, I figured that the actual game simulations would be boring but nope, I was very wrong there. It brought back my old days of coaching calling the shots from the dugout or sending signals, trying to direct your team to a big win.\n\nI simply cannot say enough. I have been gaming ever since I can remember and I have never gotten into a simulator. If you enjoy baseball, you will love this game. If you kind of like baseball, you will love this game.

I've played a few sports sims (Football Manager series, Eastside Hockey, Front Office Football), all very good (with Football Manager being the king of sport sims).\n\nI hadn't followed baseball religiously since the 94-95 playoff lock-out. Not sure why, but just lost the love for baseball at that point. I've followed with a mild interest since then.\n\nEnter OOTP 17. Because I don't have a good grasp of the current MLB rosters, I decided to start a league in 1982. A year when I really started to love baseball, read every stat line in the newspaper, and collected baseball cards. A year that produced some of the era's best baseball players and brought back a ton of memories for me.\n\nCommissioner mode allowed me to put together a ball club of personal favorites. This game is deep and lots of fun. The immersion in this game is fantastic. The flavor text, the mounds of stats, the interactive playcalling, roster management....this game has everything I could have dreamed of in a baseball sim.\n\nYes, the graphics could be better. I'd love to have the option to add additional sounds to the game...BUT, those are minor gripes.\n\nAt the end of the day, this rivals Football Manager in many ways. The only area it doesn't, is the 3D presentation. But again, this is such a small thing for me, because the flavor text is so dynamic and well written. Thanks, OOTP team, for bringing back some great baseball memories and renewing my interest in baseball.","April 2","true","302.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It's not crippled, but just doesn't allow you access to add ons which can enhance your gaming experience.\n\nThe steam version forces you to use workshop central for adding add ons, but it only has a couple of add ons while the version bought directly from OOTP uses add on central which has a few dozen add ons. It's a shame that the developers created a different version of OOTP17 for steam users. Both OOTP16 versions used add on central. Next year I will no longer buy OOTP from steam because of this.\n\nThe steam version of OOTP17 still plays fine, but you can't do as much with it if you had the version sold directly from OOTP development and that's a shame.

Rarely do you see a 'do a search dumb azze' response. Even if the question is asked a million times.\nYou can choose how much immersion you want. You can control almost every detail of the game. Yes, this can have drawbacks, and from my personal experience, I wish I would have let the AI control more when I first began playing. But now, I like having almost full control and then letting the stats and RNGesus determine everything else\nConstant bug fixes throughout the year. Obviously this game just came out, but Markus and the gang are always adding features and fixing bugs.\nReally, too many pros to name\nCons\nThe game will let me cheat and pick Pedro whenever he is available for the draft. To be fair, he is the only player I will do this for. And to be fair, we would all cheat to have Pedro.\nI have learned a lot about confirmation bias. Which has led me to realize I may have other flaws as well. Hey OOTP, I don't need to be psychoanalyzing myself. I just want to live out a dream of being a GM. But, this game is only 34.99. My shrink charges more, so I guess it cancels out. My shrink gives me benzos also. Any chance of that next year????\nIn all seriousness, no real cons I can think of. I'm not saying they aren't there, but I don't want to say "X" is a con when I don't even have a solution.\n\nAlso, to avoid the should I get "OOTP or the Show" types of questions I have seen the past couple of years, I will preemptively say they aren't the same types of games. Its not fair to compare them. I personally love them both. But, one thing OOTP does that the Show doesn't is truly upgrade from year to year. I'm not saying there aren't improvements with The Show each year, but that they just seem more minor.\n\nI highly recommend. This is a game that could easily cost more and still be worth it. And they don't have any competition (Yeah, I know what some are thinking, and no that isn't competition).\n","March 23","true","19.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Although I get a Steam key, I don't install or play through Steam, hence my 0 hours logged. I assure you, starting with OOTP 14, I have logged countless hours playing OOTP: the greatest sports simulation known to man.\n\nIf you love baseball but don't own OOTP, all I can say is, man, you are missing out. I knew of OOTP for years before I finally decided to give it a try with version 14. Once I got the hang of things, I could not believe I had put off playing this game for so long. This is literally the sports game of my dreams, and of any baseball fan's dreams. It is absolutely on my Top 5 Games I'd Take to A Desert Island list (...everyone should have one of those lists...)\n\nHow anyone could give OOTP a Negative review is utterly beyond me. This is the deepest, most flexible and immersive sports simulation on the market, hands down. Deeper than Football Manager. The only thing I can think of is, perhaps the negative reviews think all sports games need to look like MLB The Show or NBA 2K. Those are great games in their own right, but OOTP is every inch a baseball game as "The Show" and then some. Since version 16, OOTP has been officially licensed by MLB, so anyone who avoided OOTP because it couldn't give you the "official MLB" experience offered by The Show, well, that problem has been put to rest.\n\nThere is almost nothing you can't do in OOTP. Feel like GMing the Tokyo Yakult Swallows in the Nippon Professional Baseball League? Be my guest. Want to manage the Red Sox' AAA Pawsox affiliate? Go to it. Feel like skippering the 1925 New York Yankees and the likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Bob Meusel? Have at. Feel like setting up a completely fictional league tailored exactly to your specifications? Why not. The depth and flexibility of OOTP are simply breathtaking. You won't believe it until you experience it for yourself.\n\nAll that said -- yes, get ready for a learning curve. The game is DEEP. I've heard it described as the 'Dwarf Fortress' of sports games. (I've also heard Dwarf Fortress described as the OOTP of roguelike/simulations...)  The complexity and depth can be intimidating. But what amazes me is, OOTP is not just played by die-hard baseball fans. Plenty of players with little interest in baseball have given OOTP a try and gotten hooked. (The fact that OOTP is developed by a team of Germans tells you all you need to know about its broad international appeal!)  And there is no question you may have that you cannot get an answer to in the OOTP Developments forums -- there is an extremely knowledgable and dedicated fanbase there who are very happy to answer even the most basic questions about baseball and OOTP -- they are more than happy to welcome new players!\n\nTL:DR --  If you (A) love baseball, (B) love sports, and / or (C) love in depth immersive management games, don't overthink it:  BUY OOTP 17 NOW  !!!  Easiest no-regrets decision you will ever make.","March 23","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was easy, with a game like OOTP 17, to get caught up in the nostalgia of the day.  OOTP is immersive, I felt like I could really make an impact and improve on what was a pretty dismal year 1 for the franchise.  OOTP feels like baseball.  The detail exists in every aspect of the game.  Every pitch, every decision, every trade, every move could be decided by me or by a fairly competent AI coach.

I've been mildly addicted to the franchise for years and this is another great outing but where it really excels is how the customization options allow for the creation of fantastic stories.  The forum on the OOTP website is awash with stories of baseball leagues incorporating the fiction of Fallout(complete with occasional deaths from radiation, drug addiction, and deathclaws), Tolkien(orcs make surprisingly good catchers), Star Wars(Wookie umpires, don't argue with them), or spurring users to create totally new(though probably derivative) fictional universes.\nIf that appeals to you check it out, I can almost guarantee it'll be money well spent for a baseball fan.\nWhat follows is a brief story from my first OOTP 17 game. Relatively brief anyway.\nThe universe is mostly ours but the major pro baseball league is the United Nations Baseball League featuring 32 teams, 16 in the Americas(North American Pro League-DH), 16 in the Pacific Rim(Pan-Asian Super League-No DH) each league features four divisions of four teams each, division winners make the playoffs. No interleague play because well the travel would be sort of ridiculous.\nI started with an opening draft where I'll be guiding my Perth Koalas as GM so I'm relying on the AI to handle the gameday management under manager Shugo Endo. Notable players include local boy Adrian Wall(1B), power hitting Jordan Najera(C), the 22 million dollar man Jesus Suarez(CF), the all-around excellent Alex Ozeguera(RF), and team leader Andy Varner(OF). Despite all those position players the real power is on the mound, where I spent our first three picks on starters Rickey O'Dowd, Mike Davis, and the great Canadian hope Willard Hayward, we also have one of the best closers in the league in Jose Reyes a 21 year old fireballer out of Cuba and a top notch setup guy in Ryan Nance. So that team sounds pretty good, what's the problem? Glad you asked.\nFor starters this GM does not like his manager and most of these players have their own fatal flaws, such as defense Wall, Suarez and Najera would all be better suited to DH work, the guys I have to play defense to shore up these niggling issues like Varner cannot hit period. One of the great things about OOTP(sorry this probably belonged up top) is that you'll see two sets of players ratings, one regarding the view of the league at large and one for your scout's opinion, those two will start to converge, but with that opening draft I'll find myself wondering how much to trust my scout and how much his opinion differs from that of the league in general and I'll be repeating the process in amateur drafts. This is a problem for my Perth Koalas because Varner, our shortstop Davon Jones, and outfield prospect Freddie Kozak are among many players where my scout thinks they are way better than the league does.\nLuckily pitching cures a lot of ills and with 4 of our top 6 draft picks in the rotation O'Dowd, Davis, Hayward, and Darren Fyfe are cleaning up while fifth starter Frank Rosales is performing above expectations, it helps that Reyes is mostly unhittable and Suarez is playing like the best outfielder on our side of the Pacific. There are injuries to deal with but the first two months of the season sees us pulling away from our division rivals the Melbourne Emus, Brisbane Dragoons, and Taipei Liberty, competing with the Beijing Reds(amusingly because of the name the Reds initially were setup to play in the Great American Ballpark) for the best record in the PASL. Injuries popped up from time to time, but mostly involved our mediocre left field situation(starter Nick Bailey has a .302 OBP and his backup Kenichi Takeuchi hits .217) until the chaos started.\nA few relievers started to get hurt, annoying but something I can work around as long as the rest of the staff is healthy. The biggest issue was losing talented middle reliever Soetsu Tanaka for the season, but hey at least he isn't Nance or Reyes. Then Reyes blows out his arm, he'll need Tommy John surgery and the man had a 0.99 ERA at the time.\nOkay, going into June without 2 of our top 3 relievers, As long as Nance is still around and the rotation's intact. We keep on plowing through the PASL, seven all-stars O'Dowd, Davis, Hayward Suarez, Najera, Wall and our third baseman Johnathan Lugo. Our lead in the division is from 15-20 games for months, we are dominant. How dominant, well aside from the massive divisional lead for almost a month Najera and Suarez were in the top five in the league in homers. What I'm saying is that things are good Nance is filling in admirably for Reyes, my biggest problem is that my potential free agents want to be paid and for some reason they want to be paid in American dollars not Australian ones.\nNajera, leading the league in homers- 20 mil(currently making 10)\nAaron Biles(2B) leading the team in average and OBP- 10 mil(currently making 1.4)\nSuarez(CF) best all around player and fastest man around- not interested doesn't like manager Shugo Endo\nThen actual problems started. In late July we lose O'Dowd, down for the O'Season. Which means I need more starters and Frank Rosales the initial 5 starter has been traded away because his personality description is literally 'Clubhouse cancer. The kind that gets managers fired' I'm not a fan of Endo, but with Suarez wanting out of Australia I need this clubhouse functional, this may very well be our best shot for a championship for years. The only counter to Rosales' disruptive influence is Varner and he's hovering around or below .200, so I shipped out Rosales for reliever Hideki Sato in early June.\nNow O'Dowd's gone and I could really have used Rosales right about now instead of an expendable middle reliever. Luckily the lead we've built up is so massive that it won't matter in the division, but in the postseason I wanted to be able to line up O'Dowd, Davis, Hayward, and Fyfe, now it's Davis, Hayward, Fyfe, and some random dude. That's an issue and it's late July so I have five days to look into a replacement. Nobody's available for a reasonable price, so I figure you can win with two and a half dominant pitchers, especially as long as Nance's healthy.\nIn mid-September(after we clinched) Nance goes down for the season. Sato, that guy I got for Rosales in early June is our new closer and he has about a week to settle into it before the playoffs.\nWe win the division with 93 wins, ending the season on a 7 game losing streak and in the process lose Nick Bailey the good left fielder and Ozeguera(RF hitting .298) picks up a nagging back injury that'll last a couple of weeks. Ozeguera can play but he'll be hampered.\nSo we start the playoffs against the 92 win Yokohama Anglers without our best left fielder, best starter, 3 of our top 4 relievers, and with our right fielder constantly complaining about tightness in his back. This isn't ideal. To digress a little this is one of the things that makes OOTP great, in a game like XCOM if you lost that many major soldiers going into the endgame you might reload an earlier save or just start a new game, in OOTP you keep going because there's always another season and maybe just maybe our leadership crew of Varner(hitting .188), Sato(new to closing), and Endo(despised by our star CF) can hold it together and pull off a Grand Championship Series win.\nDavis starts game one and we immediately hand him a three-run lead, then the offense stops. Yokohama scores one in the seventh, eighth and ninth to tie. Sato's first save chance is also his first blown save. Unfortunately Endo has pulled Suarez, Wall, Ozeguera, and Najera so we don't have any offense left. In the eleventh both teams score two. It goes to the fifteenth before we win on a walkoff slam from Lugo(3B). Only 11 wins to go.\nIf you read through all of this, sorry it's longer than I thought it would be, but I think you get what I'm saying.","March 24","true","20.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

They also added the ability to quickly generate the play of a series between any two teams in history, so you can pit the 1927 Yankees against the 1967 Cardinals in a seven-game series or replay any World Series matchup.\nAs far as the game itself, you can do what you've been able to do in the past. You can take control of your favorite team this year, or other years throughout history and win and lose with them.  Manage a MLB team, trade players, work with minor league teams.  Haven't watched baseball since '94?  Start from there or create a new fictional league (complete with personalities, nicknames, faces) to call your own.\nThis is a great game, and an improvement over an already great game from last year.","April 9","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I just can't recommend this.  Look, if you're seeking great major league simulator with all the default options, etc., this is a great game.  Truly, it is.  So if that's all you're looking for and don't have a somewhat recent version of it already, go for it.  You'll love it and it'll be worth your money.  If you're looking for for some non standard action that's going to delve deep into the games various options.  Just don't.  It's buggy.  And worse, several options just flat out exist but don't work.  I set up non standard leagues, really trying to stretch the imagination and utilize many of the games highly detailed options and it's painful to see them flat out not work.  Aaron Harang being drafted in a High School league where you have set the age from 14-17?  Yeah, totally makes sense.  Why even have the option of setting age requirements if you have nothing within the system that actually prevents teams from acquiring them?  Mind boggling.  But hey, if you're not worried about that level of detail, little things like that won't bother you.  And you'll enjoy it.  BUT, if you've bought a previous version in the last few years (I moved from 15), you'll be sorely disappointed.  For $35-$40, not only is it a technical downgrade in some ways (bug related), but there's just not that significant an update.

I've been playing OOTP ever since the first iteration in 1999. OOTP has established itself as THE premiere hardcore baseball simulation dethroning the venerable - and still very good - Diamond Mind Baseball.\n\nOOTP 17 is the best iteration yet and the AI manages like a pro so do not underestimate it. That said, be prepared for surprises as baseball is a very unpredictable game.\n\nPerhaps the best way to review OOTP is to compare it to other textbased baseball simulations. I've decided to compare it to Baseball Mogul 2015, Diamond Mind Baseball, and APBA Baseball for Windows.\n\n1. Seasons: All seasons from 1871 to 2016 are free in OOTP. Similarly all seasons are also free in Baseball Mogul. In what I consider a boneheaded move, APBA has stopped free seasons with its newest iteration. The old game was glorious with Ernie Harwell announcing the game. Seasons were imported from the Bill James Baseball Encyclopedia. Now, there is no way to import seasons. Like Diamond Mind - which charges 25.00 or more per season - , you will be paying hundreds of dollars or more to have a complete history of Major League Baseball.\n\n2. Endorsements: OOTP is the ONLY baseball sim endorsed both by MLB and the MLBPA.\n\n3. Customization: OOTP rules the roost and the other sims cannot compare. Perhaps the closest would be Baseball Mogul as it allows you to creat a universe of any teams in MLB history with a few clicks. I would love to see this feature implemented in OOTP. But, OOTP allows you to creat real minor league seasons; something the others simply do not do.\n\nYou really are free to create the baseball universe that is your very own, When you compare the proverbial bang for the buck there simply is no contest. OOTP is the king of baseball sims. I should add that this iteration is the most user friendly. OOTP has a great user community as well as a number of excellent videos for th baseball neophyte.\n\nPLAY BALL!!","March 27","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have logged 78 hours into the current iteration so far using my Macbook Pro. The gameplay is as great as ever, the details on par with last year with a few minor upgrades. What really bugs me though are the bugs. I recognize that it is still relatively early as  far as patches go, but so far the game has crashed about six times over the duration of that 78 hour stretch. This is extremely frustrating considering that it takes a long time to load your league back up. There is an auto save feature. You can choose to save daily, once a week (which is my default), once a month, or once a year. The auto save feature is handy, but it too takes a long enough time to be a teadious hassle. This is the third time I have had to go from several regular season games in to restarting spring training all over again in one save file. I should add that this is the first season of the save file, so it isn't as if there are dozens of seasons causing a crash. Don't get me wrong, OOTP is great as a series, and I would still recommend OOTP 17 to fans of the sports microsim genre, but the crashes are killing me.","April 22","true","309.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The more I play it, the more I find myself saying, "No way!!  They have THAT in the game too?!!?"\nI have played HH2003 for years and this game beats it hands down.  Sure, the graphics in HH2003 are more realistic but for the true baseball fan, the realism of OOTP 17 cannot be topped.  The 3D stadiums and on field live action representation is great as it pulls you into the game while maintaining all the stats and controls I love.  When the ball leaves the bat and starts heading for deep left center field, I find myself saying aloud, "Uh, oh!" if it is the other team batting and "Get outta here!" if its mine.  In other baseball simulation games, I have always had to settle for what the game developers thought would be the best way to control your team but that is not the case here.  As an example, I wanted to move one of my MLB players to a minor league assignment and the game said that that player refused the assignment!  At first I thought, it's my team, I should be able to decide where I want my players.  I looked into the online manual and saw that I could turn that option off so I COULD move players to wherever I wanted.  I then began to examine what else I could change and was blown away.  I could be solely the manager, or the general manager or both or neither!  Heck, I can be the comissioner if I want to!  And in any of these roles, I can opt to do everything myself or assign duties to the AI on a case by case basis.  The amount of control you can have over your league is astounding!  Plus, if I start a league and decide that halfway through I want to change something, I can!  No need to restart here, just turn control items on and off at will.\nMy favorite part is the historical leagues.  I started the 1984 season as the Tigers manager and to see all the names of the players really brought me back to my younger years.  The game imported all of their stats from their careers up to the 1984 season and I get to see if MY management techniques are as good (or better) than the legendary Sparky Anderson.  Can I lead this team to a World Series win, or will I fail?  What about in subsequent years?  Who will I play, what players will I choose to promote from the minors, who will I trade for, what will I pay them?  The questions go on and on and I can hardly wait to find out the answers.\nIf you like baseball, this game will deliver.  It has all the realism you could ever want and with the modding community and future updates and releases (OOTP 18 is already on my wishlist), it is sure to be my favorite game for many years to come.  Great job, devs!\n","April 21","true","35.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have logged 78 hours into the current iteration so far using my Macbook Pro. The gameplay is as great as ever, the details on par with last year with a few minor upgrades. What really bugs me though are the bugs. I recognize that it is still relatively early as  far as patches go, but so far the game has crashed about six times over the duration of that 78 hour stretch. This is extremely frustrating considering that it takes a long time to load your league back up. There is an auto save feature. You can choose to save daily, once a week (which is my default), once a month, or once a year. The auto save feature is handy, but it too takes a long enough time to be a teadious hassle. This is the third time I have had to go from several regular season games in to restarting spring training all over again in one save file. I should add that this is the first season of the save file, so it isn't as if there are dozens of seasons causing a crash. Don't get me wrong, OOTP is great as a series, and I would still recommend OOTP 17 to fans of the sports microsim genre, but the crashes are killing me.","April 22","true","309.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tykrane/recommended/402430/","tykrane","Poochie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tykrane/","51 products in account","I've been playing iterations of this game for about 6 or so years now, and have played "franchise"/general manager modes in baseball video games for about 15 years. As it should, this game does it the best. The game is more accurate than any other simulation in terms of player progression and strategy's effect on team performance. The game really shines in its historical replays - not only do player statistics stay reasonably close to real life, but putting past prospects who never panned out into different organizations or roles can actually yield some pretty realistic results.\n\nHowever, the game does have its rather frustrating moments from time to time. For example, in the most recent franchise I started, the league expanded after 2016. I tried going into "commissioner mode" to undo this since I didn't want to play 2017 with the "Indianapolis Beavers" in the NL Central, but was only able to delete teams - the expansion draft was still scheduled and unable to cancel. I know there are advanced settings you can manipulate before starting each playthrough, but I like having these changes happening in the game's future. It's just that sometimes OOTP seems too quick in making those changes (another playthrough had the NL adopting the DH rule after 2016, although I'm a little more okay with that).\n\nAnother qualm I have is with player progression. Although I did mention that this game is more accurate than any other (well, I guess that means more accurate than The Show since that's really the only other baseball game left on the market), past playthroughs seemed to continually favor the same players over and over again. Example - in one of the more recent versions of the game, Matt Adams would consistently break through in every playthrough and slug 40+ homers every year, to the point where I'd just start every season with trading for Matt Adams for an easy 10+ years of Hall of Fame-caliber play at First Base.\n\nI haven't played enough of this year's version to say that this is still the case, but the game still seems to mostly ignore fringe cases where old players make huge comebacks (ex: Bartolo Colon) or minor league journeymen finally getting it together and putting up superstar seasons (ex: Josh Donaldson). In this sense, the game seems fairly linear - only the players with high "potential" ratings will flesh out into solid everyday players and anyone past 30 years old is incapable of improving or making a comeback.\n\nStill, though, the game is more complete than anything before it and seems like it'll stay that way for a while. This year made some great improvements in the coaching system, allowing you to fill your organization with coaches aligned with your baseball philosophy (smallball, sabermetric, etc.) and the opposing General Manager AI seems improved, as negotiating trades on "normal" difficulty is much more tougher and realistic (although there are still some holes here and there).\n\nIf you're a baseball nerd and haven't played OOTP, I definitely recommend this game. However, if you own past versions of the game, I'd say OOTP 17 is pretty much only worth it for the statistic and development updates - if you're on the fence, it might be more worth it to you to wait until a Steam sale as the core aspects of the game (player progression, AI, etc.) haven't changed too much.","April 23","true","153.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I started a season with my local team as the GM (You can play GM or manager, or choose to play as both). I wanted to start off as simple as possible. Nothing is overwhelming at all in this game. They ease you in and before you know it you're making trades with other teams for prospects and taking players off of your active roster so that you can force your manager to put them in the game :). The menus are intuitive and nothing you are looking for is hard to find. The game is a blast! I cannot believe that every player in MLB history is in this game. I can make a team with Ken Griffey Jr, Pete Rose, and Mickey Mantle if I want to and have a fantasy league! I don't leave many reviews, but more people need to know about this game. It is THAT good!

Coming from an experienced Football Manager user I had certain expectations, some of which were met, others exceeded, and a few not quite to the standard I expected. Still, in simplistic terms OOTP 17 is a very thorough and extensive game that, for people who enjoy sports management sims, gets the job done.\n\nThe sheer depth of the simulation is at times overwhelming, even for someone with hundreds of hours in sports simulators, and this can reasonably be attributed to the hefty amount of real-world representation that baseball requires. Being a general manager is by far the most exhaustive role one can take on. For those who are just interested in the day-to-day playing of baseball as a bench coach, the option to be a regular manager is helpful. Even as someone who has been watching baseball their entire life, I still found some of the rules and regulations regarding minor league contracts, active rosters, and drafts to be confusing. Thankfully the manual provides reasonable enough information and goes as far as to point out the differences between how things work in the real-world and how they work in OOTP.\n\nEven still, some aspects of the game warrant polishing and others can be too abstract as to cause frustration. An example of the latter would be the simulation aspect of the game. Teams make strange trades, random players go on un-charactaristic streaks, whether for better or worse, and general performance overall seems to be skewed away from reality. Teams you would expect to do well sometimes just don't, for no apparant reason. This brings into question how the real world performance of such a complex sport is translated to a virtual simulation.\n\nThere is plenty of work that can be done to make the game more user friendly, whether that be interactive tutorials and situation explanations, or better reasoning behind the simulation and representation of real-world teams and players. As a baseball manager simulation, OOTP is pretty much the only option. It certainly gets the job done and is absolutely worth checking out for diehard baseball fans and stats nerds, just don't be too disappointed or surprised if things turn a bit toward the fantastical after too long.","April 23","true","97.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has never failed to build off the previous year, and 17 is certainly no exception. The first thing you notice when you open the game is the official MLBPA and MLB licenceing (yes!). Personally, I have been awaiting this feature since I began playing with OOTP 15. The new design is sleek and original. And finally you don't need mods to get the player faces which is definetly a plus. I do wish that generated players had faces as well, but that's obviously a minor thing and definetly doesn't impact gameplay.\nI've never been one to really watch games often, but the options you have in game are just fine. Sure, I wish there was an option to choose your plan for every pitch and be able to play the game (like most people) but that's not really the point of the game. Playing the games does however give you plenty of control and gives you the feel of being the manager.\nWhere this game really shines as always is the deep variety of options to truly make each league your own. I messed around with a lot of the settings in previous years and have found the formula that works for me. This games mechanics are nearly flawless, the only slight issues being the AI trade proposals (which, as usual, are as dumb as ever that it's impossible to keep them on), and that the game seems to run a tad slower with other programs running on the computer, as opposed to prior years. In addition, injuries seem to occur MUCH more often, which isn't necessarily a terrible thing, especially because you can change those options. A lot more players seem to become "wrecked" in comparison to previous games, which can become annoying. However, these problems do not come close to bringing this game down.\nAs usual, the OOTP developers have not tried to reinvent the wheel, which they don't need to. This series has given me hundreds of hours of enjoyment. The official licencing by MLB is no doubt the biggest change and upgrade over last year. For the casual OOTP player who doesn't care too much about updated rosters and the forementioned changes can stick with last year. This game, however, is worth the price, for $10 or $40, as there is endless fun and no micro transactions (please please please don't).\nMy Yankees franchise is 18 years in, and have 4 championships. I know, not great but hopefully many more to come.\n","June 5","true","96.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
