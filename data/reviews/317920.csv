"http://steamcommunity.com/id/faffri/recommended/317920/","faffri","faffri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/faffri/","462 products in account","Played the first 8 or so missions of 21 in about 40 minutes and it is a bit of fun for a while but probably not something I would highly recommend. You get a decent return on the 3,99€ (20% sale) so not to much to complain about there.\n\nSince it is a Mobile port you have fairly limited controls for weapons and such. It is not a traditional tower defense as I have yet been able to place any towers or anything like that so far in the game. You mainly controll 4 weapons with the two mouse buttons, rifle, mortar, napalm, machine gun/flamethrower. It does what it is suppose to do from what I can tell but there are far better alternatives in the genre.","May 31, 2015","false","1.3"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

Things are graphically pleasing and there is a plethora of guns, upgrades and enemies that make this game something better. You basically, just man a turret from your bunker blasting everyone who gets close to your base; subsidize that with helicopter strikes, mortar blasts and more!\n\nYou can earn achievements but in game only. There are also items to find and unlock in order to complete collections. This element reminds me of CS:GO gun collections! The maps are laid out in a campaign style, as you complete levels your advancing army conquers more of the map.\n\nIt definitely seems like a tablet port; that doesn't necessarily make it a bad game but definitely lowers the value and you do notice that classic mobile repetitive gameplay. Overall, yes its "good", but no I wouldn't hunt this game down for purchase.\n\nWorth $3-5; I'd grab on sale or find in a bundle. No need to intentionally purchase this game.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

The graphics are pretty decent, but don’t expect something spectacular, it’s an originally mobile game. The atmosphere is about basically many maps around Italy, France and Germany (in order), where you will have to repel many troops/elite troops and many tanks/elite tanks. The areas differ from villages, to cities, and even fields and small forests. The audio is fine, the shooting and the explosions are pretty good, even though there is only one background soundtrack. The gameplay is pretty fun and challenging, you control a bunker which has several units, taking care of the battlefield. You may only equip 4 out of the 8 weapons available in the game. You will unlock them as you progress. There will be coming many enemies towards you, and you must do your best in order to defend the bunker. You can call air bombers in order to bomb the tanks with anti-tank mines, as well as you can call helicopters for airstrikes or for ammunition, supplies, bunker’s health, etc. There isn’t any interesting story, probably the fact that this game occurs in the Second World War, while you are fighting Italy, France and Germany could be taken as a story. General Doug will teach you how to use the weaponry, as well as he always complains about the situation on the war being bad, but he always has hopes in the arriving reinforcements after each battle, and most importantly, that one day they will all win. The engines and the mechanics are pretty alright, the tanks have a few designs before being completely destroyed, as well as they keep having a booming design when they get shot. And the soldiers also have the stage where they aren’t wounded, massively wounded or dead. Overall, it’s a pretty fun and relaxing game.\n\nStrong Points\nPretty decent graphics\nGood SFX/soundtrack\nChallenging gameplay\nThe ability to purchase and upgrade equipment\nPretty big campaign/survival mode\nFun but relaxing arcade type\nPretty good mechanics\n3 large countries to combat\nMany enemies and weapons to choose from\nCollectibles and personal stats\nWeak Points\nNo achievements/trading cards\nPoorly optimized controls\nOnly one soundtrack\nLack of deeper polish pretty much everywhere\nGeneral Ratings\nGraphics: 7.5/10\nAtmosphere: 8.5/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nAudio/Music: 8.5/10\nStory: 8/10\nEngines/Mechanics: 8/10\n\nPersonal Rating: 8.1/10","May 4","true","6.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kruglii/recommended/317920/","kruglii","Corwid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kruglii/","1973 products in account","A port of mobile game. Not the best port of not the best game. You are sitting in a bunker shooting everything around. Sounds fun enough for me, BUT... Unlocks gives you almost nothing and often worse than basic weapons. Rifle is better than the shotgun, napalm is more useful than mines, mortar has more damage than grenades (though you'll barely use it, for crates collecting mostly, because it can't even kill basic green soldier in one hit which is just stupid) and secondary weapons - don't even know, used it only few times. So basicly all you need is fully upgraded rifle and sometimes napalm. Knowing all that you want to at least just hold mouse button and shoot everything but you have to click for every shot because holding a left mouse button let's you use mortar because of it's mobile roots I guess.\nCampaign is 21 levels plus couple of extra levels which has differently looking maps and a little more interesting. All fun vanishes when you realize that unlocked weapons are useless.\nIt's an ok timekiller to play on a phone but there are much better ones here on steam. Lacks nice powerful unlocks and achievements (but please not the grindy nonsense like kill 5000 soldiers with mortar). Can not recommend untill game is updated which I doubt will be.","February 8","false","3.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
