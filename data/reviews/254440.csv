Take it easy, shoot some pool like a pro and relax.  That's what you have Pool Nation for.  It's zero pressure, it's zero chaos. It's 100% cool, daddy-o.  It's got some great physics too, so you can shoot pool and feel like a king.\n\nBecause some times, you need to come home and pretend that you're a slick mo-fo pool shark.

If you're not already a billiards fan, Pool Nation won't make you one. Conversely, for those dying to scratch the billiards itch, Pool Nation is sure to satisfy. An entertaining, highly varied and technically excellent pool game, even if lacking in innovation or new elements for its genre.With Pool Nation you'll get a pooling experience that you've never had before. The simulator delivers several game modes and a lot of options to choose from. Every kind of shot that you can imagine is possible to make in the game and because of that you can truly speak of a great simulator. Another big plus are the graphics, which are truly stunning for a low budget title. Overall, Cherry Pop Games's first endeavour has left us with a fantastic billiards game featuring stunning visuals, great audio and even better physics. The lengthy, albeit difficult career mode, will give you plenty of play time but perhaps for the wrong reasons. If you're looking for a realistic, stylish, and fun billiards game, Pool Nation is the cream of the crop.","July 5, 2014","true","43.4"," 54 of 62 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","54","62","0","4"

The solid gameplay and controls were not enough for Cherry Pop Games, they went ahead and added some beautiful locations each offered during day, sunset, and neon lit night time.

The game modes for single player include 3ball, 8ball, 9ball, endurance, golf, killer, rotation, speed, and straight. In addition, you can play online versus friends in a friendly match or choose to be competitive in tournament mode.

Lots of different game modes like 9-ball, 8-ball, endurance, and tournaments. Plus you can play online versus friends. The game offers good graphics, although they can be a little bit on the shiny side. The cue control system is mostly user friendly even though sometimes it can feel like a chore to set up a trick shot just right. Straight shots are extremely intuitive and the angle assistance makes it really easy to sink shots. Although bank shots and combos aren't so straightforward.\n\nThis is the first real pool game that I have played on the PC and quite frankly I wouldn't be surprised if it was the last.

Released as the maiden offering from Cherry Pop Games, it’s gorgeous visuals, multiple game modes, lengthy campaign and lots of unlockables will keep Pool fans coming back for more.\n\nCampaign | Gameplay: Gamers have the choice of playing standard 8-ball or variations like 9-ball, Rotation, Endurance, Sudden Death etc across a variety of visually stunning locations / pool halls. A lengthy campaign mode (against AI opponents) allows you to perfect your game and strive toward numerous unlockables including new locations, pool table decals, new ball styles and cue styles. Additionally, the online mode allows you to match up with friends or other online players in single matches, Tournaments or King of the Hill events. Multiple difficulty levels (from Novice to Pro), a spot on physics engine, responsive controls, and a great soundtrack make this the best Pool game to date.\n\nFlaws: In considering its biggest issues – 1. Game Stability is poor (Tabbing to windows results in an insta-crash) and 2. Online Gaming is largely dead (Bring your own friends). Additionally, the developers have pushed the previously promised ‘Trick Shot’ mode to the next release, and the lack of Co-op play is disappointing as well.\n\nOverall, ‘Pool Nation’ is the best conception of a Billiards game to date and fans of the real game will find this a fun, polished distraction. But, even ardent fans soon realize that Pool without the smoky basement rooms, uneven cues, pitchers of beer, chatty girls, side-bets and bar-room trash talk, is a somewhat hollow experience.

Most billiards games like to focus only on either 8- or 9-ball.  Those games are here, but they do not stop at that.  Along the game, other games like Rotation and Golf are in the mix.  With nine different ways currently available with Snooker and Trick coming soon, there are plenty of ways to play.\n\nAnother strong point about the game is the controls.  Like in any other pool game, being able to control the cue ball is important.  Most games simply allow you to aim the ball and adjust the power.  Even though most games stop at this, there are more options to offer.  By being able to adjust the angle of the cue stick as well as where on the cue ball to aim, it gives the option of doing jump and swerve shots, something most billiard games leave out.  Additionally, with a full tutorial teaching how to do all of these moves, it does not take long before they become second nature.\n\nBeyond all the gameplay details, a nice touch about the game is the amount of customization available.  Even games that try to simulate pro billiards tend to stick to a single, sometimes sponsored look throughout the game.  This one goes beyond the basics.  As soon as you start a game, the highly detailed and moving locals make it feel like you are in what could be a real location.  As you keep progressing, at least a dozen locals, cue sticks, ball sets, and even table decals make it that regardless your taste, there is plenty to see even from a visual standpoint.\n\nOnce the single-player game is over, there is still more to play.  Through online multiplayer, it is possible to keep playing with others.  It is even possible to create tournaments to learn who the best player is.  However, the one drawback is that there is no local multiplayer mode available.  This means that in order to play with another person in the same room, the two of you must play through a network.  This feels like a major oversight.  A simple hot seat patch would have made that the game could be a great party game.  Even without local multiplayer, this is still a great package that any billiards fan can easily enjoy.","July 13, 2014","true","62.9"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

However annoying and cliche the music is it surpasses quite alot of the ♥♥♥♥ on steam. The gameplay works well. Physics are very good and accurate. Visually it is amazing and is an all round enjoyable game. You can play with a friend and having a nice game of pool. Are take a tournament by storm and listen to some tunes while your at it. I never thought I would buy a pool game but for £1.04 it was so worth it. It is definetely worth even £7. I recommend giving this game a go. Although it may not be a game you spend hours upon hours playing it is for sure a game worth getting.

Beautiful textures, great physics and enough variation in games to keep you busy for a while. Best of all it runs great on my old-as-dirt PC.\n\nMultiplayer is a blast, especially if you can get a group together for a tournament. The free roaming camera allows for amazingly framed shots when you are brodcasting the game. Your spectators won't get bored!\n\nMultiple levels of difficulty are present, and should gbe used if you are looking for a challenge. The novice mode is only good for the first few rounds, as it reveals quite a bit of the ball paths. My only complaint here is that champion mode perhaps reveals too much as well (Cue ball only).\n\nTricks shots are a blast to pull of and never get old. Experimenting with angles and english prove to be highly satisfying. Especially when you pot the winning shot with a knifes edge.\n\nLooking forward to the new mode: Box of Tricks, and maybe Trading cards?

I will explain: The english in Pool Nation does not accurately represent the way in which a ball would travel with said spin. Top and bottom english when making a cut shot can cause the cue ball to travel more left or right on the deflection, and this is not represented at all.\n\nLeft/right english isn't actually as useful on a pool table as an amateur might think. I rarely use left/right english in real pool, as top/bottom english can account for most necessary ball control.\n\nAs I can best explain it: Top and bottom english account most for how the cue ball deflects off the object ball, and left/right english effects the way the cue ball deflects off rails. There is a small amount of effect with left/right on ball deflection, and top/bottom on rail deflection, but it is very slight.\n\nThis has to do with the fact that the rail is a solid unmovable force, and ball deflection is sympathetic to mass/friction.\n\nMy previous pool experience makes this game very unintuitive!","May 6, 2015","false","0.9"," 32 of 56 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","32","56","6","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/254440/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Pool Nation is one of the most polished indie games of 2013- the animations are shiny and smooth, the gameplay is responsive and the physics are realistic. You won't find yourself screaming at this game for bouncing your balls in the wrong direction, or glitching out and dropping your cue ball through the table. With eleven game modes including tournaments, online play, and single-player endurance mode; as well as a slew of collectables to unlock, Pool Nation has no shortage of goodies to keep gameplay fresh.\n\nThe single player component revolves primarily around tournaments where you take on AI challengers of ever increasing difficulty. Each match has an associated list of challenges, and completing them unlocks a variety of cosmetic changes like cues and balls. Standard games like 9 ball are present along with more interesting options like Golf, which challenges you to put specific balls into specific pockets. There’s also a time attack style mode, where balls spawn on the table and you have to sink as many as possible in the time limit. There are Free Play, Versus, and Online modes present too, but I had a hard time finding anyone to challenge online.\n\nPool Nation is a great looking game that features bright and shiny graphics that makes each game, literally, feel new and different. There are some good themes on the game's soundtrack, and though the game's controls look difficult to use, they aren't difficult to learn. There are also options that can be easily turned on or off to give players assists in a game including arrows that point at the next balls that need to be hit or arrows that show where a ball will travel when hit. All of these features combine to make an excellent presentation for Pool Nation.\n\nBut is it fun? In short stints I definitely enjoyed playing the game, but it isn’t the type of thing I’d want to play for hours at a time. Having said that, I think Pool Nation is the kind of experience that would be a hit at a house party. If you’ve been searching far and wide for a Billiards simulator, and don’t have room for an actual table, Pool Nation is probably the solution. The physics are solid, the controls allow for extreme fine tuning of shots, and everything looks super shiny. A few more game types would be welcome, but for $10 Pool Nation is the gold standard in the category.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=382462339\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","January 27, 2015","true","5.8"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","23","39","2","0"

I like the attention that was put into the details. Everything looks really nice, there are quirky opponents, and most importantly the gameplay is excellent.\nThere are two campaigns: one for 8-ball and one for 9-ball. Both have challenges each match to help keep the game fresh. Some example challenges are complete a trick shot or have a streak of potted balls. Their are also a variety of opponents with little biographies that you can choose to read or not. It is nice how this game is not too story dependent as I feel that would interrupt the flow. Each campaign takes a while to get through and was fun for me until completion.\nAnother mode I've spent time on is endurance mode. It is an addicting, time sensitive, mode in which you try to continuosly pot balls while new balls are being added at increasingly fast intervals. I've spent at least an hour just with that mode, chasing a new time record.\nThe variety of modes is very extensive. There are also one off matches with a variety of rule sets as well as online multiplayer. It is hard to jump right into a match sometimes due to lack of online opponents but there are plenty of small groups on Steam dedicated to tournaments and matchmaking.\nAdditionally, throughut all the modes, you can choose whether to play with an auto aimer on or off to toggle the difficulty.\nThe upcoming free update Box of Tricks looks super neat as well. I'm sure it will further increase the replayability of this game.\nOverall, for the low price this game is a must buy.","December 6, 2013","true","13.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Let me make this as plain as possible. If you like pool and can find this cheap, check it out. It's not bad at all. I think the controls are better here in many ways than I've seen in previous PC pool games, but what's the game really like? You get nine ball, eight ball, and a few mini-games. There is a trick mode that hasn't been put into the game yet apparently. The humor is painful mostly, but not always bad. Just never very clever or subtle.\n\nAs for the negative stuff: I think it gets repetitious. It's also buggy. I don't like the AI at all, as it sometimes seems too transparent what's happening in the game. Some of the rounds a really good AI player will goof several times in a row to give me a chance to beat it. Other times it feels like it's cheating to win.  Sometimes the match challenges don't appear to count properly or are too literally applied, and it seems inconsistant with its application of what meets the requirements of a given challenge. For example, I played a match that wanted me to get a 3 ball streak with a jump shot. I got a 4 ball streak with a jump at the end and it didn't count it. The next time I played, it seemed to count it. So I just don't trust the AI at all. Also, some of the designer ball sets that you can unlock confuse me visually because the stripes and solids look too similar to me from a distance. The settings are very colorful, which isn't necessarily bad, but can be VERY loud.\n\nAnyway, even though this seems a negative review, it's not meant to be. The devs say they are working to improve it, and if they do I think it has a lot of potential. As it is, if you can get it for a very low price and you like pool, try it. I've enjoyed playing it, but it can be frustrating at times.","August 29, 2014","true","44.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Well, after asking the question I heard back from the developers.\n\nThey in fact are working on a new pool game where these features will be featured. They are re creating a pool game engine from the ground up to allow these features.

(Though, if by some miracle, I were to become champ, it would be sooo cool.)\nI mean, there's something very gratifying about being on a 6 ball streak, while carrying on a casual conversation, with friends, about the stupid decisions the characters on Walking Dead make.\nBut, play on any other setting and I'd have to put on my ugly old game face and actually concentrate on each shot, and...well, I don't wanna.\nOh yeah, I've also recently discovered that it's a wonderful little comedown after a long hard evening of pulling "overkill" jobs in Pay Day 2, as well.\n\nHowever...\nOn the other hand, the game can be a bit glitchy.\nLike, it won't let me exit.\nIt asks me if I would like to exit, I say yes, and then it just sits there blankly looking at me.\nI almost always have to close it via task manager.\nEven worse, there was a point, early on, where it would just shut down and chuck me onto my desktop.  Once, it actually crashed as I was hitting the 8 ball in for a win.\nThank goodness, that seems to have stopped, though the exit problem still persists. It's a minor glitch, which alone, will certainly not stop me from playing.\nI mean, it would be nice if they'd fix it... but, honestly, in my mind, task manager has pretty much become the default mode of exit now, anyway.\n\nNote: I bought this during a Steam sale for less than half the regular price.  A fact that  has, of course, influenced this rating.\n\n","April 6, 2014","true","79.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

Period.\nBeautiful pool tables, balls, and environments that are fully fleshed out and animated to give you a real sense of immersion.\n\nThe game is full of details that kept surprising me.  Some of them are so subtle that you can't even notice it unless you are watching the replay.  Here are a few things you will find:\n\n* 3rd dimension: this isn't a simple pool game where balls stick to the table.  All pool balls can be knocked off, up in the air, and over other balls (given enough force).\n* When hit certain ways, chalk will fall off stick and sprinkle on the table.\n* Tiny woven texture on table material when you zoom in close\n* Sides of table (bumpers) actually give and bend in when a ball hits them with force (very hard to notice without replay!)\n\nFor single player there is enough to keep you busy for awhile with tournaments in various game types against different AI.  One thing I found keeping my interest is bonuses you can try for on each game in a tournament.  For instance one might have a bonus for pulling off a jump shot during the match.  You can still win the game, but there will be a bonus for doing the jump shot.  Earning these stars while winning makes for a fun challenge.\nThere are also many ball styles, cue sticks, and locations to unlock through single player.  So far every ball set I have unlocked has been great looking and is a good incentive to keep playing and unlock more.\n\nFor multiplayer, it is fully functional in both same computer and online play.  Unsurprisingly you have to wait awhile for a game to show up, but that's less the fault of the game and more of the popularity of online pool :).\n\nLast I should go over the physics.  This is a tough point to argue because so many factors go into pool physics and without a doubt there is no game out there that is 100% accurate.  If you have ever seen a ball hit another ball at high speed in close up slow motion you'll see what I mean.  Not to mention there are many different ball sizes/weight, table materials and cue sticks used in different areas that add to the difficulty in comparing this to the real world.\n\nAll I can say for sure is the physics seem real and have been really fun.  Added to the ability to hit the ball just where I want at power levels I never could in RL the game makes you feel like a pool master.\n\nGame is on sale for $1.99 currently.

There are a lot of opponents but they felt very identical to play against.  However, I wasn't working towards the challenges against each opponent and going for those could be fun, although they're usually pretty same-y (x match score, x-ball streak).  Additionally, there are actual stand-alone challenges but of the few I played they were pretty boring.  While they did break up gameplay when I found it necessary, the AI is so unpredictable  that modes like speed challenge or 3 ball just aren't that much fun.\n\nAs a 8-Ball and 9-ball simulator, though, this game is pretty excellent.  The physics work, there's a guiding shot marker to help  you learn how to shoot better (this can also be turned off, or reduced) and the game is pretty.

For online play there are a lot of interesting game modes past 8 and 9 ball including 3 ball, straight, rotation, speed, and killer.  Of those I only tried killer (possibly speed in the campaign) and it was fun, though it felt more like a quick distraction between a few rounds of 8 ball.\n\nSo yes, I recommend this game.

This is something I needed in my life and it's nice to have, but I also recognize that it's probably not for everyone.  I've only played a handful of times and only for a few hours total.

Controls feel great, especially using the mouse as a virtual cue system. Graphics are crisp and colourful with great reflections on balls. Sound is good, music isn't too annoying buy can be turned off if you prefer (which I do). Its challaneging with every game in its tournaments having 3 stars you can unlock for doing specific things like skill shots or winning without losing a frame etc. This means even if you win the tournaments you can go back to specific matches in the tournaments to try and unlock the stars. Lots of unlockable cues, ball sets, locations and decals for the tables.\n\nMy only downside would be that I hoped more people would be playing this game online. I have found and played people online but there doesn't appear to be many.

Full HD, good physics, nice gfx & sfx, local and also online mp wich is easy to access and uses steam functions like invite friend from friendlist. The difficulty in the standart setting for a experienced pool player is way to easy - you will feel like a billiardproof when having all the helping lines turn on. IF you turn off the helping lines or just set them to one of the 4 other presets like champion the game will become more like the real feeling because not every shot will be a putting. Different type of Billiard games makes it interesting to play again. And there is also a snooker mode announced wich i look forward too. Play this with a friend online or local is the most fun, but also the single player option serve some fun. For experienced and for newcomers this game is worth every penny. You can even train your real skills this way without killing some poolshops tables ^^. As some kind of bonus you can customize your tables , cues and also all the billiard balls.","January 16, 2014","true","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Controls feel great, especially using the mouse as a virtual cue system. Graphics are crisp and colourful with great reflections on balls. Sound is good, music isn't too annoying buy can be turned off if you prefer (which I do). Its challaneging with every game in its tournaments having 3 stars you can unlock for doing specific things like skill shots or winning without losing a frame etc. This means even if you win the tournaments you can go back to specific matches in the tournaments to try and unlock the stars. Lots of unlockable cues, ball sets, locations and decals for the tables.\n\nMy only downside would be that I hoped more people would be playing this game online. I have found and played people online but there doesn't appear to be many.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/okram/recommended/254440/","okram","okram2k","http://steamcommunity.com/id/okram/","289 products in account","This game really caught my eye on steam, and how could it not, it’s so very very shiny. Released originally on PSN Cherry Pop ported their billiards game over to the PC and is available for $10 via steam.\n\nWhat we have here is really a modern pool game. A sparkling beautiful graphics engine combined with an impressive realistic physics engine all to send shiny balls flying around a table. It’s smooth, it’s pretty, it’s gorgeous. (click on some of my high-res screenshots and see for yourself!) Really what else do you need to know? If you like pool games then it’s for you, if you don’t, all the shiny graphics in the world probably won’t change your mind. What you might expect from a pool game is all here, an 8-ball and 9-ball tour to play through with slowly increasing difficulty as well as some other game modes to throw in some variety.\n\nThere are also arbitrary points systems that award you points based upon added difficulty of shots (kinda like the way skater games give you points for harder tricks) and as you progress through each tour there are challenges to meet in each match to unlock extra goodies. It’s all your typical completionist fluff we’ve grown to expect from games these days but they do add some extra challenge and drives you to try to be more creative as you play. I also found I enjoyed most of the challenge modes that are unlocked during the tour play although a couple get a little tedious and boring.\n\nEverything in the game is well crafted, the table is high textured, the balls well polished and reflective, and even the backgrounds are rich with detail and eye candy. The art style is beautiful and there’s even interesting little blurbs written about each opponent you play against. But all of this eye candy is just background noise to distract you from pocketing those balls! The game really shines though when it comes to trick-shots. Jump shots, draw backs, kick shots, even riding the rail is all possible with the engine. With full control to put on as much english and angle on your shot as you’d like you can put together some pretty sweet shots. Thanks to the shot guides they are not very difficult to learn and once you start pulling them off with regularity your options with each shot open wide. Best of all, the AI knows and uses them just as well which creates quite a challenge as you progress through the game.\n\nThe trick-shots are definitely best seen in video as screenshots cannot do them proper justice. You’ll be hopping over balls and making crazy draw backs in no time making you feel quite the awesome player. The game is, however, not without it’s flaws. A common complaint I have of many games, the music started to get annoying to me but this is not the first game I’ve had to mute the music and play my own. It is also clear that it is a port rather than designed specifically for the PC.\n\nThe menus sometimes feel a bit awkward navigating with a mouse and I feel some of the controls are awkward. For example rotating my cue around the cue ball to line up a shot only involves moving mouse left or right, yet my natural inclination is to try to circle the mouse around the cue ball. It made for some very frustrating moments until I realized this. Also I found the video replay system to be- clunky at best. Still even with these small complaints I’d definitely recommend the game if you ever find yourself wanting to shoot some pool.\nNailed it!\n\nNailed it!\nFinal Score:\nGraphics: 10/10\nGame Play: 8/10\nMusic / Ambiance: 8/10\nStory: -/10\nValue: 8/10\nOverall: 8.5/10\n\nRead more indy game reviews on my blog!\nhttp://markofithian.com","November 26, 2013","true","6.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

People buying it know exactly what the game is: billiards.  It's not like there is at all any surprise.  You don't get surprised that Taco Bell serves tacos so why would you be surprised a game called Pool Nation is anything but pool?\n\nOverall I found it to be addictive fun.  When I bought it, the game was at I'd say a dollar and it was the best thing I've ever bought with only one dollar (NOT EVEN TAX!) I could have bought gum or soda with that $1 but that won't last me and is not as enjoyable as something you can share in an online session with.\n\nIf you like or would want to learn about playing pool, this game is honestly the best (and only) pool game I know of.  The only con is that because it is for the computer, the gameplay takes some time to get used to (whether you use the keyboard or a controller).  However, the amount of time it takes you to learn how to play with buttons (versus using an actual pool stick) is time that you also gain experience and tips; so realistically you are not losing anything but gaining more than you pay for!  Being taught how to play a sport (that can be used for real life) is so worth paying only a dollar for.  McDonald's doesn't even have a dollar menu anymore; it's like $1.50.  Though I was fortunate at the time and the game is back to its' original price, the pirce is $9.99 (NOT EVEN $10!!) so it's not too bad a price.\n\nI SAY GET IT!!! But who am I to say?  See for yourself.  You won't be displeased.\n\n+Physics: Way too realistic! :)\n+Price: Cheap!!! :)\n+Customizable: To some degree.\n+ Music: Relaxing (If you are immature like me, I thought of porno background music).\n","December 29, 2014","true","6.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I played PC Billard games from the 90's on, all the Virtua Pools and whatever is out there and i play Billard in real-life and this is the best simulation i've seen so far. There are a lot of game modes (3-Ball, 8-Ball, 9-Ball, Rotation, Killer, Golf, Speed, Endurance) and a small career style mode where you unlock locations, queues, ball designs and layouts for the table - so it's even fun in single player but absolutely shines in multiplayer.\nThe graphics are nice an shiny and the music is great\nBest thing of all is that the developers actually are active in the forums and listen to the fans and their wishes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannedfeces/recommended/254440/","cannedfeces","ploq","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannedfeces/","255 products in account","I think Pool Nation is one of those games that knows exactly what it is, and doesn't try to be anything it's not. Pool Nation is a billiards game, that's it. It's a slick-looking multiplayer/singleplayer campain billiards game.\n\nAnd it's fun as hell.\n\nWeirdly enough, I'm comparing this to Sniper Elite V2. While the two games' topics are in no way similar, both play out in coincidentaly similar ways. For example, both Pool Nation and Sniper Elite V2 hav slick, shiny graphics that look AMAZING. The graphics on both games look professionally made and I just love it. Graphics haven't been a huge thing for me, but wow, Pool Nation's graphics are actually better that Call of Duty Ghosts, and to top it off, my computer can run it.\n\nAnother weird similarity is the "killcams". In Sniper Elite V2, if you hit the enemy in a certain place, the camera pans out to the bullet or the enemy, and you get to watch the enemy get shot up close. In Pool Nation, if you make a Skill Shot or just a nice looking shot, the camera sets up on the hole, and you watch the ball fly in. The only difference is, Pool Nation does this less. For me, almost every shot in Sniper Elite was a killcam, and it got annoying as hell (except the ball shots). But the killcams only happen periodically in Pool Nation, and THANK YOU SO MUCH for doing so.\n\nAnd the last thing, if you think about it just a tad, playing pool is almost like sniping. You have to aim carefully at a specifis target (and in some cases many targets) and shoot. Not only to you target all if the solid or striped balls in pool, but you also aim at a certain hole and shoot! How weird is that?\n\nSo now you know why I compared Pool Nation and Sniper Elite V2. Pretty good comparision if you ask me, but overall I think Pool Nation is worth your money. It's an amazing pool game, but its not Steam's only pool game.Buy it and hit me up.","August 2, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, okay, you can quite plainly see that, but it's fairly pretty gameplay wise, too. Once you get the hang of the controls... Which is easy enough, because the tutorials are quite helpful, and the aiming sight, even on default settings, is actually useful for everything except hardcore kick shots... The game gives you that little bit of extra motivation to up your game by asking you to do challenges while you beat the AI's ♥♥♥.\n\n...Okay, the AI is also quite fair in this game, and so sometimes (especially on 3-ball, an event you'll love to hate) it'll kick your ♥♥♥. Beat a certain number of challenges, you'll get bonus levels. Beat bonus levels, or certain characters, and you'll get customisation for your table decals, cue decals, and ball style.\n\nProblems: There *is* online multiplayer for this game, but sadly, it's very, very dead, presumably because pool afficianados prefer a local fix (I sure do!) Also... The high reflection on the balls can sometimes make it difficult to tell what's what, even in Overhead view. Finally, the soundtrack, while chill, gets a little repetitive at times, and doesn't really cover that "Playin' Pool/Billiards in a pub/club" feel.\n\nConclusion: Even for the non-sale price, this game is worth the cash (5 hours in, and while I could *theoretically* beat the AI players in that time, 100%ing each players' challenges is a slightly different story), and for something to relax to, then wonder "Wait a minute, wasn't it 6PM a minute ago?", there's few better things than a game of 'puter Pool.","August 4, 2014","true","27.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm a long time Virtual Pool player (15+ years). Physics could be a teeny bit better, like the english (ball spin) physics. In real life, pockets on a pool table have angled cushions around the pocket to help your ball in, should you hit them correctly...In this game however, if you don't hit the ball straight into the pocket, it's not going in. If you hit the angled portion around the pocket, it will just reject your ball much of the time, really unforgiving but challenging. Hard to explain...think of a basketball hoop where if you didn't swish the ball, the ball would never go in.\n\nI don't use that aim assist or flashback bullcrap either. That's for sissies!\n\nEasy on the eyes and shiny as hell, though. I think the lighting on the balls (ha, balls) could be a lot better. Also, like the virtual pool series, it's a great game to play and mute all the in-game sound if you're in the mood to rock out to some of your mp3s, you can fully enjoy your music and the game at the same time.\n\nThe game is still in development so I think it will improve over time. There are few odd glitches here and there. Buy this game the next time it's on sale and come play with me!","January 4, 2014","true","59.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game deserves a solid 9/10, losing out on full marks quite simply because the only thing it’s missing is pornstars wandering around in 6inch stilettos and lines of coke and rolled up 20 dollar bills laying haphazardly about the place.  What this game does extremely well, is that it makes you feel important. It draws you into a world where you can be the person you’ve always wanted to be in real life, a world where paying $15 for a drink wouldn’t make you penniless by end of the evening, a world where every woman wants to blow you and every dude……. Well who gives a f*#k if every chick wants to blow you right?? Pool Nation offers something different than any other pool game I’ve seen before.

Potting is so satisfying and once you start completing skillshots, it's enough to make a grown man make girlish squeals of pleasure.\n\nPros\n- Very easy to "pick up & play" the tutorials are well done, but are OPTIONAL, so you can do them whenever you feel like, if at all and repeatable, so you can brush up on certain types of shots if you are having difficulty.\n\n- All of the things that make this more game than simulation can be turned off or not used. Those who want a challenge don't have to have aiming lines or use flashbacks.\n\n- Loads of unlockable customisation options, unlike certain simulators where to get a new table or cues (or trains or pinballs) you have to get your wallet out, 95+% of the customisation options are unlockable by beating different challenges or tours.\n\n- Each match in a tour comes with 2 challenges that require you to win the match in certain ways, such as using a particular shot or getting a high score, etc, giving completionists more to achieve.\n\n- Scrolling the mouse back & forth to control the cue is enjoyable\n\n- The graphics are amazing. Bearing in mind i'm playing this on a laptop, it looks beautiful. I would go as far as saying this is the best looking game i've run on this, with no framerate drops.\n\nCons\n\n- The menu can occasionally get fiddly.\n\n- Sometimes, when trying to aim the cue with the middle-mouse-button, the camera pans up instead.\n\n- Extremely rare crashes. Had 2 so far, but i'm unsure if that's something to do with my hardware to be honest.\n\nSeriously, just look through the rest of the reviews. There are HUNDREDS of reviews, all positive, some are casual players, some are hardcore simulation players, all of them love it. Even when this game isn't on sale, it is totally worth the full asking price. If you're even slightly interested in this game, pick it up, you won't be disappointed.","July 31, 2014","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's addictive and instructive. My Real Life™ game has improved, thanks to the accurate physics and cue aiming system.\nAs an enthusiastic supporter, who wants this game to become a household name, I have a few humble suggestions for the developers:\n1.  Please add more tournaments featuring more game types:\na. British 8-ball\nb. Snooker\nc. Straight\nd. anything else you can think of...\n2.  Maybe add more types of tables... at my local pool hall, there are, at least, three distinct styles of tables:\na. Quarter-drop - small green, big pockets\nb. Big/Big - big green, big pockets\nc. Big/Little - big green, itty-bitty pockets\nd. Is "Bumper Pool" a real thing? I'd play it...\n3.  I am far more likely to pay for decals, cues, balls, and locations, than I am for trick-shot materials.\n4.  Some sort of local playlist ability for the background music.\nI'd like to say again...\nI'm a HUGE supporter of this game.

A pro can appreciate the tournament structures, the spot on rulesets, the tricks, & the challenges, which are a bit like wagers in a bar.  Quite realistic, that.  Pool Nation is rendered beautifully & has all the charm & atmosphere of Poker Night 2's outlandish settings.  The music is well mixed, adding to the full effect.  Everyone should own this game.

The sound design is fantastic, the graphics are shiny but non-intrusive, I haven't seen a single physics error. If you want to simulate a game of pool, this will do it almost to a tee.\n\nHowever. I have three reservations.\n\nThe power meter gets stuck sometimes if the mouse is accidentally pulled to the edge of the window, even on fullscreen. This can cause some dodgy shots.\nThe Endurance challenge instruction page seems to be bugged and will only let you see the last page of it. To be fair, the gist of the 6 page manual is that you need to pot balls fast, but it's not entirely apparent what parameters there are on this activity.\nThe Straight challenge does not account for trick shots or indirect aiming the same way that the rest of the game is, and this is never explained. As such, and as the name might suggest, you should only shoot straight. No jumping, no swerving, don't even think about a combo.\nAside from that, a very robust and well designed pool game.","November 5, 2014","true","22.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I regularly had an issue where stars in levels would not be awarded after the match when the in-match tracking said I had completed the challange and I had won both the game and match. This lead to completing stars up to four times before the game successfully registered them. Another frustrating but not game breaking issue was that the overhead view became blocked on some levels which left me with only the on table view. This view is enough to play on, but still limited my options. A lot of little things like this detracted from the game for me and lead to me sending it to the done pile earlier than it should have been. I found this game to be worth the money I spent, but still fails to be something I can recommend.","June 30, 2015","false","16.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game takes getting used to and might even mess up your real life game.

So I wasn't able to do the 5 cushion cross bank combos that I'm used to doing in real life :P  I also don't understand how putting more power on your stroke will curve your bottom right/left shots.  The physics of reverse english and carom pool are also off.  And stop shots are really hard to do.  I'd much rather play in real life than play this game online.

It lacks a bit of the old time sleazy pool-hall atmosphere, which, to me is a big part of the game. The settings are a little too modern for me but having said that, the game is solid. I like the aiming system and the AI players really need to be kept at bay or on the higher levels, they will run the table even though they can miss some very easy shots but like humans, they just plain miss now and then. I have not tried the trick shots much so I can not speak about those but if you just want to play some decent 8 or 9 ball, get this. It sells pretty cheap too. It just needs some snooker !\nOh, and some more pub-like settings. I want to hear my mates swearing in the background :)\n\nNote, there are many complaints now about the devs abandoning the game and not updating in a bit so if that is an issue for you, take heed.","July 9, 2015","true","15.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game takes getting used to and might even mess up your real life game.  Imagine a REALLY PRETTY pool on Yahoo Games, because the rails, physics,  table speed, and power value are kind of the same.  So I wasn't able to do the 5 cushion cross bank combos that I'm used to doing in real life :P  I also don't understand how putting more power on your stroke will curve your bottom right/left shots.  The physics of reverse english and carom pool are also off.  And stop shots are really hard to do.  I'd much rather play in real life than play this game online.

I regularly had an issue where stars in levels would not be awarded after the match when the in-match tracking said I had completed the challange and I had won both the game and match. This lead to completing stars up to four times before the game successfully registered them. Another frustrating but not game breaking issue was that the overhead view became blocked on some levels which left me with only the on table view. This view is enough to play on, but still limited my options. A lot of little things like this detracted from the game for me and lead to me sending it to the done pile earlier than it should have been. I found this game to be worth the money I spent, but still fails to be something I can recommend.","June 30, 2015","false","16.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Fantabulous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cpt_fantabulous/","668 products in account","It's kinda tricky to review a Pool game so I will try and break it down into what matters.\n\nGraphics\nAs you can see in the screenshots the game looks great, it is ported from the Xbox 360 so it will run pretty damn well on almost any computer set up you care to mention and with Anti-alising all the way up it is a very very nice game to look at. The UI is nice and easy to use as well although, whislt the controls have had there names changed. It still asks you to press A, B, Start and Back whenever you want to do something. That is more of a monor niggle though\n\nGameplay\nThe Pool on display here is very nice. The balls all act realistically and as far as I can tell things like friction have been modeled very well. In the close up slow-mo shots you get sometimes when a ball is potted you can see that the balls are lifting up and sliding about realistically. The sound design helps to sell this as well, with nice clear sound making it all the more satisfying when the ball drops.\n\nMultiplayer\nAs far as I can tell the multiplayer for this game is dead. Which is a shame and slightly confusing. I couldn't seem to find any games at all in any mode so unless one of your friends has the game it is most likely gonna be solo play for you.\n\nOverall\nConsidering The lack of a decent Pool game on PC and the promise of the release of the Trick Shot mode soon I would say this game is well worth picking up","December 28, 2013","true","34.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game looks and feels great, has infinite replayability value if you are into pool, and has some quite interesting features coming, inculding the free Box of Tricks DLC!\nControls may seem a bit overwhelming for the first 15 or so minutes, but you will get the hang of it pretty soon. After that, they feel great and pretty easy to use, considering what you are capable of doing in this game.\nThe only slight complain is that the menus were probably initially designed for gamepad use, and while mouse and keyboard works perfectly fine in them, there are some slightly weird leftovers, like the menu that appears when you are about to use a Flashback (The available choices are listed as 2 buttons of an Xbox 360 gamepad, but mouse works great here too). Keyboard keys are listed correctly everywhere else though. Really really small complain for an overall great title!\nIt happened to crashed 2 times, but considering my pc and its current state, I probably can't and won't blame it on the game itself. Luckily both times were during the initial loading, so no game was in progress.\n\nRegarding multiplayer, you can play online with friends or other people, but I haven't found anyone in 2 quick searches. I however didn't try hosting a game due to limited time.\nYou can also play locally, with 2 players using different input methods, or hotseat (2 players using the same input method).\n\nIt's definitely worth your attention if you are interested in the sport, 9.7/10 and that is only because of the gamepad oriented GUI that is left in a few places.\nKeep in mind that while I have only played 3 hours so far, I probably experienced most of the core mechanics, after all it is a pool game, not an MMORPG.","January 3, 2014","true","32.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fantabulous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cpt_fantabulous/","668 products in account","It's kinda tricky to review a Pool game so I will try and break it down into what matters.\n\nGraphics\nAs you can see in the screenshots the game looks great, it is ported from the Xbox 360 so it will run pretty damn well on almost any computer set up you care to mention and with Anti-alising all the way up it is a very very nice game to look at. The UI is nice and easy to use as well although, whislt the controls have had there names changed. It still asks you to press A, B, Start and Back whenever you want to do something. That is more of a monor niggle though\n\nGameplay\nThe Pool on display here is very nice. The balls all act realistically and as far as I can tell things like friction have been modeled very well. In the close up slow-mo shots you get sometimes when a ball is potted you can see that the balls are lifting up and sliding about realistically. The sound design helps to sell this as well, with nice clear sound making it all the more satisfying when the ball drops.\n\nMultiplayer\nAs far as I can tell the multiplayer for this game is dead. Which is a shame and slightly confusing. I couldn't seem to find any games at all in any mode so unless one of your friends has the game it is most likely gonna be solo play for you.\n\nOverall\nConsidering The lack of a decent Pool game on PC and the promise of the release of the Trick Shot mode soon I would say this game is well worth picking up","December 28, 2013","true","34.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One of my favorite "sports" games (let's not get into the semantics of whether pool is a sport) of all time has been the original Virtual Pool by Celeris. Since it's been literally years since I played the game, Pool Nation struck all the right chords with me: low price (on sale for $5), great artwork and graphics (ooh, shiny!), and those pangs of nostalgia that I'd been craving.\n\nPool Nation sports a reasonably good tutorial mode and even teaches you how to pull off expert moves like jump shots, knife-edges, and all sorts of careful maneuvers with curving and banking. And those moves will generally score you loads of style points (which, as far as I can tell, are only useful on the in-game leaderboards - there's no way to spend them, and all the unlockables come from milestones in the Tournament modes).\n\nIf I have only one complaint about Pool Nation, it's that the AI suffers from what I like to refer to as "Worms Syndrome"; in short, the AI will alternate between being a complete and utter stooge (like pocketing the cueball) and being freakishly perfect at their shots (I've seen even low-tier opponents like Cousin Merl pull off insane curving bank shots and manage to pot two or more balls in one hit, on occasion).\n\nOf course, this ceases to matter if your intention is playing with friends. This is also a bit of a problem, though, as the online scene for Pool Nation is...well, pretty much nonexistant. You'll pretty much need to talk your friends into buying it if you want to play against anybody other than the AI opponents (or the timer in Endurance Mode). This said, though, given the game's low price, that shouldn't be too hard.\n\nAnd then, yes, there's the graphics. Everything in this game is really shiny. Not "bloom and HDR" shiny, but nice and reflective and smooth. The pool halls you compete in (there are several!) are lovingly rendered and actually remind me of the city from Mirror's Edge. Then there's the character artwork, which is occasionally hilarious (Cousin Merl and Beef Chillingham both elicited chuckles from my usual Livestream audience).\n\nSo, yes, I give Pool Nation my recommendation. There are no crazy arcade elements (you won't see explosions or fancy particle effects); it's pretty much straight pool with a nice coat of gloss and some solid physics.","December 22, 2013","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its called 8 ball in the game. I enjoyed this part of the game the best. The computer is good but not overbearing. It brings back a lot of good times playing pool in bars. 9 Ball I want to like but Hate the game play of the computer who seems to be able to make any shot sometimes and then other times will miss the simplest of shots. Its  annoying and makes my want to punch his face. The physics feel very good its not perfect and some of the time it just feels a little off but its very good.\n\nI like the unlock system but for whatever reason they made it progressively difficult with 3 stars needed later on to unlock some stuff. However the worst is some of them are busted and dont work like they should. The jump shot is needed to unlock on of the stars and I have done it and not gotten credit for it. Its annoying. A few of the others are just based on luck and thats very annoying as well. The locations you play pool in are very well detailed and looks super great. Sound of the pool is very good. The music can get annoying so I turn it down a lot. Not prefect but very fun and more then worth the $1.50 its on sale for.","May 29, 2014","true","17.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One slight twitch and away your cue aim goes. For a fast pace game you have to play slowly in order to even succed. I also hate the points system, it over shadows the whole "clear up to win" aspect of pool giving the impression that highest points wins.

Lining up shots is a chore with iffy mouse controls. This is one of those games where you are controlling something with the mouse (the cue stick), but there is still a mouse pointer in a different area of the screen and they don't correspond at all. It is frustrating and distracting and something I didn't expect to see this side of glitchy Windows XP games. It's like half of the game was designed around a controller and the other half was made for keyboard and mouse.\n\nI'm sure there is a bit of a gem buried in here if I dig long enough but it just doesn't seem worth the effort.\n\nOn the plus side you can totally cheat using a straight edge on your monitor to line up your shots, if you cared enough.\n\nBought on sale for $1.49.\n\n12-28-14 edit: Achievements are working again.","November 21, 2014","false","4.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The right joystick on a 360 pad is used to not only select shot power (pulling back the stick), but also to execute a shot (pushing up on the stick).  With all the strategy that goes into each shot, it's too easy to accidentally execute a shot in this manner.  Worse still, it is possible to push up on the stick with no options set, executing a medium power shot with no options set (power, stick angle, ball spin).  In the options, I could see where to remap some things, but not this.  I really want shot execute to be a button, not a stick that I can bump...otherwise, fantastic game, great price!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KrudlerTheHorse/recommended/254440/","KrudlerTheHorse","KrudlerTheHorse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KrudlerTheHorse/","139 products in account","I love this game for 2 player local co-op.  We use 2 Steam Controllers and play via my Steam Link.\n\nThis is a fun little pool game that is great for players of all skill levels.  The controls are very intuitive and have been easily picked up by my 75 year old father and others.   We all like the music and find it contributes nicely to the overall relaxing nature of 2 player pool.\n\nOne of the great features is the versatile aiming aid which shows players the exact path of the cue ball and object ball as they aim and adjust spin and power.  As players get better they can shorten the length of the aid to increase the player skill required to make the shots.  In 2 player local co-op each player may choose the length of the aiming aid independent of the other player.  This means experts can have a very short aiming aid while less-experienced players may have a longer one.  This is a nifty way to handicap games that doesn't make new players feel pandered-to in my experience.\n\nA couple of negatives are that the physics are a bit questionable at times, and the aiming aid can permit some absolutely ludicrous shots that would be impossible outside of a physics simulation.  The single player career seems to be nothing more than a way to purposefully gate content... even though you bought the game if you want all the locations and wingdings unlocked you have to buy the "unlock" DLC or slog through the laborious and completely unfun "career".\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game for local co-op play and pretty much no other reason.  Several times I've checked out the online lobbies and couldn't find anybody to ever play with though YMMV.","January 27","true","28.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

More abysmal controller support.\n\nAfter having a lot of fun with this on my console, I grabbed it on Steam. Unfortunately like several "controller enabled" titles here, the input progarmming is only half complete. Instead of having a fully functional control mapping feature, it simply picks up input devices and automatically assigns them to functions in the game. This means that if you have other controllers besides a gamepad, like throttles and sliders, menus and views will constantly scroll or move until you find the offending device and unplug or otherwise disable it.\n\nThis is a fun little game, but I have no desire to constantly unplug or reconfigure controllers just to play, only to have to reconfigure again to play games which use those controllers.\n\nOn top of this, there was no consideration for alternate resolutions (such as multiple monitor setups). The 3d portion of the game functions, but 2d elements such as splash screens fail to scale properly, making them unreadable.\n\nEither make PC games or don't make them. I have no interest in a product that not only doesn't fully support my platform, but forces me to disable features of the platform in order to make the product usable.\n","February 6, 2014","false","0.2"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","7","26","0","0"

No ordinary truck, this one was Holy White, and the gold Delivery logo sparkled like a thousand suns reflected through shards of the purest ice formed with unadulterated water collected at the beginning of the universe. The driver, clad in a robe colored the softest of white, floated towards me on the cool fog of a hundred fire extinguishers. He smiled benevolently, like a father looking down upon his only child, and handed me a package wrapped in gold beaten thin to the point where you could see through it. I didn't have to sign, because the driver could see within my heart, and knew that I was pure. Upon opening the package, an angelic choir started to sing, and reached a crescendo as I laid this disc into my system. Instantly, my antiquated equipment transformed into components made from the clearest diamond-semiconductor. The game knew where to install, and hooked itself into the correct directories without help from me - all the while, the choir sang praises to the almighty digital god. With trepidation, I pushed "play," and was instantly enveloped in a sound that echoed the creation of all matter, a sound that vibrated every cell in my body to perfection. I was instantly taken to the next plane, where I saw the all-father. I knew with my entire soul, that all was good in the world.\n\nBut then I realized the game was blue, so I only gave it one star.

And lastly this is just a pet peeve due to the fact that video game based pool games always lack a degree of visual depth so you kind of need an aim marker for precise shots which in real life pool you can make just with your own judgement/imagination and this one while highly decent lacks the key feature of projecting a line for each ball struck and instead focuses on the cue and the first ball it hits.\n\nIn short for a pool game it's good for what it is, I'd say a 7/10 and if you enjoy pool and want a game that does a fairly good job of simulating it then this is a definite must while on sale, though honestly I'd never pay more than $5 for it.","November 22, 2014","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think I was only...what, five years old during the time?\n\nIn any case, the controls took some getting used to, but after about 10 minutes into playing "9 Ball", everything felt natural.\n\nThe camera angles give a nice sense of realism, and if adjusted correctly, you feel as if you're holding the pool stick yourself and hitting the target...with psychic eyes in seeing guidelines.\n\nThe physics in this game felt just right for me, where like real pool, speed and precision matter when banking shots, as well as how you plan to hit the ball, such as curving and hopping.\n\nThe graphics added a nice sense of realism to the game, and the crisp clear look on each ball gave the game a nice type of brilliance. The only thing I question is that every ball has a reflection, which is very awkward to me, since I know actual billiard balls aren't that reflective in real life. But I'm being anal at that point, and you might as well add scratches to the balls and pool table, and make the atmosphere bleak.\n\nYeah, that's real pool right there, but I'm digressing at this point.\n\nOverall, with the different types of modes in the game, and the option to play with a friend or online, this game is pretty solid, and I would recommend this game to any of my friends that want to play a billiards game without the need of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off pool owners for scratching up the leather.","November 22, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has nine-ball pool (pot the balls in sequence and whoever pots the last ball is the winner), eight-ball pool (the stripes and solids version), trick shots and online play.\n\nEvery match in the campaign mode has extra challenges that make each game different and help to ramp up the difficulty. For example, a challenge might be to get a four-ball streak, perform a kick shot, etc. There’s also a few bonus rounds with different modes of play.\n\nTutorials are excellent. It guides you through each step of the shot and makes it very easy to perform impressive stuff like kick shots, jump shots, combo shots, swerve shots and more. There's a surprisingly large amount of ways to hit a ball.\n\nYou can unlock different designs for the tables, cues and balls. You also unlock different locations to play pool in. These are purely cosmetic, but they look great and add to the overall experience.\n\nIf the idea of playing pool appeals to you - definitely get this. I personally have very minimal interest in pool, but it’s all so well done that I'm enjoying it anyway.","March 7, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You hit balls, get them in the pots, battle against AI or online, and rage at your friends for their skill at games. But there are a few flaws in this that make the game's screenshots exagerate how the game actually is.\n\nFirst of all, the physics in the balls are AWFUL. Atleast 20 times (not exageration) during my career I got the ball stuck RIGHT AT THE POT and it didn't go in. If we got it to atleast the edge, give us credit or something. It happens to everybody playing pool, but come on, you didn't have to make it THAT realistic. Besides, who has two extra fingers on each hand?\n\nSecond, the camera controls are amazingly crap. You MOVE YOUR MOUSE to move the camera. That's nice. How about when I'm trying to hit the ball? Can you KEEP THE CAMERA WHERE IT'S AT????? Half the time I'm trying to fix my camera or looking down the cue or I'm a 500 feet tall man that looks on the very top of the pool table.\n\nLast, the AI in this game is the hardest I've ever played. If you don't hit a ball, this AI will hit every striped/coloured ball it sees and you realise that you should use your time wisely because he hit all the balls, he's ready to hit the 8 ball, and you have to hurry and hit all your balls. It took me 3 times to beat the first guy. THE FIRST GUY. I have played pool as well, and I've went through the tutorial.\n\nMy honest review is that if this game is on sale, don't get your hopes too high but you could buy it. If it's at it's regular $10 price, it's not worth your money.","February 12, 2015","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Secondly, I have less than 1 hour of play time, just enough to play the tutorial.\n\nOkay, so that out of the way, for a game that I bought for less than $2 USD, this game is amazing.  Best billards/pool game I have ever played.  Beautiful graphics also. I give it a 9/10, just because no game is perfect.  One thing so far I have noticed is the lack of customizable music.  I'd like to listen to my own tunes while playing.  Just to give it more of a bar or bowling alley feel.  I do understand its supposed to be tournement/pro type of play, so that's okay.  Anyways, if anyone happens to read this while its ever on sale and is a billards fan, just buy the game.  I don't think I would have ever paid the full price for it, but that's not because its not a good game, I just like to find good deals on games.\n\nAlso, it would be cool if players could have custom decal or felt for the table also.","August 2, 2014","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a solid and balanced play system that almost identically replicates what it is like to actually go out to a pool hall on a friday night and just hit the tables with friends. I have noticed some very slight table friction that causes your que ball not to roll as it should always, but that is such a minimal issue. It's easily fixable by playing around and learning the physics. So why should you download Pool Nation>?\n\nBecause Pool Nation is crazy fun.

It´s been a while since I played a real game of Pool and it´s been even longer since I played a Pool game on a PC.\nI got Pool Nation in a Bundle and did not expect too much, but this Game (or should I call it a Simulation) is just brilliant.\nThe first thing one might notice are the visuals. The environments are beautifully crafted, as are the tables. The lighting is superb (although a little bit less bloom would have been nice), the textures (especially of the balls and the cloth) are very highly detailed. And you can even see the chalk coming off in the slow motions you get sometimes when you make a great shot.\nAnd the balls have nice, realistic looking reflections which only adds to the atmosphere.\nOne might think that the background tune is repetetive, but I did not feel that yet. It fits perfectly to the environments and it really wants to make you step into your screen, right into that room and have a very nice, calm and relaxing game of Pool.\n\nNow to the physics: When I played first, I played through the tutorial which was a good choice. I would not have expected that the cue / ball interaction is modeled that well. You can do whatever I can think of in real life with the cue and land all kind of Trick shots. It seems there´s even a (free?) DLC in the works which focuses on Trick shots, and I´m really looking forward to it.\n\nYou can attend several tournaments with different rules (there´s 8-ball, 9-ball and lots of other play styles you can choose from) and there´s Multiplayer which I did not try yet. I want to play through all the single player Tournaments first to get some practice.\n\nAnd the difficulty? Well, it´s partly up to you. You can select between various levels of how the game helps you to visually see in which directions the balls will roll. This is also great to teach you what kind of effects a shot by aiming the cue in specific angles to the white ball will have before you even shoot.\n\nI can only highly recommend Pool Nations and I don´t see anything another Pool game could make better.","August 17, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a good pool sim, but I wouldn't say the best. It has some little things that irk me especially having played other pool games like Virtual Pool, and of course real life pool (in which I suck lol).\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, though at times it may be a little too shiny, like everything is made of chrome. With some balls it's difficult to distinguish between the stripes and the solids due to how the light shines on them at some angles. It also has a tendency for the FPS to shoot up too much if you have a decent gaming rig, so be sure to use VSync or have some kind of frame limiter program like RTSS. The problem with the FPS shooting up is that it makes it harder to aim as how quickly the mouse moves is affected by it. There are no advanced graphics options adjustments except for VSync and anti-aliasing. An option to reduce shininess or even brightness/gamma would've been great.\n\nCue and ball control are fairly good. It may take some getting used to how noticeably slow the rails and the table are if you're coming from other pool games. The speed of the table and whatnot are not adjustable in this game. However, they feel somewhat similar to real life pool tables so that's not a bad thing. The only other odd thing I've noticed is that the side pockets are very open. You can pocket shots into them from angles that you just can't do in real life. Pocket size can't be adjusted either.\n\nThe UI and interface are very nice. I love the UI sound effects particularly. A minor issue about the interface is that it seems to have been optimized for play with a controller, however due to how slow and inaccurate you are with the controller when playing pool, it's much more comfortable to play with mouse and keyboard anyway. Because it was optimized for controller, the interface options can be a little confusing when playing on mouse and keyboard. Things like a "select" button to go forward/continue and they ask you to press "start" to view your completed challenges. Again it's a minor issue since these are mapped properly by default to certain keys and mouse buttons, but still something they could've addressed.\n\nThe music is nice, but short and repetitive, and I wish they would've given us more of that. I ended up turning the music off entirely within the first hour and I just play music in the background via iTunes. It's odd, because with a shiny, cool-looking pool game like this you would think they'd have a bit of good music to go with it. Casual games often do.\n\nOne more issue that bothers me about this game is that you watch your opponent taking the shot as if you're the one at the table taking the shot. This probably won't bother some people, but because of how quickly the AI thinks and how they move the cue, it can be very jarring. I wish they would give us the option to automatically switch to a fixed camera angle when it's the opponent's turn. I like the way Virtual Pool does it, where you're off to the side as if you're physically standing aside while your opponent takes their turn. An option for that would've gone a long way for me.\n\nAnd lastly, I need to comment on the game's AI. It's probably the worst part of it, and you have no choice but to play against it to unlock things like cue stick skins and ball sets. The AI seems to be suffering from a pre-programmed failure algorithm. You can watch even the low level AI make fantastic trick shots or amazing safety placings at the start of their turn, but then they'll suddenly miss on easy shots late in the turn, often on the last ball itself. After having played hundreds of matches against the AI, it feels like a pre-determined failure chance to make sure the player gets a chance at the table. It gets so bad that sometimes you'll miss on the 9-ball and it rattles in the pocket, and it'd go in if anybody sneezes, yet the AI somehow misses it too. As a testament to how rushed the AI feels, the AI never changes its shot (such as moving the ball or changing the angle at least) on the break. It's always dead center, and therefore you end up with very similar shot options all the time after the AI's break. I don't think that's cool. A good AI should make it feel like you're playing against humans too, again something that Virtual Pool did much better.\n\nOverall it's just another pool game. A good one, but it could definitely be better. Well worth the money if you get it on sale, and a great gift to give a friend if you know they're into this kind of game too. Then you can play each other online.","September 29, 2014","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
