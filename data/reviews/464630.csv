But I can't get a pass the profile and it gives me to cursors. very upsetting. I uninstalled it twice and got the same thing. How I feel right now is upset.","May 12","false","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Some games are bad without trying. this game really tried and succeded. puzzles areset so if you are called away you cant get off the screen so you have to pass. the only good thing about this game is its pretty.  not recommended for anyone who wants to have a good experience.  it really is awful.   cybermom 22","May 16","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Puzzles were generic and way to easy and the second half of the game it feels they just gave up and didn't bother with voice-acting, story or even names to what spirits I saved and suddenly it were over after about an hour of gameplay.","May 22","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
