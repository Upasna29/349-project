It was complete garbage back then, it is complete garbage now\n\nDetailed Review:\n\n- It is extremely expensie pay to win\n- It is pure pay to win, there is absolutely NO skill involved\n- It requires insane time investment, that is the only way to offset the pay to win aspect\n- it is insanely overdesigned and deliberately obfuscates valuable information. The purpose is so it looks deep. It is not deep, it just hides information from the player\n- All monetization methods are borderline unethical. This software is closer to virtual gambling casino than a game\n- It has innumerable game breaking bugs, that will cost you time and money. Even the TUTORIAL is broken!\n- It has numerous unethical practices, For example forcing (not asking, forcing) its employees to like the game in AppStore, youtube, Steam. So you know where the possitive reviews come from.\n- Another unethical practice - bullshoting. For example its trailer has elements that has nothing to do with the actual gameplay. It is subtly lying to you\n- The game is completely unfair PvP - every day your resources will be robbed by much stronger players and your army killed. Only way to prevent this is to be canstantly online\n\nConclusion - this is THE WORST piece the gaming industry has to offer. This game is what you would get, if the creators of farmville were greedier but also complete morons","April 22","false","0.2"," 128 of 138 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","128","138","8","0"

I liked building up a tiny nation, with a good army and all that, and I was close to getting my first ever colony.\nThen I was constantly raided by people, and that's when I quit the game.\n\nOver these 5 years, the 'game' has shown no improvement, in fact it's shown the opposite. The 'game' has 1 terrible update that I NEED to mention\n\nIf you have 5 times more, or less points then another player, you can't attack them. This sounds like a good solution to fix weak players being raided by stronger players right? Wrong, I still get raided by stronger players that have 2 times as many points as I do, and I end up getting raided, loosing battles because the combat is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible, and I end up quitting the 'realm'. I can't even find targets to raid so I can make back my resources, it comes down to "who has more units" for the combat system. It comes down to Big players raid medium players, causing medium players to raid small players, and small players (like me) have no one to raid becuase every one is below 200 points, or is too high up.\n\nTo sum it all up\nDon't play this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Pay-to-Win Freemium browser based piece of ♥♥♥♥ 'game'.\nHow the ♥♥♥♥ did this game get on steam?\nHow?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pixelmonarch/recommended/424780/","pixelmonarch",".PIXELMONARCH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pixelmonarch/","179 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThe worst port on steam.\nBefore I even start to review this game, please read this líttle note:\nI am aware of the lack of quality of facebook-, mobile-games. So this review is based on the average portation of games of this kind. At first I thought: "People that have only played this game for a hour or two can not review this with an real objective mind." but I can assure you, even just one hour is enough to write a solid and honest review of this game.\n\nThis game is reviewed as a game on steam and as a desktop game, not as a browsergame/mobilegame.\n\nThis game is your typical mid-2000s browergame with world resets and uncomplicated mechanics. The story is set in an medival time, so it has to compete against tons of different games of this kind.\n\nReview\nDesign:The design is simple but the details are pretty fine. Your provinces are designed quite clearn and even though it takes you a second or two, to find smaller buildings, it is very overviewable. The world design on the otherhand is very poorly designed. You barely cansee the difference between player provinces and barbarian provinces and the resourcefields are almost invisible marked with tiny little icons.\n\nThe interface is concepted very bad while the design is pretty good. The most annoying thing about the interface is, if you open a menu that is taller in height than the game itself, you are forced to scroll which can be confusing as you have the feeling of a window that is broken. 4/10\n\nMusic & Audio:Solid. Very solid. The backgroundmusic and audio of Imperia Online is pretty good and almost takes you back to the edival times. Only little problem is the random trigger of sounds that make no sense, such as a smith doing his job even though you are only browsing through the world. 8/10\n\nGameplay & Addiction:This game is by far the worst port of a facebook game / mobile game / browsergame that I've ever played.\n\nMaking a game with world resets in the 2010's is one of the most pointless ideas ever. Instead of creating new servers every now and then, Imperia Online LTD decided to reset the worlds, that's clearly a mid 2000's phenomenon that was used to save server costs and is the way of a publisher to tell their consumers "We are parsimoniously and rather delete all your archivements than let you play forever". If you, as a publisher, are scared, that the world will die itself and that's the reason why you reset the worlds, then you are only telling the consumers, that your game is so badly balanced, that you have to reset it so it won't break.\n\nThe royal family idea was a nice one but poorly translated into the game. They almost make no difference and barely based on any system at all. Within only two days I had so many children and grand-children, they could have run their own empire all together without any citizens.\n\nThe fighting system is pretty basic for a browsergame-port and easy to understand. The fact that you can't join the game after it started for a week or more is very sad. You will get grinded and raided by all the big, money paying players and have absolutely no chance to enjoy this game at all if you are not going to pay hundrets (not exaggerating.) of euros/dollars. We all know that free games are not free. We all know and accept that you have/should pay a few bucks to a freegame to unlock good features, but on this game you pay huge amounts to unlock game standards and if you do not pay, you will have absolutely no fun at all. This game is not pay to win, it is pay to play. 2/10\n\nCost-Benefit Equation & resumé:Even if this game is for free, it cost you a lot. I am not talking about money (not mainly), but about nerves. The game crashes are extreme. The connectivity of the steam, android, ios and browser version to eachother is zero. Bugs are plastering the street downhill you are taking from the moment you are installing this game until you are deinstalling it again. The support on the games own Steam-discussion board is zero. This is by far the worst portation of a browsergame I have ever played. I do not recommend this game programm at all.\n\nThank you! If you like this review, you can feel free to add me on Steam","May 15","false","5.5"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"

For example evony, known to be quite p2w, doesnt even compare to this when it comes to p2w.)\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Tutorial is a pain, no choice to do it on your own\n- There is no "do you really want to" message when using paid currency\n- The learning curve is huge, not because its hard, but rather because its badly documented ..\n- Speedups etc. is REALLY unbalanced! Paying vs free players is so big that this game become unplayable\n- Upgrading buildings feels kinda pointless, when you have the resource buildings to 10 its practically 100% about making an army ...\n\nPros\n\n- Great music! (Theres none)\n- The combat works quite well\n- Range and movement speed feels balanced\n\n\nPersonal conclusion:\n\nA free player wont stand a chance due to how unbalanced this game is. I.e. I as a free player and active from the start of the server has about 10k points. A paying player that defeated me had over 100k points ;) Making it practically impossible to fight back :P Supposedly theres a system to avoid players 5x stronger than you from attacking, but can't really say that worked here either. Anyways a paid player can be in first place and 4x as strong as the second place if he is willing to pay for it, now THAT is unbalanced.\n\nTLDR;\nThe game itself is ok enough, but the p2w destroys it badly.","May 29","false","58.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
