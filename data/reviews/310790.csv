"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/310790/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","The first thing I notice when starting up Geometry wars 3 for the first time are the stellar production values. The title screen alone with its swirling colored auras and a strange vector grid stretching out infinitely before you, the soothing electronic tones of the background music shimmering in and out like waves. Before even getting into the game I can already tell a tremendous amount of work has gone into the look, the feel, and the sounds of the game and have been focused on much stronger in this iteration of the series.\n\nThe progression of adventure mode is much more varied in levels than any of the classic games which will be a welcome addition to new players who craved a more content heavy experience. Across the adventure mode map you'll advance through levels of increasing difficulty and each with an important three star rating based on score. Aside from stars you'll earn points in order to purchase upgrades for your various drones, a newcomer to the Geometry Wars series that offers a number of abilities including back-up fire, mines, or magnetized pickups for the Geoms to keep your score multiplier going and let you focus on the action.\n\nEach new level features a different mode ranging from classic 'Evolved' to new additions like 'Rainbow', with a variation of differently shaped 3D landscapes dotted with rotating pillars, red life stealing walls, and various other obstacles thrown into the mix. Aforementioned stars will be needed to access the various boss stages that break up adventure mode, and they can be quite hard to collect especially if you're not a diehard twinstick player. Bosses feel like a strange and not very Geometry Wars-like addition, but they are nonetheless very intense and flashy with their chaotic bullet hell-like patterns.\n\nThe classic enemies players will remember from the last games are adapted to this new 3D playstyle very well, and their movement patterns flow almost more naturally than before on the spherical landscapes you fight on. The straight-moving arrow enemies wrap around the globe-like levels and criss-cross past each other, while the quick and sporadic square enemies sneak up on you from either side of the rotating stages. In addition to the classic geometrical enemies we've come to love/hate, there are a couple new enemies with unique behavior that spice up your old strategies.\n\nThe shapely structure to the stages that changes with each one gives a more strategic and tactical approach to the twin-stick formula forcing you to adapt to the area and its hazards each time, keeping certain players more engaged than before. Old schoolers will likely miss the euphoric rush and focused score attacks missing in this new iteration, but I've more than warmed up to it, come to terms with the differences and have found new excitement in taking my place on the boards for what is a different kind of game.\n\nGeometry Wars 3 has the variation, gamified progression, and massive content that some people felt was missing from the originals but older fans will more than likely miss the pure and calculated arcade action as well as the minimalistic neon visuals that the first two were known for. While GW3 may not bring the same-old-same-old that those fans were wanting, it does exactly what it's supposed to by pushing boundaries in the twin-stick medium and setting a new standard just as its predecessors did.","November 28, 2014","true","30.7"," 171 of 185 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","171","185","4","3"

I have only been playing for 20 minutes and I love it. The game looks amazing, runs amazing, and feels amazing. My analog stick is off and in most games I constantly move left, but they must have deadzone support because I don't move at all unless I move the analog stick myself. They have the original game types (King, Pacifism, Deadline, Evolved), Adventure Mode, Online, and tons more. I love the music, SFX, and 3D elements. I strongly recommend this to fans of the previous installments and to anyone who is debating whether to purchase the game.\n\nI thought I would post some more notes.. so here we go. I am not the best at Geometry Wars and it has been a while since I played, but so far, the game isn't very easy. It isn't like Angry Birds when you can easily get 3 stars on every level.. you have to really know what you are doing and play the level multiple times, and I really like that. I reached the first boss and was pleasently suprised. It took me multiple tries to defeat it, but was really an awesome experience. You have to watch for the enemies, fight the boss, and get Geoms all while under a time limit.\n\nThe game is super intense and is honestly really fun.\n\nEdit: If you have any questions on the game, feel free to comment or PM me and I can try to answer!","November 25, 2014","true","5.2"," 108 of 124 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","108","124","2","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/310790/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","The last Geometry Wars I played was Retro Evolved which came out close to 8 years ago. It was so simple, so beautiful & so challenging - it really stood out as one of the best shooters of the time (and still fun to play to this day). Sufficed to say I had high expectations for Dimensions.\n\nRather excited to start, I regrettably found myself spending the first 30 minutes trying to get the game to run properly. Control were not responsive & everything had severe lag. Forums highlighted that the game needs to be run in windowed fullscreen mode, not the normal fullscreen. Even though a lot of people experience this it has not yet been patched which is disappointing to say the least. Now it’s running properly - it does feel like a whole new game!\n\nResponsiveness is spot on, fast, instant, allowing your reflexes to kick in. I felt right at home like I was playing the same Retro Evolved in gorgeous neon high definition, three dimensional landscapes. No longer is it a flat grid, it bends & warps and also introduces other fully 3D geometric shapes (such as spheres, cylinders, squares & many more). These are awesome fun to play & cannot be overstated enough how much positive impact they have in the game design. Each of these offer a unique challenge, requiring different tactics or strategy as you adjust your shooting around the shapes/curves. Makes it harder, but keeps it interesting.\n\nSpeaking of harder .. Dimensions is one of the toughest shooters I have played in a long time. In the Adventure mode (series of 50 levels to unlock, including power-ups & bosses), I got stuck on the first level for quite some time (can't remember the last time I got stuck on the first mission on a game :lol:). I like to consider myself a little above average with my shooters but this one I am finding is hardcore! Its too early to see if the high difficulty will discourage longer term, repeat play (or perhaps have the opposite effect), but for now I am still making progress. Along with the Adventure mode, you also have a bunch of classic modes (e.g. King, Pacifism, Deadline, Evolved) to try from previous Geometry War titles, local co-op & an online multiplayer mode. Good variety & certainly more than previously offered in the series.\n\nEnemy designs remain largely the same & you will notice many classics that you love to hate. There are some new enemies too. Each has a unique pattern, unique shape & colour making them instantly recognisable even when things get hectic. There are times though, were things get too crazy with all the enemies, fireworks & geoms on the screen but it’s at the right intensity & is balanced well.\n\nThe overall quality (technical issue aside) can be seen throughout, from the eye-popping gorgeous graphics, energetic music & effects to the little refinements like being able to press 'X' straight after your last life to restart level instantly (no menus needed). Results are a real joy to experience, one that I think has raised the bar for twin-stick shooters for 2015; much like Waves did in my view a couple years back.\n\nWorthy addition to the Geometry War series.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","January 9, 2015","true","5.7"," 58 of 62 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","58","62","2","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VALIS/recommended/310790/","VALIS","VALIS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VALIS/","7552 products in account","A worthy if not superior sequel to two of the greatest modern arcade-styled games. That says it all right there, but let me go into finer detail.\n\nGeometry Wars 3 is similar to #2 in a lot of ways, but the biggest addition is 3-D arena shapes rather than the standard 2-D rectangle. Spheres, tubes, globes, warped rectangles and more; It reminds me of Super Stardust HD at times, as well as the '80s arcade classic, Tempest. Also new is the ability to upgrade your ship (only in the Adventure mode) with different helper drones and abilities, and it's rather necessary to do this to achieve three stars on most levels, as well as adding an extra layer of depth in tinkering to come up with the best "loadout" to ace a level.\n\nThere is also a classic mode which is quite similar to Geometry Wars 2, which did not receive a PC port, unlike the original. I believe five of the six game modes from Geo Wars 2 are present here, but it's been a few years and I don't quite remember all the modes. Of course there are leaderboards for all these modes, as well as each separate level on Adventure, and leaderboard jockeying is a core part of the Geo Wars experience.\n\nThe controls felt a slight bit sluggish at first, but switching the video mode to 'windowed borderless' made the controls feel instantaneous, every bit as quick as the first two versions if not better. If your controls feel sluggish, read the forum where people are posting various tips and fixes.\n\nGeometry Wars 1 and 2 are among my favorite games of all time, so I had a lot of personal stake in this latest, announced-out-of-nowhere version, hoping it wasn't going to be a quick knock-off based on name alone. I'm happy to report this game is worthy of the Geometry Wars name and then some, looking like it's going to be another modern arcade classic for me. Dozens of hours of white-knuckle, twin-stick bliss await.","November 25, 2014","true","6.0"," 61 of 67 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","61","67","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdmiralTurtle/recommended/310790/","AdmiralTurtle","Turtleboats","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdmiralTurtle/","478 products in account","First things first. The thing everyone is wondering, is it as good as past geometry wars? I would say yes, and in fact a lot better. It is perhaps the best geometry wars game out yet to date. *GASP*  I have played all of the geometry wars, from the first one to even the Wii and Ds games. Love the series. Many long time fans were worried  since this wasn't developed by the Bizzarre creations guys that it just wouldn't be the same. But fear not, much of the old staff has transitioned to the newly formed Lucid Games (after they disbanded from making Blur) which in turn created this masterpiece!\n\nFor any of you that wanted the classic gameplay, those modes are in with the updated snazzy visuals.  There are many classic modes to choose from, from pacism mode, to the tried and true three stock mode, to the waves mode just to name a few. So if you are an old time fan of the series, you will love the updated visuals paired with the classic gameplay.  Along with these modes is a local co-op mode for you and a buddy to tackle head on together!\n\nOn top of the geometry wars you have all grown to know and love, there is a new adventure mode, something similar to what you might have seen in the Wii version. There are a multitude of maps and different traps to conquer on Lucid Game's newly envisioned 3d playing field. The new and unique 3d playing field brings on for exciting gameplay challenges that haven't been seen in past iterations. No longer are you shooting on a flat surface, but now you are traversing through spheres or other geometrical shapes. Not only does each map have a leaderboard, but it also has a three star system for you to aim for if the top score is not your preference. You can ignore the star system just like the leaderboard scores, but as your point score racks up, you see the star meters guage fill up, just teasing you to three star each map. You are always left with the feeling, "One more run and I can finish that last star!" Another exciting addition inside the adventure mode are boss fights where you have to tackle a boss with its own unique set of traits.  These boss fights are not for the feint of heart and are quite difficult for even the seasoned veteran like myself.\n\nOne of the first things you notice about this game are the visuals. They are beautiful and have that eye popping look accompanied by bright neon explosions.  Along with the vibrant visuals, the soundtrack has a thumpy electro vibe that matches the fast and frenetic nature of Geometry Wars, a perfect fit!\n\nPerhaps one of the coolest features I am really excited for and hopefully the Steam community for geometry wars gets big enough is the multplayer mode.  You might be asking, "What? Multiplayer in my Geometry Wars?" There is a matchmaking mode online where you can compete against other players.  You go around shooting, competing for ammo, upgrading your ship, and taking down bosses. Whoever can score the most points/take down the bosses wins. A nice challenging and new creative way to play Geometry Wars.\n\nFrom the updated beautiful visuals, the new 3d playing field, adventure mode, to the classic and new matchmaking modes, for any old or new fan, Geometry Wars 3 will be an addicting game that will consume us for hundreds if not thousands of hours again. If Lucid games had just ported the classic modes without any of the graphical changes, that alone would have made it a great game, but there is a whole bunch more here than just that!\n\nBrb, back to playing!","November 25, 2014","true","10.5"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","35","41","0","1"

For everyone one else, you are in for an Aficionado treat.\n\nAfter 6 long years, the moment I thought never possible is here, as ‘Lucid Games’ releases to us the next chapter of intense arcade action with Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions. This is the epitome of “arcade” gaming, the reason why kids everywhere stood around a cabinet, converted their lunch money into quarters and pumped them into a machine to top each other’s score. If you ever wondered what a “Twin Stick” game is, this is the perfect definition.\n\nWhen ‘Lucid Games’ announced their latest production, a flood of 2 stick nostalgia and excitement hit me with the force of a round-house kick to the face. The day Steam posted Dimensions for presale, my twin stick senses were tingling as I couldn’t pay for the game fast enough. Waiting for release day, the hardcore fanatics were ranting and raving in the forums and this gave me a minute to reflect as I wondered if I wasn’t over-hyping myself with high expectations for this sequel.  Which lead me to ponder the possibility of disappointment in a game that has a long history, a strong cult following, is a standard model for a Twin Stick Shooter, and a title I’ve dedicated a lot of time to in subsequent versions.\n\nIt was these doubts that made me nervous going into the game and it wasn’t until I started playing it when that familiar flood of nostalgia and excitement came back with the force of a pile-driver. Wow, this is the Geometry Wars that the PC always deserved. The simplistic game play and tight control was always and still is a twin stick enthusiasts dream but for the PC twin stick enthusiast that has been neglected the content the consoles were blessed with by ‘Bizarre Creations’, Dimensions makes those dreams, a wet one.\n\nWith that, so you are now aware of where I’m coming from, and as I review this game I will attempt to give it to you as straight factual without the euphoric bias opinions, as much as an enthusiast can be possible. Though, the simplistic game play doesn’t require a complex description as Lucid still used the same model of Geometry Wars gameplay and used a lot facets from the prior versions of the game. Several game modes from the 360’s ‘Retro Evolved 2’ were used in modes of game play, drone usage, some power ups, and variants of arenas from Nintendo’s ‘Galaxies’ were also included in this new release. Dimensions does have its uniqueness as the graphics were revamped, they added some 3D mapping, added a couple new enemy models, some new power-ups, a little online team play, and long awaited boss fights. Viola! Now you have Dimensions!\n\nLucid breaks these up in several different modes. Adventure, Classic, Online, Local Co-Op, and Bonus which are outlined below:\n\nAdventure mode:This feels like Galaxies though maps are different, even giving us 360 degrees of mapped environmental movement and shooting in some. It take Geometry to new worlds (the 3rd one!) adds a new difficultly to the game, especially for some enemies like those green one’s that were easier trapped on a wall to kill. Going from a 2D arena based shooter the 3D 360 degree mapping arena was aspect I had to get used to, but I was destroying polygons within no time. This mode also adds boss fights which takes Geometry Wars to a whole new level and something I’ve always wished for. Also new to Geometry Wars are some power ups and awesome new types of game play. Overall from the whole game, Adventure mode feels like the most time, thought and effort were put into it.\n\nClassic mode:Straight from the 360’s ‘Retro Evolved 2’, you get Deadline, King, Evolved, Pacifism (defying the “shooter” genre) and Waves. Evolved is a slightly different version than the PC version found here on Steam and Waves is also pretty much the same thing that can be found on Project Gotham Racing 3 as a sub-game. The modes are nothing new as they all seem like they were ported straight from the 360 and given a face lift.\n\nOnline mode:Another first for Geometry Wars and is a limited offering of 2 game modes of play called Stock and Summoner. Both are online team based consisting of 4 players each team. The objectives are simple. In Stock, the first team to destroy the boss wins. In Summoner, teams take over towers for control and the team with the highest score wins. A little disappointing but I’m sure there are more modes coming and being an Activision product, you can almost expect it to be a DLC you will need to pay for. I’ve got my thumbs crossed!\n\nLocal Co-Op mode:This is basically a variant of Adventure mode, except you play with another player on your PC. It is only 10 missions long and that includes one boss. Again, a little disappointing and likely, another upsell from our friends at Activision.\n\nBonus:These were additional maps that were provided for presale participants. You get 3 and they are basically just variants of existing 3D maps in Adventure mode. Though they have additional features like moving walls, portals and enemies. It’s a minute disappointment but still something I will gladly accept.\n\nProblems:All of that is not to say that this game didn’t have its problems. The black holes and explosions are a little lackluster compared to prior versions but my issues with the design are petty. However, the graphic issues are not. Upon first loading the game I noticed some line flickering in the menus. Prior to actual gameplay I always check the settings to verify that they are good for my rig. This part of the menu the graphic options are limited and though I thought no changes were needed, I jumped into game play. The controls felt sluggish, the character sprite movement felt slow, and the overall resolution off compared to the videos and what I was used to with subsequent Geometry Wars. I also confirmed this among other enthusiasts using both AMD and Intel CPU’s as well as Radeon and nVidia GPUs. After tweeking the few graphic options made available, changing the display mode setting from “Full Screen” to “Windowed – Borderless” fixed the problems and running both windows and Dimensions at 1080, basically looks ‘Full Screen’ without the problems of ‘Full Screen’ mode. A minor issue but still one that shouldn’t happen.\n\nOnce the graphic issue were fixed those familiar tight controls felt solid again, the 3D mapping more crisp, the frame rate higher, the game play more “action-y”, and the deaths felt less cheap.\n\nOverviewGame Play: Twin Stick 3D Arena Shooter\nGraphics: Great – once you get past the issues.\nSound: Good – Dimensions has that familiar but revamped techno thumping sound track, though the sound effects of picking up Geoms gets a little old after a while.\nControls:Freaking Awesome! – A good, comfortable controller is highly recommended. Dimensions does offer the keyboard and mouse control combo but you lose a lot of the movement angles that that are needed in some modes with the keyboard and is not recommended.\nReplayability: OMG Yes! I find myself playing one mode over and over, knowing there are over 50 other modes that I love, just to top my friends score. Arcade addiction at its finest!\nOverall: 10/10!\nBeside the limited modes and fixable graphic issues, Geometry wars 3: Dimensions is an all-around awesome experience and one I cannot recommend enough to everyone! This is a must buy!\n","November 26, 2014","true","42.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","3"

I feel like in their little office they were just coming up with ideas for marketing ploys and said "hey why don't we take geometry wars make a sequel and make it totally way over digitalized for the younger generation." By this, I mean they went out of their way to make some different songs all that have the standard bass beat line you would hear in any normal techno song. For some it might not be bad, but compared to the music they have put into this game to the original Geometry wars (they remixed that too, btw they should have just kept that one alone I can't even get into the remix version) music it just gets irritating. I don't like how in arcade mode even though you have just the flat 2d square they have to make the camera all warped. Really, I played this for thirty minutes, then bought Geometry Wars retro evolved for $4 (But please, read more)\n\nGoing on to positive side now.\n\nOnce you get to levels 10 and up in adventure mode, the get actually gets pretty hard. Which I am sure will entertain old veteran Geometry Wars fans. It takes some getting used to but it is great fun. I admit I had my doubts, I did buy retro evolved shortly after purchasing this game out of dissapointment. But then I gave this game more of a chance, I got to the first boss battle, then the second, and then things got interesting. I won't spoil much of it but I will say if you are an old old geometry wars veteran then you should consider buying both this game and the retro evolved version as you will find yourself wanting to play both version. This game has a good amount of replayability but I still think people will crave the old retro evolved version time to time, as at times you will get frustrating with the difficulty of having to unlock stars for further stages.\n\nAll in all, it is a good game and I don't regret my purchase. You should consider it if you have always been a Geometry Wars fan. 8/10 for a casual shooter.","December 15, 2014","true","5.1"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

So far, I'm enjoying the collection bot that seeks out any uncollected multipliers while I concentrate on staying alive.

I got the second one the minute it was put onto the Xbox Live arcade servers, and I am happy to report that I would recommend this game to any veterans of the series, or even newcomers.\n\nNormally I'm not one to care about high scores and leader boards, but there is something about Geometry Wars that is insanely addicting. You find yourself constantly replaying levels going "I can do better." I love everything about it. Not only is the score-chasing a thrill, but the actual twin-stick shooting mechanics have always been the best in the genre. If twin-stick shooters were ecstacy, Geometry Wars would be molly. Pure bliss.\n\nBoth Geometry Wars 2 and 3 have added new things to the series. Geometry Wars 2 added several new modes, and they started to include Geoms to increase your multiplier. This was probably created to attempt to get players to not do the strategy that was pretty much required to do well in the first game, which was just flying in a circle and kiting the enemies behind you. It wasn't very dynamic, but adding Geoms into the mix makes it to where you can play riskier to increase your multiplier before they disappear. Now the third game comes along and adds this adventure mode where tons of new modes are added, AND all the previous modes from Geometry Wars 2 are available as well.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game, and I can't wait to sink even more hours into it. I can't recommend it it enough.

The games are kinda difficult to understand but if you like twinstick shooters you can get hooked.  There is no other game where I get competitive about being on the highscore list.\n\nThe music is great, the gameplay is great, the screen will blind you,  but you'll love every minute of it.  If you compare this game to retro evolved, evolved mode is a lot harder as there are new enemies, black holes are much harder to take out as they make it impossible to see while shooting them, and chargers that spawn earlier than I remember in old retro evolved.  The guys that go in a straight line also kinda throw a wrench in my old strategy of just going in large circlur motion across stages where it was possible.  This makes for interesting gameplay imo since it lets you strategize per stage.  The scoreboards per stage also adds a bit of competitive fun for me.\n\nIf your a fan of the previous games this won't let you down and if your new to the series this is probably a good time to start.\n\nDisclosure: I received a review copy of this game, I do not believe that this has affected me in my decision to curate and recommend this title but I like to tell my followers anyways.","December 13, 2014","true","8.6"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","24","35","0","0"

Great.\n\nSo, now let's understand something important about this game. There's no story. Apart from that driving aspirations to grind your score so high it quadruples your friends' pathetic scores. Reign supreme as the name at the top of the list. Sure, you can go slay dragons in another game and feel perhaps a greater supremacy and satisfaction, but there's no denying the satisfaction you gain when you finally finish a level with 3 stars you've been retrying for the past hour or so. Sometimes you just have to take a step back from the world on the inside of your monitor, and enjoy a game for what it actually is: a bunch of shapes.\n\nOh, I should actually explain what you're getting? Well, for a measly 15 bucks (almost 20 in AUD) you get a twin stick shooter with you as a measly little shape, armed with a laser against hordes of geometry shapes. Battle will happen on a multitude of single player challenges, where you fly about and destroy everything you possibly can, scoop up the green scraps and destroy even more for more green scraps. Blowing stuff up gives you points. Green scraps gives you multiplier. You can't do without either. And if that's not enough, you can even bring some friends along with you to make your war against the shapes easier... or perhaps more interesting, as you steal both kills and geoms from your rivals. Your score is the only thing that matters. Oh, did I mention there are some boss battles?\n\nBut I'll admit, the game won't last you as long as some of the bigger games of today. Or maybe it will? Alas, the thrill of beating scores over and over will eventually burn out. There's no denying that. But for a mere fraction of the price of bigger titles, you really shouldn't pass this up.

That clone isn't available any more, so I am extremely happy to buy and play the official Game, third installment.\n\nI read through various reviews, especially negative ones, and understand the criticism. But to me as a casual player who would be happy with only the classic mode and needs games that run on Linux, this is probably one of the best shooters I can get.\n\nThe gameplay is basically always the same, there is a limited number of enemies, but I don't care. For me, this game is about hand-eye coordination, being able to read complex and hectic situations, and getting in the "zone". I can't say I have reached that level yet, it will probably take many many hours to be able to make millions of points in a zen-like state, and maybe at that level I will also notice the supposedly sluggish controls and inaccurate hitboxes. So... if you're a pro gamer, or familiar with the geometry wars series, read the negative reviews I guess. If you're looking for some harmless action fun, get this game.\n\nCons:\n\nWhat annoyed me at first was that I can't switch to keyboard + mouse mode, the game always uses the controller. I could probably fix that by removing the controller, but I like the controller gameplay quite a bit after a few hours.\n\nAnother minor annoyance is that even the "classic" mode has a 3d view of the playing area, and that due to camera movement you don't always see all the borders of the field.

I go on benders with this game so long that the brightly colored shapes burn into my brain and I see them behind closed eyelids. I've been a fan of the series since the first one (the mini-game) and watched it grow, and this iteration is leagues ahead of its predecessors as well as any similar titles you might find on Steam. The production values are top-notch and the gameplay is finely tuned and addictive & varied enough to keep you playing for hours and coming back for more. From the slick menus to the creative, psychedelic 3-dimensional level designs and variety of ways to approach them, it's clear the developers put a lot of love and effort into this. However, what impressed me most wasn't the polished presentation, but rather the variations on the basic types of gameplay modes and how they translate over to 3 dimensions. There are still flat-surfaced levels, but on the 3D stages, you (and your enemies, the types and behaviors of which are vast) have command of the entire surface which is sometimes covered with stragetically placed walls and other interactive objects. This opens up worlds of new possibilities, and the developers clearly explored a large amount of them. In fact, a recent free update (in which "Evolved" was added to the game's subtitle) introduced even more level designs. With the attention to detail and sheer amount of gameplay elements - some of which are continually being added - you really get the feeling that this is a labor of love for the folks at Sierra.\n\nI'd like to address a very common complaint I've noticed: the difficulty. When I first started playing this, I agreed that it was insanely difficult and the learning curve too steep, but after spending a few hours with it, I felt increasingly comfortable and began to advance quite quickly through the adventure mode. In fact, a few days after getting this, I revisited those early stages I initially had so much trouble with and wound up getting the full 3 star score on all of them with relative ease. It's true that the amount of enemies on screen at one time and the frantic pace at which the game operates can be extremely overwhelming to people not used to it (as can the cheesy techno soundtrack), but it is not impossible. If you have at least decent hand-eye coordination and a twin-stick controller (and I cannot stress how important it is to use a modern, dual analog stick controller like the Xbox 360's with this game), rest assured, you'll get the hang of it. And this is one game most definitely worth getting the hang of.","April 8, 2015","true","22.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

I'm looing to live countless hours on this amazing arcade game and I'm so happy to have it back!\n\nIMPORTANT: Be sure to disable v-sync in your GPU control panel, as right now there is no in-game option and the lag will absolutely be noticable if you are experienced with the last installment. Also do yourself a favor and buy a controller if you dont already have one so you can kick back with this phenomenal twin-stick shooter!\n\n10/10 and must-buy for fans of the GW series","November 26, 2014","true","62.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The bulk of the game consists of "Adventure" mode, a linear progression through 50 maps.  Lucid Games did an admirable job injecting an impressive amount of variety into each of the levels.  The result is that you usually won't feel like you're trying to achieve the same objective over and over again (for 50 maps).  There are a few duds in the mix--I've never been a fan of the missions where you see how long you can prevent enemies from completely "painting" the arena--but the game makes up for it with a lot of missions that are genunely fun to replay.\n\nReaching certain goals and milestones unlocks upgrades for your ship (like buddy drones and super weapons) while obtaining higher scores grants you a sort of currency that can be used to improve these upgrades.  While you'll ultimately have more points to spend than things to invest them in, you can only take one of each type on a given mission with you, so you need to think about the level you're going in to and what will benefit you most.  Maybe a defensive buddy is important for a 1-life survive-as-long-as-you-can mission, but a gem (point) collector drone is better for a timed mission.  Similarly, certain super weapons are better on certain maps than others.  The ability to customize your loadout helps add some depth to the game.\n\nIn addition to "Adventure" mode are three other main modes:  "Ultimate" mode, which plays like a crazier, 40-level version of "Adventure" mode; "Hardcore" mode, which is primarily levels from "Adventure" and "Ultimate" modes, minus the ability to use drones/super weapons, and "Classic" mode, which is simply the ability to choose from the 6 primary mission types featured in previous Geometry Wars installments.\n\nAs the game is all about stars, points, and high-scores, it can really create a "one more time" itch for people who like seeing how high they can get on the leaderboards.  The game itself provides a reasonable challenge--I wouldn't qualify it as an especially difficult twinstick shooter by any stretch--but for those who are looking to score 3-stars (or beat friends/global scores) the game can put up enough of a fight that you probably won't sleepwalk through levels.\n\nPackage it all up in a coherent lo-fi arcade art-style and you've got a solid twinstick-shooter timesink that likely offers more content than the average person will be able to tackle.  I probably wouldn't recommend taking it on without a gamepad of some sort, though.","April 7","true","65.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

As a past player of all three games, Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions hits the mark and goes a mile beyond offering a very solid game on all planes. Gameplay, visuals, music and all, it has risen to my top pick of the Geometry Wars series.\n\nThe gameplay is snappy, responsive and most importantly: intense. The contents is the same as per Geometry Wars -- shoot varius geometric shaped enemies with defined characteristics in a given plane. The number and diversity of enemies increases as you fend yourself off, which will have you clenching your input device as you weave yourself around the plane. As well as an array of classic modes found in past games, Dimensions has also included a story mode.\n\nThe nature of story mode might seem a bit head scratching at first, but its execution makes it feel like a natural extension of the game's experience. Each mission tweaks the contraints of the level and offers a unique twist to the game's original gameplay. What kind of plane you play on, the enemies you may see/how they spawn, and other quirks vary from level to level, which offers some good variety. Also seen is a feature called drones which is little bot that assists you in story mode missions. This feature is a neat addition as it allows the player to change its behaviour and upgrade its abilities using points accumulated through playing missions.\n\nLeaderboard support is also well implemented. Every mode in classic has a leaderboard as well as every single mission in story mode has its own leaderboard -- both global and friends. For anyone who loves to score attack and compete with friends or others around the globe, this game has you covered.\n\nAll in all, Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions is absolutely amazing. It takes the elements of what makes Geometry Wars immensely enjoyable then builds upon it and gives it a refreshing polish.\n\nNotable features:\n-Addictively intense gameplay\n-Responsive controls\n-Loads of leaderboards\n-Great visual polish\n-Music that fits the mood\n-Online Multiplayer and Local 4 Player\n\nShortcomings:\n-Many story mode gameplay mechanics and enemies are exclusive to that mode\n-Leaderboards are not available through Steam Community web interface\n\nRating: pineapple/10 (aka RTFR: Read the fine review)","April 1, 2015","true","25.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Every level along the way automatically lists who has the best scores and even flags levels that someone's surpassed you on, making for a lot of "Hey, when you get a chance go check the boards again" kind of fun back-and-forth asynchronous multiplayer.\n\nNow battles take place on 3D objects and make for more visual chaos by causing ripples throughout it.\n\nThey've included progression for weaponry as well as new powerups.  Definitely an evolution from before.  I'm impressed how these guys make it significantly better each time.\n\nGeometry Wars classic has basically been redone and included in this as well, if you delve into the minigame area.\n\nIf you like twinstick shooters, this one should satisfy.","February 6, 2015","true","8.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

First of all, I must have been late to the party because I've only just found out about the game; let alone being developed by Lucid Games (a company I have no idea on their track record). Alright fine, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt that Sierra can provide good quality control over this game. I wasn't wrong either.\n\nFirst off, I'd recommend you start with Adventure Mode. Why? Because classic mode is pretty much untouched as far as I can see it; sections include Deadline, King, Evolved, Pacifism, and Waves. Sequence? Not this time around, we have Adventure mode to fill that in. And I believe the game shines it's best with this new addition.\n\nSo the first thing you'll notice from the wacky screenshots is the 3D stages. Does this work? Yes, it does and from your first hour it's not hard to see why. First off, they went with the 3D style on everything as opposed to the bright eye-burning sensation that started this series and overloaded in 2 (that was still fun). But saving your eyes will be the least of your worries as you'll try over and over to get that 3rd star in each level. Honestly, the game is pretty simple enough to get the first, if not the second star. But it really hits you when you aim for the last one.\n\nAs you're playing through, you'll notice a few things. First off is the powerups. How will you notice, well visually there is an attackable structure that appears on the map for your ship to fire at. Coupled with that is the voice calling "super state" (at least that's what I hear) that blends in well with the music. These super states, which were found in Geometry Wars 2 multiplayer, range from fast attack, double or triple shot, guided shot, or a combination if you destroy two when one's timer isn't used up.\n\nFor those looking for a real nostalgia trip, then rush to the 3rd stage in Adventure Mode. Right there is where you get your "ah ha" moment helping you to remember the old game you knew and love. Not to mention the stellar music you'll soon be humming to (don't lie, we all do it!).\n\nOverall, this game is a blast. I personally haven't tried the multiplayer mode (unsure how online will work. Local will be later on) but I assume it's pretty well polished, if not, especially for the local. You'll be looking at this knowing it's like the previous installments, but rest assure this isn't a clone. It's taken what we all loved about the past and added some new innovative way to keep us entertained with our eyes locked on the screen.","November 25, 2014","true","32.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This vortex seemed innocuous at first. Nothing seemed to be happening. The farmer had made a small sum charging people to come see it, but people got bored. "Hey, that's a boring vortex." they would say. So they let it be, sitting there quietly humming.\n\nIt would be years before we discovered the horrifying truth. The vortex was in fact syphoning all colour from our video game entertainment. We didn't notice at first because the 1990's had brought a shameful bout of "Grimdarkness" to our media, and so we attributed this lack of colour in games to words like "gritty", and "Batman". We were fools. FOOLS!\n\nLuckily someone did notice, and that person was Sierra, who is not actually a person. They are an old video game company that died and was mysteriously revived from the grave. It is a strange ghoulish version of Sierra, some would say it no longer has any humanity due to the lich lord that resurrected it, however the ghoul Sierra has seemingly brought with it a gift from beyond the grave. They brought with them a new game... a special game that contains All The Colours.\n\nYes, be warned, for while this game will finally let loose the missing colours thought destroyed by the Grimdarkness, your fragile mind may not be able to maintain sanity in the presence of such vibrance. Your dulled senses could fry when forced to interpret information such as red and orange. You may witness greens and blues. There will be pink.\n\nA great gift has been bestowed upon us... but are we capable of handling it's power?

There, I said it. This game has usurped Super Stardust HD’s throne. The various drones and supers you can upgrade create a variety and freedom of choice unparalleled in any other twin stick. The developers have clearly gone back to the drawing board again and again to wring out every possible level variety they could imagine – you will not find the same basic arena over and over in this game, no siree. Enemy variety is abundant enough, as well – you will learn to hate some and taunt others. Plus, boss fights!\n\nI admit, I was frustrated with the level progression until they nerfed it in a recent patch, and now the game is perfect. There is massive replay potential in the variety of loadouts you can choose, and going for three stars in every level will keep you challenged for a long while. I haven’t even tried the co-op yet – looking forward to it. Not to mention, the graphics are gorgeous – pay close attention as the levels morph into gridlined 3D maps at every start. The music is pure pulse-pounding techno goodness, as glittery as the neon-soaked graphics.  This game oozes polish.\n\nTo top it with a cherry, the devs have thrown in modes that ape the previous entries in the series all for free, basically giving you the entire series in one game. How cool is that?\n\nIf you are new to twin stick shooters, look no further. If you are fan of the series already, you must be playing it right now rather than reading this.\n\nThis is the best shooter on Steam.

You can fail a level ten times with a measle score and suddenly - only by playing a little better - get an amazingly high score. Another important thing is to pick your tools for each level.

The developers of this game stuck true to the original developers vision without severly altering the franchise, while adding a new 3D twist.\n\nThe visuals are incredible, though the game is hard just like the first 2 games by Bizzare Creations, it is worth the challenge, especially with the 3D maps. This is also fun if you're looking for a newish Retro game to play.\n\nControllers should work with this game, I plugged in my Xbox 360 controller and the game knew what it was right away. No setup required. Just plug and play.\n\nI give this game a 9/10. It has really surpassed my expetations for a Gemetry Wars Game, of course not everyone maybe able to enjoy it since it requires a bit of a learning curve, and a challenge to really get past a lot of the levels, but I say it's still fun.\n\nYou don't even have to take my word for it, try it out yourself when a trail version hits the scene on here or on the 360 tomorrow if you don't feel like investing $14.99 just yet.

If you are new to the series, and like twin-stick shooters, this is the ultimate.\n\nThe have the graphics all polished up and levels are now fully-3D, I never played Geometry Wars 2 but coming from the first one I must say it's nice to see so much could be done while maintaining the graphical style of the original.\n\nThe game, in my hour or so playing, has been flawless.  I like how I can turn on my 360 controller AFTER the game is running and it will detect it without rebooting the game.  It's the little things like that where you can tell they went the extra mile to make it the definitive experience.\n\nMy favorite part is the leaderboards.  It's your usual leaderboard scheme where you can see the top of the global charts, where you position in the global scheme (per level), or see how you rank up against your friends.  This makes replayability time basically infinite.  I see it a lot on Steam games so it's not a new concept but to see it on the game was a welcome sight.\n\nLocal multiplayer sounds incredible.  Can't wait to try it.\n\nI don't see a "Steam Cloud" badge on the store page here, I'll do a test to see if I can resume my progress from another machine.  If not, that would be one disappointing aspect.\n\nOverall, if you are a die-hard and pay full price, you will get your money's worth.

Maybe I just need more time with the game to recognize them quickly?\n\n3)  Ability to automatically generate a replay video - for YouTube or otherwise.  I've been FRAPSing my runs, but it seems like an automatic replay video that was shareable from within the game would have been easy to do, and neat.\n\nNitpicks, though.

I have bought and played every version on every console and it's got to be one of the top 3 arcade games of all time in my opinion. I can recommend this to anyone that likes Geometry wars even though i do have a few issues with the game but they are just nitpicks because overall the game is fantastic. I do wish that they would have made it more like Geomety Wars Galaxies for Nintendo DS which is the best release to date imo. This is simmilar in a lot of ways but i sitll believe that the DS release is the top GW game out. Adventure mode is fun but the timed stages i'm not to fond of, i'm more of a classic style guy, give me 3 lives and let me go at it but it's still not enough to hurt the gameplay. You get to unlock support drones after beating bosses and upgrade them along the way which is one of my favorite features taken from GW Galaxies. Besides aadventure mode there's a ton of other game types to play including classic, coop and bouns stages. I'm still new to the game so there is stuff i have yet to try out but so far this game is the bees knees. Cop it, load it, play it, shoot stuff.","November 26, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is for you.\n\nFrom the now resurected publisher Sierra, I had my doubts about this game. Most of which were washed away when I finally got around to picking this up. This is the game that you will always come back to. This is the game you just want "one more crack" at the highscore. Dry your eyes worry soul. The same addicting game is here in a more refined and complete package.\n\nIn this version they revamped the visual style from Geomtry Wars 1 and 2. I had my personal distaste with the visuals of Geomtry wars 2. Most of my complains being, in motion, the visual style is alot harder to see things when enemies spawn on higher levels of play. The visual representation of 3 is alot easier on the eyes in motion and the inclusion of 3d playing fields is something I welcome ALOT.\n\nNow as far as gameplaymodes every thing is here from Geomtry wars 1 and 2 now with the inclusion of Adventure mode. Adventure mode being a 50 level challenge mode where you test your skills to complete in various game modes and boss fights(It saves progress too). YES this version includes Boss fights similar to those found in Super Star dust HD(on PS3).\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of shmups or arcadey games of yesteryears you owe it to yourself to give this game a try. You might, keep coming back.","November 26, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Geo Wars 3 however, has enough variety to be a good single player experience even if you don't care about leaderboards. I can play Evolved, try a new level, try and get 3 stars on an old level, try one of the weird bonus levels, play classic if I'm bored of 3d levels, play pacifism, etc.\n\nEven if you don't love the 3d levels, drones, and super powers in the new single player modes, you'll definitely appreciate the variety.

It took the gameplay of Robotron and expanded it, while at the same time simplifying it.\nThe action was frentic. The enemies, while simple in their AI, had a tendency to gang up on you and cause your inevitable demise. And games usually lasted short time enough that you could always just restart to have one more go at the high score.\nGeometry Wars: Galaxies for the Wii expanded upon this by adding different shaped levels, medals to set you some goals and some mutators like certain types of waves in the levels to give you some variety over the classic Retro Evolved.\n\nI hear Geometry Wars 2 did rather well as well, adding game concepts like checkpoints or bubbles in which you need to stay in order to shoot. Expanding on the original to add some flavour.\n\nAnd now there's Geometry Wars 3. The main draw over GW2 seems to be the 3D angle, it's right there in the title. The graphics look a lot more futuristic and flashy. Gone are those silly vectorlike wireframes. Hello flat shaded 3D backgrounds, blurry lighting effects. The works.\n\nSadly this is what really soured the experience for me. The art looks really good, especially in motion. But instead of the lines coming together to form newly spawned enemies, you just get a faint intensifying glow before the enemy is there. Instead of having a good view of the playfield, suddenly you're limited in how far you can see, especially on the cubes and spheres where enemies will seemingly out of the blue turn a corner and ram into you, because the camera wasn't showing you that angle.\n\nAt its heart, this game is very much an extension on Geometry Wars. With game modes from GW2, and slicker graphics. But for me it just turned to frustration to once again get spawnkilled by a powerup because I missed the slight glow. Or to get run into by an enemy coming around the corner I was moving towards. The third dimension, for as awesome as it seems, almost completely ruins the game for me.\n\n80% of the deaths I died felt like a graphical gotcha. I died not because I lost track of where the enemies were, not because I stupidly wandered into something because i was looking at where I was, or because the enemies had surrounded me. I died because of something I didn't have a chance to see before it was too late. Or because I missed a bit of coloured light in the middle of multicoloured explosions.\n\nIt's a pity really. I really wanted to like this game, and on the flat levels this game is almost as much fun as the old incarnations of the game. But as it is I can't recommend getting GW3. Go play the old ones instead, they're hard enough without falling back on optical trickery to kill you.","April 26","false","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played the original on Xbox 360 but that's about it, so I can't really compare the mechanics to other games, but I've mostly enjoyed my time with GW3 so far.\n\nIts quite a simple game, with no story to speak of. The player controls some kind of spaceship and has to shoot a variety of differently coloured enemies while trying to earn a high score. Destroyed enemies will leave behind "geoms" which can be collected to increase the score multiplier. You die instantly if anything touches you and there are usually dozens of enemies on screen at a time, so its all about learning the movement pattern and speed of each enemy type, to avoid them.\n\nThere are 50 levels in adventure mode, which give you star ratings based on your score. Bosses are locked until you earn enough stars on previous levels, which normally I would consider to be a cheap way of extending a game, but GW3 gets away with it because most levels only last 2-3 minutes so replaying them isn't a massive inconvenience. There are also 5 "classic" modes that only have 1 map each, so their only goal is to set a high score.\n\nThe controls are designed to work best with a gamepad, so I used my 360 controller. You move with left stick and aim with right stick, and have super weapons on the two triggers which can be used a couple of times per level. You've got a supernova that instantly destroys everything on screen, and one other which the player chooses from a range of options. I liked the homing missiles because when the action gets really crazy, I didn't want to worry about aiming. I tried the mines and black hole but didn't really find a good use for them.\n\nYou can also choose between several drones that fly around and help you. The attack drone shoots enemies, and is useful when you need a bit of extra firepower, but I mostly used the drone that automatically collects geoms because the score multiplier is absolutely essential for earning stars.\n\nThe big feature for GW3 is the 3D design of the levels. While it looks impressive, it can sometimes have a negative impact on the gameplay. What I found is that many enemies spawn in places I couldn't see, so on small maps, fast moving enemies could kill me before I could react, and on large maps that have a time limit, hunting for an unseen enemy wastes valuable seconds.\n\nThe music is a good match for the fast paced action and I didn't notice any major bugs. Value for money is good. I finished the adventure mode in around 8 hours, and genre fans could probably spend countless more hours chasing high scores on the leaderboards for every map. And just before I was ready to post this review I've seen an article on IGN saying more levels will be released as a free update towards the end of March.\n\nOverall I think Geometry Wars 3 is a pretty good game, and worth checking out if you're in the mood to just turn off your brain, relax, and shoot stuff.","March 17, 2015","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Trails of light danced across my mind's eye and faded from existence, into the dark endless void of my memories. I had been here before, in another time and place, but not quite like this.\n\nI recall a vision of a simpler time, when stages were 2D and there was only one large box shape to choose from. Enemies would spawn from all around, different colors and shapes each with their own personalities and behaviors. Yes, those were simpler times. But simpler times only give way to more advanced versions of themselves in the future, and the future is now!\n\nI began my journey back into the war of shapes and vertices, raging since the dawn of xbox360. My ship handled comfortably and was just as I had remembered... moving, shooting, and high energy disintegration bombs. But what's this? New and improved technologies have given me advanced weapons of war, multiple companion drones to choose from, each with their own deadly abilities. On top of that I had been given a second special attack slot, and an arsenal of fantastic devices to choose from.\n\nI jumped into the fray, determined to give these multifaceted miscreants a reminder of who I was. A veteran of the old war, bringing my enemy not only memories of defeat and despair, but the chance to experience these things all over again. At first it was a breeze, wave after wave of neon polygons fell to my superior prowess.\n\nA pattern of dots appeared on the map, shiny and chrome, glistening in the psychedelic hues that enveloped the world around me. Blaster fire proved an effective solution as usual, and I was rewarded with upgraded firepower. Now golden bolts of justice were being dispensed in all directions, the map was nearly mine. Retaliations were to be expected, and sure enough they appeared on the horizon. Glowing blue homing cubes, followed by more evasive green tesseracts converged from my starboard side. But as they sought to conquer my life I had found in me greater resolve to live, and my supercharged blasters had a wide enough spray to lay waste to them all. Are they even trying? Nothing can stop me now, their defeat is to me but a simple game.\n\nSuddenly I was aware that my vigilance had failed me, I was not in a game, I was in a battle for survival, and the slightest lapse of attention would be met with fatal repercussions. A tear in space-time opened in a nearby corner of the map. Out from that inter-dimensional orifice poured dozens of cancerous glowing peenises. Their neon blue heads throbbing and probing their environment for supple spacecraft to penetrate, their long red shafts, engorged with hatred and blood-lust trailing behind them. The others had all been attacking from one direction and lulled me into a false sense of confidence. I snapped back to reality only to click my smartbomb trigger and hear the sound many valiant souls before me had heard, the sound of doom, of the inevitable and immediate return to the void, ammunition depleted.","September 5, 2015","true","19.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"

The other reviews will tell how difficult it is to progress through the first batch.\n\nThe progression system fosters more of a sense of "oh crap I didn't get a good enough score to move on" or "about time I got that score" rather than the "ooh I didn't beat my highscore, better try again" or "wow that's a great score!" that GW 1 and 2 had.\n\nIf you need progression systems to feel like you've accomplished something in a game, then GW 3 will do you just fine. But if you're self-confident enough to simply get better enough for the sake of getting better, than do NOT buy this game. It will take all the intrinsic motivation right out.\n\n\n\n\nFirst thoughts:\n\nI'm one of those people who has always wondered why each game in a series doesn't have every single option or gamemode the previous one had. It bothered me tremendously when halo 3 didn't have any variant of blood gulch.\nI feel kind of the same with this game; Geometry Wars 3 seems to have omitted some things which I considered central to the second game.\n\nAs far as new content, Geometry Wars 3 has the 3-dimensional playing spaces, such as spheres or peanut shaped things of some sort. That's neat, and I'm interested to play them all. However, the game is trying to get some sort of campaign/unlock system implimented, which I honestly thoroughly despise. Instead of just having a menu where you choose which gamemode and which shape you want to play on, you need to progress one by one through various combinations of game type/shape in the "adventure mode." I used to be excited to play on these new shapes, but I in NO WAY wanted to ever have to unlock anything in a Geometry Wars game. Now I have to. I'll be playing the game anyway, but now it feels like a chore, and will probably take away a lot of the intrinsic value I originally got from simply playing.\n\nCo-op options such as one player piloting and the other shooting are missing, and again, you need to progress through an adventure mode before you have any control at all over what game type/shape you play co-op on. I find this irritating because I have really always considered this franchise to be an arcade-style dual stick shooter, and now it feels more like a mobile game. It even implements the star system from angry birds or cut the rope.\n\nIt seems there's no way to do custom games modes of any kind, which is annoying considering that there's so many different factors now. Instead of just gamemode, you also have different geometric shapes to play on. When combined with the original 5 gamemodes, it seems like a no-brainer to just have a menu to select shape, select game, and get going. Granted, you can unlock many of these different combinations by playing through the main adventure mode, but working for it takes some of the joy out of it for me. You COULD play any of the 5 game modes from Geometry Wars 2 in "classic" mode, but you can only play on the classic rectangular playing field. So that's a waste of my time. I already own Geometry Wars 2 and frankly it works better.\n\nThe UI is clunkly and needlessly slow, and I think that the art style is a bit distracting. Honestly I don't like it, but that's just a personal thing. I miss the vector lines and the way I felt like I was in cyber space in the original two games. Everything is too blue now and the parts of the grid on the playing field change color to make it look like it's "reflecting" or something. It just clutters the screen.\n\nTL DR: there's a progression system in a game I don't really think needs one, and the only step forward (3 dimensional playing fields) seems to have forced a step back in a few other areas. It's still geometry wars. But it's basically the same geometry wars I owned on xbox, with all my favorite features removed.\n\n6/10 only because the elements it kept from the previous games are still fun.","November 28, 2014","false","16.9"," 38 of 75 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","38","75","2","6"

I've only played the classic modes which pretty much means Geometry Wars 2 is finally on PC. Everything looks better and sounds better but the movement just doesn't feel as tight. That's my only complaint so far. It's so close to the greatness of the second entry but something about it just feels off. Don't get me wrong, it's not so bad that it's killing my enjoyment but for some reason the ship just feels a bit more sluggish than usual to control.\n\nThat being said. Waves, Kings, Pacifism, Evolved. It's all here and it's just as good as it was years ago. I can't wait to dive into the new modes & multiplayer!\n\nPerformance wise, I am noticing some odd FPS drops here and there. I'm running a 4790k/GTX970/16GB DDR3 so nothing should be dropping but I am. It's some minor stutter here and there. It's not enough to completely screw up the game because it happens really fast but you can notice it and it does hurt the flow a bit. The game is also locked to 60FPS so those with 120/144hz monitors keep that in mind (although I have read about a workaround using the NVidia Control Panel to unlock it).\n\nOh and it has Borderless Window mode so if that's a thing you look for it has it! Always great to see that.\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nAdventure Mode doesn't seem to have the minor stutter at all. Odd, there is a lot more going on in that. The game is gorgeous too. So far adventure mode is great. It's not quite GW Classic but it has its place here. No complaints at all with that.

It is a treat of controls, visuals, audio, and difficulty. If I was forced to choose a small number of single player games to live with forever, this would be the admiral of the fleet. It's replay value is perfect. One stick moves, the other shoots. You have buttons for bombs, your basic panic button, and specials, which to me feel like sort of mitigation or back-up half-panic. In most modes killing enemies drops green pellets that you can pick up to increase your multiplier for sweet sweet points.\n\nYou are some sort of sharp edged open pentagon thing. You shoot bullets at over shapes, each of which behave in their own unique neurotic way. Many blindly move abut paying no heed to you. Some bumrush you. My favorite are the green shapes, that are skittish and will run away when shot at. There are also a number of bosses, and the boss music is incredible to be sure. I still nod my head to it and jam out. There's multiplayer as well, for some pew pew.\n\nThe aesthetic of this game is something like Tron, and there is this ague sense that this is all happening in some technological device. The music is great, and I wish there was more of it. I also wish there were more exotic geometries, as everything seems so Platonic and regular. Klein bottles? Eldritch higher dimensional planes?

Let me shoot ya in the face!\n\nTruth:Where am I?\nWhere are those geoms?\nWhere are the enemies?\nWhere is my cursor?\nI think I need a controller.\n\nExplanation:Your ship shoots towards the position of your cursor. So for accurate aiming, you need to know where your cursor is. Somebody might argue that you can just keep shooting and adjust the angle. The problem is, since the distance between your ship and your cursor isn't fixed (the cursor can be anywhere on the screen), most of the time the adjustment is super inaccurate if you do not keep an eye on your cursor position.\n\nHowever, keeping an eye on the cursor is quite distracting in GW3. Most of the time you might focus on the enemies, especially those fast and/or small ones. Meanwhile, you should also locate the geoms, which is tiny green gems that increases your score multiplier. Geoms are dropped from enemies and will disappear after a few seconds, It is essential to catch enough geoms, otherwise you might even find it hard to get 1 star out of 3. If using a controller, it is acceptable to focus on these stuff. But if you are using the keyboard and mouse, you should also focus on the cursor, which is very distracting.\n\nPersonally, I feel frustrated while playing GW3. This does not mean I don't like playing twin-stick-shooter games. I used to play Waves and it makes me feel much better. Frankly, the graphic of GW3 is great and I really want to love it.

I absolutely loved it. It did everything right, and let me tell you using a stylus to shoot did not make things easy, especially for a lefty.\n\nYears later, I bought this game (shortly after its release if I remember correctly). It was a decent price and I knew the graphics would have my eyes sparkling and my mouth puking rainbows. And I was right. Visually, this game is absolutely stunning. The many game modes and three-dimensional levels make it a huge step forward from Galaxies. Plus now my drone has awesome special attacks (called supers), and Super States give me a chance at getting a huge edge, if only very briefly.\n\nSo why can't I recommend this game?\nIt's a lot of things, but it mostly boils down to the fact that in this game, death means that you have to restart the level, either because (depending on the game mode) you only have a single life, or because while you have infinite lives, you have an extremely short time limit. Combine these issues with the following:\n- Enemy spawn animations are very brief and easy to miss, especially when you're focusing not directly on your ship where they're spawning, but on the enemies you're currently shooting at.\n- A lot of the levels, due their 3-D design, give you almost no visibility around you.\n- There are many enemies whose speed makes them hard enough to dodge even when you can see them coming a mile away.\n\nIt doesn't help that you need those impossible-to-earn stars to actually progress through the game's single-player adventure mode.\n\nIn short, while the action is fast-paced and gorgeous, I can't recommend a game that has you spending hours on end just to make next to no progress. It would have been nice to include a few levels that worked like Galaxies, where you start with three lives, one bomb, one super, and can earn more of each by scoring enough points. The complete removal of this game mode (and mentality) has left me frustrated, and it's the type of game that ensures I'd get very, very fat if I had a swear jar (because I'd spend all that money on candy and ice cream).","May 21","false","10.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Although you can play on keyboard and mouse technically, don't even bother unless you have an Xbox or other high quality gamepad with analog sticks. Your score will be WAY higher on the gamepad.\n\nHonestly if you own Geometry Wars 2 already, $15 for this game is a hard sell since there isn't really that much new. Adventure mode is a just like a shuffle mode with warped maps of the different familiar gametypes with the occasional boss match. And the music is a lot worse than 2, in my opinion.

It is easy to pick up and play but difficult to master, which is a concept that I absolutely adore. That being said, I was excited to hear that there was going to be a new installment. However, does it live up to the previous installments?\n\nGW2 was in my opinion the best installment in the series. It brought new gameplay modes, updated visuals, and even tighter controls. I'm happy to say that GW3 delivers on all of that and takes it to the next level. There is a new adventure mode that breathes fresh air into the gameplay by introducing the first change to the playing field by having you play on a variety of different shapes. This also carries into the visuals which are as sharp as ever and are NOT for those with a history of epileptic seizures. The controls are even better than that in GW2, which is incredibly important in a game that is this fast paced and intense. As for the diffuculty, this is the easiest GW title for beginners to jump into yet, but it is still as maddening as ever. As I mentioned earlier, this game is easy to pick up and play, but to really start knocking down some higher scores you need to put some serious time into this game. So this game is not for the faint of heart, but I encourage you to not be intimidated.\n\nWhat are some things that I didn't like? There seems to be an issue with performance and optimization. I don't have the strongest system in the world (i3-2100, GTX 560 Ti, 14gb RAM), but it is more than capable to still run many modern games at 1080p at a smooth 60fps. Surprisingly, that is not the case with GW3. As important as tight controls are in this game, a steady framerate is important as well. I experienced frame drops that have led to me bumping into enemies and throwing off my groove. This is an issue that may not matter to some, but to people who have spent a lot of time with previous titles of this game, all of them will agree that a smooth framerate is incredibly important in this series. I was able to remedy the problem by disabling v-sync in my Nvidia control panel with little to no screen tearing as a result. A simple fix that to a problem I hope will be fixed in later patches. Aside from that, there is not much to hate here.\n\nSo to go back to the question of whether this lives up to the previous titles in this series, I am happy to say that it does. It inludes the gamemodes that made the orginals so great, and builds upon that strong foundation into something fresh and new. Anyone who enjoyed the previous games in the series, particularly GW2, you will feel right at home with this title and have an absolute blast. In this humble casual gamer's opinion, a solid 9/10.\n\nPros\n-Great new gamemodes (orginals included)\n-Beefed up visuals\n-Tight controls\n\nCons\n-Perfomance/optimization issues","November 25, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Because the second one was for me a direct follow up, improving the first one and not so many added features. This one should be approached as something completely different - mostly...\n\nGeometry Wars 3: Dimension introduces "dimensions", which is not as fun as it sounds. Instead of shooting these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ flying alien geometry-forms in a fenced rectangular area, you are doing the same but on 3D objects (/maps), sometimes a wavy format of the "original" rectangular map.\n\nDon't get me wrong here, the concept is good, but in practice this get annoying to say the least. Problems like visability is encountered constantly on many, if not all maps. MAINLY because the map must always be just big enough so it can fit your screen, which often leaves out 40% of the screen for a wallpaper. And i get that if you don't have the "shape" of the map visible there would be problem to navigate. A fix to this could be to scale down everything on the map, but no, they have not even considered scaling anything down, maybe because of the PC-release with smaller monitors.\n\nExcept from this the theme of "dimension" is within every inch of your screen from the moment you start the game which unfortunatly came in the way of the beautiful background on the second game and replaced it with a moving grid which is just one annoying thing that draws your attention away from the basic gameplay.\nYou are (on every map i think) in this kind of pit or hole in the ground which is meant to reflect your impact on the surface of the map. I can go on for hours about these small details of theme-ruinment, but im not going to.\nInstead your getting a list of + and -\n\n-The theme of the game penetrates and destroys even basic gameplay\n-Map layouts are mostly just a pain in the ***\n-Music is more unseemly\n-Spawn of enemies is more than ever overlooked and difficult to handle\n\n+Music is still good\n+You have and option for "classic" gameplay on original maps\n+Online is an awesome feature\n+Local still kicks a**\n\nConclusion\nIs it better or worse? It's different\nIs it worth a buy if you liked the first and second one? Yes","February 22, 2015","true","26.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As for me, I regard Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved [1] as the gold standard of the franchise (and all twin-stick shooters). I ultimately did not like Geometry Wars 2 for its departures from GW:RE1, and I don't like GW3 for the same reasons and more. If you have never played Geometry Wars, you will probably like GW3, but I recommend Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved, instead. It is available here on Steam for just $4 full price. Unfortunately there are no online leaderboards, but the gameplay is far superior to GW3.\n\nHere are the pros and cons of GW3:\n\nPros\nGood PC port. I didn't have any performance issues even at high levels.\nCreative leaderboard stuff. Giving an indication on the overworld when a friend beats your score is brilliant. It is missing an "overall" leaderboard, however.\nInclusion of classic modes. For the purists out there.\nDrones. I lked this feature in the lesser known Geometry Wars: Galaxies, and am glad to see a bit of customization return to GW.\nThe 3D maps are a good addition and work well. It actually isn't any harder to navigate or see what's going on than the 2D maps.\nNeutral:\nI would list online multiplayer as a pro, but I haven't been able to find a match as of this writing. The description of the Summoner mode sounds like a good implementation, though.\nThe quick restart button. This is a great feature, but why in the world is it ONLY available at the end of levels? This isn't a new idea; other games have instant restart buttons available to the player at all times. It's not like the X button does anything else during gameplay. It's as if they did extra work to make a "great" new feature just "OK."\n\nCons\nThe gameplay changes made from 1 to 2 apply to number 3 as well, so I will first list my gripes with GW:RE2 that also apply to GW3.\n\nThe gun's firepower is much narrower, fires fewer bullets per shot, and fires fewer shots per second than in GW:RE1. The number of enemies you can potentially keep away is therefore much smaller, even if you play perfectly. It is therefore artificially difficult.  GW2 and GW3 prioritized pretty 3D graphics over maximizing gameplay--style over substance.\nI like the idea of geoms, but they are not implemented correctly. I don't like that 1 geom = 1x multiplier. They should be like points in GW:RE1--every so many geoms, your multiplier goes up by one up to a limit. Making the scoring system so exponential rewards the end game too much at high levels. You are able to collect geoms from enemies when you use a smart bomb, but not when you die. This is the opposite of how it should be. This way greatly rewards you for giving up and using your last resort bomb and severely punishes you for sticking it out as long as possible.\nAnd here are my gripes that are new to GW3, in order of most to least egregrious. Some are patchable without a leaderboard wipe. I will update my review if these issues are addressed.\n\nNone of the new modes is any fun.\nThere are no extra lives to be earned in any level in Adventure Mode. Every level is either a set number of lives (usually just 1) or timed. This is not in the spirit of Geometry Wars. For all intents and purposes, you cannot earn extra bombs either (I noticed one extra bomb in one level).\nThere is a 5-second-long, unskippable animation before every game. I have probably wasted half an hour just waiting for my games to start. Any "feature" that keeps the player from playing is a terrible idea.\nSuper States disappear if you die. This means dying a second after a Super State spawns is punished much more severely than dying 2 seconds earlier. I don't think the player should punished for pushing game without a bomb.\nBullets expire before hitting an enemy or wall, even in Classic Mode. There is no reason for this on wall-bound levels.\nThere are no new enemy types to speak of.\nPoor visual fidelity. Mayflies and crosses strongly resemble geoms. You can easily mistake your drone for an enemy, too. Black holes can camoflauge pinwheel spawns. White Diamond and Pink Square spawns look very similar. I have not had these problems with previous games.\nNo in-game VSync option. You have to be clever and edit your graphic card settings to disable VSync (to reduce effective input lag).\nBlack holes make no sound at all. The black hole sound used to be either very satisfying (if you destroy it) or alarming (if it blows up). This was not the case in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ far as I can remember. Again, it's like work went into undoing a good thing.\nTL;DR Read the first paragraph.

It's not a poorly controlled game. It's just impossible.\n\nThe "adventure mode" contains a total of 50 stages. In each stage, you can earn up to three stars based on your score. The one-star score is a reasonable score, and you might be able to reach it on your first attempt. The two-star score is a very difficult score and will require at least a few attempts, as well as near-perfect play for at least the first half of the game (this is due to the way your score multiplier works; pump it super high early on and you can afford a couple mistakes later). The three-star score is a hyper-difficult score that theoretically requires perfection; I'm not a perfectionist, and I never got a three-star.\n\nNormally, all you have to do is reach the one-star score on a stage and you can proceed. However, every fifth stage is a boss stage, and you need to have a certain number of stars (in addition to clearing all stages up to it) in order to enter. The 10th stage requires 16 stars. Because 9 stages preceed it, you can earn a maximum of 27 by then. You'll need to attain 7 out of 18 "extra" stars. I managed a total of 13 stars before I was ready to throw the controller.\n\nOh yeah, there's also the classic modes, virtually identical to those found in Geometry Wars 2.\n\nLOST STORY SHORT:\n\nAre you a total bad***, an arcade god, a sheriff of the sticks? (Or a TASer?) Get this game.\n\nAre you looking for a good dual-stick shooter, but aren't in the top 1% of gamers? Get Geometry Wars 2, which is pretty much just as hard, but at least lets you access the entire game.\n\nNeither of the above?

Whereas before you had to master a 2 dimensional arena, now you fight on 3d shapes - offering you new freedom to manuever, and new freedom to die horrendously or get confused. The 3D arenas are utterly absurd at times and will essentially reset your Geometry Wars skill to 0, but they certainly found a way to innovate and re-establish what made the game so good in the first place.\n\nAll the old game modes have returned, and are basically as you remember them. Dimensions introduces some fun new modes, like Titans, and Boss Battles. You also get a companion helper that is slightly more helpful than useless ,who can kill stuff for you or increase your attack power.\n\nThe graphics are obviously much better, as the game is now 3D, but it's a bigger, more challenging version of Geometry Wars 2, with new game mechanics.\n\nMy only complaint is that, being an arcade game, they seem to have developed it on the assumption that it actually takes .25 cents out of your wallet every time you have to restart - some of the difficulty is ridiculous.","November 25, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Its flaw is that it comes across as unfair. The special stages it has, where you play on funny shapes such as a cube, look nice but it limits your field of view and you get easily blindsided if you stay close to an edge. That or you run the high risk of dying immediately after switching sides due to running into an enemy you could have easily avoided if you could have seen him. The signal you get that an enemy is about to spawn is pretty short too, so more than a couple times I died just because an enemy spawned on top of me. There are also special abilities such as having a minion that collects geoms (the green diamonds that increase your multiplier) or placing mines on the battlefield. This sounds cool too, but it just makes the screen too busy. In Geometry Wars 1 &2, it was easy to make snap judgments on where it was safe and where it wasn't; the green geoms are safe to grab, nothing else. But now you have your geome-collecting minion flying around on his own, and your mines place around the battlefield, and in the heat of battle it is too difficult to make out what 3 things on the battlefield are okay to run into out of the 20 things on screen.\n\nFrustrating is part of the genre, but feeling like your death was unfair and out of your hands is not fun.","December 19, 2014","false","1.7"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","10","25","0","0"

Each level has a certain classic mode attached to it; sometimes you'll be playing Deadline, sometimes Evolved, sometimes stuff like Titan where you have to break up large versions of shapes that break off into clusters of smaller versions of themselves. The levels also take on shapes other than a flat board, such as a sphere, a cylinder, a board with windows or walls that spin, and such.\n\nThe worst part of Adventure Mode are the bosses. The conditions for beating a boss are as follows; you have only one life and must survive and you must defeat the boss in a limited amount of time. You start with a certain amount of time (30-ish seconds) to drain the boss's lifebar. Once you do, it pulses a ring that will kill you if you are too close and the boss becomes invulnerable for a short time before going to its next phase. Enemies will spawn during this entire time. It's a little irritating and they're required if you want to unlock drones and supers and continue into the later stages.\n\nEach stage also has 3 stars you must earn to continue beyond a certain point. You can only get these stars, however, if you upgrade your drones and supers so that you can score faster. Drones can shoot, lay mines, collect score multipliers, and do a few other things for you. This can be annoying, as sometimes you probably can't finish a level with 3 stars unless you spend time grinding geoms to upgrade your stuff (and you WILL have to do so unless you're highly skilled).\n\nIn the end, Adventure Mode is a cool bonus that will add a lot of replay time. I didn't get a chance to try multiplayer, however, as there were no games open when I tried.\n\nIf you've read this review and you're still on the fence, try out Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved. It's only $4, has all of the Classic modes featured in 3Dimensions, and will give you a cheaper intro to the new game.","November 30, 2014","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The classic play types are still there, and the rest of the game is fun, but you'll spend hours grinding the same levels for just a few more points so you can get enought starts to continue the game.  Besides the 3D twist, and some modes like infection (I think that's what it's called), the mecanics aren't really as solid as the previous versions because they still rely on assumptions that were true when the playfield was 2D.  Have fun dying 10,000 times because some enemy you couldn't have possibly seen comes flying around the corner of the cube and the camera angle is fixed overhead.\n\nI respect that the creators had a tough task to expand the series, but there are a lot of places where the older games (esp. 2) were a lot more *fun.*  I found myself saying "this isn't fun" too many times while trying to play the single player campaign.  There are some creative and fun modes, but having to play the same level 10 or 15 additional times to squeeze out 10,000 extra points or whatever to advance puts a huge damper on it.\n\nDespite this, it is still geometry wars, and it still touches on a lot of the right notes, but do yourself a favor and have your kid brother/cousin whatever play through all the single player levels so you can go back and pick and play just the ones that are fun.\n\nOne last gripe: the PC port is lacking.  If you're playing with the keyboard, why can't you set space bar to bomb?  Why does the game show you what buttons to hit as if you're playing with an XBOX One controller?  Good luck figuring out what keys are left and right trigger & bumper.  Also, resolution is fixed, etc., rabble rabble rabble...\n\nIf you're a fan of the series like I am, go buy this because you have to and you were going to anyway.  If not, play it first to see if it's worth your investment.  I'm still on the "recommend" side despite this game's warts.","December 5, 2014","true","46.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Would cleanse the universe of geometry again, 8.5/10\n\nOk sorry I had to try my hand at troll reviewing.  In all seriousness its more Geo Wars that you love with a whole new adventure mode thats basically 50 smaller game modes in one with their own leaderboards PLUS all the Geo Wars 2 game modes (dubbed "Classic" modes).  The adventure mode also allows you to have one of 5 types of drones that can be paired with any one of 5 "special" abilities, its pretty cool.  The dollar spent per hour ratio should be pretty low with this one if its your type of game (twin-stick shooter).  A gamepad is necessary to play to maximize your scores.  My only three minor complaints are:\n\n1) that the graphics are not as nice or updated as I would have hoped,  In general the graphic style is more understated and less colorful and flashy, like pastel colors or something.  This does generally create better contrast when stuff gets crazy but it still just doesnt look as cool and trippy as you would have hoped waiting 6 years for a sequel to Geo Wars 2.\n\n2): Theres an enemy type they brought back from Geo Wars 1 (the little purple triangular shaped things that swarm you by the thousands from the 4 corners of the screen), except now they are orangey yellow color and can be hard to distinguish from geoms, thus you can be collecting geoms and BAM a single little triangle thingy is in the mass of geoms and you dont see it and die.\n\n3) On the 3-d levels I found the camera to be kind of stiff (especially on cubes) and something off about it since you can see a background behind the plane or shape you are fighting on and thus the camera isnt as locked to your ship as before and somehow at first I found the game to be almost nauseating looking at stuff, took me an hour or two to get used to it.  Im sorry Im having a hard time describing it.  In general though, I also feel Stardust HD on the ps3 did a better job with 3d battlegrounds.  But realistically, what else could they try to add to the geo wars experience?\n\nIn the end, this is the best and most fully featured version of what is in my mind, the best twin-stick arcade game series ever made, and it isn't particularly close.","December 12, 2014","true","37.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Almost whole - the devs seem to have taken out local co-op from it, for some reason, and you should absolutely hold it against them*.\nIf you haven't played it and don't have access to a console, and a score-attack twin-stick shooter set on small arenas sounds like something that you may even marginally enjoy, you should consider it essential. The feel of the game is perfect, and the mechanical flourishes for the different modes are absolutely brilliant.\n\nThat's classic mode. As for this new sequel: The new modes are ok; some bits are good fun- otheres, not so much. The main change was to map the arenas to a 3D shape, a couple of new modes, a (non-story-based) campaign linking short levels, upgradeable companion drones from a Wii-only version of the game, and... boss battles.\n\nI have a theory on how boss battles were introduced. There's this high-profile consultant - let's call him Pat - who's brought in whenever a game studio doesn't know what to do with a beloved franchise.\n"So, Pat," they'll say, "we're terrified of screwing this up what's essentially a perfect arcade experience. How should we go about this?"\nPat tuts paternally, and responds "What you need to do is to make the game yours."\nThe developers nod enthusiasthically; "We've actually got a few ideas we can introduce organically-"\n"Hold it." Pat says, and it stops them cold. "Don't be timid. How do you mark something as yours?"\nSilence.\n"You ♥♥♥♥ on it!" Pat screams. "You spray it with your urine until it's soaked through!"\n"Well," the devs say, "I don't know if we want to..."\nPat's adamant. "How can you ♥♥♥♥ on this game? How can you get it good and wet and yellow and pungent with the sweet, sweet aroma of ammonia?"\n"Hmm, we did talk about putting in boss battles..."\n"Excelent!" screams Pat. "Make them multi-stage, long, and really annoying!"\n"Annoying?"\n"Sure - frustration creates attachment! Our studies show that that's the reason people like Dark Souls."\n"OK!" The devs are on-board now, and excited. "What about gating progress behind star ratings, so that players need to replay levels to be able to progress?"\nPat takes a drag from his cigar, and almost purrs. "That's some grade-A weewee, son."\n\n\n*: Unless I'm being thick and I missed it.

Each level has a certain classic mode attached to it; sometimes you'll be playing Deadline, sometimes Evolved, sometimes stuff like Titan where you have to break up large versions of shapes that break off into clusters of smaller versions of themselves. The levels also take on shapes other than a flat board, such as a sphere, a cylinder, a board with windows or walls that spin, and such.\n\nThe worst part of Adventure Mode are the bosses. The conditions for beating a boss are as follows; you have only one life and must survive and you must defeat the boss in a limited amount of time. You start with a certain amount of time (30-ish seconds) to drain the boss's lifebar. Once you do, it pulses a ring that will kill you if you are too close and the boss becomes invulnerable for a short time before going to its next phase. Enemies will spawn during this entire time. It's a little irritating and they're required if you want to unlock drones and supers and continue into the later stages.\n\nEach stage also has 3 stars you must earn to continue beyond a certain point. You can only get these stars, however, if you upgrade your drones and supers so that you can score faster. Drones can shoot, lay mines, collect score multipliers, and do a few other things for you. This can be annoying, as sometimes you probably can't finish a level with 3 stars unless you spend time grinding geoms to upgrade your stuff (and you WILL have to do so unless you're highly skilled).\n\nIn the end, Adventure Mode is a cool bonus that will add a lot of replay time. I didn't get a chance to try multiplayer, however, as there were no games open when I tried.\n\nIf you've read this review and you're still on the fence, try out Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved. It's only $4, has all of the Classic modes featured in 3Dimensions, and will give you a cheaper intro to the new game.","November 30, 2014","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The arcade adventure mode has dozens of levels (50 I think?), each unique in its own way. Think of them as 50 new modes to spend hours and hours on. Seriously, some of these levels will just mess with your head and have you restarting over and over again. They are very challenging, and even the most hardcore arcade gamers will be impressed. You thought playing on a plane was hard? Try a sphere. Also, all of the modes (pacifism, king of the hill, etc) from geometry wars 2 are present. It has local co-op and online play.\n\nI do, however, recommend a game-pad, even though the mouse controls are good.\n\nHonestly, this game has it all. Worth at least $30.

For those that have never heard of Geometry Wars, it started out as an in game freebie for PGR:2 on the Xbox.  It was addictive as h3ll back then, much simpler, bullet hell gem.  Its a twin stick command, one thumb moves and the other shoots in the direction of the sticks.  It had one goal, don't die.  Now it has time trial, original, maze, and drones that you level up (just to start).  The original would get so hectic and busy you could hear the xbox struggle with all the dots, waves and explosions, this one is much, much worse.  Now its 3d, so you get these little pills rotating, moving backgrounds, and everything bending and twisting.  I dont really have a lot to complain about, i have been a fan of the game since its inception and am glad i paid the 10 bucks for it.  But here it is:\n\nThe graphics are fracking amazing for a game less than 400 megs\nThe controls are wicked precise\nThe gameplay is beyond frantic, i actually thought the 1st level was going to be a piece o'cake, silly me\nIt has co-op!\nIt has multiplayer! (the previous 2 are enough reason to pay 10 bucks)\nIt makes me want to rage quit, over and over and over again\nYou literally get tunnel vision and can lose track of your ship (this is kind of bad though)\nIt can induce seizures (this is bad too, just sayin)\nMusic and sound is spot on\nTruly a game you must play before you dieded\n\n10/10 would let my eyes bleed again...i'm a poet and i didn't even know it\nworth the price: bullet hell yeah!\n","March 10, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are dozens of modes, over 50 levels, a superb concept of a 3D grid folding back upon itself to open up new ways to travers the grid and take down enemies all mixed up very well with constant rage-quit preventing variety (bored of one level? play another!). You also have power-ups in the form of drones and special pickups granting temporary enhanced shots. I found the difficulty fair if at times a bit on the hard side. The game is an excellent PC port that runs fluidly with pulsing bright, colourful and smoothly flowing graphics all punctuated by excellent music setting the tone for the frenetic gameplay. I read reports of people encountering technical issues but I never experienced any myself, most likely since the game has been patched since release. Speaking of patches, the developers released a free content pack several months after release along with a patch that many recent games would try and sell as DLC, just shows that they actually respect their players and they really deserve to be supported. If you like arcade shooters and like good value (hours upon hours worth of content here) you really should try out this game. I recommend playing this with a gamepad as twin stick shooters generally control better with a gamepad but the keyboard and mouse controls are also very well done.","June 27, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having played the previous Geometry Wars games, this addition is a must have. The colorful particle effects are amazing as always and the new Adventure Mode adds a fun, objective-based campaign to the game. For those who simply want to experience the classic gameplay modes, those are available in this installation to the series, which includes my all time favorite gamemode: Evolved. The music is very fitting to the game's atmosphere and makes you feel very tense and in the heat of the action while playing. Last, but certaintly not least, the 3D effects and the dynamic stages add an excellent challenge to this wonderul title.

It's a step towards a better Geometry Wars 2 and 1, but it ruins the trilogy too.\n\nPros:\n\n- Nice Graphics\n- Runs pretty well, can get a little stuttery when more enemies are loaded but ok overall\n- Some music is good. A lot of it is remixed, and some is a bit off.\n- You can play old 6 modes. That's excluding Sequence and including Retro Evolved.\n- Multi-Platform optimised, and is probably funner with a controller on Steam Link.\n\nCons:\n\n- £11.99? Not too sure.\n- Dead community.\n- A Campaign mode. It's not a good idea, but to make it worse, they made a system wherein you have to be really good at every single previous level to get to the next boss. Not fun.\n- Some controls can be really weird. Can't explain too much.\n\n============================================\n\nLonger Review:\n\nThis game isn't what I expected. It's nice to play some modes, as said before, but the 'Adventure - Campaign' mode is horrifically grindy and seriously not fun. Every mode is ruined by the adventure mode and every level expects you to be incredibly good at it. Or you're going to have to do it again to unlock the next few levels.\n\nThe classic modes are nice. I would have liked to see Sequence recreated in this game, but having the other 6 modes isn't bad. Pacifism feels changed and the grid feels smaller, and there are no familiar achievements, but the gameplay feels good and the updated feel to the game works well with these modes without taking too much away.\n\nPC Gameplay isn't a lot compared to any controller gameplay, or previous XBOX360 gameplay for GW2. You really need an analog stick to get the fluid movement this game needs, otherwise it fails in certain aspects. And whilst having the mouse bound to attack works ok, it feels very different to the previous games. Not only that, but can you rebind the controls? Not that there are many, but for things like bombs, it might've been nice.\n\n============================================\n\nOverall, I can't say I play half the modes the game has to offer. But if you liked the old modes/games... I'd recommend playing them instead.\n\nTL;DR Pros and cons, probably about 55/100 but maybe just because I like the previous 2 games, maybe buy on sale.","December 19, 2015","false","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The new graphics look fantastic, all of the classic modes from the first two versions are present and true to the originals, plus the new adventure progression makes playing by yourself even more rewarding. I've never been very good at Geometry Wars, but I still love playing it, and this iteration makes the best parts even better. It's a trippy, electro-rave of a game, and it's fantastic to pull out with friends. Just a few quick rounds is normally enough for me in a day, but if you're actually good at these kinds of games, you'll probably enjoy playing for longer stretches of time.

It's a step towards a better Geometry Wars 2 and 1, but it ruins the trilogy too.\n\nPros:\n\n- Nice Graphics\n- Runs pretty well, can get a little stuttery when more enemies are loaded but ok overall\n- Some music is good. A lot of it is remixed, and some is a bit off.\n- You can play old 6 modes. That's excluding Sequence and including Retro Evolved.\n- Multi-Platform optimised, and is probably funner with a controller on Steam Link.\n\nCons:\n\n- £11.99? Not too sure.\n- Dead community.\n- A Campaign mode. It's not a good idea, but to make it worse, they made a system wherein you have to be really good at every single previous level to get to the next boss. Not fun.\n- Some controls can be really weird. Can't explain too much.\n\n============================================\n\nLonger Review:\n\nThis game isn't what I expected. It's nice to play some modes, as said before, but the 'Adventure - Campaign' mode is horrifically grindy and seriously not fun. Every mode is ruined by the adventure mode and every level expects you to be incredibly good at it. Or you're going to have to do it again to unlock the next few levels.\n\nThe classic modes are nice. I would have liked to see Sequence recreated in this game, but having the other 6 modes isn't bad. Pacifism feels changed and the grid feels smaller, and there are no familiar achievements, but the gameplay feels good and the updated feel to the game works well with these modes without taking too much away.\n\nPC Gameplay isn't a lot compared to any controller gameplay, or previous XBOX360 gameplay for GW2. You really need an analog stick to get the fluid movement this game needs, otherwise it fails in certain aspects. And whilst having the mouse bound to attack works ok, it feels very different to the previous games. Not only that, but can you rebind the controls? Not that there are many, but for things like bombs, it might've been nice.\n\n============================================\n\nOverall, I can't say I play half the modes the game has to offer. But if you liked the old modes/games... I'd recommend playing them instead.\n\nTL;DR Pros and cons, probably about 55/100 but maybe just because I like the previous 2 games, maybe buy on sale.","December 19, 2015","false","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It shares the same concept, use your shape to destroy other shapes whilst gathering multipliers and accruing points. Many of the shapes you will see are more or less the same shapes from the previous games. To me this is a plus. Compared to Geometry Wars 1 the variety of gamemodes is a nice touch. However, if you compare this game to Geometry Wars 2, it falls short. The main "campaign" in Geometry Wars 3 seems like a weak replacement of the gamemode "sequence" from Geometry Wars 2. Basically by beating levels you move along a path towards other levels like in many of the Mario games. When the game was released this is all it had. Since then they have added a "classic mode" which encorporated a few of the gamemodes from Geometry Wars 2, Waves, Pacifism, etc. For me, this is the saving grace of the game and the only reason I play it. In Geometry Wars 3 they have added "drones", basically little helper shapes that you are required to use in the main "sequence type" gamemode. They do everything from, collecting multipliers to creating black holes to suck enemy shapes in. For me, this was disappointing, they should have made them optional. The hitboxes are slightly different aswell. This is very obvious in gamemodes like Pacifism. They're less forgiving and take some getting used to if you have played previous games. Overall, if they added Sequence to the list of classic modes I would give this an 8/10. For now I'll give it a 6/10.","February 2, 2015","true","34.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
