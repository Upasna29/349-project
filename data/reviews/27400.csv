I don't know how accurate it is -but it's fun.\nThe game has charm but overall I can't really recommend it unless it's on a really good sale and you don't care about the following cons:\n\nFirst off to navigate the map you need to put your mouse to the edge of it and wait while it scrolls to the appropriate area.\nThis quickly gets tedious since it would be very easy to make the arrow keys or something scroll the map without you having to mouse over everytime. It's a needlessly slow process.\n\nThe second con and the biggest is that the game is mostly luck based. You have stats you can increase but you will soon realize that sometimes the only reason you lost - was because of luck. You can win with the worst stats and you can lose with the best.\nThe minigames themselves are a bit fun though.","July 15, 2014","false","7.7"," 57 of 88 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","57","88","2","0"

I'd classify it as a RPG/adventure game in the style of an old board game where encounters are settled with mini-games. You recruit a plucky gang of rebellious teen girls and work to unravel the town's big conspiracy. You talk to people to learn info and complete story-driven goals, perhaps convincing them with a mini-game. The prohibition-era setting is pretty neat. The mechanics are pretty fun, although the pacing's pretty slow. The flirting game confused me for some time, though.\n\nThe story is quite long. There are many sub-plots that each take some time to complete. For the most part, the story is light-hearted and fun, but it takes a really dark, unexpected turn at the end. There are multiple endings, but getting the better ones is very difficult.\n\nAdventure fans will probably enjoy it. RPG fans, maybe. It's not for everyone, but not a bad way to spend a few dollars. $10 is probably a little too much, but I'd get it at $5.","January 31, 2012","true","13.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

Set in the early 20th century, you control a group of high school girls trying to solve a mystery murder, which leads them to uncover a darker secret involving the whole city. The skills you invest in are Rebellion, Glamour, Savvy and Popularity. You level up by using those in appropriate 'mini games', which always involve interacting with the townsfolk.\n\nBoth writing and the art are superb. While exploring it for 15 hours or so, I encountered some weird things - a talking pony, a split personality, a desk serving as a policeman, a ghost hired to scare unwanted visitors... The story got more ridiculous, more interesting and more serious as I progressed. By the end it felt like Doctor Who, catching you off-guard with messed up revelations & profound thoughts, right in the middle of the laugh. Let's just say I understood why it got banned by Big Fish Games.\n\nIf this got you interested at all, try it - a tad repetitive mini games don't detract from this one of a kind experience!\n\n\nV e r d i c t : GREAT, with some room for improvement","May 7, 2013","true","13.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/recommended/27400/","callistawhite","CallistaWhite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/","137 products in account","Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble is a fun game that's set up in a board game style although there is clearly a story.  For those who aren't familiar with this game, the basic idea is that you play as a queen (of your own choosing) of your high school and have to recruit three other girls and boyfriends (although the latter is optional) to help you solve cases/problems that are happening first in the high school and then in and around the town of Brigiton.  As you encounter various characters in the places you explore, there are four mini-games you can play: taunting, exposing (solving a word riddle), fibbing (kind of like poker), and gambit.  Succeeding at these games will give you access to perks like items and increases in stats although you can increase the stats of a girl in your party after she has successfully played a certain number of mini-games.\n\nFor the most part, I liked this game.  The story intrigued me and I liked the gameplay aspect, especially exploring the various places and such.\n\nI do have a few criticisms, however, although they are really minor more than anything.  First off, I had no idea that once a boyfriend would sacrifice himself to prevent a girl from leaving your party, there was no way to recruit that same boy again.  This wasn't necessarily a bad thing, as there are more boys available as you get to explore more places.  Still, having this information beforehand would have been convenient.\n\nThe other criticism I had was regarding how to get the best ending for this game.  Even though I had followed a walkthrough for this game (from Gamezebo), I couldn't get the best ending.  It was because one of the final goals was to collect scriptures and morals regarding the main problem in Brigiton and why all of the problems there were happening.  However, later on, I did find out that an answer to this problem was posted on another website although I'm not sure if that answer is accurate.  Because of the way I tend to play and all, I make sure to explore all places thoroughly and go back and forth to make sure that I don't miss anything.  Of course, this could be a bug but I can't verify anything as to that.\n\nEven though this is an older game, I would like to have seen an achievements list added in the game itself.  According to the walkthrough I checked, there should be a total of 16 separate events but there is no way that a player would know this unless he/she looked at a walkthrough or searched online for that information.  I don't think it's necessary to add Steam achievements or anything of the sort since I know that could be difficult to add for an older game but I would have liked for there to have been an achievements list.  I like to make sure that I've done everything I can in the games I play.  XD\n\nOverall, though, I do recommend this game.  It's fun despite that there are a few dark themes presented.  I'd recommend patience to play through since it's highly unlikely for someone to finish it in one sitting.  I may try to replay it later for a better ending but we'll see.

But the mini-games that comprise the bulk of the gameplay, while mildly fun on their own, quickly became tedious and even mind-numbingly boring.  On top of that, the storyline kind of takes a cliff dive by the end of the game, taking the RPG party building elements with it.  I struggled along with the game as it became more and more tedious, hoping to simply complete the storyline... but the end of the game finished in such an abrupt and non-fulfilling way that it made me regret the hours I'd spent wasting my time with the game in the first place.

You can play as any of the diverse women, from Charlotte, a stuck up ♥♥♥♥♥ who thinks the world revolves around her, to Clara, who gets the boys in her High School to do her bidding. There are like 20 other women, all equally stuck-up, and proud to be a a snob. The point of this game is to find your friends in the school. Again like Clue, except instead of solving a murder, you're competing to be the world's biggest ♥♥♥♥♥. You also can recruit other women into your so called "gang" But all they want to talk about is how their clothes or talking bad about other women. (Like real women, am I right guys?)  When recruiting other women, they taunt you, and to survive this attack, you have to click on the correct snappy comeback. Oh did I forget to mention that this game is all point and click?\n\nNo Steam Overlay, only plays in 800x600","March 28, 2012","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game gives me all three and then some. I feel like the title and subject matter might turn off the male gamer, but they're missing out. The first time I failed a flirt attempt and got the "He's too much!" screen, I cackled!\n\nI think maybe the price point of the game is a LITTLE high. And I would love to see a HD version of this game. Actually, I'd love to see a physical boardgame of this game produced - not sure how that would work, logistically. But it would be fun as hell to play this with people!\n\nWhat's especially commendable is the variety of races/body types/personalities in this game. It's very rare to see that and a breath of fresh air!\n\nMy only grievance with this game is that some of the "expose" puzzles aren't random (and considering you're trying to piece together a mystery, they SHOULDNT be random) - so sometimes its a matter of having a good memory vs actually solving the puzzle.\n\nIt's simple, addictive, charming, and keeps you on your toes.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI gotta say that the charm wears off LONG BEFORE you're even close to finishing this.

If you lose, you suffer the consequence like decreased reputation or losing one of your gals from the posse.\n\nI am enthralled with this game.

The concept seemed really interesting, and I liked the idea of a diverse cast of high school girls.\nI actually don't really want to write a bad review of this game because, there's a lot of potential. I hope the creators continue, fine tune the art of the mini-game, and go on to create characters with greater depth and the player can actually feel an interest in. But for $20 it's a big disappointment. The minigames are really boring and that's basically they're all you'll be doing. I think it may have built up to more interesting storylines, but I was too bored to continue. The art, considering there's so little of it, is really sub-par. There is also way too little strategy and long term planning in this game so I felt like I was meandering around. I felt the 20s era felt inauthentic and too based on stereotypes and slang- perhaps if the characters had a little more depth or backstory it would feel truer to the period.\nIf you want a truly awesome dark, involving detective game involving high school girls I would recommend Black Closet. It's by Hanako games, and though it is planned for Steam release soon (the creator is fine tuning it) it is currently available through their website.  Of if you simply like the fun of a brightly colored teen girl unraveling a mystery in a dangerous setting (and possibly dying horribly) you'll love Hanako's Long Live the Queen on Steam. And no, I'm not affiliated in anyway with Hanako. I just love their games and their nuanced portrayal of girls.","August 9, 2015","false","2.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

The gameplay is confusing in that I couldn't tell how my actions affected the outcome, if at all. Many of the "quests" can only be played one way, so there's no challenge, risk, or fun. I clicked what it told me to click, and the game chugged along while I watched.  It's not a short game, but you can move through it far too quickly. Rounds fly by because there's nothing to the gameplay. The artwork is nice, but again there's not much to it. There aren't many locations in the game to view (mostly since it's kind of a board game). It's a purely point-and-click game where the things you click don't matter much. Point-and-click games should have to work harder on story, but the story here is empty, and doesn't matter. This might be a good game for young kids, or people who don't play video games. It's impossible to lose, and easy to play. Way too easy for most, I'd say. Finally, I paid under $5 for this game.  The full price of over $20 is shocking. Defintely not worth that price.

Although the concept of an old style board game is fairly clever, the 1920's speakeasy music begins to grate after an hour or so of gameplay, and it is very unfortunate that the entire gameboard is not visible at all times, requiring a scrolling of the mouse to see and reveal objectives.  The character art is interesting and fairly well done but overall this game simply lacks the interesting core play that would encourage me to pick it up again.  Combined with a lack of both Steam Overlay and no widescreen support, I would recommend my friends pass on this game.","March 28, 2012","true","0.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

No emotional ties, and once you lose a game against someone they take the beating and hit the road. Well, I found it funny.\n\nAnyway, there is a main story to this; and depending on how good you are at the card games here, the quicker and easier you'll find it to get information out of people. The girls all have different personalities, so it's vital you mix and match to battle other students, teachers, and others alike. A really good game if you've got time to waste and have a thing for playing cards.","January 31, 2013","true","2.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
