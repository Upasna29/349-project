"http://steamcommunity.com/id/overcookedchickenfingers/recommended/283940/","overcookedchickenfingers","zeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/overcookedchickenfingers/","83 products in account","Originally released in 1994 for PC (the source for this review) and Mac, this game has now been resurrected on the Nintendo Wii as Freddi Fish: Kelp Seed Mystery. Sadly, regardless of the platform, Freddi Fish’s first adventure features far less of the engaging entertainment that those other franchises provide.\n\nAfter an opening spent swimming through the ocean and greeting all her friends, Freddi soon learns that Grandma’s kelp seeds have been stolen. Ever the willing detective, Freddi and her finny friend Luther set out on the case. The story progresses by collecting bottles containing messages left by a bumbling shark to remind him where he’s hidden the seeds. This shark, along with his more competent boss, is working for the Squidfather (complete with his pet “catfish”), and occasionally you’ll see them pop up in cutscenes becoming increasingly worried about the repercussions if they don’t find the seeds.\n\nIt’s a bit disappointing that you never get to interact with Freddi’s foes, and they only ever meet face-to-face in the closing sequence. This creates a bit of disconnection between the plot and player, and there’s a distinct lack of thrill and excitement from the sharks’ involvement. Being able to sneak into the Squidfather’s cave to search around for clues would have been a much more gripping, tangible experience, or at least seeing evidence that trouble is closing in behind them. Some apparent threats are encountered along the way, like when Freddi and Luther have to distract a fishy guard dog or delve into the darkness of the sea to retrieve a bottle from an angry bottom dweller, but there’s never any fear of death or capture. As a result, there’s no sense of urgency, and most of the time the adventure feels like more of a leisurely swim than an important hunt with potential danger close at hand.\n\nFreddi herself is a cheery young fish, and her chirpy and enthusiastic friend Luther tags along on her adventure, both of them keen to help out others in whatever way they can. As you progress, you will come across a whole host of different sea creatures. These colourful characters are wonderfully personified, from a jolly pair of finned pirates to the bucket-helmeted British castle guard fish to a shady stingray, each suitably matched with talented voice work. You don’t really spend a whole lot of time with them, so the conversations are quite condensed, but what dialogue there is will surely bring out a smile with its innocent humour and charm. The pirate song near the end of the game may even have children singing along in unison, and there’s a theatre you can pop into to watch a whole host of different performing acts, like a group of acrobatic carps or a one-octopus band.\n\nUsing just the mouse to control the cursor, Freddi Fish operates through a simple point-and-click interface. Chunky arrows indicate when a location can be entered, and the pointer highlights over clickable objects. Clicking can result in either picking up an item to store in the inventory at the bottom of the screen, or activating a bizarre animation in the environment – a flag folding back to reveal a fish showering behind it or a plant turning into a trumpet, for example – that are sometimes funnier than the actual game itself. Such simple interface and controls make the game a breeze for even young children to pick up and play.\n\nThe underwater setting had real potential to offer up an enchanting and exciting world to explore. Disappointingly, the game doesn’t capitalise much on this, instead offering fairly weak locales that aren’t very interesting to look at. There are only a couple of memorable places, like King Crab’s big wooden castle and a sunken ship, but they only stand out in comparison to the rest, as even these are rather underwhelming. The problem is that nothing breaks from the norm to produce anything fantastical: everywhere you look there are the same types of rocks, aquatic plants and debris, which may be realistic, but not particularly fun. After a while all the places you visit just merge into one bland underwater landscape, something that you wouldn’t expect from a children’s game. It doesn’t help that the sea world is poorly laid out, and with few labelled signposts it’s easy to become lost. In a game that’s full of such bright, vivid characters, it’s a shame the setting is the complete opposite.\n\nThe presentation isn’t all drab, though, because the music is extremely mesmerising. The soundtrack makes great use of steel drums, guitars and piano, among others, and is wonderfully relaxing to listen to. It’s a perfect fit with Freddi’s slow, easygoing adventure through the sea, but when the sharks occupy the screen, the game will kick in with some Jaws-inspired music to signify where their intentions lie. The music is one of the best parts of Freddi Fish, and while you won’t quite be humming them after you’ve finished playing, the songs can certainly have you tapping your foot along the way.\n\nThe puzzles are quite cleverly done, although they have a tendency to be quite easy, probably even for much of the younger target audience. There are times when Freddi will just outright say where the player has to go next and what they’ll have to do there. Rather than finding a suitable way to get the goal across, this method comes across as patronising rather than helpful, though fortunately it’s only done on occasion. When a solution isn’t blurted out by the protagonists, there are some fun, albeit simple, moments such as collecting shells to open a gate or feeding someone blocking a cave to be let past. Freddi usually has to help others in return for an item she needs, although some objects are discovered lying around the environment. You can also choose to engage in a math quiz hosted by a starfish, a fun learning experience for children with varying difficulty levels.\n\nUnlike many other Humongous titles, there’s little to no replayability in Freddi Fish. Considering the game is incredibly short, clocking in at just one hour for me after exploring everything on offer, even the youngest players will be completely finished all too soon. Although the back of the box boasts a different world “every time you play”, the only thing that changes each time you begin a new game is where the bottles are, which is a trivial difference considering you can go anywhere you want at any time. On a single occasion you may encounter an extra puzzle involving a particular item that is otherwise irrelevant; a small step in a welcome direction that should have been more fully explored. During one playthrough, I even came across a bug in the bottle order that caused a whole chunk of the game to be skipped, advancing Freddi to the final location and effectively cutting out half the gameplay time in the process. It might not happen for others, but if it does it’ll certainly cause confusion and annoyance.\n\nThere’s definitely some childlike fun to be had with Freddi and Luther as they meet a whole host of colourful characters and help them in their troubles, but it’s hard to recommend The Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds nearly as highly as Humongous Entertainment’s other superior offerings. Mind you\n\n\nThe Good: Nice variety of colourful characters; talented voice work; catchy music; charming animations.\nThe Bad: Extremely short; too easy at times, even for young ones; little to no replay value; bland environments and story.\n\nVerdict: The first Freddi Fish isn’t as strong a debut as its older age counterparts, failing to fully capitalise on its underwater setting, though there’s some fun to be found by the young ones a single time through.","January 12, 2015","true","219.2"," 58 of 70 people (83%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","83","58","70","37","4"

Originally released almost two decades ago as an easy, semi-edutainment children's adventure game, it was among the very first PC games I ever played and I still have quite a few fond memories of the numerous hours I spent trying to solve the mystery which now seems so utterly simple.\n\nFlash forward to today and I'm once again joining Freddi and Luther, only this time I'm not playing in accompany with my three year old niece, who can barely use a mouse but found the colorful world of one of Humongous Entertainment's most enduring games utterly engrossing. I wouldn't have expected it to hold up in modern day, nor hold any interest for kids anymore, but to my surprise it became a great moment of uncle/niece bonding that has now renewed my fond memories of the game and added some new ones.\n\nIf you have no nostalgia for Freddi Fish and are just looking for a decent adventure game you probably won't get much out of the experience, but personally I was pleasantly surprised just how entertaining it still was for new and old audiences alike. I also discovered it was headed by Ron Gilbert of all people, a fun fact that just makes me love the game all the more.","August 31, 2014","true","1.1"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"

Such as friendship, bargoning, and not trusting strangers.\n\nWARNING SPOILERS:   When Freddi and Luther made a compromise with the villianous Boss and Spongehead, I couldn't help but shed a few tears. The idea of sharing Grandma Grouper's kelp seeds was truly a ballsy move by Luther. Squidfather was fond of the idea thus saving Luther's tail.

I decided to venture into the depths of the ocean once again to revisit a happy part of my childhood, and dare I say it was quite awesome.\n\nBeing a mystery adventure game there are of course puzzles that are quite simple and not exactly challanging. It took me one hour to complete this game and that's because I took my sweet time to interact with everything and have a nostalgia overload. The puzzles mainly consist of you talking to different sea creatures and desiphering their clues. The dialoges are charming and well written, and it never feels like a chore to talk to anyone. There are also some special features in this game that is quite classic with older adventure games. For one thing you can interact with everything. If there is a rock  somewhere on the level you can click it and a small crab orchester begins to play, or a shark dances for you, or a hula dancer takes the rock and does indescribable things to it.\n\n\nI recommend this game for those of you that played this as a child and want to have a rush of nostalgia visit for approximately an hour. It's one of the games that still live up to its name despite you being 20 years older and isn't just tedious with bad humour and lousy gameplay. And although I am very nostalgic about the game, I think it could be played by somebody that didn't have this as a child.","February 5, 2015","true","1.2"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

These titles focus on a range of light academics including basic geography, basic to upper elementary level mathematics, logical thinking, critical thinking and puzzle solving, topped off with reinforcement of good manners and polite social etiquette. At the lower end of the age spectrum, they may require some adult supervision and supportive guidance, but there is no better series of games for a child’s first venture into PC gaming.\n\nIf I recall correctly, I didn’t get into Freddi Fish until I had already become fairly invested in Putt-Putt. Because of this, I don’t have the same nostalgic tie to the franchise. That being said, there are still scenes of this game that upon replaying, were as vivid in my mind as the day I first played them. The Missing Kelp Seeds was the first Freddi Fish game I played and I enjoyed it immensely.

Nowadays animation has very loud, bouncy characters that mostly scream their lines.

Oh no!\n\nThen Freddi and his buttbuddy, went out on a grueling adventure to try and find the kelp seeds. (instead of just buying more or something)\n\nOne thing that sets this apart from most story based games is the personality, Luther is a ♥♥♥♥♥ that acts tough, and don't even get me started on how GOOD Freddi is.\n\nFreddi is UNBELIEVEABLY cool.

There is a junkyard in this game and I found this game in a junkyard.\n\nOne of MY favorites was the shipwreck. It reminds me of when my family died on a ship along with 250 others. Very real. I was on the ship as well, I had a piece of wood stuck through my left leg and I nearly drowned.\n\nOverall, here are some pros and some cons!\nPros: Personalities, and realism.

The scares, THE SQUID WAS SOOO SPOOKY. SAME WITH THE DANCING SKELETON. Oh, and better Graphics than Call of Duty (well, that's easy) and Battlefield.\n\nCons: The dumb fishing rod. I hated it.\n\nOverall, I give this 1,256,738,386 kelp seeds out of 1,256,738,386 kelp seeds.\nAnd my friend gives this game a 16/0 (truly flawless)\n\nBuy this game right now!","May 6","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","1"

While there, she learns that her grandma's kelp seeds have been stolen! Freddi sets out with her best friend Luther to find the culprits and restore the seeds to their rightful owner.\n\nThe Gameplay\n\nFFaTCotMKS is a point and click game designed for younger children. The resulting gameplay is simplistic but intuitive. Puzzles tend to fall into the  use this to do this  category, which is fine. I completed the game in about 40 minutes, but I expect it to take a bit longer if you choose to explore the areas more thoroughly. I liked it, though it may not be enjoyable for everyone. It is very easy, after all.\n\nThe Characters\n\nFreddi is a very brave and conscientious role model for children. She pays proper respect to her elders and does her best to set things right. I found it very difficult to be interested in Luther, however. He barely helps beyond asking meaningless questions and is seemingly only after the kelp seeds for his own benefit (despite being reprimanded by Freddi several times). However, his antics make him an interesting foil to Freddi and her grounded disposition. Still, he felt unnecessary and I personally didn't like having him around.\n\nThe side characters give the game an atmospheric quality that I enjoyed as a child and continue to enjoy as an adult. Their colorful personalities are memorable beyond the confines of their limited time on screen. Interactions with them are simple and genuine, and an enjoyable aspect of the experience. I chuckled a few times at the villains' dialogue, especially.\n\nThe Setting\n\nFFaTCotMKS takes place underwater. It appears to be the ocean, but it could be a sea or some other large body of water, as it is never explicitly stated.\n\nI liked the variety inherent in the different environments. The world is well populated and immersive, and there are a TON of things to click on in every screen of the game. Colorful little creatures bounce around, a starfish teaches you basic math, pearls shine and an opera fish performs a solo. It's worth exploring every inch just to see what crazy thing will happen next! These fun little events are synonymous with Humongous Entertainment's early point and click offerings, and they help bring the world to life.\n\nThe Graphics\n\nThe game has a very charming, almost handdrawn look to it (forgive me if the art actually IS handdrawn, I'm not very proficient at spotting the difference). The graphics are endearing and vibrant while simultaneously giving off the look of a cartoon. It's fun to look at and even runs in widescreen!\n\nCharacter designs themselves aren't incredibly impressive, but their personalities more than make up for any obvious deficiencies.\n\nThe Sound\n\nThe music is serviceable and ambient, but not very memorable. The sound effects, on the other hand, are abuzz with life. You'll recognize many reused sound effects if you've played any other Humongous Entertainment games, and I guarantee they'll put a smile on your face.\n\nThe Verdict\nI wholeheartedly recommend Freddi Fish and the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds. It's chock-full of educational and humorous content for younger minds. It looks and feels like an interactive animated television show, it has a strong identity and an altruistic endgame, but, most of all, it does exactly what it sets out to do: provide a meaningful experience. I think it's definitely worth a buy, though I'd recommend purchasing a reduced price. 7 dollars might be too much to some people for the amount of content you're provided.\n\nI give Freddi Fish and the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds 9.5 out of 10 purple sea urchins.","February 6","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The randomization here is mostly where each of the macguffins are located, but there's generally not many options from what I can find (I had very little variation) so the replay value and chance of variance is pretty low in this one.

While the game can be completed in only an hour, It's one of the most nostalgic hours of my life. But, a review isn't based on nostalgia alone. Let us talk about the actual game.\n\nStoryStory wise, Grandma Grouper has lost her Kelp Seeds, which she shares to feed all undersea life. You are Freddi, and with the help of your best friend, Luther, you are tasked with finding the lost 'treasure'. But watch out! The Squid Father and his shark goons are also after the seeds! Talking to, helping, and interacting with the undersea life is the only way to reach your goal, but you better hurry!\n\nWhile a simple kids story, this game does it exceptionally well. I never once felt interaction was forced. Everyone seemed to know Freddi in some way or another, but that doesn't de-value the interaction. While I did beat the game, I didn't obtain enough sea-urchins to enter the undersea volcano, which will send me back one day to find out its mysteries.\n\nGameplayThe game plays as you would expect a point-and-click game to play. While you move around the world, you are set to be in one area, while finding things around the world to interact with. It plays fantastically, but at times, the object you are looking for may be too well hidden, and blends into the background a little too easily.\n\nVoice Acting This is possibly the major fault with the game. While some people are voiced decently (The Eel, Stingray, Pirate), others seem like a very odd choice. For example, giving the Crab a French accent is a little weird, and at times, Freddi would sound disinterested in what is happening. While this isn't such a huge deal, it still takes it out of the experience.\nI PERSONALLY give it a pass, solely on the reason this is a childrens game built in 1994.

This is a great, although short game. It's perfect if you got a child of your own and want them to experience the same feeling for game as you did as a kid, or just keep them busy for a while, haha. It got a lovely story with math problems, puzzles and I remember thinking it was kinda tricky! I asked my parents a few times, haha.

While the game can be completed in only an hour, It's one of the most nostalgic hours of my life. But, a review isn't based on nostalgia alone. Let us talk about the actual game.\n\nStoryStory wise, Grandma Grouper has lost her Kelp Seeds, which she shares to feed all undersea life. You are Freddi, and with the help of your best friend, Luther, you are tasked with finding the lost 'treasure'. But watch out! The Squid Father and his shark goons are also after the seeds! Talking to, helping, and interacting with the undersea life is the only way to reach your goal, but you better hurry!\n\nWhile a simple kids story, this game does it exceptionally well. I never once felt interaction was forced. Everyone seemed to know Freddi in some way or another, but that doesn't de-value the interaction. While I did beat the game, I didn't obtain enough sea-urchins to enter the undersea volcano, which will send me back one day to find out its mysteries.\n\nGameplayThe game plays as you would expect a point-and-click game to play. While you move around the world, you are set to be in one area, while finding things around the world to interact with. It plays fantastically, but at times, the object you are looking for may be too well hidden, and blends into the background a little too easily.\n\nVoice Acting This is possibly the major fault with the game. While some people are voiced decently (The Eel, Stingray, Pirate), others seem like a very odd choice. For example, giving the Crab a French accent is a little weird, and at times, Freddi would sound disinterested in what is happening. While this isn't such a huge deal, it still takes it out of the experience.\nI PERSONALLY give it a pass, solely on the reason this is a childrens game built in 1994. And not just a childrens game, a young childrens game. I just let it pass, but it is a negative point.\n\nOVERALL SCOREFreddi fish is an awesome game, more so for children and the nostalgic. With a good story, math and mini-games, it's awesome to help a developing mind along.\n\nSTORY        7/10                GAMEPLAY        8/10                VOICE ACTORS        4/10                OVERALL        7/10\nYes, it has it's problems, as all games do, but it handles them well, and keeps the whole experience enjoyable.","August 18, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Back in 1996, my parents bought me this classic point-and-click when I was 2 years old. Suffice to say, it isn't all that fantastic as a game, but it is still a great way to kill time. The game features a goldfish named Freddi, and a green guppy, Luther, as they embark on a quest to find her grandmother's treasure chest. This game's art style is very colorful and wacky, while the backdrops illuminate under the shimmering ocean surface. The music definitely gives me that summer vibe as Freddi visits various locations such as a beach, a junkyard, and even a king's castle. There are loads of things to click on in the back ground and foreground. Since this is a game for very small audiences I can imagine that this serves as a simulator for waving one's keys. Aside from that the character's dialogue is very tounge and cheek. I forgot how amusing those mafia sharks were in the cutscenes. The game even has section dedicated to teaching mathematics, which is probably the reason I'm so good with math now! All in all, Freddi Fish is a cute, fun exploration game, but would not recommend to an audience who never grew up with any of these games. For the kiddies and for those who have fond memories, this one's a real treat as it is loaded with various things to do, despite it being a game that will last a couple of hours maximum.","May 27","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
