"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicOfGilga/recommended/331500/","EpicOfGilga","Gilgamesh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicOfGilga/","122 products in account","After I watched Jerma and Star, I was amazed by the concept. A Command and Conquer type of game (boy, the developer must be getting sick of hearing this comparison)  mixed with a FPS element.\n\nNow, I don't really review games much; however, I hate seeing shortassed reviews so get ready for a pretty long but detailed review. I will also try to keep it entertaining.\n\nThis review will talk about everything, so I will add a very short TL:DR and criticism at the bottom.\n\nI will try format this review very well, so you can read the entire thing or skip to the interesting bits. (Steam formatting sucks.)\n\nLet's begin.\n\nThe game\nIn Executive Assault, you play a rich corporate snob, whom wants to get rid of the competing capitalistic swine on the other side of the map.\nNow usually in a our world's economy, one would try to do this by running his golf buddy out of business. In this game however, the businessmen strategy that will be in practice is filling your competitor with a variety of destructive matter.\nWhich may include: Lasers, Quantum Particles, Rockets, Shells, Bullets.\n\nThe game is won when the enemy executive takes damage. The only way to reach the enemy executive is to power your self through the buildings go up the elevator of the HQ and do what I said above.\n\nUsually in games you ( or subjectively I ) will not give a ♥♥♥♥ about the people involved and probably skip the credits. In this game on the other hand it is worth to note the developer(s).\nThis game was directed by  Robert Hesketh , the programming was done by  Robert Hesketh , the graphic design were made by  Robert Hesketh , and the sound effects were also made by  ♥♥♥♥ing stop already .\n\n\nHow it works\nEconomy:\n\nYou start the game with your company's headquarters which you can build around.\nLike most RTS games you will probably start with setting up a main power grid which you do by building a power plant.\nOnce you have that ticked off of your check list, you will want to start your economy.\nThere are three types of resources in the game.\n\nIron, which you get by building iron extractors on iron fields. You will need this to build basically anything.\nTrions, which generate after researching the Trion Generator. You will need this to build unique Trion weapons.\nand Heskosium, which you can pick up from crashed in meteorites. You will need this to build advanced units.\n\nOne thing to note is, that your iron extractors need to be connected to the power plant. You can do this by building a chain of pylons.\n\nIf you reached your power generation capacity you can collect Thorium crystals that are spread over the map with drones which increase generation.\n\nTo boost research you collect Calcit Crystals.\n\nBuildings and Units:\n\nThis game was pretty much just released for early access. So it does not have a huge amount of units, but neither does it have a small amount. All your units can be equipped different kind of weapons which can be researched in the research tab.\n\nUnits\n\nThere is basic infantry which till now only consists of one type of drones with different armor.\n(Also you can build a single invisible hacker drone which can overload the enemy power plant, blowing it up and it can disable enemy defenses)\n\nThere are vehicles.\nLight Jeeps.\nTwo different tanks medium and heavy.\nAnd light, medium and gigantic walkers.\n(The gigantic walker can make your units ♥♥♥♥ing fly OUT of the map if you get kicked by it in first person. It's hysterical)\n\nThere is also aircraft.\nOne Fighter, one transport pickup, and two bombers.\n\nBuildings\n\nI will not talk about every building as that would be too time consuming for you and me.\nAll major buildings must be connected to the HQ, and are made almost instantly. (For now, they also seem to be virtually  indestructible) the  The only exception being the pylon and iron extractor which are made by drones. There is also a limited building area for major buildings that can not be extended.\nThere are also defense buildings which can be build in the limit area but they do not have to be connected to the main buildings.\nThere are production buildings for each respective type of unit, there are buildings that allow you to have security (will talk about that later), research, radar, artillery/missiles, and other useful things.\n\nResearch\n\nToo keep it short, you can research a lot of things in this game. There are many research tree that upgrade your units, unlock more of 'em, allow you to build more advanced buildings, give you more power. Etc.\nYou can speed up research by collecting calcite crystals (it's basically ♥♥♥♥ing chalk).\n\nDefenses\n\nThere are plenty types of defenses, most importantly different types of gates, which you can build inside of buildings to prolong the time the enemy takes to get to your executive. Inside you can also build an alarm, which is pretty handy to know if someone is sneaking around in your main base. There are turrets you can build outside and inside. Which can also be pretty handy, and walls outside which I have not build because of the building area being to small for it to be worth it.\n\nHumor:\nThis developer has humor, not too much, but still has funny little tweaks to make at least you chuckle. Like the Gigatron's pilot having a cocktail.\nI don't want to ruin it for you, but for example when you ride the elevator up to brutally slaughter the enemy executive, some classy elevator music is playing. Also the summer sale trailer is genius.\n\nCriticism\nThere are some things the game can improve on, this is entirely subjective though, so don't take my suggestions as absolute ( I have also might have missed a few things). Of course it will be fair criticism as once again, this is made by one guy so I will only talk about game play.\n\nMain enemy buildings can not be destroyed, at least from my experience. This is simply stupid. Now of course I do not mean that the buildings should be destroyable from the outside, neither do I think the HQ should be destroyable, but there should be a spot which you should be able to destroy the building from. Right now there is no point for why you should defend buildings from the inside. Of course this would mess with the gate mechanic but there must be a way around this like being able to protect the "spot" by building dors around it (example would be the Security Control building which has that) Of course the buildings should have a decent amount of Hit points even from the inside.\n\nSelecting buildings should be easier. (Maybe add a bigger rectangle instead of a small circle to select it)\n\nAll the resources but iron are visually too small.\n\nBuildings should not build instantly.\n\nThe building area is too small for defensive buildings to be worth anything.\n\nHackerbots, should be able to do more, like disable any buildings by getting to their main control HUB.\n\nTL:DR: For a game made by one guy and it just being released as an early access title it has a lot of content, of course it needs a lot of polishing done and some bugs to be fixed. But as long as there will be new content and improvements coming in, for 13$ it is definitely worth picking up. It also has a FANTASTIC soundtrack.\nFeel free to call me an autistic idiot for my dyslexic spelling in the comments. Corrections are appreciated. I am German, so my comma usage might be a little funky.\n\nGood luck to Robert on improving the game!\n\nCheers!","August 7, 2015","true","14.0"," 184 of 192 people (96%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","96","184","192","37","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magicmahn/recommended/331500/","magicmahn","[EO] Magics","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magicmahn/","183 products in account","I will be writing this review as I play the game and learn more and more about it.\n\nSpoiler: I'm starting this review before even playing more than 10 minutes. Because this guy needs more money.\n\nJan 23, 1:30 PM\nFirst off, I looked that this game and saw its graphics.. they really were nasty looking. But knowing myself, I like graphics but love gameplay.. so I gave it a deeper look. The reveiws being 90%+ was a huge get go with 400+ reviews. I watched the trailer.. let's say I fell in love with it. I love the satriatric humor this game slightly gives. I will give my feelings and emotions on how I watched and interpreted it.\n\nThe Trailer: In the trailer you see a bunch of bots fighting shooting eachother, fighting in buildings, outside, etc. It Looked like a normal shooter with RTS counter parts. Seeing it was a hybrid, I was more intreged already since I love that genre. Loved Nuclear Dawn, Natural Selection 2, and much more other games like it. After looking deeper into the trailer I see that there's a research module, building module, defense, radar, ALL KINDS of UPGRADES. THEN YOU SEE YOU CAN CONTROL EACH UNIT. Only a FEW games that I know of can let you do it.. and dang is it satisfying in those  select few. In the RTS view you can see BIG robots and small robots.. this reminds me of Mech Commander 2 where you can see the average mechwarriors and the humans in super suits; its a wonderful nostalgiac feel.  This game shows the availiablity of superweapons.. probably attained by research. This shows that there is multiple paths of research to help you win the game. At the point where you can "Lead your army into battle" you see that the AI pathing looks a little less "natural" I guess.. but I'm sure it can be improved. After that you see a human holding a glock in a business suit residing in some kind of "HQ" or control center. I was sold. YOU CAN SIMULATE THE FUTURE OF SENDING ROBOTS INTO BATTLE TO GOVERN WARS, FEARING LOOSING AND GETTING OVERTAKEN! IN FIRST PERSON! The 'EXECUTIVE' has a glock for a reason! Once yo' self get overtaken you gotta fight for your life. That'll had hilarious elements to mutliplayer gameplay with friends. The possible stories of what will happen with my friends just flows through my mind. Once it gets done showing the executive person part it shows the player changing the power grid and forcing less power towards defense on what seems to be the enemy's base, he then goes up an elevator and kills the enemy.\nI will now continue playing the game and update this review.\n\n(I know my english and structure isn't really proper in this review but I'm writing it fast so I can get to playing!)\n\n2:25 PM\nPlayed for about 30 minutes, had to restart a few times because I wasn't being effecient and fast enough on how I was doing things. You have to learn how to do most things, though it has awesome video "COMPANY TUTORIAL" thingies that I found to be really neat.\n\nSo I was able to get basic buildings down, got power, pylon lines, started gathering crystals to increase my power, made tiny army, etc. I started to expand and noticed the enemy sent a single robot to attack me.. I had my main army away from my base at the time. So I foraged about 4 units to go and attack the intruder.. as I watched him get closer and closer while my robot factory was taking its sweet time.. he entered my facility. My robots finished building and rushed to the rescue. Since the enemy bot entered my facility, I could only see his healthbar (though you can visually hide roofs to see the interior of your base.. but I was in a panic) traversing my estabilishment. My robots were racing to get to him and I watched in horror as this little healthbar started rising. He was going up the elevator. My mind flashed to the trailer to the part where a player went up the enemy's elevator and shot his opponent helplessly. I quickly spammed my HQ icon and tried to wake my guy up.. little did I know after zooming into my character, he appeared to be asleep, doing what executives do. I suppose his mind was in the neural computer or something.\n\nLet's just say this game has a cinematic death sequence when your executive's body ragdolls after being lit up like a christmas tree.\n\n3:08 PM\nGotten a little farther in the game. Got wiped out by enemy vehicles. I keep noticing that the research tree starts unveiling more and more stuff to do.. I haven't even scratched the surface. Loving the music! I'm not bored by it at all. I'm noticing a few things that this game lacks from average RTS features.. Some units are tiny and you can't see them too well. But it has some really nice features that other RTS games don't have. For example, when you need to build outside of your HQ zone, you need to use fabricator drones that will fabricate buildings at the cost of loosing the drone. But the neat feature is that you don't need to buy a drone THEN place a building. You place a building and the game will auto buy a drone for you! I really like that. Ima keep playing,\n\n3:30PM\nAI doesn't seem to gather Thorium Crystals (which are used to upgrade your power.) I guess they don't need it? I kinda like that in a way, but I hope it is more competitive in MP which I'm sure it is. Though, the crystals spawn at random, sometimes they're closer to you sometimes they're not. Just now I got 6/8 crystals right at my door step in this play through. At this point I'm starting to get the hang of what I want to research first. Kinda wishing I had a research que feature. I am very successful in this playthrough.. I have the AI cornered and it cannot do anything.. game is way too easy when you figure it out. Currently just looking into research.\n\n3:55PM\nStill trying to figure out how to get the CEO out of his darn chair.. I don't think you can. There is research to give him a better gun though..\nJust controlled a bot an walked into the robot building facility.. I see robot legs coming out of a foundary and getting moved into another room. That's awesome! It'd be cool if we can see the robots actually get built! Edit: Figured out how to get out of the chair. "E"\n\n3:58PM\nControlled my own bot, went up into the hq.. picked up the gun I purchased.. then shot myself in the face not knowing it would kill me in one shot. Gotta restart :(\n\n4:17 PM\nStarting to notice that there is some features missing.. or I just cant find what i'm trying to do. I researched a few cannon thingies to find out that they're not in the build menu. Not impletemented yet or is there another menu?\n\n4:24 PM\nI think they're implemented.. just can't figure out how to expand the build menu\n\n4:28 PM\nFigured it out, gotta make a "Long Range Facility" and build upon that.\n\n4:53 PM\nI believe I figured out most of what this game has to offer.. now I need a friend to test out multiplayer!\n\nCool fact: This is probably one of the first games where you can have an AI fight another AI and you can just simply watch... AND you can serve under one of the bots army as an "Executron"\n\nMy current verdict is that the game idea is completely awesome. Though, it needs major polishing, better optimization, etc. Basically what every game needs. I would love to see more fluidity and content being added to the game.\n\nI run the game at about 11 FPS in a 4 player AI match with my cpu at 20%\n(I have an extremely overkill computer for this game)\n\nKeep in mind I am not even near a good critic at all. I just like this game and wish it to become better.\n\nI know this was a terrible review, I got lazy.\n\nThe fact that this game is so cheap and made by one person is phenomenal. This is the kind of developer that needs good funding. It won't be wasted like a AAA developer.\n\nIf the devoloper sees this, I wish you the best of luck. I wish I had some skills to help with the devolopment of the game because it is worth my time. I am good with film and editing though..\nWould love to help if I could.","January 23","true","4.6"," 88 of 100 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","88","100","12","3"

The makers behind executive assault is a small dev team, with only a guy and his friends, and for once he isnt a billionare greedy CEO of a company.\n\nThe gameplay is quite nice once you get used to the strategy and controls.  It has a cool first person feature where you can control a soldier in a unit you sent out to defeat your enemies.  From giant mechs, to small riflemen, there are tons of ways of defeating that rivaling company that threatens the toilet plunger market. (I don't know, I'm tired.)  The game is a bit buggy and a bit unoptimized, but the devs are constantly giving feedback and supporting the players.  They upload new concept art of new graphical changes and other things, so overall, good dev team.\n\nAlthough the feeling of a regular FPS is cool, just imagine yourself charging in with just a rifle with your 10 story mech warriors and tanks beside you, and this game brings that.  The game makes you feel so powerful charging in to the enemy base with your carefully planned out small army, charging through their maze of corridors and drone factories.  Until, finally you place that one bullet into the CEO's head that is controlling all of his forces.\n\nOverall, great game with alot of potential, and please, PLEASE support the devs.\nI would rate 9/10 for an early acess game, pretty low price, tons of potential, fun gameplay, and good devs.\nGreat job Hesketh Studios, keep it up.","July 17, 2015","true","0.6"," 110 of 134 people (82%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","82","110","134","13","0"

You can play 1v0, 1v1, 1v2, 1v3 or 1v4. There's many difficulties for the AI, AI: The Janitor beign the easiest, you can make each bot have a different difficulty or all of them to have the same difficulty. There's cheats such as: Make resources fall out of the sky (from meteors), have infinite resources or have very quick research times (3 seconds instead of 3mins-10mins). There is no such mod support. There is multiplayer. In order to "take over" some bots' or players' office/company you wll need to use Hackerbots to hack all of the doors down or use Infantry and simply shoot the doors down, shoot the indoor turrets down and finally kill the CEO. The tech tree is very nicely split up into many parts such as Structures, Units, Defence with tons of upgrades in each part. There's tons of units too, you can cutomize your units by combining 'X' chassis (tank, jeep, infantry ect) with 'X' ability (faster moving speed ((infantry only)), shields ect) with 'X' weapon (RPG's, LAZERS! ect) to create the most badass thing you want. The updates are  very common (3 or more per month on average) so there is so much more to be seen, did I mention one guy made this?\n\nGraphics\nThe game supports up to 1920x1080 resolutions, the graphics themselves aren't something that are super pretty, but they are still nice, although a bit dull. The HuD could be improved since it is very clunky and is confusing, also, it has many spelling errors. The animations are very smooth, especially the giant robots! The models are absolutely purely made of the most badass material known to man. The effects look very powerful, so do the ammunitions.\n\nPros and Cons\nPros:\nLow price for hours of badassery\nConstant updates\nThe most badass models for an Early Access game\nInteresting concept\nMultiplayer\nCheats\nLarge selection of tech upgrades\nMany units\nMany buildings\nMany ways to win/lose\nYou NEED a tactic\n\nCons:\nGraphics aren't that bright, too dull for my liking\nFinal Rating\nA real masterpiece of an RTS mixed with a TD. This game went into new terittory, and got out easily, using badassery. Great game for any fan of Strategy games or Tower Defences. 8.5/10 - Just improve graphics, add some cheats (just for pure fun), add mod support and improve the optimization.\n\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

It took me a few matches to adapt my tactics and play style, but soon enough I was having the most fun I've had with a video game in a long time. If you even remotely enjoy RTS games, I simply CANNOT recommend Executive Assault enough.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirLagsalott/recommended/331500/","SirLagsalott","SirLagsalott","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirLagsalott/","116 products in account","UPDATE: After many patches several of these issues were fixed.\n\nThe game is heavily flawed, but fun.\nThe graphics are so-so, even on the highest settings. There are plenty of graphical issues, like bullet holes being stretched to unrealistic proportions on certain surfaces, lights that blink in and out of existence, and performance problems on higher settings (I don't blame the game for that).\n\nIt's very fun building corridors and locations and being able to walk around them. I'm sure it's been done before but it's still a welcome break from RTS games where you're always floating around in the air and you want a piece of the action.\n\nI've noticed several oddities in gameplay. The first one I noticed was right in the beginning of the game, where you can press CTRL and you can't move, just your mouse moves. This is for activating surface GUIs, but it has a lot of issues. I walked into an elevator, pressed CTRL while it was moving down, and I was suspended in midair as the elevator moved beneath me. I ended up on top of the elevator's roof, and without being able to open any kind of menu, shot a few shots with my pistol, hoping I could break the glass. Oddly, this resulted in my death. I had to start all over again.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=486156275\n\nLater in the game, I was exploring my base and I heard some gunshots. I went to the elevator, hoping I'd be able to see it from above (at this point I didn't want to die and have to restart again). There were two robots in the elevator, and I mistook them for my own robots (I thought they were going outside to fight whatever was shooting at us) and they just gunned me down. In one hit. I had to start once again, but my enthusiasm was dampened by being unable to continue where I left off.\n\nAnother issue is that there's no way to save or exit to the main menu from what I've seen. The ESC key does nothing at all, and you press P to pause. However you can't open up an options menu or any kind of menu for that matter. I hope there's a way to save but I just can't find it. I have to alt-tab to get out of the game.\n\nIt's annoying having to be at a certain spot to open up the RTS interface, as that meant painfully long walks (you can't sprint) through uniform, bland corridors. Both of my aforementioned deaths were caused from that elevator ride.\n\nDesigning your own robots is interesting. I haven't spent a whole lot of time with that part of the game but it's nice being able to design your own army. Unfortunately, the robots themselves aren't very fun. When my first bot spawned, he took the longest possible route to the destination I specified while I struggled to keep up with his running, and when those stupid elevator bots attacked while he was right in the adjacent area he did nothing.\n\nThe game itself is better off on sale. I don't know how many bugs the dev plans on fixing or how many new features they plan to add (the opening dialogue suggested they're working on new games) but I hope these small issues are fixed to make an interesting concept a great game.","July 19, 2015","true","1.2"," 67 of 80 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","67","80","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/331500/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I've been preaching a RTS/FPS hybrid for as long as I can remember. Just recently pulled the trigger and bought the game full price (which is extremely unusual for me)! The game in it's current state is playable and has quite a bit to offer. Gamers will be hungry (in both good and bad regards) for a lot more once they finish a couple of games. Most games will take around an hour but given on how determine you are, can take more or less time.\n\nI remember when the very first StarCraft came out. RTS Games started striking it big and FPS began making a strong debut. I loved both genres but couldn't have both at the same place or time. I've always wanted to control a single marine or a Goliath and have never been able to until this game released. When the game states you can take control over any unit, you literally can take control over any unit. This is an absolutely beautiful feature that was nailed. In addition to this scenario, players may play against or with their friends. One friend can be in charge while other friends can take control of units (to do this "execubots" need to be approved). This can be handy as players are more independent than AI units. Independent players as well as any player playing in FPS mode can command nearby units by pressing "F" (for follow) and "G" (for guard). Big points for inclusiveness here. The AI within the game is decent at the moment. Depending on what level you set them at will determine the intensity of the game.\n\nThe premise (or story) regarding Executive Assault is the player takes control of an executive business man who is essentially the only human on the battle field trying to take over the world. Instead of directly being involved in the fight, the executive sits high atop of their office with only a pistol in his hand and a computer on a desk. The computer allows the player to enter and exit RTS mode (by pressing "E"). There isn't much reason to control the executive either than if you're being raided. The executive cannot have any other weapon either than a pistol and a upgraded pistol (that needs to be researched) that takes out robots in one shot. Additionally, a desk shield can be researched and a big red button has to be pressed manually by the player to activate it. Robots will have to fight their way through corridors to the executive elevator that will take them all the up to the office. Defenses can be upgraded and added to protect the executive. Auto-turrets can get really annoying if you don't come in with a strong enough presence.\n\nFrom the executive view, we jump into the RTS view. Before the player can start building anything at all, a power station is needed. Power management is extremely simple in this game but takes a bit of skill to manage properly. Research, drilling power and defenses can all managed through this. Go over the magic number (that keeps everything in homeostasis) and watch the stores deplete faster than instant noodles being microwaved. Power towers can be placed throughout the map in order to expand drilling expeditions. Upon building that, the player can build basic buildings such as unit facility and drone facility. Drones will build towers and drill sites while units are the ones that can raid the executives office. Research is another tab besides the power management tab in which the player will have to closely watch and use in order to advance their technology. There are other buildings that can be built such as airports and vehicle factories but this all needs to be unlocked through research. Some other buildings with neat features include a long range facility which has four slots that can be assigned to artillery or a trion cannon (that bombards every so often) or a missile. All long range weapons need to be assigned a target by the player. Moreover, hallways can be added and defense mechanisms such as turrets, fences/force fields or mechanized doors can be added for a buffered defense.\n\nResearch plays a crucial role in what one can do in-game. Weapon options begin to open up once the proper research is done. A unique and enjoyed feature in this game is that there are no set units. When a new building is researched, a default unit is given but there are five empty slots. These slots need to be filled up by the player. Players are able to design their own units to their preference. For instance, basic foot units can be given basic to upgraded armor and equipped with lasers, quantum weapons or missiles. Additionally, defensive sort of measures can be added such as personal shields, timed explosives or electrostatic shock. Vehicles and air units also have option defensive measures although at the moment quite limited. Research unlocks these weapon variants, units, buildings and abilities. Players should be careful as research can take up quite a bit of energy. This uniqueness allows players to add another depth to their attacks. Some players may favor certain weapon types while others find benefits in mixing ballistics with energy.\n\nThe HUD for each individual unit is awesome. On one of the bigger aircraft units the player has the view of the action from the bridge. In mech-walkers, it feels like you're walking on mechanical legs and obviously the view is a little different. It would be nice if some sort of sprint option was available for air and vehicle units. Even though most of the visuals and graphics are a bit block-y/Half Life 1 sort of graphics, they do not get in the way of delivering effective gameplay. The controls themselves are simple at the moment and units have a primary weapon complimented with a secondary (upon doing research). I would like to see a little bit more added here in regards to personal options (meaning more weapon/defensive or some sort of special ability slot).  Two is good, but maybe adding that third could take the game to another level. Sounds are basic at the moment but the dev seemed to put everything necessary in the game. A laser sounds like a laser shot. Missiles explode and explosions are heard. When guns are fired there isn't really an impact sound when hitting other bots or walls. Music is actually pretty good but has a habit of cutting out randomly.\n\nOverall, this is a DECENT game that has the potential to be EXTREMELY GOOD. It seems the dev is trying to get the basics and foundation down before any major updates come out. There still is a lot of work to be done but the game is playable as of this instant. I have never paid full price for a game (that I can recall) so this must have been something to get interested. I really hope that this game turns out to be the next big thing. The only way that is plausible is by the devs continuing their good work and getting some input and possible help from the community. Believe it or not, there's always someone out there willing to help.\n\n\nE/A RATING : 6.9/10\n\n\nGameplay	B-	Story / Campaign	N/A	Visuals / User Interface	C+	Sounds / Music	C	Replay-ability	B-	Overall 	B-\n\nScreenShots :\n\nEstablishing a power grid\n\nBe wise with your spacing\n\nPUSH THE BIG RED BUTTON\n\nYou can watch units being made in real time\n\nInteresting way to log in\n\nI wonder if every CEO works this hard\n\nNice view","May 3","true","13.6"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","22","23","2","4"

It is still in early access and is a really great concept. However, it is not ready for any real gameplay. The visuals are ok but the game has a lot of work to be a truely great game.\n\nPros:\n+ Cool art style allows for graphics to stay as is without any real issues, though is early 2000s looking.\n+Decent RTS gameplay and ok FPS gameplay.\n+Can enter buildings and build interior and exterior defences.\n+Cannot spam defenses so it is possible to take an enemies base.\n+Best elevator music ever.\n\nCons:\n-Unit desync is a major issue. Connecting to another player is also an issue and is very sporatic. I had a 1v1 match and the other player could see exactly where I was, exactly where my single bot was, but said they had an army in my office, and I killed them all with one invulnerable bot. As far as I could tell, all his men were outside shooting my walls.\n-Graphics are 2000s looking. Not a big deal, however there are loads of detail issues that need fixed, such as clipping and shots going through walls and not really being there.\n-Damage is severely unbalanced. A tank destroys everything, but a group of bots destroys the world. Defence is useless. It is better to just invest in more bots with better weapons. They grind though doors like they dont exist, yes, forcefield, safety and security doors like tissue paper. Walls last only a few seconds longer. Your greatest defense is the long travel time of the elevator.\n-Low tech weapons and ballistics in general are useless.\n-No guides or tutorials.\n-Air vehicles easy to shoot down but can destroy all your defences including interior defences while building.\n-FPS mode rendered useless as unit ai is just too quick and does sooo much damage that there is no reason to use FPS mode. Sniping is possible, but you do so little damage that FPS mode only helps with late game fights. Strafing has little to no effect so why bother?\n-Base building is more of a puzzle of placement more than anything. Once the enemy is inside your base it is game over unless you have spammed lots of hallways to have loads of turrets inside the base. More often than not, the game is over before you even build your first few handfulls of bots.\n-There is no point to leaving your office ever as CEO. If you leave, your are dead. 1 shot kills you. Your pistol is a joke. If you leave and the enemy takes your office, you might as well surrender. You cannot do ANYTHING on foot as the CEO. Unless you have an ally or lots and lots of units on the ground, you are dead. You might as well just stay in the office and die ending the match.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the game is a great concept, works kinda , but has lots of bugs and balancing issues. Being in Early access, this could all be fixed, in which case the game would be a 9/10. Otherwise, it is currently a 5/10 as it is mostly unplayable for me.\n","March 16, 2015","true","22.8"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","0"

The rts elements arent shockingly different or anything but they're solid and dont frustrate the player, also controlling your units is awesome and feels very good (save for the planes but I hope that gets reworked). The main gimmick that really makes Executive Assault what it is, is the fact that you are playing as the objective, basically if the other Executive kills you, it's game over, this makes for some really hectic wars just to get into the other player's base, and once you do there's nothing more intense. The game doesnt particularly look amazing or anything and the performance is frustrating at times but that shouldnt get in the way of a truly solid rts/fps that's a joy to play with friends.","August 5, 2015","true","9.0"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","19","20","3","3"

You sit down at the desk, allowing you to play the game from the traditional RTS perspective, building your sole base, constucting a small army, and attacking the enemy base(s).\n\nBut of course, there are a few differences. For a start, you can directly control most of the units in the game. This could be anything from a light infantry robot to tanks, aircraft and giant mechs. You cannot directly control the other units, save for giving infantry follow and guard orders, so you might want to give out your orders first before taking over your tank and rolling across to the enemy base.\n\nAnother difference is that you don't destroy the enemy base, you have to fight your way up into the enemy bases office (elevators included) and kill the enemy CEO whilst they are desprately getting their forces to defend him. The CEO can deploy a shield if he has researched it and can even fight back, though his/her pistol is pretty poor.\n\nThis also means you can enter enemy structures, only your small footsoldiers can enter, making them a weak, but highly important unit. You will have to fight your way through other robots and automated defences to get through to the CEO. Even if you are not planning on killing the CEO, you can still cause trouble by getting your robots to the interfaces in some of the buildings. So far, only the power plant is sabtagable by shutting of the cooling, forcing the CEO to go down there himself to restart the cooling. But it is a fun feature.\n\nThe gameplay is a little difficult to wrap your head around the gameplay to start off with and the tutorial videos are admitedly, not fantastic, so don't be surprised when the Janitor, the lowest level AI, beats you early on when he slips a pair of robots into your base whilst you are struggling to get your robots in to defend you in time. But once you get the hang of it, it is a fun game in a rather underused genre of RTS. Of course, you don't have to use the FPS feature, but it's there when you want it.\n\nOf course, this game feels rough round the edges and perhaps harshly, uncomplete. The graphics aren't fantastic though it works wonders for older computers or those with low quality graphics cards. There are only a handful of two-four player maps in the game, a little less than ten, maybe even less. But then again, you can't blame the developers. It is only one guy and a few of his friends who are working on this game, not some AAA developer or greedy company (no offence intended to the AAA devlopers of course). The work they have done so far is great with what they have to work with, so you can understand the game's current state and greatly respect it for what it has done so far.\n\nLet's just hope that the developers keep adding things into the game such as new maps, CEOs and other fancy features to freshing and fill up the game.\n\n8/10. This game has a lot of potential and I'm looking forward to seeing it progress.","July 21, 2015","true","4.5"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

For sure as an "Early Access" it's not yet perfect. I made a test-skirmish-match where I researched everything and I never had a crash. It seems to be stable and that's good - because I didn't find any possibility to save. I only tested the skirmish part.\n\nThe most important thing:  It's incredibly fun to play!!\n\no description:\na very innovative mix of C&C, Supreme Commander, Z:Steelsoldiers, Etherium, Evil Genius and James Bond. As a CEO you have to conquer a small environment on a planet in RTS style and you have always the possibility to control every unit yourself. You are able to enter the enemies base buildings in FPS style or do your own assassin missions during the battle.\n+ pros:\ninnovative gameplay - it's incredibly fun!\ninteresting views - size of units and buildings are real\nYou can enter buildings and assassinate the enemy CEO in his own office!\na lot of different strategies and tactics possible\na big pro are the limitations of units, building space, resources and research -> forces you to decide what way you want to go -> forces you to watch the enemys moves\nyou can sell buildings and change your base very fast when needed\nUI and renderer can handle 21:9 aspect ratio and 3440x1440 resolution (better than some full price titles!)\na high complexity that is always easy to handle (unit design, research, building & control base)\neverything you have to control by yourself - and that's a BIG pro -> it  forces you to set priorities on your own actions! And that is THE SUCCESS of this game!\n- cons:\npathfinding sometimes bad\ndidn't find a possibility to adjust the cam angle - zooming and turning cam is OK\nno save in skirmish\ngraphic performance sometimes get bad when many units are on the screen\nsometimes units are not built for no reason - they stay in the queue and are not built, even when the unit limit is not hit\nYou should be able to adjust the mouse sensivity better for the FPS part\no neutral:\ngraphics are functional - no great, but cool indie style\nanimations are mostly poor, but it fits the whole game style\ncontrols are sometimes special -> text button to build drone, symbol button to build robot\ngame focus is on RTS, but you can use FPS mode whenever you like it - just for fun or to hit some assassin attack.  Be James Bond!\nConclusion:  What is a big contra in other RTS games is the real big pro in this game: the big strength of this game is, that you don't have too much automated help. Everything has a limited availability - you have to choose and set priorites. You're a CEO - not a general. If you think this way, you're going to have a lot of fun with Executive Assault!\n\n(You can also play an unlimited resource mod, if you like)\n\n--> to the devs: I highly recommend to NOT add more automated building or research help - because it would kill the fun. It's so cool to forget to do some things and then have to compensate it with workaround mesures during you try to get back on course.

You probably think it's quite a bit like them at a first glance. That's where you're wrong.\n\nFirst and foremost, this game is an RTS. A proper RTS. This doesn't rely on multiplayer matches with other people to be your groundfolk or play the opposing team or anything like that, everything works as it should in a proper RTS. You can go completely offline in single player against up to 3 AIs in configurable teams and difficulties, or online with other players and AI if so wished. You build your base, you build your units from a huge (emphasis: HUGE) list of weapons and upgrades, and you control them all as you would in any other RTS. It's done well, it's fun, and it has all the things a GOOD RTS needs - massive titanic sized walkers driven by captain martini-in-hand, huge destructive lasers, and a big list of buildings to choose from.\n\nThis game adds strategy to a location that most RTS games dont - building your base. Usually, a base's construction is simply a matter of what you've unlocked so far or what you want next, and the way to win is to have a bunch of a single building all producing something. That or they're just tech tiers. The strategy here lies in the small grid given to construct your base - all structures are confined to it and connected via corridors at one of many preset points for each building. The result of the small space and huge number of buildings means you have to be efficient when designing your base and can't simply lay things wherever you please. You can't fit everything into a single base, and some sacrifice will have to be made to specialize in something for the game. For example, if you wanted to completely surround your base with walls, that's going to take a toll on how much space you have remaining for other buildings. If you want an artillery station, that's going to take up a huge amount of room you could use for other things. The whole base becomes an intricately designed puzzle that, for the record, you can fully walk about in when in FPS mode and will -HAVE- to deal with to win the game.\n\nThe units are built in a sort of design-yourself ideal, where you pick the type of unit you want, special ability, and weapon before saving it to a slot, of which you have 6 for each type of unit - infantry, vehicle, and aircraft. You can overwrite previous designs if you get better ones. Each unit in the game except the transport aircraft can be controlled by the player should they so desire, and depending on how good at FPS games you are, it can be an advantage over simply letting it control itself.\n\nWith that, there's also the Executron mode. Up to 4 Executrons can join each company in multiplayer, up to 16 total. They act as purely FPS players who run about and can commandeer vehicles and aircraft as well as have infantry battallions follow them into battle when necessary so the CEO can focus on other things.\n\nThe FPS mode (more so specifically Executron mode) itself, however, does leave some to be desired. I had initially said there was no way to access the menu, this is wrong - you can press F10 in FPS mode to access the menu, not escape. So point 1 is invalid. For two, the Executrons have no way of upgrading themselves without dying/respawning and can only train whatever unit is set as the basic one at factories. For three, the Executrons are quite literally just another unit - they're restricted to what a normal unit can use. This is understandable in most cases, but they're also confined to a single weapon. To help make executron players a bit more involved, multiple weapons and preferably some sort of extra health would probably be desired seeing how they have no RTS control and need other ways to stay motivated.\n\nOverall, this is a game that's gotten me 5 hours of enjoyment in the last DAY and is likely to get many, MANY more with my friends joining me. There are still many aspects of the game I haven't been able to try - that's how big the tech tree is. And what's more, this whole game was made by 1 guy. 1 GUY. Every single thing. The art, the assets, the FANTASTIC music, all of it - 1 guy. (Ok, the music was actually his brother, but still.) It's absolutely outstanding. The game even has a huge amount of polish and is surprisingly stable and bug-free, even more so than many AAA games that come out today. I cannot bring myself to believe a single guy was able to create this good of a game. You expect this quality from higher budget studios with many people working at them, not from a single guy. On that alone I urge you to buy this game. And for $13? I'm surprised you haven't hit buy already.","May 31","true","7.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

There other games that have tried to mix the two before to varied success or unsusccess, but this one seems to understand why anyone would mix the two in the first place. It's the epic grand battles of an rts and the heated action of an fps.\nThe plot is non existant, but what do you expect? It's an indie title and not the artsy indie title. From what little I can understand of this universe is that there's corporations of bot manufacturers (not CIS from starwars) that are waring over planets. There's not single player campaign and the AI skirmish doesn't count.\nIt's not the prettiest game and it's certainly not the most well animated with the no wheel turn on jeeps and the CEO's walking like robots. The music is still epic though, especially when you finally build the highest tier mech.\nGameplaywise, there is a combination of good ideas that I remmember from other games. For one thing it will mark units on the map if you zoom out like in Supreme Commander. This allows the game to keep the infantry to scale when compared to vehichles and buildings. The buildings themselves are detailed and mapped out making them fun to explore. There's enough attention to detail that you can even see the process of which the infantry are made. There's even a game mode where you play as just the infantry while someone else does the rts mode. Your goal is primarily to kill the opposing CEO in his building by sending infantry in to theses structures and up his tower to shoot him. Then I found out how to break this game.\nYou see, once I realized buildings were indestructible, I surounded my CEO tower with hallways and left no openings. This meant no one can shoot me all the AI can do is look at my tower with it's ary of giant ships and robots. At that point I had to wonder if anyone else figured this out and tried pulling it on multiplayer. No wonder I can't find any servers. Even the AI seems to forget how to win once it's tech tree is high enough since even the Chairman level AI focuses on building giant war machines instead of infantry.\nThis game still needs tweeking but as it stands, it's a fun concept and I hope this gets popular.","February 4","true","22.4"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

Because in Executive Assault, you can.\n\nThe FPS mechanics are pretty solid, though I'd point issue with the aiming. At the lowest DPI it seems like each registered mouse movement moves a few pixels instead of one at a time, unless you zoom in with right click. It's annoying enough that it made leading and shooting targets fairly difficult.\n\nOn the RTS side, I cannot stress enough the importance of getting the crystals scattered around the map. Thorium increases your energy "production" by 25 units, which with 1 or 2 upgrades alone helps immensely. The other one (Celerite, I think?) increases your rate of research, and my God is research important in this game. It's a fairly standard multiple-category research tree but some of the first available upgrades are the most important.\n\nReally, though, as one of the only decent FPSRTS hybrids I've ever played,  I can heartily recommend it. The developer seems to have his head on straight and if nothing else, deserves a bit of compensation for his clearly hard work.","August 23, 2015","true","9.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The dev is a great guy and will personally respond to your suggestions, opinions, and is always at hard work to further the games development. The game does have its flaws, such as clunky animations and outdated graphics, but what it lacks in textures, it makes up for in mechanics. Even going as far as to allow you the ability to create your own corporation name, and logo. It also does a fantastic job of giving you the feeling of fighting along side your units in a chaotic battle zone. A business man's dreams of a capitalistic society where corporations fight with robot armies over planets to mine and harvest to continue in profit (almost like a CIS simulator). I highly suggest purchasing this game for only $15, a low price for how hard this single-dev has (and is still) working on this game. Even those who don't like the RTS genre can enjoy the upcoming gamemode "Executrons" which allows one CEO player to play in the RTS mode building the base and creating armies, with up to four players who play primarily in an FPS mode.","July 26, 2015","true","45.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

So far, I've loved this game. There are so many good things I could say about this game, but I'll stick with a few.\n\nThe Good:\n-The Research Tree and Units are expansive and diverse. It's great being able to choose specialties and weapons for particular units.\n-The Music in this game is pretty good. It also fits in with events that are happening. I especially love the epic song that plays when you build the giant mech.\n-The FPS side is used less often, obviously. However, it is really fun leading your soldiers into battle. The FPS adds to the scale of the game as well as adds attachment to your army.\n-Infiltrating bases is another thing I love about this game. It makes you look for weak points in the enemy base. It also makes you really think when planning an attack on the enemy base. You can't just run in and gun it out. It's satisfying when a mission goes successfully- but punishing when it doesn't.\n-Also, I like how this game has character. Once you start playing the FPS side, you'll notice a lot of humour.\n\nThe Bad:\n-The AI can be a bit annoying. Sometimes they'll roll into water and die. Other times, they won't guard an area properly. I'd like to see a bit more options for units.\n-Computer difficulty. The easisest difficulty is not easy. They're hyper-aggressive and relentless.\n-The Sounds also need a bit of a change.\n\nTo sum it up, I love this game.

That depends on what you want out of it. The game is a little rough around the edges--but improving all the time. The developer is very active and gets updates out quickly. He just finished a total re-write of the multiplayer code. We don't really notice that as players so much because it's not new content, but the game runs better in MP by a long mile.\n\nOther thoughts: Graphics seem dated--but the art style is cool and original. The gameplay has some glitches--but the concept is well put together and amazing. The sounds are pretty generic--but they are appropriate and add to the sci-fi atmosphere. The music is amazeballs. But it's also only 12-13 US dollars. The RTS mode is generic. And the FPS mode is missing things like lean, crouching and prone. But RTS mode and FPS mode happen at the same time which is so unique you hardly notice the missing "features" of more dedicated FPS titles like Call of Duty.\n\nIn the end you have really odd game. It's one that if any one of its components was left alone, it would be mediocre. It's not going to win any graphics fidelity contests, or have pundits talk about the realistic sound-scape. It's certainly not going to supplant StarCraft II as the golden standard of fast-paced RTS nor will it outsell Call of Duty's yearly sequels. But when all of its components are put together it's a one of a kind experience that I recommend to anyone with 13 US Dollars to spend. The thing that makes this game worth getting is its originality, its humor, and its unique blend of gameplay concepts from two genres that are really different--even if neither aspect of the game gets developed to a AAA level. There's nothing else like this game that has been made in over a decade. If you want something different to fill your hours, this is it. If you are looking for the next Call of Duty or StarCraft II, you'll have to move along.","November 1, 2015","true","36.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It combines two of my (and many others) favorite genres:\n\n- Real Time Strategy\n- First Person Shooters\n\nThe very unique aspect that you can control your units, and experience the fight on a new dimension, as well as the many ways you can set up your base and infiltrate the enemy's base, adds a lot of replay value. These combined aspects made the game for me.\n\nI also feel that there is no fluff in this game, there is everything in the game that needs to be, and nothing more.\nThe framerate gets choppy when you are beamed down into units, but thats the only gripe I can find with this game.\n\nIf you like base building, FPS, and RTS games, do yourself a favor and buy this game.","April 24","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Instead of being restricted by a single hero unit to lead your grand army, you can control any single unit you chose (insert Mass Effect Collector joke here).\n\nItd be nice if the game was a little more friendly in the UI department, it takes precision and timing both to make sure that an attack on a specific unit or building is ordered instead if a movment order. Would also be amazing if it allowed you to command your army from a FPS perspective, telling them to gather, charge, and so on Rise and Fall style (but better)!\n\nLOVED the customization of the robots.

There's just something awesome about the watching your massive fleet of giant robots flocking the enemy base. The game has outdated graphics but the mechanics make up for it. It runs very smooth and doesn't have any game-breaking issues. When you first start up the game, a message from the developer appears on your screen. He talks about how he is thankful you purchased the game with your hard earned cash and gives you some starter tips for your first time playing. It was very welcoming and I strongly wish more indie developers would do this.\n\nCons: The only negatives I found in this game were some laggy animations (Such as the robot running animation) and the pathing for the AI. Don't get me wrong, the pathing for the AI is much better than I expected, but there were just some slight issues with the units exiting their construction buildings.","July 20, 2015","true","17.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's not much, but I'm going to start with my first game. The only way to describe it is epic!\n\nThe match started with me walking around HQ getting a feel for the looks of the game. And enjoying the elevator music... Anyhoo, I soon decided that it was time to start playing the RTS part of the game. I walked over to my computer and logged in. Soon I was on my way to building a base. I had all the basics set up:\nPower plant\nRefineries\nBot production\nEverything was going good so far. I had a steady income. My warbots were being built. It was a good time to be a CEO.\n\nThen the fire nation attacked...\n\nI was on a large map with three other opponents, and one of my neighbors, Yellow, was attacking. They had sent of two tanks, and a couple bots. In retaliation, I sent all of my warbots over to help defend my iron mine.\n\nThis is where things got epic.\n\nI took control of a bot, and what happened next was amazing. The bot wasn't some sort of super\nmachine capable of terminating the enemy. I was one in a group of 12. My companion bots were marching next to me in a rhythmic style. You could feel each step. Whoomp. Whoomp. Whoomp. Then we got close enough for the enemy to start firing upon us. They opened up in a blaze of fire. Bullets streaming across the map. My allies death cry's could be heard as they were being cut down. We didn't lose the fight if that's where you thought this was going. While they were\nfiring at us, we were returning the fire. My warbots, even though they were dying, were fighting\nas hard as they could. Being down there with them made the hair on the back of my neck raise.\nYellow's bots were falling fast and hard. It was the tanks that caused us the most grief. One by\none my warbots were falling to the blasts of the enemy, but we prevailed and drove the enemy away.\n\nFor now.\n\nLosing 9 of my warbots from the original group of 12, I knew that I needed better hardware. This\nis when I started to research tanks, and getting better armor for my warbots. Within no time at\nall, I had produced two tanks with Gatling guns, and some tougher warbots.\n\nI was ready for war.\n\nThe new army that I made was on the march to attack Yellow because they attacked first. I was\nhalfway there when all of a sudden I saw a massive explosion from the yellow base.\n\nGreen had beaten me to them.\n\n\nDepending on the ratings of this review, I will tell the fate of the three remaining groups:\nRed\nGreen\nMyself\n\n\nOverall, I think this game is amazing. From my one game, there were a LOT of epic moments that\nI feel are only there because I could go into a FPS mode. Basically, how many times have you\nplayed an RTS where you wish you could be one of your troops in that massive battle? The feeling\nof finally being able to do this was amazing!! Besides the FPS mode, this game has a lot to\noffer. The research system is diverse. Your units are all customizable. Having to worry about the\ninsides of your buildings adds a new layer to the strategy.\n\nThis is one of those games that I hope has a very long life.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game to everybody!!\n\nKeep up the good work devs!!\n\n**Edit: Formatting issues","July 23, 2015","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Get the light Invigilator Tank, I mean....50 of them, and sic em on the enemy base from 2-3 fronts while a unit of infantry sits on a good vantage point.

I was like "This is BattleZone 3!!!!" If you don't know what I'm taking about look up BattleZone 2(on google). It has the same feel and looks to this game.

Units have all customizable loadouts.\n\nNot so great - Weapons seem to not have any range restrictions, equip a tank with the best anything, destroy anything you can see.

This game is buggy, glitchy, the units T pose from time to time and the weapon balance is absurd. The AI is somewhat not brain dead and there's upgrades that seem to be utterly useless.\nWhy should you buy this game? Because it is purely fun. Despite everything I just said the game has given me and my friends some goofy fun to mess around with and it is ENTIRELY worth the price tag. Seriously? 11.69$? That's a damn crime. This game lets you customize your units weapons, and abilities. There is a pool to pick from obviously but I get a sneaking suspicion that there will be more to come. The fact this is on unity just means that there is some creative room for this game. The matchmaking is still better than battlefield 4s and the gunplay is just about as good. There is monstrous balancing issues that need to be dealt with but this game has some insane promise.\nMy favorite part of it is the fact you can pilot a Warlord Battle Titan from war hammer. It's called the gigantilator but any closer and games workshop would be giving this guy a phone call. But that's not a bad thing. It's fun it's slow its HUGE. I hope to see more units and unit types in this game because it is so fun. I am literally counting days until the next update because I want to see where this is going. Buy it.

Interesting and different mechanics to other RTS, with the base only damagable by sabotage. Base buildings need to be interconnected, and have internal defenses to intruders.  Units have all customizable loadouts.\n\nNot so great - Weapons seem to not have any range restrictions, equip a tank with the best anything, destroy anything you can see. There is a race for reactor and research crystals, with limited supplies scattered randomly on the maps.

This game is buggy, glitchy, the units T pose from time to time and the weapon balance is absurd. The AI is somewhat not brain dead and there's upgrades that seem to be utterly useless.\nWhy should you buy this game? Because it is purely fun. Despite everything I just said the game has given me and my friends some goofy fun to mess around with and it is ENTIRELY worth the price tag. Seriously? 11.69$? That's a damn crime. This game lets you customize your units weapons, and abilities. There is a pool to pick from obviously but I get a sneaking suspicion that there will be more to come. The fact this is on unity just means that there is some creative room for this game. The matchmaking is still better than battlefield 4s and the gunplay is just about as good. There is monstrous balancing issues that need to be dealt with but this game has some insane promise.\nMy favorite part of it is the fact you can pilot a Warlord Battle Titan from war hammer. It's called the gigantilator but any closer and games workshop would be giving this guy a phone call. But that's not a bad thing. It's fun it's slow its HUGE. I hope to see more units and unit types in this game because it is so fun. I am literally counting days until the next update because I want to see where this is going. Buy it.

The concept you read in the other hundreds of reviews is really cool; HOWEVER, it has still some way to go to be a truly enjoyable game. Do not misunderstand, I truly love it as it is, but I know I can love it even more if some of these little thingies get fixed, which I am sure they will, because the dev actually gives a damn. Not like...  You know who.\n\nThings like I am into a match for several hours and there is no save game function. Which is all right now as I like to play for hours continously, but it can get really fustrating when it freezes and there is absolotely no way of getting your play back.\n\n\nI don't know if others had the same issue or not, but there are times when I am not able to select my units for some reason. Mouse is working fine and I can play just fine, but there are times when I can't select them. I have to go first person on a robot or be in CEO mode and get back again to RTS mode to be able to select them. Weird.\n\n\nThere are small bugs here and there and there is no reason to complain about those as we get those from 70 dollar games as well with hundreds of staff that worked years on them.\n\n\nI really hope this game will get tons of stuff added to it and I am looking forward for those improvements.\n\n\nBY THE WAY, Can someone please help me get the OST of this game? I love it so much, There are times I think I just wanna pause the game and listen to it, layed back and eyes closed.\n\n\n\nI know this ain't a good review but better than it's ok - IGN 10/10\n\nHowever as it sits:\n\n\n7/10\n\n\nIt will be 9 or 10/10 as those fixes and patches are coming out.\n\n\n\n\n","August 11, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The game itself is hilarious to play with friends while at the same time being a strategical timing based RTS. Although I use "Strategy" rather loosely. Although it has standard RTS objectives, build army, fortify base, build defenses, research upgrades, etc. It does not have the objective of, 'Destroy enemy base', rather, walk in and shoot a guy with 1 health and win the game. Although that's not really a BAD thing, it makes for some preeetty ♥♥♥♥ing stupid defeats. You could be absolutely destroying someone's army but one little peon robot could waddle his way in under your nose and steal victory from you with one little bullet. Obviously there are upgrades to defend your CEO, but still.\n\nThe game will obviously get better over time, and the developer has put a lot of time and effort into this, and it shows.","November 27, 2015","true","10.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PieMansLIfe/recommended/331500/","PieMansLIfe","PieMansLife","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PieMansLIfe/","45 products in account","Executive Assault is a RTS (Real time stragey). Unlike most RTS games, Executive Assault has a FPS (First Person Shooter) mode where you can take control of your robots without leaving your comfy CEO chair. In FPS mode you track your enemys (even through walls) with a red square being placed around them. It is better then just commanding and leaving your robots to shoot down your rivals because in FPS mode, you can see as far as the eye can see (well the whole map if theres nothing blocking your view.) The robots in normal mode will only shoot things near them that they can see (this also depends on the weapons that they are using). In FPS your weapons do have a range limit but you can actually shoot further. You can command any nearby troops by pressing F (Follow) or G (Guard) in FPS mode.\n\nThere are many differnt ways you can play this game. You could play against AI or real people. You could play 1v1 1v2 1v3 1v4 2v2. Multiplayer makes any game much more fun by having differnt people have differnt stratergies and some people will be easier to destroy as they have had less game time. Some people will be tryhards and murder everything in there path.\n\nThere are ways that you can shoot giant green lasers shoot your enemys down or make meteors fall and give you reasources. You can create hackerbots to break into enemys bases and open all the doors without having to shoot them down which takes forever. You can make turrets, towers, walls, bunkers and there is probably much more coming to this game.\n\nThe tech tree is very neat and split up into differnt tabs on a wheel. Sections like Units allows you to upgrade or create new units. Energy, Ballistic and Trion weapons allows you to create and upgrade your weapons for your units. Structures allows you to reasearch radars (which eventually lead to giant green death laser) and a reaseach facility (where you can pick up iron from meteor strikes and bring them back).  You can also customise your units by pretty much choosing a shell, weapon and ability for the unit. Theres mechs, infantry robots, tanks, more tanks, more mechs, planes, more planes, and of course a jeep.\n\nGraphics\nExecutive assault supports a reasolution up to 1980x1020 (i think). The graphics arent the best i have seen but this game is made by a single man! The maps look slightly man made and could use a bit of natureisation (not a word but meh) The terrain seems too flat and you cant climb the mountains that some of the maps have. The units could use a bit more detail and the overlay is confusing and ugly. (but the graphics dont make up the whole game right?)\n\nPros and Cons\nPros:\nNot to much of a price\nUpdates flowing through frequently\nVery nice concept\nMultiplayer!!\nTactics\nLots of tech upgrades\nQuite a few units\nLots of buildings\nMany ways to win/lose (Stupid rouge robots)\n\nCons:\nGraphics are not the best i have ever seen.\nNot enough weapons or units.\n\nOverall Rating 8.5/10\n\nImprovemts that should be added!!!!:\nBiological troops or animals\nMore terrain and bigger maps\nLonger games\nTroops:\nJets\nSoldiers/Infantry (Biological)\nWeapons:\nFlamethrowers (BECAUSE FIRE)\nPlasma weapon things??\nMelee weapons\n\nThank You!!","December 11, 2015","true","97.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You see, there was once this CEO. His goal was to take over a planet, but another CEO was interfering. So he went off to kill that CEO. So as soon as he started at his desk, he began researching Light Invigilators and Particle Beams. Once he unlocked the two, he put the two together. At once he began amassing an army of light invigilators. He charged the base with his invigilators and destroyed all defenses and power pylons in the entire base. The enemy tried countering that with a Gigantilator, but it was no match for the massive army of Light Invigilators that lay before it's very spawn. However, through all this time, the CEO with the Invigilators was never able to kill the other CEO. Why? Because he didn't have any Infantry to infiltrate his armored bunker.

SHUSH! these minor choices are just that, minor. and when swarm tactics are what you have to play with, you wont bother with much more than " do I want more damage, or more armour?"\nI really wanted to like this game> I wanted to look past the bad design choices, and one man team...\nbut I can't. this is a FULL release, which it should not be.\nwith another year or so of love and care this could be made into something more focused and polished.\nbut...it's steam...so all I can do is hold my breath and hope I didnt pick a bad egg, like soooooo many others.\n\nrandom, but this game reminds me of C&C reneagade!!\nit worked! despite EA doing everything in its power to kill the series, THAT game's multiplayer was something that no other game did better!\nthis game could take a page or two from that gem.","May 6","false","3.1"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","12","25","3","2"

It scratches it well, the game is essentially if Command and conquer had a child with an FPS and then added features that would make numerous AAA Developers blush and the most impressive part is that this game (as far as i have been lead to believe) has been made by one singular human being.\n\nGameplay wise it gets a solid 9/10 purely because after the few hours i spent playing i only just got about halfway through the tech tree and experimenting with different units, not only that but the interior of your base is completely explorable and you can add internal defences such as turrets and doors to impede the progress of your enemy into your base. Almost any unit in the game can also be directly controlled (so far only the troop transports weren't) and this lead to some awesome moments of attacking my enemy in the middle of an army i sent.\n\nVisualy the game looks fairly decent. The map i played on looked rather nice and was well designed, my only real issue here is the lack of colour for the base buildings, while the textures are good, they are one colour and there isnt much variation which gets a bit dull to look at sometimes\n\nThe sound is good, but i have noticed some sounds make an unbearable noise when layed ontop of each other. For example when i lead my troops in an assault once there was a god awful racket when the bullets started flying, other than that its nothing special\n\nOverall this game is Definately worth sinking some time into, i had a blast in the single player. But i feel multiplayer with friends would be an incredible experience. Would i recommend this game? YES, yes i would.","December 24, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Get the Heskosium crystals that are dropped from meteorites and get access to stronger units. Its just a race to who can get the drone to the crystal first.\n-The AI version of your units will not destoy enemy drones. Only way to stop them is to go into 1st person.\n-Destroying a drone who picked up a crystal will not make the crystal aviable for you.\n-Alot of the weapon upgrades are pretty much useless unless you play in 1st person mode. The only weapons i seen the AI use with some effect are the basic machine guns and laser beams. Simply impossible for them to hit anything with a cannon.\n-A match can be won real quick if you buy one robot troop and send it to kill the enemy executive, honestly few people can afford putting out a defense so early on. (Once its inside the base you can rarely catch it before it reaches the CEO who dies so quick)\n-The AI version of my units tends to blindly shoot at walls as targetable objects are behind the wall.\n-The wall that lets you put units ontop of it is completly useless for AI can't shoot even if the target is right under them. Only useable for first person.\n-Once you get artillery, aiming them at the enemy's resource nodes will pretty much ruin their entire income and win you the game by simply having little to no threat left.\n-Sound can glitch out if its to many things making sounds at once.\n-Tends to bug out when selecting units\n\n\nOverall: This game had potential but wasn't executed so well. Its more a race of which drone will reach the crystal first than it is a battle. The winner of the crystals is basicly the winner of the game. The only fun i had was messing around with a friend on this, and that was only for 1 hour of fun for us. This game had potential but changes needs to be made, it needs to be redesigned on its rules as this is a snowball RTS more than anything and it needs to have bug fixes for the sound glitches aswell as the bug that makes selecting a unit annoying. Ontop of that they need to improve the AI so more weapons are even useable for the AI units, making all my units use laserbeams since else they will miss everything if not is just not fun simply. The only way i can make use of the more hard hitting weapons like the cannons is to have a private aircraft with the cannon simply there for me to make quick assaults on incomming enemies. I shouldn't have to do that just to make the cannon useable.\n\nThis can be fun for some i can imagnen but i simply cannot recommend it unless it gets some patches that fixes some of theese problems.\n\n(Theres not to much wrong with the AI players its just the non firstperson player units that are complete garbage)","September 24, 2015","false","23.1"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

It also bares a striking resemblance to the old Command and Conquer games.\n\nThere are a few major downsides though.\n\n-Older machines might not run this as well\n-Some textures look like ♥♥♥♥\n-The FPS combat is horrible (except when you are in a tank battle or dogfight)\n-The AI is always 100% accurate so there is no point in going into FPS mode at all\n-A lot of features are unfinished and the game has a half-baked feel to it\n-There is absolutely no balance in gameplay\n-Buildings do not take damage so bombarding the enemy base is pointless\n-If you press the F key in FPS mode your game breaks\n\nOverall, I would say... wait before you buy.\n\nThis could really turn into something really good but for the time being it's not exactly worth it's asking price for what appears to be an unfinished project.

Basic exterior base defense, I can see how to build. But, what I can't understand is how you build interior defenses! There are literally no ingame tutorials even RELATING to interior defenses. The game developer thinks they can hand the game to you and simply say, "Ok, have at it. I think you can learn without a proper tutorial." Well, guess what?!

I can work past the bugs and the hideously out dated visuals, but I can't say the same for everyone. But I can say, Dev, you must have sold over 400 copies by now, judging from the amount of user reviews, I did some math, and at a rough estimate I'd say something over 2 grand (but probably more because all I did was $10 x 400 - %50 (if Valve were ♥♥♥♥♥), which are all worst case scenarios in terms of sales), that should be enough to warrant further work on the games visuals and polish.

Sounds good? Yeah well it should sound good in theory but the game has performance and gameplay issues which kills every attempt to enjoy it. From lag issues and framerate drops to invisible units which count to the unit limit but can't be destroyed or suddenfly fly to the sky and can't be killed but kill in return everything which come near. The position of the ressources is - frankly - a joke. It reduces the strategy effect to who comes first, can research in seconds with no energy issues at all. You fail in the first minutes at collecting these hard to spot crystals? You can give up, simply as that.\n\nI know this is early access so bugs and troubles have to be expected. But not such problems that the game becomes unplayable for both players especially to a price of 20 €. I like the game but I can't for the love of god recommend this to anyone out there.\n\nOn the positive side: The developer works very hard to fix issues and stays in contact with the community. I'm confident that he will solve these issues sooner or later. That will also be the time I will change this review.\n\nEDIT: I can say that the inprovements of the performance issues worked. I barely have any issues anymore and the bizarre thing with units going trough sea or mountains also dissapeared. There are some other bugs still left but I can see the developer is doing something. The Issue with the ressources still remain and make the "strategy" aspect a simple "who catches what first.","June 14, 2015","false","41.5"," 35 of 76 people (46%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","46","35","76","4","3"

Shouldn't waste 15 good dollars on this game, plenty of better games out there, probably for cheaper too! I uninstalled.\n\nUpdate: I reinstalled to try again. The Tutorials are NOT very inviting, So I felt like I was going back in time when I had to force myself to read the manual. Yet the robotic tutorial voice is not so great, so it is very hard to follow the tutorial videos, they should have a replay button or something. It just ends and you think..."So what did it just tell me?" ...Also the tutorials were not synched up to what I was doing. They start by a trigger event, but that fails to realise what I have done, very frustrating and I believe most of them had more than one area covered in the one time play, tutorial videos.\n\nThis caused me to try different things at random and it didn't feel fun. I was playing a solo game against no-one like it said on the main menu to get familiar with the game. Unfortunately this leads me to thinking that there is really only one starting path to choose from, and setting up your base with the essentials just seem tedious, which is why Im not bothering to start a me vs AI game because I feel I need to know exactly how to play the game and know every technology path JUST so I wont die miserably, and even if I did I still won't be having fun with this game. Why? because there is no learning curve in my opinion, you have to know it all before playing it by reading up the guides on it, leading me to think that mostly this game was for the creator and people who play multi because there is many faults that need to be fixed.\n\n1. Interior doors should be closed and locked to begin with!\n2. I found a bug, after taking direct control of a robot in the field, I exited back into the RTS view, problem was that THEN the WASD keys stopped working for moving around the base in RTS view, luckily I had the radar reseached and built so I was able to continue by moving around with clicks on the map!\n3. Another bug! On the RTS view, you can only "drag select" units, not a simple left click... ?\n4. The map seems to small for a 4vs4 game\n5. Thats all I have so far, Im still unsure whether I want to play this again, But I might if the dev addresses these issues soon!\n\n\nUnfortunately at this time I cannot recommend anyone buy this game.","September 24, 2015","false","1.5"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Some things have a lot of really interesting detail, like the elevators have elevator music and you can have battles inside.\n\nBut there's a lot of flaws...\n\n- 80% of the time connecting to my friend gives "NATTARGETNOTCONNECTED". We don't have problems hosting any other multiplayer games, and the error is not helpful.\n- Terribly balanced. I don't even know where to begin. Things aren't so much overpowered, just they don't work as expected or the AI doesn't know how to aim at the right targets.\n- Near impossible to micro manage due to poor controls.\n- Main menu music not affected by sound sliders. Very loud.\n- Tutorial videos have some british guy with a lisp, then some robotic effect applied. Very difficult to understand.\n- Some really lacking researches, like +5% armor for a specific unit type.\n- You can easily defend yourself by calling the elevators as soon as they reach the bottom, before the doors open. Just stalls the game, but very annoying.\n- Lightning gun has a very long recharge time, but the reload indicator doesn't work for it.\n- Very poor unit control, clunky first person mode switching\n- Impossible to force attack certain objects.\n- Very small map selection, and most aren't very interesting.","July 19, 2015","false","3.6"," 7 of 23 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","7","23","2","0"

The units all look quite basic,blocky and similar to each other and in general look like you'd expect from an older Strategy like total annihilation for example.\n\nBut that is where the negatives stop.\n\nThe concept is simple, build an army, kill the enemy CEO. The fact that you can go into first person with almost any unit means that you can personally pull the trigger on the assasination rather than just send in a squad and view from above.\n\nThis game is about the gameplay. There is a varied tech tree and the route you take up that tree will decide your fate. That and the route your opponent takes. You can choose to build big weapons and huge troop numbers and bust into your opponents base or you can choose the more subtle sneaky assasinaton attempt.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun and the ability to go firts person adds a fun extra to the game. There's somethig awesome about building a base then taking a tour of it in the first person to admire your work. And despite the opening sentence to this review... it looks pretty good!\n\nThere are elements that I would like to see improved though. The tech tree although expansive allows for a limited number of basic unit types. I'd like more research options for unit types and i'd like to see larger and more maps. Perhaps more options for the assasination than a blaster to the face.\n\nTo summerise, the game is immensly fun despite it's basic designs and unit limitations. These are made up for by some other subtle minor details that i didn't expect.\nYou can tell that it was made with a very small budget and to a small degree it feels like only half a game but that just doesn't matter. £10 well spent.","March 15","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's only 12 dollars, but its a lot funner with friends. In Executive assault you are a CEO of a company. the goal is to assasinate the other CEO.\n\nPros:\n- RTS and FPS\n- Ai is a challenge\n- Huge skill tree\n- You can build a base, and walk around inside it\n- Players can be ExecuTrons, which are player controlled robots that are part of your company but only in fps mode\n- Active developer that listens to the community about ideas and such\n- Huge robots, and large battles\n- Decent graphics exept for ground texture\n- Good soundtrack\n- Different ways to win, like shutting off the cooling of the other CEO's base\n- Many different weapons and interesting battles\n\nCons:\n- AI is easy to beat if you rush it at the begining\n- Needs optimizing, but runs well on my gtx 970 untill usually 40 minutes in, which it goes to 30-26 near huge battles\n- Occasionall bugs, like any other game\n- Why haven't you bought the game yet?\n- Seriously, what are you waiting for?\n","January 24","true","42.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It's an RTS where you are not only part of the battlefield, but you can take control of any unit you own and play as that unit.  It's crazy.  This is what I imagined Command & Conquer Renegade was going to be like.\n\nFirst the negative - this game is a resource hog.  Rocket League may take a lot of horsepower, but this takes more.  The game 3D-models everything and it chugs like crazy if you don't have an excellent machine.  It's also very rough around the edges.  The interface is clunky and confusing, and takes a while to get used to.  Also, the multiplayer options are very limited (no ability to chat, and you have to restart to play online again).\n\nBut it's fun!  The base building and customizing of units, along with lots of research options keeps you engaged.  And there's nothing more thrilling than running into an enemy CEO's terminal and shooting him.  It definitely needs some balance work, but it's a good time with friends.","August 12, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an RTS where you are not only part of the battlefield, but you can take control of any unit you own and play as that unit.  It's crazy.  This is what I imagined Command & Conquer Renegade was going to be like.\n\nFirst the negative - this game is a resource hog.  Rocket League may take a lot of horsepower, but this takes more.  The game 3D-models everything and it chugs like crazy if you don't have an excellent machine.  It's also very rough around the edges.  The interface is clunky and confusing, and takes a while to get used to.  Also, the multiplayer options are very limited (no ability to chat, and you have to restart to play online again).\n\nBut it's fun!  The base building and customizing of units, along with lots of research options keeps you engaged.  And there's nothing more thrilling than running into an enemy CEO's terminal and shooting him.

Then all of a sudden an alarm goes off in my base, I go back to my CEO point of view and see 8 robots coming up the elevator trying to kill me. I quickly dashed to the other elevator, ran around panicking in my base for 5 minutes before getting killed. 10/10 moment.\n\nMy three biggest gripes with this game are the following;\n\n1# Undestructable buildings in the base. You can kill pylons, turrets, extractors and basic defense structures. I would love if I could blow up my enemies unit buildings, radar station, etc.\n\n2# Taking control of a unit. This is the greatest thing ever, but every time I do it, I feel like I'm losing out on micromanaging my base and units to the fullest, and start falling behind the enemy.

This game, how do I put it.... It's absolutely amazing. The concept is very simple. You play as an executive commanding a bunch of units to kill another executive (hence the name). You can control these units either through a typical RTS manner or through FPS and you can customize the loadouts of these units. It plays out like any other RTS (research, resource management and the works), but unlike many others you can manage the distribution of power into a few departments: automatic defenses, iron mining, research and I cant remember the rest off the top of my head. The first person aspect adds a lot to the game and is my preferred way to play. I mean, sure, you can send a few units into the enemy base and have them fight their way to the command center, but I'd much rather assume the position of a robot, get a gang to follow my by pressing F, clear the halls and personally assassinate the other executive. Anyway, the main reason I type this is because it opened my eyes to the fact that many indie developers who have great and innovative ideas are going unnoticed and the more popular game companies who keep re-using the same concepts and mechanics (I'm looking at you, Activision) are getting way more money than the people who actually deserve it. But anyways, this game is a 9.5/10 in my personal opinion and is frankly a lot more fun than the vast majority of non-indie games out there. I highly recommend this game.","February 25","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a lot of potential, and there are so many small details in the game that makes it pretty good.\n\nMy fondest memory of this game that I remember, was playing my first game and learning what to do, the basic mechanics. Then all of a sudden an alarm goes off in my base, I go back to my CEO point of view and see 8 robots coming up the elevator trying to kill me. I quickly dashed to the other elevator, ran around panicking in my base for 5 minutes before getting killed. 10/10 moment.\n\nMy three biggest gripes with this game are the following;\n\n1# Undestructable buildings in the base. You can kill pylons, turrets, extractors and basic defense structures. I would love if I could blow up my enemies unit buildings, radar station, etc.\n\n2# Taking control of a unit. This is the greatest thing ever, but every time I do it, I feel like I'm losing out on micromanaging my base and units to the fullest, and start falling behind the enemy. Not sure how to fix this problem.\n\n3# No bulletdrop. If you go into FPS mode on one of your units, you can hit the enemy base from your own. That's kinda broken.","August 20, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The units all look quite basic,blocky and similar to each other and in general look like you'd expect from an older Strategy like total annihilation for example.\n\nBut that is where the negatives stop.\n\nThe concept is simple, build an army, kill the enemy CEO. The fact that you can go into first person with almost any unit means that you can personally pull the trigger on the assasination rather than just send in a squad and view from above.\n\nThis game is about the gameplay. There is a varied tech tree and the route you take up that tree will decide your fate. That and the route your opponent takes. You can choose to build big weapons and huge troop numbers and bust into your opponents base or you can choose the more subtle sneaky assasinaton attempt.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun and the ability to go firts person adds a fun extra to the game. There's somethig awesome about building a base then taking a tour of it in the first person to admire your work. And despite the opening sentence to this review... it looks pretty good!\n\nThere are elements that I would like to see improved though. The tech tree although expansive allows for a limited number of basic unit types. I'd like more research options for unit types and i'd like to see larger and more maps. Perhaps more options for the assasination than a blaster to the face.\n\nTo summerise, the game is immensly fun despite it's basic designs and unit limitations. These are made up for by some other subtle minor details that i didn't expect.\nYou can tell that it was made with a very small budget and to a small degree it feels like only half a game but that just doesn't matter. £10 well spent.","March 15","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe its best to get that offensive upgrades as soon as posible or will that leave your CEO defenseless since you didn't choose the auto turrets and the blast doors for your base?\n\nThis game is a one-man made game, no AAA game here, it means every single asset, sound, bug or glitch has been made/overlooked by a single man, and THAT is great! It recieves regular updates, but you cant ask much since its a 1 man job, but the game is pretty fun, i dont know why not many more peole play this!\n\nIt has a lot of flaws, yes of course! but its pro's outbeat them once you play it!\n\n10/10 !","May 4","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of the Best RTS/FPS Hybrids I have ever played. Its Easy to understand, Fun to play with friends. (Not many people play Multiplayer) Insane Game Changing events. RTS and FPS are Easy to play. Tech tree has alot to Research. Best part is that you can have up to 20 Players in a single game at once with no lag. (Unless  you don't have the right computer which most people do have.) Overall Great content! Community is Helpful.\n\nThe only thing i would say that isn't perfect is that it is only on PC. (No Mac or Linxus Versions Released yet.) Also Multiplayer isn't very active although there are Various groups dedicated to finding a Player you can play with.\n\n9/10 As time goes on It might become more popular within Multiplayer! Worth the $13.\n\n"Just because the Graphics are god awful, doesn't mean that the Gameplay is absolute Sh-it."\nSalem 2016","April 10","true","40.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
