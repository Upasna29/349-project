I do. But there's just too many issues.\n\nPros\n\nA unique fighting experience that I've really enjoyed so far.\nInterestingly mapped out story mode. Looks to have a decently long story.\nI love the design in general. Of the game, and where the lore comes from as well.\n\nCons\n\nThe translation is god awful. It's really bad. There are some cutscenes where the text is in Chinese, when clearly english was chosen.\n\nThe game constantly flickers for me. It gives me errors about my graphics card, and as the game gets more intense, it becomes more impossible for me to play it. My setup is more than enough to run this game, so unless it's a compatability issue with nvidia gtx graphics (unlikely), I don't see the issue.\n\nVery, very little options as far as changing visual settings go. Literally all that's there is an option to change the resolution.\n\n\nI hope I can reccommend this game someday.\n\nIn case you're about to buy this, here's my rig :\n\nIntel Core i7 4720HQ (2.60 GHz) 8 GB Memory 1 TB HDD NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M 2 GB GDDR5 15.6" Windows 10 Home 64-Bit\n\nIf yours are like mine, I would NOT reccommend this game to you.\n\n\n\n","April 17","false","0.6"," 54 of 66 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","54","66","2","4"

Yeah, the story is alright.\nThe game has content, BUT..... the gameplay is just really disappointing.\nAll I do is use j the most, then k, h, and i depending on leveling the "generals," beside the wasd as directional keys.\nThe game is unique due to graphics and how the game is.\nBut the gameplay was just very dissappointing to me since I'm a huge rpg player. :/","April 18","false","0.7"," 38 of 53 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","38","53","3","4"

Seriously it's bad. I'm not talking about non-sense character design which is barely recognizable from the origin: Romance of the three kingdoms; It was not the horrible localization such as "numbered sisters" all over the text which was literally "2nd sister and 3rd sister"; I'm not even talking about the gay joke of dude kissing dude; I'm just saying that when I choose English, it should run in English. It's hilarious to show us a cut-scene with FULL Chinese text in an English version of the game. Even better, once, some comments in Chinese were saying "no-translation provided" on the screen. It took me a while to figure that out. What about "translation server error"? LMAO Use google translate dude! At least make the full game playable yeah? I was speechless, entirely.\n\nYou need to remove the English tag if the localization is still wip. It's irresponsible and totally not decent. I'm considering it as an act of lacking the respect toward worldwide consumers whom spent money and time on your game.

(Also stuck on a certain level due to a Combo Condition)\n+The game is actually an very interesting concept with funny artistic character designs taken from Chinese History and Characters from Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The only catch is that its like a parody with genderbender with some of them (Guan Yu&Zhang Fei are Female but not Lui Bei). Thus the reason you see chinese characters in the game itself.\n+Its quite beautiful and alive especially the visual effects and its perspective view of 2.5 and 3D. Think of Muramasa: The Demon Blade game if you have played it on the DS or VITA.\n+Don't worry for the game is fully in English with some funny translation but the Developers are Chinese so its bound to have funny translation.\n+The Music is also quite amusing to listen since it fits the gameplay. The gameplay itself is situated as a button turn base where you choose the 1 abilities per turn per characters. You can score points by racking up the combo whilst dealing more damage and staggering the enemies so they can't counter attack. Its all about timing.\n+The map is like Mario where you travel in each node.\n-/+You can level up each characters with coins you earn from your travels though it will be grinding/farming since you need to level them up just to pass a level.\n-/+To unlock characters you not only need to get through a certain part of the story but you need certain number of stars to unlock them.\n+Gamepad is supported though I only tested using X-Input so I have no clue about D-Input.\n-There are some minor bugs to be found though its nothing Game breaking.\n-/+Some dialog when playing in English weren't translated but they will fix it next month.","April 15","true","6.5"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","20","31","2","0"

This truelly is a gem for all who love fast pase, thinking 2 steps ahead, cute cartoony character beat em up games... BUT! This game have a slight twist then the normal beat em up game...\n\nThere are no direct control of your hero's movement, they taking turns jump into then fight then withdraw when the next hero enter the battle, and the control have been split for both left and right hand...\n\nLeft hand WASD = Controlls the roaster of heroes in your team, game will auto rotate your heroes if no extra command was given, but you can use WASD keys to force select a hero from your roaster so you can unleash one of his skill that is not in cooldown.\n\nRight hand IHJK = Controlls the 4 skills of each hero. J is the basic attack, that every heroes start with at lv1. K is advanced tier attack, and H is higher tier attack, Heroes unlock this 2 at higher level. I is ultimate attack, and also the last skill to be unlocked, they are not just dealing large amount of damage, they also laster way longer then any other attacks, and the lasting effect extend into 1-2 more heroes's turn.\n\nThe goal of this game is to plan and form combos with the attacks of your heroes, and use those attack to ether stunlock or push back waves of enemy, but enemy do have special ability or will be located at areas that some attacks just won't be able to touch them, so it will be up to the player to form up a team of heroes to bring down those annony buggers.\n\nThis game have a really fast gaming pace, really nice graphic for an indie game, funky cartoony design... It is fun to play, and even the music make me want to record it for my MP3 player!!\n\n\nOkie.. I forgot to mention the down side... Due to this is a Chinese indie game, so far only some of the dialogues (most of them) and menus were translated into English, other in-game signs like "Let The Battle Begin!", "Show them what you can do!" and "Victory!" are still in Chinese... So it might be eyesore for some Internet Nazi, but not a big issue for normal game player. :P","April 14","true","1.2"," 41 of 80 people (51%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","51","41","80","11","8"

The mix of action & strategy looks nonsense at the beginning, but as soon you progress you'll need to adjust timing to your attacks and use character types wisely and level them up accordingly. It's like a turn-based action rpg with side scrolling view.\nhttps://youtu.be/TPym4LCKvMY\nThere a some yet-to-be-translated parts but it's safe to say the game is still understandable and only affecting further stages/less important parts of the game. Depending of your confidence to the devs, you may wait or support this title now and enjoy the game like many others have. I did not regret the amount i've spent. Some of you may differ regarding it's quality, but as far as i'm concerned the price point is acceptable.","April 19","true","3.7"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","14","27","2","1"

During a hero's attack friendly heroes can join with their helper attack if available. Also: cute anime style.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8-1R83Mg3S8\n\nThe PROS outweigh the cons\n- Unique gameplay!\n- Many enemy types\n- Cute style with big Chinese text on the screen\n- Fun enough story. 2 of the main characters have enough personality\n\nCONS\n- Just 4 girls in the game? And 8 guys . . .\n- If you think you play a level, and then continue to the next level and continue with the story, no! You usually need to play the same levels again to complete challenges that are only available after beating the level once, and your character may not be strong enough to stand enough of a chance to beat the next level.\n- Combo challenges can be literally impossible if your characters are too leveled up and kill enemies too quickly.\n- The leveling up system plays a bit too much of a role for replayability: If you just want to play a much earlier level because it was fun, it won't be challenging any more.","April 16","true","26.4"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","7","20","0","1"

Its almost like the "Project X Zone" games for the 3DS. By that i mean that you controll a set amount of characters, you start with 3 and then as you progress you unlock more characters. You add or remove people from your group of 4 and follow a story based adventure where every stage is a combat scenario. Every character has 4 abilities, when you use one, the ability gets a cooldown and you switch to the next character and keep the combo chain going. The game is quite interesting, kinda funny story so far.\n\nThe only thing that i need to comment on which could be improved is the UI and the text. Sometimes the screen dosn't fit with texts and icons cover some things around the screen. Regarding the text of the game, anyone could understand it except some parts like "Titles" for the stages being in chinese letters only. But there's alot of spelling errors such as. "You unlocked a stage star (Icon) Use it to unlock next stag" or "then take care of the troublr on left".
