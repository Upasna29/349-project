I will give it a thumbs up but i want to make a few things clear.\n\n1. When you buy a game to play on your own pc you should be able to play it your way. At this time the developers (or rather Single developer that made this). Has not taken this into consideration. If you play on a server with other people, the person running the server should set up the rules.\n\n2. Everything is about choices.  Some of us do not have the weeks and weeks to gather resources to build everything.  That is why most games employ a creative mode.  The author of this game will not commit to this so I would suggest that you pass on this game  if you do not want to  spend the time on it .\n\n3. The day / night cycle is too short (days are 12 minutes long and so are nights),You can not accomplish anything in that short amount of time. There is to much time spent on eating and drinking  and fighting off monsters you can not even see or hear at night until you are dead . And if you get caught in the spawn area with a zombie  you just die over and over and cant do anything about it.\n\n4. If you Start a new player in a world you already created you get NOTHING (no tools or anything ). Good luck in chopping down a tree or anything,   You cant do anything\n\n\n5.This game requires you to stand in front of an anvil while you are making plates and you cant move or do anything else , A steel plate takes over 30 seconds.  If you need a dozen,   well you get my point.\n\n6. Food and water are spoiling too fast in your inventory ,  even if you build a freezer , they wont keep more then an hour or so. This needs to be rethought.\n\nI think the game shows promise but as of now you might want to watch the updates and see what happens.\n\nSo now for the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\n1. great graphics\n2. The ability to create many things.\n3. Play with friends on a lan or over the internet.\n4. Hundreds of things can be built.\n5. The Sound is pretty good.\n\nCons\n1. Zombies are too agressive. They Cant be seen or heard night or day.\n2. Lack of a creative mode or way to turn off fighting if you want a peaceful mode.\n3. Day night cycle is too short.\n4. Working with the anvil is too time consuming\n5. Resource regeneration is too slow.\n6. Hunger and thirst go down to fast.\n7. Creating a new player in a new world yields a blank inventory.\n8. Walk speed is a bit to slow.\n9. The game seems to generate a fairly small world even at its largest setting. Unless i am missing something the single landmass is the only landmass in the world.  (yes unity can create endless worlds if you program it to )\n10. Food spoils at too fast a rate , even if you place it in a freezer.\n\nBottom line.\n\nLike most early access games on steam this one is probably a little too early.  I have a feeling that in time  the game will be a fun and exciting addition to your  library .\n\nAccording to the credits, the game states it was written by 1 person. It will probably take a long time before it is done. The price is right If you want to deal with all of the issues right now. I am sure they will improve.\n\nI will update this review if things change.","April 12","true","35.7"," 85 of 94 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","85","94","0","1"

I can´t wait for a multiplayer serverlist, this should be great fun in multiplayer, especially if the thing with the credits works because I can imagine some people will want to trade items and specialize production and maybe even make little shops to sell their products... a RP server for this game would be kinda epic... hope the devs stay with it because in the long run, this could become something special, it has that potential!","April 8","true","1.0"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","32","41","4","7"

I'd just like to warn you that if (like me) you don't speak a word of Russian, this game is not for you.  Don't believe me?  Look at the Pinned threads, then go through pages of conversation all in the Russian script and find out for yourself.  The developer himself is replying in russian on the thread questions and there doesn't seem to be any real english translations to guide us english speaking community to understand what is going on with the thread.  Considering this is a Pinned thread, this enforces my statement further.  If I'd known I was going to buy a game that was not going to at least balance out the english language and give some of us an insight of wha'ts gonig on and being said, I would have swerved past this product.  As it is, I'm now stuck with it.\n\nI've given this game a fair 30+ hours of playtime so I should be able to make a relatively good base of a review on it.\n\nFirst and foremost, its not a bad game .  Don't let the Thumbs down actually deter people from actually purchasing the game.  I've done literally everything you can in game in regards to building what's currently available across two single player servers.\n\n\nThe Pro's of the game\n\n* At the start, it is relatively slow to get yourself on your feet.  It took me around 2 realtime days to actually get some sort of broken battery power initiated to actually make any real progress.  Once you get a thermal generator up its smooth sailing for the most part.\n\n* You can make a fair few nice designs for base building.  The map can be varied to small, medium and big so you can get a lot of room to go places or keep the area small and managable.\n\n* The cross-server option is nice.  You make a fake world to mine resources and clear-cut the map to then bring over to your homeworld map (like Savage Lands where you can make a resource map - delete when cleared).\n\n* I do see a lot of potential if the game continues to go in this developing direction.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nNow the Cons - and sadly there's a lot more in these than the Pro's\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* Firstly, having aliens popping up ONLY at night (nearly always three and they randomly spawn whever they like) and die in three hits are tedious.  Technically any sort of barrier or even uneven surface they get stuck on and run at you where you can easily just kill them off.  They need a huge improvement with AI and spawning options.\n\n* A lot of the things you can build need to actually be operational and useful.   Currently, things like the Greenhouse, Filler and one or two other items constructed serve utterly no purpose.  They have not been scripted and are currently a construction waste of time as they do absolutely nothing at all.    These need to serve some sort of purpose.\n\n* My biggest headache - and a lot of the community agree - is that there is absolutely NO tooltips on items to be constructed.  I understand what machine (for example) does what by building and use it. (or I've had to refer to the discussions thread with other people asking those same questions).  The items are listed, it tells you what materials are needed to craft, however there's no description AT ALL as to what their purpose is.\n\n* The food side of things.  I am so fed up with just banana trees, oranges and lemons.  That's all I've found on EVERY world I've created and I've make hundreds of servers with different ratios for the resources sides.  but things like the Apple Trees, vegetables of ANY sort, etc etc... none of them exist.  I've never found any at all and really, I've solely been relying on oranges for the most part as a food source.  They decay in hand way too fast and the Freezer only slows it, so there's no real storage to keep them fresh.\n\n* Stuff needs to be described in regards to placement of structures.  I slapped down about 1500 blocks to be able to place the air transport factory as when I tried to place it on the map as its partially hilly, half of it was in a mountain or half underwater so I made a platform large enough (as its f'cking huge!) to place it on.  Total waste of time as it did not place on a flat structure.  This needs to be a possible option.  The Transport Factory has no problem being on a platform so why one and not the other?\n\n* Stuff like fishing, hunting that sort of thing would be good in game.  However, its currently not.. its a 3x tree farming simulator.\n\n* Some items are categorically useless.  The campfire purifies water 1x2 for the bottles.  When you upgrade to a Distiller, its 1x1, the process is a little slower, but you don't lose one bottle to every two.   Then there's the Chem Lab.  All its DOES is purify water and that's pretty much it.  Its the fastest of the three but what's the point of the middle man really?\n\n* Lastly, one other thing that has me a little concerned regarding the game that I read on Forum, I was trying to figure out the use of the Filler machine.  I have a vague idea but as its not doing what its supposed to do, I can't do anything with it.  I'm certain though that someone asked a question in regard to the Filler and the developer responded something like "What is a Filler?"\nThis actually concerns me as he was the one who put the object in and he himself doesn't know?   Two thirds of the forums are literally nothing but conversations in Russian which makes us english speaking only population at a loss unless we get a broken google translation decipher.   So it does raise my concerns regarding how "user friendly" its going to be.\n\nPlease note, the main picture is of Space.  So Far I've found nothing that leads me into space and I'm not even certain if the games even developed that far.  The main picture on the Store page with the picture of Jupiter and one of its four main moons Europa.. that's the night sky spashscreen you see every night on your little chunk of island.  The bigger map may have fragments off shore, but it looks like there's no other islands off where you start.  I swam/walked for a solid 2 hours and saw nothing but ocean.  So I'm assuming its only the land you start on being the map itself.\nPersonally I would wait to see how the game develops.  Its been enjoyable so far just to build bases and try and get some sort of power grid going.  Other than that, there's really nothing else to do.  So I'd suggest holding your money until it develops further.","May 17","false","35.1"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","2"

I also hope they add underwater exploration and diving suits and harpoons, and enemies to be in the water. I wish they put in alien animals so we can use meat to help feed ourselves.

Possible not, StarsOne seems to be a attempting to differentiate itself from its competitors by the range of building and progression through the crafting and if you see the screenshots you can see how advance you can go, but you do start of with building with wood and basic iron always up to modern electric items.\n\nGraphics of the game are competent nothing that is world changing but its good enough (without floating items you seem to get in random generate worlds). Only one area that needs work is shadowing on landscapes which especially one land seem to flick in and out of existence.\n\nSurvival part of the game you need to keep health, hunger and thirst under wraps. The game has gone for a seed system for food, so as soon as you find one piece of fruit you can make trees to make more and more and more meaning this aspect of the game looks after itself. Water side of the game I had to deal with be building my base next to water and making bottles is very cheap and easy so you can care plenty of water around with you again not adding torment to the game which is not bad as the game seems to centre around crafting more then the survival.\n\nSo why you not recommending?\nThe core game play loop for me is just plain boring. I found very little need to go explore other then to find more ore for mining which seems to be about the only thing you cannot just keep building more off. The ore is just in the middle of fields you run up to it and hit it, I feel a sense of exploring to find items would help a sense of achievement to the game for me to keep me interested.\nIt takes so long to turn ore to ingot (which can be left to do on its own) also even longer to use an anvil and turn ingot into usable parts all of which you just have to twiddle your thumbs.\n\nCan multi-player save the game?\nIn its current state No, but I feel its the area that could "save" this game but the interaction between characters need to be made to offer great variety and allow people to build a world which they can almost rule, adding the human character aspects between players.\n\nIf you just love collect and craft games give it a go for early access its better then most. Has the game done enough to separate itself from the market? If you just like simple building game then yes but for survival games it lacks compare to other choices.\nhttps://youtu.be/oqoDwOdFzI8\n","April 8","false","2.5"," 46 of 88 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","46","88","2","9"

Every time I hit a wall I had to look it up which was almost every step of the way.  When I looked things up it was 50/50 if I was going to find the answer or not because the community isn't big enough (bad sign).  I also found out that once you get to a certain point of crafting (which doesn't take long) the game is pretty much over because there's nothing to do... not enough creatures, recources, or space to explore.  If they don't update this game soon to make it worth even $10 it's going to get a bad reputation and no one will ever hear of it.","May 21","false","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As it stands, if you are crafting in any device, be it an anvil or whatever, and your friend is doing the same, you will take their items from what they are doing. So if they are hammering out steel plates, their steel ingots will magically appear in your inventory and out of their anvil.","April 23","false","6.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","1"

Then, I gave it another try, and am I glad I did.  The crafting is very interesting, but a kind of <tips tool> would be very nice since it can take you quite sometime to find out  how to craft one particular item.  Another plus for this game is the fact that you will not spend most of your time running around to gather materials:  it is done fast.  It is EA but if you like crafting, building base then you should give it a try.
