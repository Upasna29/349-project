There are currently no effects (poison, lifesteal, retaliation, etc.) At its core, BoE has damage (as well as bonus damage, which is added to damage only if it's dealt), defense, and healing. Defense is subtracted from damage for each player and the net total is applied. Healing then heals any missing health. That's all there is to it.\n+ Novel and not P2W card system--gameplay works like this: The game generates a random deck of cards for you in each game, depending on skill levels and other factors. Initially, you will draw all your cards from here. At the end of a match, any cards you played get added to your "Stash". Cards in your stash can then be added to a "Collector's Deck" (which is an alternate deck you can choose to draw from during a match) or can be converted to gold (used to buy other cards). Therefore it's sometimes recommended to avoid playing a beneficial card in order to save enough energy/mana to play a rare card just so you can keep it.\n+ Some RPG-like elements. Levelling gives you stat points which you can apply to your hero in order to increase things like energy, hitpoints, regeneration, etc. This helps reduce some of the RNGsus-ness from the game as you'll have a noticeably easier time defeating certain opponents if you've applied your points in a constructive way.\n+ Nice music\n+ A developer/company rep is currently active in the forums. Currently there are only a few posts there so I don't know how long that'll last but it's always nice to see someone around and feel like you're being heard.\n\nCONS:\n- That simple gameplay feels redundant after a while and may not be appealing to more experienced TCG players.\n- Less variety than other games. In terms of playable classes, MMDoc has six factions, MtG has five, and Hearthstone has nine. This game has three, and they form sort of a rock-paper-scissors triangle. In terms of card variation, the lack of game mechanics more complicated than direct damage means practically every card either heals, adds mana, does damage, or adds defense.\n- There's very little room for strategy formation or planning. A turn consists of drawing cards (until you have five), equipping a card (an ongoing spell, if you will), playing two cards, and then discarding zero or one card. There are no permanents; most equipped cards last 4-6 turns before disappearing. Where BoE deviates from most other games is in the combat. You don't have creatures that exist on the battlefield so much as you have cards that deal damage for a turn (occasionally two or rarely three) and are then discarded. Therefore, the only real planning takes place when deciding when to play a card that lingers for more than a turn. For example, you might have a card that deals bonus damage and last two turns and another card that deals normal damage but only lasts one turn. If you don't have enough mana to play both, you'd have to play the bonus damage first (it wouldn't do anything without normal damage to add to) and play the normal damage card the next turn, at which point the bonus damage would take effect once before disappearing. That's really all there is for strategy though; the main goals in this game are keeping your health up (so your opponent can't one-hit you) and making sure you have enough cards that deal normal damage (since there's quite an abundance of cards that deal bonus damage and you never seem to have enough cards you can use them with).\n- You can only play as one class. If you'd like to try either of the other two, you need to pay real money. This is frustrating since it means you'll have to play on various guest accounts to really test out strategies and get a feel for which hero is for you.\n- Some balance issues exist\n\nOverall rating: 6.5/10, it's worth giving it a shot if you're not typically a TCG player. For the rest of us though, Battlegrounds of Eldhelm feels wanting of more complex gameplay.","October 23, 2014","true","3.7"," 68 of 83 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","68","83","0","0"

Simple game to get into, easy to pick up & put away, very beautiful hand-crafted art, not really pay2win.\n\nWho is this game for?\nIf you want to try a CCG for the first-time, or if you're a CCG player looking for something simple.\n\nWhat's good about it?\nVery easy to play for a bit then put away, simple game to get started with, beautiful graphics, it's not really p2w.\nIt is a tablet-port, but it's really not that noticeable or disruptive.\n\nHow does the game work?\nI would suggest giving the tutorial a shot. It's fairly short but gives you a good understanding of the game.\n\nEach player has an amount of energy points, these are used to play cards. Each card has a energy cost and there are cards that can affect your or your enemy's energy.\n\nEach round consists of 5 phases\nDraw phase\nEquip phase\nAttack/Defense phase\nDiscard phase\nBattlePlayers take turn playing out the phases, ie. first player goes through draw, equip, attack and discard phase, then the other player goes through draw, equip, defense and discard phase (while seeing the other players attack cards laid out). Then the battle commences.\n\nDraw phase: In this phase you draw cards from either the random deck or from your collector deck. Either player can draw from the random deck. Your hand can have at most 5 cards, and you can draw at most 3 cards at a time.\n\nEquip phase: During this phase you can use equipment cards from your deck. They give different bonuses to stats such as; +damage, +defense, -enemy energy, etc.\n\nBattle phase works as follows; the damage, defense and healing of each players cards are summed up, then the reduce damage, reduce defense, etc. of each players cards are subtracted, and what's left is the damage caused to each player.\n\nWhen a match is over, the cards that you've played from the random deck are added to your card stash and then you can choose to transfer them to your collector deck. This is one way to acquire cards.\n\nSimple enough, right?\n\nCharacter creation\nWhen you start playing the game you get to create a character by choosing one of the three races; human, orc or elf.\nHumans have two classes to choose from; knight and rogue.\nOrcs only have one class; warrior.\nElves have two classes to choose from; archer and mage.\nYour race/class choice affects your characters stats and there are some cards that can only be used by specific classes.\nThen you choose between a few alternatives to configure the appearance of your portrait.\n\nEventually your character will level up, and your character stats increase.\n\nSimplicity\nThis is a very simple CCG; but what does that mean?\nIt is a game that is very easy to learn and the matches do not take a lot of time to play out.\nCards are easy to understand; cards either affect damage, defense, health or energy. There are a few special card effects like bleed and poison.\nThe only real difference between cards are the energy points they cost to play and the amount they affect a stat.\n\nSingleplayer\nThere is a singleplayer campaign that you can play through and after that there are daily quests and some sidequests too.\nIf you're bored just playing against AI, you can throw yourself into the\n\nMultiplayer\nThere are a few different multiplayer modes to try out; Arena, Challenge, Slay the Beast\nArena Your opponent is chosen at random. You will use only a special random deck! You will have to complete 5 arena or challenge matches to get ranked, then you will start gaining score points.\nChallenge You will have to invite your opponent from a lobby. You will have to complete 5 arena or challenge matches to get ranked, then you will start gaining score points.\nSlay the Beast Players fight simultaneously against a very powerful boss-like enemy. The ones who survive and those who injure the beast the most will get a rich reward.","December 29, 2014","true","3.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

You will realise eventually that it revolves around 9 mythical cards for each character class (plus minus a couple of epic/elite cards). These cards are extremely rare and you can either hit it by luck or try a gambling game that costs you gold. While it may appear to be free-to-play good model, this is truly applicable until you cross level60 onwards, when the main "Mentality" skill kicks in.\n\nMentality is the single game changer skill in this (yet again, overly simplistic) game. It allows you to pack 4 of the same cards, and of course - must be the mythical cards, so Mentality+1 gives allowance for 4, Mentality+2 gives allowance for 5, and so on...until Mentality+5. Mentality skill is extremely expensive, not to mention all the gold you have to gamble to get a chance to win a mythical card. So this is the way how the game evolves into higher level as time goes on and if you want to win any fights soon enough, you will have to buy gold with real money, grinding well you can take forever.\n\nThere are no player base to speak of in this game, which is not surprising when I find out the facts. All the ranking leaderboards you see are in the past created by all these multiple accounts, some of them the same users still sticking around with their main "prime" high level heroes. The developer himself knows as guilty as himself can be as he discriminately allows those who support him by virtue of those developing higher level heroes (>70, 80,90 level), while he ban/suspend those accounts in the mid-levels(level 30-60) if they are around for too long, since it doesn't fit into "his gameplan".\n\nSo enjoy a simple game if you can and start from beginning until you near level60. Observe carefully the skill tree - look at mainly the 3 skills: Mentality, Tactics, and Tactics Mastery. The amount of gold it costs. You will understand what I mean. Do not use real cash to purchase credits(which are used to buy gold) into your account. This guy will indiscriminately ban you and you lose access to your entire account.","April 23","false","0.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The cards in the random stack is based on your race and class. You can keep cards (only ones you have used) in a seperate stack of cards to be used in battle along side the random stack, so you can keep all your most powerful cards at hand when you really need them.\n\nYour actual hero is customizable every time you level up - life regen, more energy, or hitpoints, etc. Furthermore, later on you can train your hero skills that effect the battle in certain ways. These, as far as I can tell, can all be done without paying any money. A booster pack of new cards cost 1,500 gold. You can earn about 2,000 gold free every day from daily missions, not including any dueling or campaign mission rewards.\n\n\nSo far, I would totally recommend this game over any other TCG I've played.\nThe ONLY downside that I've noticed is the actual user-interface and menu navigation is sometimes confusing.

You don't really have to strain your brain on this one, game requires very minimal thinking due to the lack of card effects, but more so on that later.\n\nOnce you beat the tutorial you'll have to create a character (you have to pay real money if you want to have more then one character). You can pick between 3 different races (Orcs, Humans, Elves). Orcs have only one class which is Warrior, Humans have Knight and Rogue while Elves have Archer and Mage. Each class has different stats and different class-specific cards it can use.\n\nThe main problem in this game is the previously mentioned lack of complexity. Pretty much all cards will do one of the following: Deal damage to enemy, Increase your defense, Decrease enemy defense, Heal you, Increase your energy (mana),  Decrease enemy damage. The only difference between those cards is the energy cost and the numeric value of their effect and the fact that some of them will do multiple of those effects. Due to that there's very minimal amount of strategy and thinking involved with this game.\n\nIn the match, you'll have Random Deck and Collector Deck. You can draw cards from either of them during the Draw Phase. Once the match is over the cards that you used from Random Deck are added to your Stash and you can then transfer cards from Stash to your Collector Deck. You can only have 10 cards in your collector deck when your character is level one, but you gain more slots in collector deck as you level your character up.\n\nWhen your character levels up you can increase his HP, Energy, Regeneration (heal per turn), Might (extra damage) or Resistance (extra defense). This is an interesting feature, but if you get matched against enemy who's level is higher then yours you'll be at disadvantage (I haven't played enough to know how good is their match making system).\n\nNow would I recommend this game? I don't know really. I wish the game had more complexity to it but maybe it will have in the future. I'd say if you're a fan of CCG's or are interested in them and what you've read in this review didn't make you not want to ever try this game, then do give it a try. After all it's free and only about 100 MB to download so if nothing else it's worth giving a try. Just do keep in mind you're likely to find it boring if you're not into casual games.","October 25, 2014","true","2.6"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

It merges the two amazingly well.\n\nI love it that you can play a match wihout creating an account, so you are really free to decide if you like it or not, and then take the next step. The tutorial is helpful, the game can be understood easily. It is a bit overwhelming, but after you realize that you can level up faster by playing some multiplayer games (even if you lose, you get lots of XP), you can get the Energy Points required to make strategic, in-depth moves, even with the limited collection and play area you have.\n\nI absolutely love the level up system, basically you decide how you want to play the game. Would you like more Health or more Energy? Do you want to expand your Hand or make your Buff area bigger? Do you want to get more gold and XP for each win? Or are you going for a huge Collector's Deck? You decide.\nThe card art is very nice, and the multiple combos you can pull with almost all cards is an excellent idea. You can turn any weak attack into some serious pain with the combos, which makes it so that no card is really worthless.\n\nCollecting cards is really easy, you don't have to buy any packs. You just play the game, and as you draw cards, you always get to keep the ones you played. These cards go into your Stash, out of which you can pick multiple ones and put them in your Collector Deck, which will accompany you on future matches. It also makes you think more strategically in the beginning, as well: do you want to play your regular cards for a guaranteed effect, or do you want to spend more Energy on playing that Rare/Elite/Epic card you pulled, so you can add it to your collection?\n\nAll in all, it's a very good game with a somewhat dwindling population (sadly), but I was able to find human opponents whenever I really wanted to. Even if you can't/don't want to, there's a nice Campaign and Quest mode, where you can just play and collect cards.","February 25, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a bit grindy, but the game itself is fun enough to keep you playing.  I consider it to be one of the better free to play games.\nYou can choose between 3 classes and each class has its own subclasses.  There are elves, orcs, and humans to choose from and each have their own special ability card to use in battle.  You can have more than one character, but you have to pay real money for extra character slots.\nTo advance in the game, you need to complete bounty hunts or campaign missions.  Upon completion you get a good amount of gold and skill points.  These missions can take a while to finish, however.\n\nAt the moment my Elf Keeper is level 29.  The game is fun, but can be very challenging.  There are times when matches seem like a neverending stalemate.  It has come to the point where I completely surrender to Orcs because they are extremely powerful.  There are times when I try to fight them, but I get their health down half-way only for them to one-shot me.\n\nI tried multiplayer once, but i couldn't stand waiting for my opponent's decision.  i will probably never do it again.\n\nOverall, i DO recommend this game.  It is free, simple (takes a bit to grasp at first), fun, and it takes only a minute to download.  You can also play it for free on the phone, and fortunately your account carries over.  Although it is a bit slow on the phone, it works just as well.","February 7, 2015","true","37.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not to mention that the instructions for playing weren't very helpful, as I had to figure out most of it myself, besides how to move the cards. Not to mention that the starter decks were horrid and the campaign mode was pointless.

I like the actual gameplay, it's just the meta-game that isn't very fun. Two things that come to mind are how you have to grind losses to level and have little control over gameplay since you unlock cards depending on how you play. By this I mean that you gain cards by playing them, so gameplay really just consists of stonewalling the enemy to prolong the game so that you might get lucky and draw a new card and then you essentially have no choice but to play it. That means gameplay follows the lines of the real-life card game "War". You just draw cards and play them without making decisions.\n\nAnother issue is that combos are a pain to look up. I'd like to see if I have any combos in my hand without going through 3 dialogues for each and every card. Are we just supposed to remember them?\n\nAs it is, I can't recommend it, but with some changes outside of gameplay it could be a good game.","March 14, 2015","false","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Having a randomized deck has been a great way to learn the gameplay without stress of building a deck. Although I am not certain, it does seem like eventually you will craft your own decks. I have only played a few hours in campaign mode, and there is PvP and other options to explore.\n\n@11 hours:\nI really am enjoying this game. I would highly recommended checking out the the manual and forum help section, as some aspects of the game are not immediately obvious. Honestly, the in-game tutorial should have been much more thorough, but I love this game too much to care. I am at hero level 12, and now I feel like the game is starting to demonstrate its complexity and uniqueness. As you level up, you gain skills, hand slots, mana, etc. which makes it a lot more dynamic. Another player mentioned in his review that this game is simpler than Hearthstone, with which I would disagree. Heartstone is simplified in many regards, such as mana control and diversity of abilities. Battlegrounds at it's core is spell-based rather than minion-based, and in addition to the basic spells (attack, bonus attack, parry, shield, and heal), there are also spells that incorporate the buff area, play area, and discard area. Since my first comments, I have now played Arena mode, which is PvP with a randomized deck. I really enjoy this mode, and I definitely recommend for others to play a couple matches even if their hero is at a low level as the experience rewards are large.","November 3, 2014","true","15.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Now every time i successfully had a nice combo where i can do some decent damage, every single time the computer some how would get back to back damage prevention cards then back to back healing, and would keep my energy down almost every 2 turns (need energy to use cards.)  and when i finally got some healing cards it would what seems every time would get healing prevention cards.  Now i know this sounds like im being a poor sport or w/e but it happened none stop so dont know if game tries to annoy you to try get you to go buy more powerful items or something but it just made me not wanna play but hey its free game so give a try if you like getting punished, but then again could just be me being extra unlucky.","November 3, 2014","false","2.6"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","2","14","0","0"

No gimmicks. F2W not p2w.\n-The game has it's complexity in the combat phase than Magic the Gathering, although MTG is more diversify in the overall playing field.\n-Intriguing gameplay, Balanced and in game complexity brings you into the world of True TCG like Magic the Gathering\n-Fantastic soundtrack that brings you into such fantasy world.\n\n\nI only write reviews that a game deserve it. And this game deserves this recognition. Look no to other tcg Free or mobile card games where only bloodsucking developers trying to leech every ounce of your money away. Those unbalanced gameplay where only one card rules it all and only suit to kiddy gameplay. I have played many other tcg games out there and none is as good as MTG and none is as close as MTG experience.\n\n\nNow, Battlegrounds of Eldhelm is for you if you are a tcg lover and i am pretty sure MTG players will love this. The complexity level is pretty much intense than MTG in terms of combat phase but MTG is more diverse in the overall gameplay experience.\n\nBattlegrounds of Eldhelm is a tcg in it's own right. It brings out the goodness in it but contrast to what magic can offer.\n\nCalling all MTG avid players and MTG lovers to try this game. You will love it as much as i do.\n\n:)","May 7, 2015","true","233.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
