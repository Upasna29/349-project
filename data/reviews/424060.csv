I say semi-roguelike because the game shuffles tiles around, but the tiles themselves are the same, just moved around sometimes. The randomness can be unforgiving, especially due to the fact that one of the primary gameplay elements is stealthing around wandering enemies. Many times I would enter a room and be immediately spotted, often starting combat due to not wanting to lose my precious food. The enemies are also fairly repetative, with overworld sprites often indicating the type of encounter you will have, ie: if there's only one person and its one of the other possible playable characters, you can recruit them.\n\nAll in all, a pretty neat, short, punishing game. And I do love that this is not early access or anything like that.\n\nWhy do I not reccomend this? The game is extremely mechanics heavy, with no real narative or mystery to really move it along, but the mechanics are fairly boring, with not a lot of strategy in combat or while sneak-looting. The randomness doesn't really add a sense of freshness on every replay, but instead a rather large ammount of arbitraty success. I would die on a first combat encounter because the only loot I found was food and no better equipment. The next go-around I could find a revolver and ammo in the first container I looked in. There is no real curve of progression, since character traits are decided at the beggining of the game.\n\nI also encountered several game breaking movement bugs that made me restart because I had gotten randomly frozen in place and could no longer move my character, resulting in being seen and dying or needing a straight restart.\n\nThis is barely a not reccomend, and mostly because of the bugs. I totally get that there will be bugs, but the ones that break the game just ruin the experience for me.\n\nEdit//\nI love the support from the developer wanting to fix the bugs. Its great to see people fixing stuff after it realeases. I'm gonna play some more and see if the game draws me a bit more","December 11, 2015","false","1.7"," 66 of 70 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","66","70","3","12"

It is, however, broken in a lot of ways. The dialogue and text sound, at times, as if they were written by someone who's first language wasn't english, ie. "Oh thank god! I thought I was goner!".\nThe textures sometimes fault, and if you try to skip the pre-conflict dialogue by clicking, sometimes it will freeze the game and render everything unclickable. Your character stands against no enemy models, just hovering hitpoints.\nThe game also occasionally just freezes. Sometimes you can still walk around but doors are unusable or things are unclickable. (NOTE: I believe the game is still being patched for bugs).\n\nAnother mechanic I don't understand is sometimes if you are caught trying to steal from humans, you enter battle with them...but they're zombies now. As opposed to being normal, talking people just before.\nThe game requires you to collect "Essences" to purchase extra trait points in game...however one of them seems entirely unaccessible. This could just be me being bad at the game, but I can't find a single way to get to it.\n\nThe game throws you into the muck with only a knife, and due to the random spawning you're sometimes immediately thrown up against a gang of up to 4 people, often with guns and armor. It is a cumbersome experience to set up your character, click through the opening dialogue, and have to loot your apartment, only to die instantly and have to do it all again.\n\nThere is also no map so it is extremely easy to get lost. Not sure if this is a flaw or just a function put in to emphasize the chaos and confusion.\n\nThat all being said, this is a charming and very engaging game. The pixel art is beautifully done, vibrant, bright, and spooky. The game mechanics are very well sketched out, despite the few minor flaws. The combat is quick to learn and either very rewarding, or very stressful (which is good, it's meant to be!). I sat down and played half of the game, then decided I enjoyed it so much I wanted it to last...however I went back to it not two hours later and completed it. It is UNBELIEVABLY satisfying to beat objectives. I still intend to play more of this game, because it's so exciting to discover all the little nooks and crannies and rooms and items. I fully recommend and really like this game. Please buy it and support the creators in (hopefully) future endeavors!!! <3","December 13, 2015","true","7.2"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","6"

You'll have to manage hunger, tiredness and sanity levels as you go by scavenging food, securing safe places of rest and tracking down Red Pills to keep your madness in check. Failure to do so will cause parades of powerful monsters to begin appearing all over the map, an event that even the most well-armed party may struggle to deal with.\n\nTHE GLOW's semi-randomized map and item generation is both the source of its replay value and its biggest frustrations. In one game, you may well be armed to the teeth within a minute or two. In another, you'll be stranded in a map surrounded by enemies, wielding nothing but a knife that might as well be a rubber chicken for all the good it's going to do you. Guns are king in THE GLOW. The first two rounds of the combat system are exclusively for ranged weapons, meaning that by the time you have an opportunity to show off your close-quarters prowess, you're clinging miserably to the hinges of death's door anyway.\n\nThere are some that will grow immediately aggravated with the patience needed to navigate this kind of merciless food chain but I found the process of building up an armoury and a trio of allies before wreaking revenge on my oppressors, who had bullied me for food and forced me to skulk through the alleys like a rat, immensely satisfying.\n\nIt lacks polish, plot and any sort of serious direction but the core gameplay is enough to put it over the top for a recommendation from me. Definitely one to build on.\n\nFull review here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fbPKTw_RQM","December 13, 2015","true","4.4"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","14","24","5","0"

One occurance happened, while in combat, for some reason my character kept skipping turns causing death and ultimatly a restart. regardless of that one occurance i enjoy the title. Below i linked a playthrough of the first mission to show a demo of the game for anyone who wants a little content before purchase.","December 10, 2015","true","0.7"," 13 of 34 people (38%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","38","13","34","5","0"
