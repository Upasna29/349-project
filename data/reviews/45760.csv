It is a very hard game. A few hundred hours is the basic learning curve for essentially being a beginner. That being said even for people not planning on being competitive there's a lot of content just in the combo system. It's satisfying working towards just doing combos in themselves or eventually beating your first opponent online. That being said, this is where the true nature of this game comes out.\n\nUSF4 Is a game of competition and self-discipline. This game will appeal to yourself if you always strive to improve. There will be an unlimited amount of times you will frustrated and convinced you hit a brick wall. This game is about gradual improvement, a constant cycle of finding new plateaus and satisfaction of overcoming them with practice, hard work and intellect. This is a personal game, you shoulder all the blame for losing in a competitive setting. If you are prone to rage-quitting then this game will quickly be deleted from your hard drive in anger.\n\nPushing past this however, you see the evolution of play and how you express your personality and play style as well as who you are playing against. It's oddly intimate in that you can recognize someone solely based on their movements, actions and decisions. In every game it is you against another person, another individual wanting to get better and improve, wanting to learn from you as you learn from them. This is the addicting part of USF4 and Fighting games in general, your best friends are always your enemies and you push each other constantly. Nobody will ever truly be satisfied in being "good enough", and that's all the reason you'll ever need.\n\nEconomically speaking it's the best ratio of purchase price to play time I've ever had and will probably ever have. Something like less than 2 cents per hour? Highly recommended. 10/10\n","November 24, 2015","true","627.9"," 238 of 253 people (94%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","94","238","253","15","14"

Will teach fundamentals through play and the abundant tutorials on the internet.\n\nCons:\n- Single-player modes are lacking; arcade mode has terrible A.I. and the challenges aren't fun.\n- The game itself does not provide instruction to newer players.\n- No theatre mode for the animated clips from Arcade Mode.\n\nNeutral Points:\n- There will be a learning curve; it is a fighting game afterall. If you are a new player then you will be terrible for a while.\n- Input leniency allows newer players to perform special moves more easily but can become an annoyance at higher level play.\n- There is a comeback factor for newer players (Ultra) which becomes a tool at higher level play.\n- The plot is barebones, but hey, that's a norm for fighting games.","April 7, 2015","true","456.2"," 225 of 258 people (87%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","87","225","258","17","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vjvswan/recommended/45760/","vjvswan","VJVswan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vjvswan/","147 products in account","Online has been patched. It was an issue on Steam's end, and now many problems have been fixed. Reviews before March 2015 lamenting online play might be outdated. Online isn’t perfect but it is definitely playable (and better than Netherrealm fighters at least).\n\nIn my opinion this is one of the best fighting games on Steam. If you want a deep and competitive game or just want to jump into the genre, this is a great title to pick up, especially with EVO right around the corner.\n\n+Diverse roster of 44 playable characters\n+All classic SF2 world warriors (Guile, Sagat, Cammy, Akuma, etc.)\n+Good mix of SF Alpha and SFIII characters (No Alex or Q though)\n+Wide range of controller support\n+Very balanced. Every character is viable in the right hands.\n+Good soundtrack (Character themes aren't nearly as good as in SFIII: 3rd Strike though)\n+Useful training mode with attack data, input display, dummy recording, and even 2 player online training\n+Matches can get pretty hype\n+Runs well on PC (80 fps on an AMD 7770)\n+Solid netcode. Again, not perfect (unless you live in Japan) but most matches are smooth.\n+Lots of colors and costumes (everyone has at least 3-4 costumes and ~12 colors)\n+New unique Focus Attack system.\n+Extensive Trial mode gives a fun way to burn time if you want a challenge\n+Interesting Japanese ink brush art style with great 3D visuals (sort of prefer the old 2D sprites though). Fireballs look beautiful.\n+Online community is still active\n-V-Sync causes input lag\n-New Revenge Meter is built up by taking damage. At 50% you can do an Ultra combo. This feels like it rewards bad play and makes comebacks more common and less exciting.\n-Ubiquitous 1 frame link combos. These are much more punishable on a missed link due to the large reversal window, allowing players to mash out a dragon punch if you mistime your inputs\n-Typical cheap arcade fighting game A.I. with psychic reaction time. Final boss in arcade mode is cheap as hell\n-3 joke characters. Dan is funny, but Rufus was unnecessary, and El Fuerte should be removed entirely.\n-Character Select starts 1P at Juri and 2P at Hakan. Why not Ryu and Ken?\n-Did I mention El Fuerte?\n\nWith USF4 what you get is a well polished, balanced, and deep fighter. What makes this game enjoyable to me is the high skill ceiling; every time I play I have the opportunity to improve my ability. Heck, even with the amount of hours I've put in I still kinda suck. Much of my playtime consists of playing in private lobbies with friends, which is always a blast. While Street Fighter may seem technically daunting, I definitely recommend it to those looking to get into the fighting game genre. A learning curve is definitely present, but the fundamentals you pick up from playing this will carry on to other fighters. This is also currently the most played fighting game in the tournament  scene, so those with a competitive drive should be satisfied. Whether you’re familiar with fighters or are a total newcomer, I recommend picking up Ultra Street Fighter IV on PC.","July 11, 2015","true","504.7"," 156 of 174 people (90%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","90","156","174","13","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shatterwaltz/recommended/45760/","Shatterwaltz","Ibitsu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shatterwaltz/","257 products in account","Title: Super Street Fighter® IV Arcade Edition makes for a very intriguing title. It contains one of those fancy circle Rs which probably stand for something legal, so you don't have to worry about any legal issues when you fire it up. Title has you covered.\nThis game is also rather super, as every single character without exception has a super move that can be activated when you have a full super meter. Each character also has Ultra combos, although the title will not reflect that until an upcoming change in 2014.\nStreet Fighter IV is the defining Street Fighter of this generation, with over four street fighters to street fight as. Furthermore, this is the arcade edition. Arcades are known for many things, but I don't actually know what any of those are. I remember that I never wanted to play in them that much because I'd have to pay every time I wanted to try again, which would be extremely frequent. I'm terrible at this. Fortunately, you do not have to buy a respawn DLC, even though this is the Arcade Edition.\n\nGraphics: The game comes with graphics, many of which are even 3d. The camera does fancy spinning flying things when you do ultra combos, and while that may not be related to graphics, I feel that is a very huge selling point as there is no better way to emphasize just how hard you punched that little casual in his filthy jaw. There are also fancy effects you can put on the characters that make a subtle but noticeable difference I can't put my finger on because my monitor does not have a touch screen.\nAt any rate, the answer to "Does Super Street Fighter® IV Arcade Edition have graphics?" would be a resounding "Yes!"\n\nGameplay: As you might expect, Super Street Fighter® IV Arcade Edition does indeed have gameplay. As games go, I would call it very good gameplay. Combos are hard as verdammt to pull off and I have yet to actually do one in a real match, although I most definitely can show that training dummy (His name is Dan :) who is the boss of 10 hit combos by nailing him in the face with one. Inputs are pretty typical for fighter games, with the stick being used to make complicated motions really fast and my xbox controller probably isn't the best for this. If you like your circles being quartered forwards, then Super Street Fighter® IV Arcade Edition is for you.\nAs mentioned previously, it does have more than four characters, and some would even go as far as to say maybe more than twenty. Some people would say more than forty, but I am not positive that they are very proficient at counting.\nSuper Street Fighter® IV Arcade Edition also comes with the internet! The internet is very well beloved by many people, and in Super Street Fighter® IV Arcade Edition, the internet is as fast and fluid as ever. There is very little lag and I often feel like I am losing to a real person sitting right next to me! I once even tried to unplug their controller, but ended up getting my power cable instead because they weren't actually next to me. It just FELT like they were, because the entcode* is so good.\n\nSound: The characters are voiced and say things like "I will win" or "You will lose". They also deliver classic lines like "Do you want to take this outside... ON THE STREET?!" punches and kicks also sound very much like punches and kicks, although they may arguably sound more like someone clubbing a baby seal. I am rather fond of the neat "whump" noise it makes when a hit connects.\nCharacters can also be made to speak in Japanese instead, because dubs are ABSOLUTELY terrible in anything where they should be speaking in Japanese. Juri even laughs better in Japanese. Do her backwards grab and tell me I'm wrong.\n\n\n\nTitle: 6/10 + 2 for legal coverage and impending updates to address present concerns (Is not marked as Ultra)\nGraphics: 8/10 + 1 for subtle touch screen effects (I would rank it a bit higher but Juri's neck looks weird. Tell me I'm wrong.)\nGameplay: 8/9\nSound: 5/10 + 6 for being able to listen in authentic Japanese with real and true-to-life subtitles.\n__________\nOverall: 9/9.75 I just averaged all the scores and the maximum points for each category and got this, I don't really know if it's accurate or not.\n\n\n*Haha, I meant to type netcode. "Don't be so hasty to point out typos, you stupid hobbit!"- a real ent playing Super Street Fighter® IV Arcade Edition\n","December 15, 2013","true","150.4"," 192 of 242 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","192","242","0","14"

Not only the character roster great, comprised of 30+ old and new fighters from the series to date, but so is the sophisticated combo system that is both easy to pick up yet difficult to master.  I wasn’t particularly a fan of SF4’s visual style and initially reluctant to try the game because of it, yet I’ve grown to appreciate the unique look and feel of each characters and stages that the developers faithfully recreated in this title.\n\nLike many similar games in the genre, SSF4 was initially released on console systems and then ported over to PC.  Luckily, the developer Capcom has done an amazing job, implementing number of customization options for PC, such as support for greater than 30fps and multiple resolutions including 1080p.  In addition, the game also supports many controllers out of the box including XBOX 360 controller and numerous fightsticks.  Outside of Games for Windows Live, game runs smoothly and the loading time is relatively short, so there isn’t much for me to complain about this quality port.\n\nAlthough brief single player portion of the game is quite good, the multiplayer is where this game truly shines.  Thanks to its improved netcode, finding multiplayer matches are quick and reliable.  Built-in match setups work consistently for the most part and despite it missing my favorite “championship mode” from a previous title, both ranked and endless mode keep the game interesting and fun.  I really like the replay / save feature as well, which helped me to capture and savor those favorite character match ups over the years.\n\nSuper Street Fighter 4 definitely isn’t perfect and the game isn’t groundbreaking enough to likely persuade those of you who aren’t interested in fighting games.  If you hold even a little preference over the genre though, this is good as any place to start.  I wholeheartedly recommend this to both casual onlookers and fighting game fans.","July 17, 2013","true","020.8"," 63 of 80 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","63","80","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/45760/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Ultra Steet Fighter IV is an update for the original Street Fighter IV which was released in 2008. Believe it or not, but this was my first experience with the Street Fighter franchise.  This game is a standalone product too, allowing you to just purchase this definitive edition.\n\nThis update brings the total number of playable characters up to forty four - each of the characters also has a different version of them selves, meaning you have in effect eighty eighty different characters to play as. Street Fighter IV has one of the best combo systems I have played with, much better than the combo system in Mortal Kombat X to say the least. You can easily view the combos for your character on the pause menu, meaning you can learn them on the fly,\n\nThe graphics are really quite nice too, it shows a cartoony style art much like the previous games, but with a more polished and finished look to it. All of the special moves and combos each have their own animation, as well as special effects, making this a really good looking game to look at whilst spectating.\n\nEach of the characters in Ultra Street Fighter have their own story line, so with 44 different characters, that is a lot of story to include! I was quite surprised at this amount given the very linear style of fighting games I have played in the past. Obviously some of the stories are more in depth than others, but each of them give you a good amount of content to see.\n\nI only managed to play this game on Easy mode, and even then, on some of the latter stages to the arcade mode, I was struggling. I would hate to see how devastatingly hard the normal and hard modes are, because I was having to retry plenty of times before being able to beat some stages. That being said, this is the sort of game that you will just get better at with practice, you won't be pulling off massive combos to start with (unless you are highly experienced with this genre) so it will take some time before getting right up to speed.\n\nI have completed four characters arcade mode, meaning I have another forty left to go, this has taken me just over two hours to do, so there is a heck of a lot of content on show here, and that is just the single player. Ultra Street Fighter also has a local and online multiplayer too which will really wrack up your hours with ease.\n\nI had one technical issue whilst playing, I for the life of me could not get the game to run in 1920 x 1080 AND full-screen. Not sure whether this is intentional of a bug with my game. It runs fine in that resolution and windows mode though. That being said, you probably won't notice it too much given the amount of time you actually get to look at anything else whilst playing.\n\nI can easily recommend Ultra Street Fighter IV, even though this was my first experience with the Street Fighter franchise, it really does a good job of introducing you to this style of game and giving you hours and hours of content too. To buy this game from scratch, the £22,99 price tag is easily justified with the quality and quantity of gameplay on offer.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

My favourite way of playing online is to activate in single player the 'fighter request' option, so you can practice with any character against the cpu, honing your skills while you 'receive' requests to fight some real people.\n\nLast but not least, I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone interested in the game to buy a fighting stick, it is essential to master the game.

But gradually over the years I always saw the pros and wonder if I can compete at their same level. Quite honestly anything is possible.. Except in a fighting game you don't rely on what level you are, or what kind of stats and skills determine the outcome of your character. It all boils down to memorization, muscle memory, adaptation. Honestly, the entire point of Street Fighter is the interesting aspect of the mind games between 2 players. It has the ruggedness of not a multiplayer game but some odd form of chess/board game appeal. As I played dozens of hours of this game I seem to realize it really does have a chess-like learning curve to all of these characters. As long as you put forth the effort into learning patterns and the characters mechanics (strength/weakness) and overcome all the mistakes you've been making as a casual player, this is a very rewarding game. Anyways, All I'm saying is if you're looking for a worthwhile fighting game I suggest you pick this up strictly to learn the fundamentals until Street Fighter V comes out. Also, Online play is very habitable. Pick it up before V comes out I promise you.. You won't regret it.","August 4, 2015","true","101.9"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/45760/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","From an outsider's perspective, the differences between Street Fighter 4 and its three existing sequels must look marginal at best. The first game made its console debut back in 2009 and helped revitalise the fighting game genre. Super Street Fighter 4 surfaced a year later and added 10 new characters to the roster, but since then, the game-to-game differences have been tailored more towards the dedicated fans. Ultra Street Fighter 4 continues this tradition with five new characters, a trio of fundamental system changes and not so much as a story mode in sight.\n\nIf you're not the kind of player who spends hours learning combos in the training room, discusses the finer points of character match-ups on a regular basis and stays up till the crack of dawn watching the Top 8 duke it out at the yearly Evolution Championship Series, then the Street Fighter 4 series' consistent lack of single-player content will be a tough pill to swallow. But for those who view Street Fighter as a competitive fighting game that only truly makes sense when two minds are trying to outsmart each other, then Ultra can be seen as both curtain call from Capcom and the most substantial sequel since Super.\n\nOf the new talent, Poison stands out as the easiest to get to grips with. Her lingering fireball and feet-first dragon punch mean she shares some shoto fundamentals with Ryu and Ken, but when you also consider her Rekka-like whip special and her command grab Ultra, it's clear that Poison isn't as orthodox as she initially seems. The larger than life Hugo, on the other hand, is about as heavy-handed as a grappler gets. His normal attacks have extremely limited combo potential, but if you can close the distance and land his wall-bouncing command grab, you can inflict severe damage.\n\nNew girl Decapre can combo into her air throw from her launcher. She can also use the new EX Red Focus to land an Ultra off her Rapid Dagger special.\nIf the fighting styles of a pink-haired cross-dresser and a gigantic wrestling simpleton don't sound like your thing, then the other new characters offer something a bit more technical. Elena returns from the Street Fighter 3 series with two far-reaching overhead attacks (must be blocked standing) and one frighteningly quick overhead special that can combo into respectable damage. In comparison, Rolento is more of a hit-and-run-style character with excellent mobility and lots of long-range pokes. He can quickly get out of trouble with his EX roll and his Pariot Sweeper Ultra will combo off anything stronger than a sneeze.\n\nThe last character on the guest list stands out for two reasons. Firstly, she wasn't previously playable in Street Fighter X Tekken or any other fighting game; secondly, she's the first new charge character to grace Street Fighter in what seems like forever. Indeed, Decapre may look like just another Shadaloo Doll with similar moves to Cammy, but once you actually take her bladed gauntlets out for a spin, you'll realise that she's fundamentally different. Her variable dash can be cancelled into her slide, dive kick, launcher or even one of two baits, and while most characters tend to have one standout Ultra, Decapre benefits from two.\n\nChoosing which Ultra to incorporate into your game plan has been a core feature of Street Fighter 4 since Super, and now with the advent of the Ultra Combo Double system, you have the option to take both at the cost of raw damage output. Other additions to the core mechanics include the Delay Stand and Red Focus. The former prolongs the time it takes for your character to rise after a hard knockdown and is useful for escaping vortex pressure from the likes of Akuma, Cammy and Ibuki, while the latter lets you absorb any amount of hits in addition to giving just about every character a viable way to combo into their Ultra.\n\nSix new stages have made the journey from Street Fighter X Tekken. That should decrease the odds of getting Volcanic Rim on random.\nThe fact that there's no way to elegantly highlight the impact of these changes without dipping into fighting game terminology just reinforces who Ultra is aimed at. The same is true of the extensive list of frame data tweaks that have been applied to the existing cast of 39. Evil Ryu has more health, Yun's EX lunge punch is (once again) advantageous on block and dragon punches are no longer safe after focus cancelling forwards. This might not mean a lot to casual players, but if you've invested the time with any one of these characters, then the chance to fight with a heavily revised set of rules is an offer that's hard to refuse.\n\nThere's no way of knowing where Ultra will take the competitive scene or how much the changes will affect the overall balancing, but if you feel like going back to the series' roots to see how much damage Vanilla Sagat could achieve off a simple Tiger Uppercut FADC into Ultra (it's over 600), then the new Edition Select has you covered. This isn't the first time that Capcom has put all past versions of each character into one game, but its inclusion suggests that this will be the last chapter in the Street Fighter 4 saga. Plus, there's nothing like picking the definitive version of your character when you're trying to prove a point.\n\nDespite boasting a thriving community that streams regular tournaments and keeps the online competition flowing day and night, the Street Fighter 4 series has always been somewhat lacking when it comes to useful features. Ultra helps to remedy this with the option to record your matches while playing offline and change your button configuration while on the character select screen. Better yet, the Training mode has been expanded with a network simulation tool that lets you mimic input latency and a save state feature that makes practising your setups less time-consuming.\n\nPoison's Ultras basically boil down to a kick in the crotch or a whip-assisted assault on the buttocks. Tough choice…\nThe only feature I couldn't find was a way to reduce Elena's health so I could test out her Healing Ultra, but that's a minor grievance. On the flipside, the new Online Training mode lets you practise against another player without health bar limitations. There's also a revised Team Battle mode that pits two teams of three against each other with a shared health bar that carries over between matches. It feels a bit gimmicky when weighed against the other new features, but at least Capcom has added something that isn't focused purely on the one-on-one experience.\n\nTaken as a package, Ultra is an easy recommendation for players who view Street Fighter as a sport. It offers highly refined gameplay married with a rich art style, and by acknowledging fan feedback in an effort to make a well-rounded game even more polished, Ultra feels like the work of a developer that's content to please its core audience rather than trying to grab everyone else's attention. That's rare, especially from a studio that was responsible for Resident Evil 6.\n\nThe only thing that holds this sequel back is the sense that it was made on a fairly tight budget. It's the little things, like the meagre choice of "new" characters and the way that some of the new Ultra animations lack the dramatic flair of their predecessors. But with the development team's passion taking up most of the slack, £11.99 for the digital upgrade feels like a fair price. It's not the Street Fighter 5 that we've all been hankering for, but as the fifth (and reportedly final) version of Street Fighter 4, Ultra is an ultimate end in more ways than one.\n\n9 / 10\n\n","May 14, 2015","true","14.8"," 34 of 50 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","34","50","0","0"

Too many characters to choose from. I noticed the Easiest setting is truly easy now compared to Street Fighter IV which I own on disk. Cloud syncing at the moment is really slow , but it's nice to know the developer had its fan base in mind and ported this game over to Steam Works so we would not lose our investments.

A simple game always goes more than his simple mechanics, that is the moment when you realize it, this is not a simple fighting game, this is not easy, this is so hard if you want to play the game in a high level skill. Because a high level skill is not about to do the largest combo, is about to know what your enemy is going to do. So basicaly if the game is simple, easy to do combos and the options that you can do or make, that actually mean that everyone could do what the mechanics let you to do because they are really simple. Then the important is not about to be good with your controller pad or arcade stick, the important is about to read your opponent: in what he is good, in what he is not, what he is blocking, what he does not block, what are the advantage of your character against the opponent's character, what are his common reactions, what are his common reversals or counter hits, when he is going to do a special move, when he is not going to a special move (DP).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/45760/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Yes, having a bunch of different clothes variants is amazing but doesn't shadow the fact Street Fighter is a pretty good game.\n\nI first picked this game up with huge anticipation. I've seen the tournaments, I've watched the Pure Pwnage episode on this, and I've played Street Fighter 2 The World Warrior back in 94' like it was Call of Duty to these kids today. To say at first, I was a little disappointed. However, with a bit of practice and exposure to unique combos and moves, I became immersed. Besides the regular arcade/world tour mode, the game also features a challenge option for you to try out and test every characters combos and special moves. This is extremely helpful to new players in learning how the game mechanics work. At first it seems impossible to do anything super or ultra combos, especially with all the joystick or d-pad movement. After hammering it out a few times in this mode, you get used to the movements and mechanics start making sense. Some moves require all three punch buttons to be pressed. I didn't know that it was supposed to be at the same time and tried hammering three quick punches to which no special move would occur. It dawned on me eventually to try pressing all three punch buttons which resulted in a successful special attempt. It can seem extremely difficult, challenging, and even apathetic, but stick with it and keep plugging away and eventually the control schemes all make sense. I felt the combos were a bit more fluent than what Mortal Kombat X's was. Just like in the old Street Fighter games, you can grab and throw your opponents. The basic controls are weak punch and weak kick, then medium punch and medium kick, then there is two variances of hard punch and hard kick. Within the game, the player is able to choose the costume, fight style and taunt of the fighters before entering the stage. There are two bonus stages that are also featured throughout arcade mode. Similar styles and patterns can be noticed between fighters where some feel balanced, some are wrestlers, and some are acrobatic.\n\nStory lines within the game don't tell a lot of story, but do give a bit of insight into the characters of the Street Fighter World. Each character has a short story segment at the beginning and then again at the end tell of their triumph.\n\nThe graphics in this game are distinctive. It follows a 3D sort of pattern but it's definitely 2D. I really like the art style they chose and they way they chose to end fights. Upon delivering a final blow, players can see their final actions carried out in slow motion. Sounds are good and do not necessarily mimic the old noise were used to. None the less, some of the old sounds are noticeable while the new ones deliver the impact they are meant to deliver.\n\nMulti player is absolute overkill. I don't think there are many players like myself still stuck in the 90's trying to put two punch combos together. Match making does a decent job trying to pair you up with someone close to your talent but often feels like it misses big time. Either really get to know this game and spend time learning character move sets, or be stuck getting punched and kicked thirty times in a row followed by a special combo.\n\nOverall, it is a pretty good game. I'm not a huge fight fan, but I do like my street fighter.\n\nFor future SF games, it would be nice to see them try to new things with the game and maybe even go for a 3D plane. I have no problems with the way things are now, but why not try to add a bit more? To buy the full version of the game it costs about $45... I think for $45 there should be a bit more into the game than small variations on fighting. And maybe for guys like myself have certain move sets for certain characters that fight in different ways?\n\nRating : 7.4/10\n\nScreenShots :\nRyu talking to himself, in a forest, by himself, prior to starting arcade/world tour mode\n\nPower/combo bars have been added at the bottom.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/45760/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","Street Fighter has had quite a long history behind it. First releasing in 1987 in the Arcades, the series became popular once the sequel, Street Fighter II released on 1991 and pretty much created the Fighting Game genre and the competitive scene for it.\n\nThis now being the fourth iteration features a number of gameplay changes to the traditional Street Fighter formula as well as a slew of new and classic characters from past Street Fighter and Final Fight games.\n\nThe story (Yes it has a story) is set chronologically after the events of Street Fighter II but just before Street Fighter 3rd Strike. A new World Tournament is arranged after Bison's defeat at the hands of Akuma (SF2) in order to draw out Ryu and use his hidden powers and complete a project. Besides the main premise, every character has their own intros and endings after defeating the final boss, known as Seth - a new character to the Street Fighter franchise.\n\nThe gameplay's still top notch Street Fighter. The game's heavily based on pokes and footsies (throwing out safe moves and controlling distance to your opponent) rather than combography, like games like Marvel vs Capcom or Mortal Kombat. Almost every character plays differently, with the obvious exception of the Shoto characters like Ryu, Akuma and Ken.\n\nStreet Fighter has a 6 button layout, divided by Light, Medium and Heavy and each by Punch and Kicks. (Eg - LP - Light Punch or HK - Heavy Kick). Unlike in games like Marvel vs Capcom, however, these inputs can't be linked by just dialing-a-combo, they have to be timed as the animation ends or you use an old trick found out that helps players link together these moves known as Priority Linking or Plinking. Every character also possess their own Special Moves, most of them CAN be linked from normals, however. Motions also vary per character as well as the requirements for executing these moves - for example, Ryu's Hadouken has the standard QCF motion plus a punch button (QCF stands for Quarter Circle Forward or in NUMPAD motions - 236), likewise, Ryu's Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku (Spinning Kick) has the motion reversed or QCB plus a kick instead of punch and Ryu's most complicated move, the Shoryuken has a "Z" like motion, (..or in Numpad reference: 623). Other characters, like Bison, have Charge moves. Charge moves are moves that require a direction to be held for a set amount of time, for example Bison's Scissor Kicks require you to hold back for a few seconds, then when you're ready to use the move, tilt forward and press any kick button, Bison will then execute the move. Kick motions are usually written in Numpad reference as: 4Hold 6+Button.\n\nNOTE: The Numpad References mentioned above require you to, of course, take a look at the numpad on your keyboard, an analog stick or a joystick go by that to divulge input information easier to Fighting Game Veterans and Newbies alike. In Numpad - 8 would be Up, 2 would be Down and 4/6 would be Front or Back depending on your positioning in the game.\n\nThere's more stuff characters can do to further extend their offenses:\n\n*L,M,H Alterations to Special Moves: Almost every character, if not all of them - can slightly alter their special moves depending on the designated punch or kick used. For Example, using QCF+LP can result in a slow moving Hadouken, whereas using QCF+HP can result in a faster Hadouken. Some moves also come with different frame numbers, so maybe a Light version of a move is safe on block, but the heavy version of the same move is very punishable after you use it haphazardly.\n\n*EX Attacks: EX moves are that require meter to pull off (Read below) but are, essentially, buffed up Special Moves. EX moves are executed by holding two of the same button when inputting a special move. For example, Ryu's EX Hadouken would be QCF+LP+MP/HP.\n\n*Focus Attacks: Focus attacks are done by holding the Medium Kick button and Medium Punch button. Focus moves, if charged enough can soak up certain moves up as a counterattack and cause a Crumple State on your Foe (Crumple State means that your character is in an animation where they can't move, defend or attack). After a successful Focus Attack, if you input a dash, you can cancel out the residual animation and continue your offense or escape a failed Focus Attack before you get punished, some characters, however are unsafe even if they cancel out. A Focus Attack cancel into dash is widely known as "FADC" or Focus Attack Dash Cancel and these can be used to cancel out of some special moves. NOTE: Some moves WILL break through a Focus Attack, when they do, you'll hear a shattering sound, be mindful of this when haphazardly throwing out focus attacks.\n\n*Super Moves: Super Moves can be done when you have a Full Meter. Just like Ultras and Special Moves, they have their own input that varies per character. Using a Super will drain your entire Meter.\n\n*Ultras: Every character has 2 Designated Ultras, you can, however only choose one in the character select screen after choosing your fighter. In game, you get the meter to use your Ultra moves as you take damage. It is possible to use 2 Ultras in the same round.\n\n*Throws/Command Throws: Every character has a designated throw move. A throw can be done by pressing the light Punch and Kick buttons. Throws can be teched out of (Escaped) by pressing the Throw buttons just as you're being thrown. A throw can come out instantly and is often used for mix ups in an on going match. A Comand Throw, however, is only usable by certain characters, like Abel and Zangief. These have their own motions plus a button press, same as Special Moves, however, these throws are untechable and often deal high damage, but they aren't as easy to land as a regular throw.\n\nIn game, you have three meters you need to keep track of as well!\nThese being your health bar at the top, your Super Meter (Has 4 rectangles - each indicate an EX move that's now usable) and your Ultra bar by the side, which, when it lights up, means your character's Ultra is now useable.\n\nThe game itself looks great visually with a lot nice visual effects that still look great to this day. The character models are a little bulky looking, but it's more or less to do with the game's own art style. The stages in the game look great as well, some are very vibrant and colorful and some have more animated backdrops in the stage to give it more authenticity to what you're seeing on screen.\n\nSoundwork is great aswell. Every stage has it's own theme to fit what you see on screen and helps further the authenticity of it, as well as some stages have their own added background noises. Each character also has their own theme songs and can be chosen to play them instead of Stage themes in the options menu as well as changing the character's Voices to English or Japanese. In game, everything also has it's own little chime that helps the player to identify them. When you gain a block of Super meter, it usually has a little 'puff' sound that helps you identify that you or your foe have a new block of meter to use. Hit noises are also fairly well done and help identify the more solid moves to give it more impact, likewise, the weaker moves, like light punches and kicks have their own sound that sounds less impactful but serve to help you identify that you hit your foe or viceversa.\n\nOverall, this is an amazing fighting game that no fighting game fan should miss. Not much to say other than it's Street Fighter. Great mechanics, a healthy selection of characters with high variation to them and of course, the game ALWAYS has something new for you to learn, even if you're seasoned veteran.\n\nPros\n+Great Mechanics\n+Lots of Character Variation\n+Has an amazingly balanced roster\n+Amazing Visual Effects\n+Amazing Soundwork and soundcues help give the game authenticity and impact\n\nCons\n-Dodgy Online System","June 29, 2014","true","60.3"," 27 of 47 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","27","47","0","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/45760/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","Ultra Street Fighter IV, should probably be called the Ultimate Street Fighter IV since that is what it is. It has all the characters from the Street Fighter Franchise as well as some new faces and locations. 44 different characters to choose from with updated standout graphics that make the characters pop on screen. The game looks good, feels good, and for those of us who grew up with old school Street Fighter, it brings back a lot of memories. Ultra Street Fighter IV allows you to play solo arcade mode, or multiplay with friends. You can find online opponents, and pit yourself against some of the best Street Fighters in the world, the choice is up to you.\n\nI played the arcade mode against the PC, and enjoyed the little mini animations between rounds. I thought that was a nice touch. Playing Blanka, who was always one of my favorites, I thoroughly enjoyed trouncing the competition. I'll admit I haven't actually played the Street Fighter Series since the 90's, but Ultra Street Fighter IV feels like a more modern version of the original, with better graphics, more characters, and new moves. If you enjoy the street fighter series, you should really consider picking this game up.","July 19, 2015","true","3.1"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

The main thing I look for in a fighting game is gameplay, and USF4 mostly delivers in that respect. However, as a PC port, USF4 is disappointing. That doesn't mean you should write it off, however.\n\nUSF4 is the final entry in Capcom's line of Street Fighter 4 games. Before this particular entry was developed, Capcom made the stupid decision to saddle its PC ports of Street Fighter IV and Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition with Games For Windows Live. GFWL is DRM that no customer wanted; not only was it unnecessary, but it caused problems for many of the game's paying customers. When Capcom seemingly did the right thing by patching GFWL out of SSF4:AE's PC port, the game's netcode inexplicably took a serious hit. Online play became unreliable at best.\n\nNot long after leaving GFWL in the past, Capcom announced that it would develop USF4, and that this update would be developed with Steamworks-based netcode. PC gamers had reason to believe that USF4 would have great online gameplay because it would supposedly be developed from the ground up without any GFWL integration. What PC gamers got instead was simply a patched version of SSF4:AE that still features the same broken netcode. Capcom promised to fix the netcode, butyears later, it has clearly failed to carry out that promise. With Street Fighter 5 having been released, it is unlikely that Capcom will ever fix Street Fighter 4's netcode for the PC.\n\nWhat USF4's sorry state of online play usually amounts to is that internet-based games will be unplayably laggy. This problem occurs even when both of the players are in the same region and have stable internet connections. If you have the fortune of playing online without significant lag, the experience is compromised by the fact that the game does not support voice chat or even native texting.\n\nThe game isn't a total wash. You can have a good time playing with a buddy who's physically in the same room as you, and the single player arcade mode is mostly fun to play through. For me, the fun stops as soon as I reach Seth, the game's final boss. He's frustratingly cheap and you'll probably struggle to win more than one round against him unless you resort to memorizing his patterns and exploiting their few loopholes in a very contrived manner.\n\nSeth battles notwithstanding, USF4's gameplay is solid. However, I don't like Capcom's decision to substite the SF4 games with a focus attack system instead of the parry system that was introduced in Street Fighter III. Although USF4's roster is large, there are many shoto clones, so the gameplay between characters isn't as diverse as your eyes may lead you to believe.\n\nAs far as graphics go, the characters look pretty good, although Decapre looks way too derivative of Cammy for a first time playable character who was hyped to the moon. (Thankfully, she handles completely differently and does indeed function as a unique character.) Most of the backgrounds are bland and unimaginative, but this has been a problem with every Street Fighter game since Capcom moved on from the Street Fighter II series.\n\nI really dislike that game's music, sound effects, and especially its announcer. Sound-wise, the only thing I like about the game is the voice acting.\n\nBottom line, this is a pretty good game, but Capcom should be ashamed for promising to fix SSF4:AE's netcode, only to release this installment and have it suffer from the same problem that Capcom neglected to fix. Mainly for that reason, I disapprove of this port, but not the game itself. People who have friends who can play with them IRL will likely derive the most enjoyment from the PC port of USF4.","March 12","false","52.8"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hybel/recommended/45760/","Hybel","Couchfighter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hybel/","236 products in account","Updated review, since changes to the Steam client have improved online performance significantly:\n\nWhat's what:\nThe most recent iteration of classic 2D fighting in the Street Fighter universe.  44 characters to play on or off line, and many mechanical intricacies to master, many not covered by the fairly basic tutorials.  Steep learning curve, highly satisfying to master.\n\nWhat's Good:\nLarge roster of well balanced characters, and fully mastering just one can be a serious commitment.  Most players will never run out of new things to tackle and learn.\nRobust net code for online play, which is always going to have some microseconds of delay compared to offline versus, but for the most part plays fluidly and works great for practice and casual matches.\nClassic 2D fighting mechanics evolved from SF II that also offers a lot of depth.  Characters can use powerful and flashy ultra combos as a powerful comeback tool.  Make your attacks safe or extend a combo using Focus Attack cancels.  Combos with tight execution require training, but are satisfying to master.\nGood amount of game modes, from the barebones arcade versus CPU and the feature rich practice mode and character combo trials, to online ranked or casual lobbies and (little used) team battle and 8 player tournaments.\nWhat's Bad:\nSearching matches based on skill online doesn't work, causing frustration for new players and professionals alike.  Its entirely possible for someone just having installed the game to be matched against an EVO competitor.\nUSFIV is showing its age visually.  SFIV was never visually advanced, to make sure it ran constant 60 fps on consoles 6 years ago and hasn't seen any visual upgrades since then.  Characters and especially stage backgrounds look quite ugly by today's standards.\nUnreasonably strict combo system.  This one's debatable and many will put this as one of the game's strong points.  Most combos are links, meaning they have to be input after an attack animation has ended completely, as opposed to chains, where normal punches and kicks can be cancelled into other attacks.  The frame window to hit these combos can be extremely narrow, often down to 1 or 2 frames precision (Using 60 frames in one second as measuring), meaning even professional players with 5000 hours and more clocked will still sometimes or often miss combo timings.  I'm all for being rewarded for vigilant practice, but combo windows being this rigid is a bit too much, and can be very offputting for newer players to cope with.\n\nSummary:\nWhile USFIV has strong competition from other fighting games these days, it is still a very good fighting game.  It lacks in tutorials and teaching how to combo and understand the finer technical points however, so new players are going to have to educate themselves outside of the game through wikis and watching a lot of high level play on YouTube or Twitch.  It still enjoys a healthy player base, and despite other games competing for attention in the genre and SF V being in production, I still feel comfortable recommending Ultra Street Fighter IV for players looking to get into a fighting game, or pondering getting the PC version of it.","February 2, 2013","true","456.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

SFIV is a 2D fighting game like most of the previous Street Fighter iterations. It has various characters which increases the chance of some that may catch your fancy. There is even more characters in this ultra edition which is an upgrade to previous SFIV versions. Fighting speed in general is normal compared to other 2D fighters which leaves a good open window for command inputs in-between. This PC version have a decent system settings and controllers compatibility other than x-input (xbox 360/one based) devices and keyboards. For all characters the fighting system has 6 main buttons, blocks are done by holding back, standing, crouching and jumping attacks, throws, dashes, wakeup delay, characters get stunned after certain amount of attacks taken, a 2 stage charge attack (called focus) for each character which strength varies by the duration pressed, characters have special moves and there is extra bar (called super) which has 4 stages (bars) and can be used for having ex version of some specials by using one bar and a super which consumes all 4 bars, there is finishing move bar (called ultra) and each character has 2 ultras which can be selected individually or together, focus then dashing can be used to link some attacks (called focus cancel) and can be used to cancel an active attack for defense and backing up. Attacks are categorized into high, medium, low, overhead, throws, some characters has command throws also and fully charged focus is unblockable. All non-normal attacks will chip the health bar when blocked and can finish a round. All characters have taunts which can be disabled before matches.  Arcade mode acts like story mode with few (1 or more) still images with narration as prologue and a small animated clip as epilogue with rival battles before the boss battle that has special before and in match dialogue. There is versus mode for local or computer battles and also there is computer versus computer matches. Training mode is on normal quality with ability to record actions for the dummy and can be locally controlled or computer controlled and all bars are modifiable, there is challenge mode which is a series of combos for each characters. Online multiplayer is decent now but with less players than the consoles versions as there is no cross platform multiplayer, all online battles have voice chat, there is ranked battles, online training, room battles and tournament like rooms with one active match at a time and all can be open invitation to all or friend invitations and in rooms you can set the number of slots for which type. Online battle can be selected to start and halt current offline matches when found, this applies to arcade and training modes. Online and versus matches replays can be saved although in limited amount and you can watch some matches for high ranking players and some recent replays for others all can be viewed by region or characters. There is a ranking system for your overall points and your character points. You can be unique online by having an icon, a title and a vs screen message and all are pre made. There is different customs for each character and a lot of them are unfortunately available as DLC.\nPros:\nEasy to pick up and learn but hard to master.\nA very balanced fighting game.\nBig selection of characters that a lot are totally unique with either English or Japanese voices.\nAll characters versions are available in addition to omega versions.\nAbility to have different playing styles, strategies.\nCommunity, as there is a lot of player made material for every subject.\nCompetitive real life tournaments.\nAlmost endless shelf life for a fighting game.\ncons:\nLackluster arcade/story mode.\nNo Tutorial mode.\nStages default BGM is mostly boring except for a few ones.\nNo visual upgrade from 2008.\nPrice is high for an upgrade.\nDLC is overpriced and cannot be earned in-game.\nMastery require too much training for any character.\nNo time attack or survival/endurance modes.\nOffline and online play variety is limited.\nSome online modes are almost abandoned.\nNeed to manually adjust some settings in graphics card options outside the game for optimum performance.\nNo official list of all combos or official in-depth guide, also no technical visual assist in training for hitboxes and moves recovery and active frames.\nOnly icons, titles, default custom colors and taunts are rewards for playing.\n\nI hope this is a fair review of USFIV on Steam.","December 28, 2015","true","168.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Unless you want to be some guy who sits at home all day playing Street Fighter, you'll never be as good as the other players. The controls are "responsive". Too responsive. Unless you hit that punch button the exact moment you make that quarter circle, you won't get the Hadouken. Once your opponent traps you in their combo, there's no escape. The block will work, miraculously only.\n\nIf you want to play for fun, this game is not for you. You'll just get mad when your moves won't execute which will be a big buzz kill. Trust me. I tested this by playing with someone in my house. We both got frustrated in the 5th round. If you're into a rough community and games that require a week to perfect your skills, go ahead.

In my opinion, this game is ♥♥♥♥ unless you play Character X VS Character X. Same Char VS Same Char.  In fact, don't buy it. It doesn't deserve it. Just buy the soundtrack.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/406animus/recommended/45760/","406animus","SOL| Animus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/406animus/","69 products in account","The most balanced fighting game you could ever own, Ultra Street Fighter IV stands as the king of fighters. I'm not one for reviewing games but I wanted to throw in my two cents to encourage you that if you are interested in playing a fighting game, this should be your first if not only choice. While Street Fighter was first born in 1987 and the title may seem like they have rehashed the game overtime, this is definitely not so. Each character has their own unique attributes, strengths, weaknesses, and believe it or not, playstyle. Just like with any game, there is a so called tier-list based off their number of favorable matchups against other characters but for the most part, anyone can win. It is not as up to date graphically but if you appreciate the cartoon/cell shaded style graphics that gives it much more of a fantasy look, it's great. Beautiful soundtrack, sound effects during fights, and add-on content with crazy costumes for characters gives you personality during your fight.\n\nThe biggest turn off that you may expereince in any fighting game is that you instantly go on-line and expect results. The problem is in a fighting game, being hopeful and mashing buttons just does not bring results (think of grinding in MMOs). While anything can happen in a match, the greatest feeling is learning the ins and outs of the fighting system where combos are difficult enough that when mastered give you a trule feeling of levling up in your gameplay but are not long stretched out button cominations such as Tekken which I myself never was fond of. Online/Offline training mode as well as trials give you the opportunity to grow and develop your timing, spacing of moves, see damage statistics as well as observe your input data to see why the special move you are trying to do is not happening.\n\nWhen it comes to fighting, Street Fighter is very straight forward, with three different levels of punches/kicks, ranging from the lighter faster jab or kick all the way to the stronger but slower hook or roundhouse. While it seems so simple, every character has completely different frame data (meaning that moves do completely different damages and come out faster or slower, some making a character vulnerable to being hit if blocked). This includes characters like Ryu and Ken who everyone knows and thinks they are so similar. While most think that all that is needed to be done is throw Hadoukens or mash special moves to win, this is just not the case. In this generation of gaming, it is crucial that you fight with your mind. Not being able to defend yourself results in very fast knockouts. What I love personally about this is that since every character is different, you start to learn which characters are aggressive, defensive, controling certain spaces, etc. This aids in creating a unqiue experience with every character you play.\n\n\nThe community for this game itself is very focused on the growth of players though just like any game, you will have trollers. It's inevitable. Great replay channel usage (download and upload as well as linking to Youtube.) Split-screen play as well which is a rare commodity in this day and age.\n\nThe only downside about Street Fighter is that on PC (While I wouldn't consider it a precise downside but for those that don't do reserach, it will be), playing online optimized will require to setup your PC in a specific way. The game is made to run at 60FPS for second without too much enhancement. Failing to run it properly will keep you from being able to perform combos correctly which of how frame precise button presses are (though this is with just about any fighting game). The preferred method of running the game includes the following settings:\n\n- Enable v-sync and triple buffering for Ultra Street Fighter IV in your nVidia Control Panel or ATI Control Center (This fixes screen tearing and allows a 60fps without over-smoothing the game to cause issues with button presses\n\n- In-game run whatever resolution you can comfortably and disable V-Sync in game, and put Frame Rate to "Fixed."\n\nBy doing this, it will be running close to if not mimicing the arcade version in terms of fluency.\n\nWith achievements, difficult to master, great online experience, and depth, this is THE fighting game you will not want to pass up.\n\nPROS\n-------------\n+Replay value\n+Character Roster  (44 Characters)\n+Character creativity / uniqueness\n+Controls\n+Online community\n+Gameplay Depth / Mechanics\n+Soundtrack\n+Graphically beautiful\n\nCONS\n_________\n\n- PC version not as optimized as console. Requires tweaking for the best experience.\n\n\nWelcome to the community if you buy it! Enjoy!","September 18, 2014","true","560.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game has so many good memories for me. I remember the time when my uncle had pre-ordered vanilla SFIV for the PS3 and I wanted to play it so bad because the commercials made that game look HYPE AS ♥♥♥♥, heh, good times those were. Anyways, this game has a HUGE roster of characters at this point and is very easy to get into, however at some point you will get the urge to become better at this game, that's where you'll get frustrated. Trust me, this game can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ to master, but once you have all the hard stuff down like, FADCs, solid combos (because this game has 1 frame links), footsies, zoning and ESPECIALLY the mind games, you'll be an excellent player. So do I recommend this game? OF COURSE! It's an amazing game. However, the entire reason why I decided to share a little memory of my past with this game was because I'm honestly kind of bored of it and moving on to SFV. Why move on to SFV? Well, for many people the answer is "because it's the new Street Fighter, DUH!", but personally for me It's because it's been a while since a Street Fighter game has felt like the classics and SFV really brings that back, but if you're new to the Street Fighter series I can guarantee you that this game will be a hell of a lot of fun when you first get your hands on it.","January 16","true","832.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I am not good-at-all at it but Ultra Street Fighter IV (USFIV) is clearly the only fighting game that make me want to be better at it. This game is awesome. Really, it is. It's also a great game if you're really strong at fighting games of course don't worry.\n\nLet's make a list.\n\nPros ;\n+ Controls ; You have a couple of choice, arcade controller (the best), the XBOX or basic controller (the good) and the keyboard (the not-so-good). I am playing on keyboard and Capcom show us that it's possible to play with a keyboard at Street Fighter.\n+ Ambiance ; One of the most intense and greatest ambiance I ever saw in a videogame.\n+ Sound ; With quality voice acting and sounds, it won't hurt your ears and it keep the great ambiance.\n+ Music ; I am not into Techno music but this game have clearly great musics that fit every situations.\n+ Graphism ; Colorful and awesome. The characters animations were really polished and all the extra effects look perfect.\n+ Storyline ; Yes, there is a storyline for EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER in the Arcade mode. Every character have their own theme, rivals, boss and cutscene (let's not forget about the animation that starts at the begining of a fight too.)\n+ Character choice ; There is a lot of playable characters which made the Street Fighter Universe so great. Make your choice. Play only with your special someone or try'em all.\n+ Character customization ; You can change the color of your character clothes and even changing them if you have the correct DLC of course.\n+ Difficulty ; There not only Easy Medium and Hard there is like 10 differents difficulties. You just need to pick-up the one that fits you which make this game perfect for Not-good players or Super strong players.\n+ 2 Players party ; Of course, why in the world would you not being able to play with your (real-life) friend at a Street Fighter game?\n+ Training and Challenge Mode ; Those are great and can really help you to figure out some new tricks for your favorite character.\n\nCons ;\n- Online ; No much people and most of them are smurfs and people that is playing fighting games from the time they're 5. No actual rookie, initiated, causual or even intermediate players. Only brainless phycos that absolutely need to play with a stick.\n- Online lag ; Like the online matchmaking isn't already that hard. There is a serious problem about the lags in this game.\n- Team Match ; It looks interesting, but I was never able to find a single server.\n- DLCs ; It bring great customization possibilities but it's expensive. Like 5€ for 4~5 outfits.\n- Difficulty at the end of the Arcade Mode ; When you're going for the boss it will be really, really, really harder that the other folks you just met ealier. It can be really frustrating sometimes.\n- Achievements difficulty ; Why Capcom, why ? These achivements are super hard, really.\n\nTL;DR\nOverall, this is great. Really. But don't bet on the Online mode, it's not nice. However the Arcade and Versus Mode are awesome. You will really have fun by playing this game. It worth the price, definitly\n\n→ 89/100","July 23, 2015","true","672.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

There are 24 specific trials to each character which make you do special moves and combos that allow you to train and get better with a character.\n\nMultiplayer: For the most part, the multiplayer is smooth, fast, and rarely has lag. Occasionaly you will get put up against someone that has network problems but you can always back out before you go into a match. There are 4 gamemodes in the multiplayer: ranked match, endless match, team battle, and tournament. In a ranked match, you will gain and lose player points(points specific to your profile) and battle points(points specific to a character). The PP and BP will be visible to the other people in a lobby/match with you. The multiplayer also goes through GFWL(Games for Windows Live), which most people don't like, but I've heard that its shutting down soon, so don't worry.\n\nVisuals and Audio: The graphics are great, it has a cartoony style to it and the characters have a cool black outline on them. The maps are really cool, and they all have animations to them(besides the training stage). The sounds are really good aswell,\nthere's great voice acting, but occasionally the map music gets a little repetitive.\n\nOverall I would recommend this to anyone. 9/10\n","February 8, 2014","true","210.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The epitomy in fighting games. Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition is continuing the success of the Street Fighter franchise that started and "created" the fighting genre as we know it today.\n\nBeautiful 2D graphics, amazing soundtrack and all the classic moves we learned while playing in the local arcades while being young. Its all back better, faster, harder, stronger. With a huge cast of characters for all tastes, a plethora of different moves and combos and a good online battle system which is lag free most of the time. SSF4 AE is super enjoyable for everyone, even those who prefer the offline game or their living room fighting with friends and having a blast. For those that money isn't an issue, or for those that really want to focus on the game i recommend to buy an arcade fighting stick as a controller. The experience is trully unique.\n\nThe learning curve for the more advance technics might be a bit steep for new players that try the genre for the first time, but the fighting is community is insanely active and offer great assistance to everyone that is willing to ask or look for it.\n\nThe only con i found personally is that the tutorial on the mechanics of the game is nonexistant so you have to figure yourself or watch one of the many tutorials out there of how the game actually works.\n\nI recommend it 100% to everyone that wants to start the fighting genre, veterans of the kind are already playing it the review isn' t for them, its the perfect game to be initiated to fighting games.","April 12, 2014","true","098.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

This is a strong opinion that I have just given, but please allow me to explain why I feel this way, and why this game may interest you as well.\n\nThe characters.  USF4 boasts an IMPRESSIVE cast of fighters.  Fans of the older Street Fighter games will see just about all of the old characters they remember and love like Ryu, Chun Li, and Sagat, but the game also throws many new fighters into the mix as well. All together, USF4 offers 44 different fighters to play as.  Can you imagine having 44 different types of delicious pasta given to you at once? I would probably blow up from eating too much.\n\nOne of the ways that USF4 separates itself from other fighting games is by how accessible it is to fighting game newcomers.  Special move inputs are simple to perform, basic combos are not lengthy or technically demanding, and the pace of the game is much slower than other fighters like Marvel Vs. Capcom or King of Fighters.  This may sound bad for fighting game experts, but USF4 still manages to have a great deal of depth and can be very rewarding for those who put in the work and become godlike.\n\nBe warned that this game does not offer much for the single player experience.  It comes with Arcade mode, Training mode, and a Trial mode.  Most players, though, will likely be spending their time playing online trying to become THE STRONGEST IN THE UNIVERSE.  Please keep in mind that many players have had problems with the online thus far. I, PERSONALLY, haven’t had much trouble.  Every now and then, I get a match that lags like a ravenous herd of chunky sea slugs swimming through a rich manure field, HOWEVER, most of the time it runs quite well and I dominate the opponent with my MLG decision making and cunning brilliance.\n\nI would like to believe that Street Fighter is the face of fighting games, and luckily, it is also DOWNRIGHT SICK NASTY at what it does.  It’s got tons of memorable characters, stages, and music.  Good visuals and flashy attacks.  An online mode that works great (at least for me) and is very active.  It’s easy for newcomers to enjoy and deep enough for experts to play for hundreds of hours.  To put it simply, USF4 is just like a steaming plate of luxurious lasagna fritta that you never grow tired of.\n\nI give Ultra street Fighter 4 a score of “Undisputed Champion of the Makuuchi Sumo Wrestling Division”.

The problem though, is not just the learning curve for fighters but the netcode as well. Capcom has had years and years to properly integrate new players into the fighting genre and have refused to do so, making it difficult for people to stop from watching on the inside and joining in on the fight. The training and challenges aren't enough.\n\nConsider in training mode you could be setting a combo incorrectly, and the challenge modes are very out of date (3 or 4 years out of date for now.)\n\nThough this could be potentially ignored, coupled with this older problem of the fighting game genre is netcode that is desperately and severely lacking. I have friends that only play on this platform, and I can't help but feel that they're really missing out by not having this game on the PS3 or Xbox 360.\n\nEdit: 10/6/2014 - It still seems relatively miserable.","August 19, 2014","false","210.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The reasons? since GFWL was removed from SSFIV the game has no longer worked properly for lot's of people (myself included) due to the netcode. This messed with the fps (even in single player) because of a massive memory leak which was fixed by the community and not Capcom. The second problem with SSFIV was the online matchmaking was just a massive lag-fest again because of the bad netcode. How did Capcom respond to fixing SSFIV? They decided to just release the USFIV DLC knowing about all the problems that were present with SSFIV. So basically the one thing most people complained about (GFWL) was actually the only thing saving this game from a disaster. Capcom has a bad habit of releasing a broken game then letting the community know "We are aware of the situation" without actually fixing anything, then abandoning the game to focus on money grabbing from their next game (DR3 is also a broken mess).","September 9, 2014","false","63.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Just don't use a 360 controller and if you want to play online, you should look that the connection is fine.","June 24, 2014","true","116.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

If you ask anyone who takes fighting games seriously this game is incredibly important and obviously has a huge following. Its greatest strengths come in finding a way to reintroduce characters from previous games in a setting that dosent screw the story up as bad as SF3 did and at the same time maintain a presentation that has become iconic since its initial release. This game has had WAY too many re-releases in forms of newer versions that that includes the most recent update "ULTRA Street Fighter IV" coming out early next year, but obviously if this game has been going strong for THIS LONG, it must be doing something right. Now, from my own personal opinion, i think a good number of the "new" characters they tried to introduce alongside the classic roster dont really have the same magic as the classics, especially El fuerte and Rufus, but that might just be me. Either way, this game is worth the time and money if you intend on buckling down and seriously practicing and playing as much online and local competition as possible. The online is good, netcode is far better than most PC fighters we get with the exception of GGPO netcode games. I suppose in a way, this game is great for both beginners who get exposure to many of the best classic characters without having to play the older games and its worthy of getting the attention of seasoned veterans. If you look at SFIV's track record, you can argue, but you wont get far. 9/10\n","November 30, 2013","true","157.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At first you will fight street and street will always win. BUT don't get discouraged, if you spend some time (1-3 minutes for most) learning to fight street you will always win 100% of the time. If you keep on fight streeting you will become fight streeter pro umehara daigo senpai 840 double blaze it momochi san topanga SS+ league double mustard 10k PP jack of all trades, and MASTER of all 44 characters, over the course of  5~ hours game time give or take 30 minutes. All you have to do is hit the opponent until their life runs out its really easy.\n\nThis game is special, fighting games have an amount of depth that is very rewarding for a committed player, and so does this game. If you get past the learning curve you will be enjoying fighting games for a very long time.\n\n*EDIT* It's 2016 and SFV is out, if you are looking to compete get SFV because this game is now dead online. Maybe get it if you are only interested in ground breaking Street Fighter lore about Ken's pasta and vandalizing automobiles.","September 19, 2014","true","435.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You simply NEED to play these games with human competition, no matter how well-crafted the single player experience may be, in the end everything boils down to multiplayer.\n\nWhen SFIV was finally released I first chose to ignore it, since I did not own a console at that time, but the thought that you could finally play this amazing game against other people from around the world was intriguing to say the least.\n\nCouple of years later I saw the game in a Steam Sale and picked it up, had tons of fun with it, even though the Games For Windows Live-Online was garbage by my standards (I come from playing DotA, Blizzard titles and Dota 2, so my online standards are pretty damn high), it did the job good enough for me to keep playing and stay interested.\n\nNow it has been 3 month since Super Street Fighter 4: AE2012 was ported to Steamworks and it completely broke online play for a lot of people. I personally have to set my computer to DMZ in my router in order to be able to play the game properly and it still lags horribly at least once a match, the menus start lagging as well and it's generally a pain in the butt playing the game.\n\nWhen Ultra Street Fighter 4 hit the stores, I thought Capcom had been working on fixing these problem for the past couple of month and are now ready to patch it along with the upgrade.\n\nPlot Twist:\n\nTurns out they did not do jack ♥♥♥♥, despite their forum posts saying they were aware of the problem and working on it, they did not do anything and even had the nerve to post the same stuff that they already did with the AE transition, which was "We are aware of the problem and we are going to fix it".\n\nI will try to come to an end here in my clumsy try to make a game review.\nBottom line for me is that if you are not living in Arcade America/Japan and you do not know anyone around you who regularly plays Ultra Street Fighter 4, then do not bother with this game since Capcom does not give a single fart about you and chances are that you will not be able to play this game with anyone else but yourself.\n\nThe game itself is well-designed maybe a bit buggy overall but it is a good entry to the Street Fighter series and tons of fun, ultimately I decide against recommending this game, since the online multiplayer is a major selling point, not only for me but for most people, and since it does not work like intended, I will refrain from telling anyone to buy it.\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAs of the 03.30.2015, this game is actually playable online, to the same extend that GFWL was and XBox Live is.\nGo ahead and buy it, if you're looking for a rather defensive but well-made Street Fighter game.\n\nThe game has its downsides of course, but it's still Street Fighter and a lot of fun to play.","September 10, 2014","true","378.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With a few losses, solid tutorial, and input method of preference, you can get into a serious online fighting session. The only thing holding this game back is the GFWL integration, which will leave you at times, unable to load into a game session or find a match, luckily GFWL will likely be removed sometime before July 2014, due it being shutdown and the fact that Capcom has announced Ultra SF4, this should not be a huge issue for long.

That said this I got this with most of its DLC on sale and can't complain since I do not own any version of Street Fighter IV on Steam besides this.\nThis game right to exist is ♥♥♥♥. The game itself however is not bad. Personally I like Super Turbo/X, V, and especially 3rd Strike more. However this is a good fighting game overall. If you have not played any version of Street Fighter IV yet I will say this is a must play. The netcode is a bit better considering most non-GGPO Capcom netcodes are terrible, there might be way too much DLC but all the characters are here and the game is overall bursting with content without the DLC.\nIt is not the best Street Fighter and not the best Capcom fighting game, but its a good and solid game and its on Steam in its finest form.","March 29","true","19.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Capcom has chosen to ignore every single issue while they put more and more resources into the sort of outfits that only a 5 year old would think is cool (swimming outfits from 100 years ago and fury outfits so the characters look like they're going to a Halloween party). Consols get all updates and DLC long before PC, and when we do finally get them they're usually broken. As of now I could not recommend anyone buy anything Capcom on PC. They treat us like a red headed step-child that's lucky to get any attention at all. Even if Capcom decided to snap out of their PC hate today it would take years before they reorganized the company in a way that made PC anything but a third wheel. If you want a good fighter for PC check out SkullGirls. Even if it's not the sort of aesthetic you prefer their developers have proven that they actually care about PC. They actually listen to what players complain about, patch the game regularly, and do not slow things down for consols. They should serve as a model for any company wanting to release fighting games on PC. I'm willing to bet Capcom will release a costume pack with all the characters in pink tutus long before they take any complaints seriously.","November 2, 2014","false","288.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But what's not fun is getting absolutely destroyed because of the online of this game.\n\nSteam has completely ruined online for this game, it jitters constantly which slows the game down and makes it literally impossible to do a special move, but then what happens? It's A-Okay! Finally the lag is over!.... For 5 seconds then proceeds to jitter more, I don't know if this is just the netcode, my internet connection (which is perfect, I have no issues on any other version on this game), or my computer (which is a beast and runs anything I make it run on the highest graphics possible) but it's seriously broken, like, actually broken.\n\nOn the other hand, some say that the netcode is fine with no issues, but these people who have told me that the netcode is fine have over 40mbps download and 10mbps upload speeds (no surprise there is there.) So what about the people who can't get fibre optic connectivity? We just can't play, at all.\n\nGames for Windows Live was a GODSEND compared to this broken hunk of junk, GFWL is active on multiple games *cough* Street Fighter x Tekken *cough* UMK3 *cough* so why can't we bring it back? It was infinitely better than this, sure we sometimes got some problems with connections, but that was mainly down to a persons internet speeds and connectivity, NOT broken netcode... I seriously pray for Games for Windows Live to make a return, at least that worked correctly!\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend it for people who want a fun OFFLINE fighting game, or for people who want to practice without the need of a console, but unless you have very fast internet speeds, I wouldn't recommend investing time going into Ranked Mode.\n\nTL;DR: Broken netcode, not fun, dropping combos, fun game offline for the whole family, praying for GFWL to come back, not recommended online, recommended for offline use.","November 3, 2014","false","310.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

No teams to fall back on or get in the way. No killstreaks. No map advantage. No gear. No excuses. Super Street Fighter IV is the finest current game that the fighting game genre has to offer. With remarkably deep mechanics, great balance, and a seemingly limitless skill cieling, it's obvious why that after 4+ years, the latest iteration of Street Fighter 4 is still the most played fighting game out there these days. Button mashers beware, you'll get nowhere online against the people that play this game. You'll get your ♥♥♥ kicked relentlessly until you learn to kick back, but earning that clutch victory against a skilled opponent is one of the most satisfying feelings in all of multiplayer gaming. For those that want a truly competitive experience, I really can't reccommend any game as highly as this. That is, as long as you're ready to rise to the challenge. It will be a very long and brutal road to becoming a good player in a game like this.","November 29, 2013","true","443.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Of course you don't.  Why??  Because they all sucked a mile of chicken butt.  There's actually a long list of fighting games that have been put out to the masses over the years but only a choice few actually stand out amongst all the others as great and memorable fighting games.  Ultra Street Fighter IV along with the majority of the Street Fighter franchise is one of those few.  Pop quiz time...... Name all the current Ultra Street Fighter IV characters that also appeared in the original 1987 release of Street Fighter.  I'll give you the answer at the end.\n\nIf you've never played a Street Fighter games now is a great time to try your hand at it.  Controls are smooth and easy to grasp with a little work.  Gameplay is realitively easy to grasp but difficult to master, which in my opinion is a mark of a great game.  Online play seems to be smooth and there's plenty to do solo too as no two fights, online or off, will ever be the same.  With all the different characters in USFIV there's bound to be at least one character you side with,  As a matter of fact, there's so many different characters that if there was a downside it's that it's hard to settle in on  just one fighter if you'r new.\n\nIf you have played Street Fighter games before then what are you waiting for?  There's a fairly good chance at least one of your favorite characters from a previous version is just waiting for you to use them in a fight.  All your old memorized combos, supers, are still here and most likely use the same movements and button combos to execute.  And if you're looking for something new there's plenty of new and new/old characters too as well as some new moves and ultras.  This has certainly got to be one of the prettiest looking Street Fighters to date.  Colors pop, backgrounds look amazing and have loads of funny/interesting characters in them, and every character has several different DLC costumes you can buy if you so choose.  Other than the cosmetic character costumes though there's no game changing DLC within USFIV so yo don't need to worry about pay to win junk here.\n\nOverall the game looks and plays amazing and is great fun.  Since you can also play two player on the same screen/PC it also makes a great party game and looks amazing on a nice big screen TV or monitor.  If there was one major downside it would be that the game doesn't play well with a keyboard/mouse or a standard Xbox controller.  You can do it sure, but you'll most likely be at a disadvantage when playing against someone who has invested in and trained on a fightpad, fightstick, or one of the newer hitbox controllers.  Owning one of those types of controllers though opens up a world of other interesting gaming on Steam though as all fighting games and many other arcade style games found on Steam just feel better when you use one with it.\n\nSo the answer to the question at the top:  Ryu, Ken, Gen, Adon, and Sagat.  There was also another character named Mike who greatly resembles the boxer Balrog so I guess he gets a half point...  Another character from the original Street Fighter named Eagle also appeared in Capcom vs SNK but not in USFIV.  There's your history lesson for today folks...","February 10, 2015","true","30.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Don't be ignorant about the online ranked match lag. It isnt the game's fault, it's steam's. Most of the time, it's pretty decent any way. Now to the actual game.\n\nPros:\n-Deep gameplay you would expect from a Street Fighter title\n-One of the best rosters the series has ever seen\n-Very ballanced game, matchups dont get any worse than 3-7, and there aren't many 3-7's\n-Simple enough for a beginner, complex enough for the fighting game gods\n\nCons:\n-The sound quality of the in-game chat is really bad\n-Community isnt very big (this game is played mostly by console players)\n\nMisc. Comments:\n-Best played on an arcade stick, but a standard game pad will suffice\n-Players on steam aren't as good as the players on console (For example, I would consider a player with up to 500PP "free" on console, but on steam, i would consider a player with up to 900PP "free"\n-Patience is your greatest weapon in this game\n-There is a ton of input leniency (it's good and bad, depends on the situation)\n\nHence, I would highly recomend this game to any one, even if you aren't really a fan of fighters. This one is a ton of fun. I have about 116 hours on steam, and another 200 hours on console invested into this game.

The smoke, the loud cheesy music, and the nasty Cheetos residue that seemed to be on every joystick.\n\nStreet Fighter 4 (in this case Ultra Street Fighter 4, not to be confused with the other 4 iterations) keeps this spirit alive in arguably the most classic fighting franchise in history, with fresh coats of paint and brand new systems. Being a 6 button fighter, I'd imagine you already own a PC compatible arcade stick or a different pad if you so prefer. Unless you want eternal carpal tunnel or feel the need to flex your masochistic man-boobs, avoid using the keyboard at all costs.\n\nMost reviews will say "DON'T EVER BUY THIS GAME EVER EVER CUZ LAAAGGG :((((" and they honestly have somewhat of a point. It's difficult to improve at such a difficult game without fighting others online - one of the most demanding online games to date that requires near perfect execution, which is damn near impossible in some of the servers you get set into during a ranked match. As long as you aren't playing on a toaster, this game will run perfectly fine for all other modes including 2 player local versus. But let's face it, at least 80% of your playtime will be in the training room against an auto-blocking Abel. Let's face it, he has the most consistent hitbox, or maybe you just hate the French.\n\nAll in all, USF4 is that arcade experience we've always known and loved, but excluding those guys who don't shower and wear Etnies. What a bonus! Comes packed with great content and all them #alternateskinzzz. If Capcom can get their ♥♥♥♥ together with the netcode, there's absolutely no reason for a fighting game enthusiast to not pick this title up on the genetically superior platform.","March 5, 2015","true","660.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It was released to keep SFIV fresh while waiting for the next installment, Street Fighter 5.\nOmega is hit and miss. Some characters completely changed compared to their "vanilla" counterparts, other got some welkcome (or unwelcome) additions. It's all but balanced, but I don't think that was the main aim for this mode.\n\nBe aware though, for newcomers this game can be brutal. The largest part of the userbase are players with years of experience. It's a game with a pretty steep learning curve, as a newcomer, be prepared to get utterly destroyed the first week or even months. Because of that, even the games' online matchmaking is off at times. As a newcomer, you'll face off against players whose skill is way beyond yours.\nSure, there are trials to get to know the characters and their possible combo's, but a lot of those combo's are of the flashy, but not so useful kind.\nAs a beginner, it's more useful to learn spacing and how to punish, coupled with some basic combo's you'll be sure to land when the need arises.\nSo my best advice is find to find some players at the same level as you or slightly above. It will keep the saltyness levels manageable, and won't make you quit the game after a week.","December 27, 2014","true","655.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Even though I have it set to not recommended, I plan on continuing to play this game extensively. I also think it's a very well made game with extremely tight balance. Yes, even Dan is playable in this game (though still not great, by design).\n\nIf you're a fighting game enthusiast, then odds are you already own this game. If you don't, and you really are into fighting games, then get it. I fully recommend it, just be aware that this game is much slower paced than most 2d fighters. Combos tend to be short and difficult to execute, as opposed to being long and fairly easy. Other than that, there's nothing here that should be out of the ordinary to you.\n\nFor everyone else... this is not a game you can simply pick up and begin playing. The single player content is as bare bones as could be, providing a training mode, a short arcade mode, and then a series of trials for every character. I'll get to the trials in a moment.\n\nQuite simply, this game does not teach you anything. It does not delicately introduce you to its mechanics and help you learn. If you want to play this game, you must dedicate yourself to it or else you're basically throwing your money away. I've played a lot of fighting games, especially in the Soul Calibur, Smash and Marvel vs Capcom series, and this game is the single most prohibitavely difficult game to begin playing of any of them. The trials I mentioned, while they do help you learn some things about your chosen character, there's nothing in the game that teaches you about the core fundamentals of how to play it.\n\nAt this point, I've spent more time practicing, studying (using online research, as again there's not much here that will teach you on its own) and learning this game than any other I've ever played. That includes things traditionally considered hard to learn, such as MOBAs like Dota 2. In fact I'd probably guess I've spent as much time with this game trying to learn it as I spent with the majority of the college classes I took when I was still in school. I am not exaggerating in the slightest. And after all that, I still lose the vast majority of the time, despite the fact I have fairly good win percentages in other fighting games. Or at the least, not as crushingly awful as my current 15ish to 120ish win:loss ratio.\n\nYou're also probably going to want to buy a specialized controller for it, like a Madkatz Fightpad or an arcade stick (and good arcade sticks cost as much as some tablets, keep in mind). You can play it with a keyboard or a regular controller, and there are a small number of really good keyboard warriors, but I think it's generally accepted that these methods are harder than playing with a stick or a specialized fightpad controller.\n\nAnd that's really why I have to set this game as not recommended, despite the fact I love it. It's entirely unacceptable that I am currently almost 70 hours played after doing online research since the game does almost nothing to teach you anything itself, and I still barely understand what's going on. At this point I'm just continuing to play it because I'm just starting to reach the point where I don't feel completely lost and overwhelmed, but the satisfaction I get out of it is about the same as if I had just booted up my Wii U and played Smash Brothers instead, a game which is far more accessable.\n\nIf you have a true commitment to learning this game, and you don't mind getting utterly crushed for an extensive amount of time and buying extra peripherals just to play it, then go ahead and get it. Also, pick Guile or Ryu for the first little while, as those characters are made to help new players learn the game while still being powerful at high skill levels. Pick Ryu if you like quarter circle characters, or Guile if you like charge characters... and if you don't know what a charge character is, look it up, because the game won't tell you. For everyone else, save your money and look elsewhere. You will just get frustrated and feel like you wasted your time.","December 25, 2014","false","91.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

If you're an experienced fighting game player you probably already know why you love or hate this game!***\n\nThis is the gold standard for fighting games. No fighter out there is more balanced, rewards fundamentals and guesses/reads more intelligently, or has the staying power of USF4.\n\nThe balance is so impressive. So often, fighting games eventually mature to the point where people have found the 2-3 most powerful characters and the rest of the cast is ignored. In USF4 there are definitely characters considered better than others, but the "top tier" consists of almost a dozen characters, and every single character of the 40+ in the game, even the "low tier" is extremely viable.\n\nThis game will force you to play more solidly than a lot of other fighters. Button mashers beware - you may take a few rounds now and then but this game is designed to punish you HARD. In fact, if you're new at this, THIS GAME AND EVERYONE WHO PLAYS IT WILL KICK YOUR ♥♥♥. It will stay that way for probably at least 100 hours in. And even then, the skill ceiling is practically infinite. When I bought Street Fighter 4: AE I knew nothing about fighting games. 1400 hours later I'm finally at a level where I'd consder myself "decent". On the way, I've discovered everything about what makes fighters an intelligent, deep, addicting, and all around amazing genre, way beyond what I had ever imagined. It's a genre that can make you feel the raw sting of defeat (where unlike in MOBAs, you only have yourself to blame) and the consequent high of a hard-won victory.\n\nThere is a definite lack of in-game resources for learning, so you'll start off stuck in a trench of sorts. You'll have to spend a long time reading up online and practicing to get acclamated to the game systems, which to some may seem archaic at times (1 frame links are a common source of frustration). But if you can fight through this and make it out of this phase you'll be on a journey to discover what makes fighting games truly amazing.","July 17, 2015","true","654.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Even though I have it set to not recommended, I plan on continuing to play this game extensively. I also think it's a very well made game with extremely tight balance. Yes, even Dan is playable in this game (though still not great, by design).\n\nIf you're a fighting game enthusiast, then odds are you already own this game. If you don't, and you really are into fighting games, then get it. I fully recommend it, just be aware that this game is much slower paced than most 2d fighters. Combos tend to be short and difficult to execute, as opposed to being long and fairly easy. Other than that, there's nothing here that should be out of the ordinary to you.\n\nFor everyone else... this is not a game you can simply pick up and begin playing. The single player content is as bare bones as could be, providing a training mode, a short arcade mode, and then a series of trials for every character. I'll get to the trials in a moment.\n\nQuite simply, this game does not teach you anything. It does not delicately introduce you to its mechanics and help you learn. If you want to play this game, you must dedicate yourself to it or else you're basically throwing your money away. I've played a lot of fighting games, especially in the Soul Calibur, Smash and Marvel vs Capcom series, and this game is the single most prohibitavely difficult game to begin playing of any of them. The trials I mentioned, while they do help you learn some things about your chosen character, there's nothing in the game that teaches you about the core fundamentals of how to play it.\n\nAt this point, I've spent more time practicing, studying (using online research, as again there's not much here that will teach you on its own) and learning this game than any other I've ever played. That includes things traditionally considered hard to learn, such as MOBAs like Dota 2. In fact I'd probably guess I've spent as much time with this game trying to learn it as I spent with the majority of the college classes I took when I was still in school. I am not exaggerating in the slightest. And after all that, I still lose the vast majority of the time, despite the fact I have fairly good win percentages in other fighting games. Or at the least, not as crushingly awful as my current 15ish to 120ish win:loss ratio.\n\nYou're also probably going to want to buy a specialized controller for it, like a Madkatz Fightpad or an arcade stick (and good arcade sticks cost as much as some tablets, keep in mind). You can play it with a keyboard or a regular controller, and there are a small number of really good keyboard warriors, but I think it's generally accepted that these methods are harder than playing with a stick or a specialized fightpad controller.\n\nAnd that's really why I have to set this game as not recommended, despite the fact I love it. It's entirely unacceptable that I am currently almost 70 hours played after doing online research since the game does almost nothing to teach you anything itself, and I still barely understand what's going on. At this point I'm just continuing to play it because I'm just starting to reach the point where I don't feel completely lost and overwhelmed, but the satisfaction I get out of it is about the same as if I had just booted up my Wii U and played Smash Brothers instead, a game which is far more accessable.\n\nIf you have a true commitment to learning this game, and you don't mind getting utterly crushed for an extensive amount of time and buying extra peripherals just to play it, then go ahead and get it. Also, pick Guile or Ryu for the first little while, as those characters are made to help new players learn the game while still being powerful at high skill levels. Pick Ryu if you like quarter circle characters, or Guile if you like charge characters... and if you don't know what a charge character is, look it up, because the game won't tell you. For everyone else, save your money and look elsewhere. You will just get frustrated and feel like you wasted your time.","December 25, 2014","false","91.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

This may be in part the reason why Street fighter has a smaller (but no less passionate) following than the big MOBA, RTS and FPS games despite being such a rich and strategic game. Because to access that part of the game where you need to consider timing, reading, predicting, matchups etc you must first be able to pull off the moves and subsequent combos reliably, a process that can be a barrier to new players.\n\nBut at the same time this is what makes Street fighter so great. The controller motions and inputs and the special attacks they yield have a sense of logic to them. 'Shoto' characters launch most of their special moves by timing an attack at the end of a quarter circle movement with the joystick. 'Charge' characters achieve their special moves by momentarily holding the joystick in one direction and then pressing an attack as they move it in the opposite. Grappling characters launch devastating throws and slams by doing entire loops with the joystick just before they attack, and Special and Ultra moves are done by pulling off really quick 'double movements' and by pressing down three buttons at once. The inputs for moves don't feel like arbitrary sequences or codes but rather appropriate movements. This sort of gameplay, which has it's roots in the video game Arcade, has a genuinely tactile quality to it that lends itself to representing fighting and martial arts.\n\nOn top of that Street Fighter boasts some of the most iconic video game characters of all time who are conceptually inseparable from their signature special moves. In summary, Street Fighter is to many, including myself, the definitive 2D fighting game franchise and Street fighter 4 ULTRA with it's insane roster of 44 distinct playable characters is the best version to date.","July 20, 2014","true","127.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Hard to pinpoint what ratio that really is.\n\nThe presentation is alright. The 3D models animate pretty well and all, but eh, 2D was better and had much more personality. I wish everybody didn't yell so many quips in mid-combat. Voice acting mainly ranges from unremarkable to bad, with a few exceptions. Music is decent across the board and actually sometimes pretty excellent.\n\nUpgrading from Super to Ultra earns you five new (read: mostly rehashed from SFxTK) characters and a handful of new (read: mostly rehashed from SFxTK) stages. Also probably some rebalancing or whatever that most players will never notice. I gotta admit I really like Rolento though. And I do appreciate the sheer volume of characters.\n\nI...ugh. This game just went so far backwards from SF3 and SFA3. Seems like every action in the game imposes a quarter-second or more delay on anything else you do. I mean I don't -hate- it, but gameplay never seems satisfying to me, always leaves me feeling like I just spent an hour arguing with something. I'd be willing to overlook most everything else except that the AI uses that patented "read your button inputs and always respond with the one perfect thing you are mathematically not prepared for" style which is pretty much one of my least favorite things on earth. That ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t becomes a matter of outsmarting/tricking a computer instead of playing the game. Yes, I know, play with humans instead. If you've got friends to play with, sure, but I don't have the mental fortitude these days to put up with randoms.\n\nI guess I'll refrain from plugging a specific other franchise this time, but SF has really fallen behind all the other mainstream fighting franchises with this one, while others have hit astonishing new strides. I mean, it does feel like Street Fighter, that's for sure. Like SF2 but slower and clumsier. I don't want to call it bad, but I don't really have fun with it, and that should be what matters here -- I can't personally recommend it to most people.","September 4, 2014","false","81.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

It's not possible to effectively play it with a keyboard and it does not recognize a gamepad. In order to play it with a gamepad it requires to switch windows with Alt+Tab and then switch back to the game again. While playing with a keyboard, some characters are not moving back and forth, and it's almost impossible to perform special moves. Besides, special moves do not cause substantial damage. Taking into account the time you need to spend on pressing special combination, it's better to just stick with the combos. The story and character lines are too cheesy even for a fighting game. The gameplay itself is boring. I feel really disappointed with this game, although it was one my favourite titles back in the days of 8-bit consoles.\n\nFull price, costs of upgrade, DLCs and costumes are a steal. Capcom is just exploiting the popularity of the title.\n\nMy only comfort is that I bought USFIV with 75% discount. It's still not worth it.\n\nOverall rating: 4/10.\n\nIf you want a decent fighting game, go get "Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition" or "Injustice: Gods Among Us" during sales time. It has much more to offer for a lower price. Or, if you want something from Street Fighter, go try Street Fighter X Tekken, but it's good only because it has Tekken characters in it.\n\nOh, Capcom, please don't go down that road Nintendo did. Some of your other titles are really great, but if you'll keep exploiting the glory of past days, you'll loose your customers.

Rimmer","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042130595/","373 products in account","TL;DR - Very little content, and multiplayer is too hard. Avoid, unless you like salty Spam n' cheese.\n\n(Updated for Ultra)\n\n\n1) GFWL\n- Support for online play through Games for Windows Live expired July 2014?\n\nUpdate: Online play has been transfered over to Steamworks. Capcom made statements implying that AE (Steam) players would be able to play against Ultra players. However, I have been unable to confirm this. Servers for GfWL are supposedly still active. So, if you did not transfer your game to Steam, have recently purchased AE via Amazon, or still have your old "CD key"... you can still play on GfWL... supposedly. I have not been able to confirm this either.\n\n2) Trial / Challenge Mode\n- A number of factors make this mode impossibly difficult. This mode asks you to perform a specific set of moves/attacks in a sequence. However, there is no explanation and no demonstration. Believe me, it sounds easy to do these sequences, but they are anything but that. The game will ask you to hit your opponent with say, 2 light kicks in a row. You won't be able to do it! It makes no logical sense whatsoever!\n\n- I'm told these are "links". I'm told that with patience and experimentation, you can eventually learn them. I found that you must have perfect timing, spacing and execution. A fraction of a second off, and you fail. The average player will NEVER clear all trials for one(any) character. (Even if you use a guide!) The worst part is that the "dummy" character will block semi-randomly. This means that even if you are good at performing the links, you still risk failure.\n\n3) Online Play\n- The game's matchmaking system is just horrible. It's gotten even worse since the beta patch. The game ranks you in a number of different ways. The game is supposed to use this to find similar opponents. I, for example, have roughly 500 Player Points(PP). When I attempt to find opponents using the "same skill" setting, it gives me players with 3000+ PP. It isn't even remotely close to fair. This, and other factors, make online play is exceedingly difficult.\n\n4) It Doesn't Matter How Much Time You Play\n- The level of competition in this game is too high. My win percentage, after nearly TWO YEARS of serious effort, is around 35%. I've put over 700 hours into this game. (More than shown here, I know. I played on a friend's Xbox before I owned this version. Also, Steam didn't record hours played in offline mode.) I've spent nearly as much time researching in an effort to get better. Nothing has worked-out. Ultimately, I gave up on being good. Improving in the game feels more like work than entertainment.\n\n- The sad part is that I'm actually pretty good at the game. It just doesn't matter because my average opponent is still x10 better. I've wasted a lot of time on this game. Don't make the same mistake! Abandon all hope if you play USF4 online.\n\n5) Online PLAYERS\n- The vast majority of people you'll run into online are jerks. There is a lot of trash talk. There is a lot of rage. (Not surprising really.) It is so bad, I had to mute voice chat. The better players will stomp you, and then play around. They won't even fight you. They'll just run away as long as they have the advantage. If you try to give up, most players won't accept it. They'll hit you a few times, and then taunt until time runs out. Alternately, they send a trollish message like, "whats wrong ;D".\n\n- The kind of person that plays this game... you don't want to know that kind of person. Here's a quote from "The Fighting Game Primer" which can be found at the popular shoryuken website: "Your job is to take the tools the designers have given you - characters with moves - and turn the game into a sheer mess of broken parts that no one ever wants to play again." This ideal has been widely adopted by online players. It is a very good reason to avoid this game. Being locked into place, unable to move because your opponent's attacks never end? That's not fun.\n\n- The Fighting Game Community(FGC) are made up of the most elitist people you will ever encounter. They like to say, "nothing is cheap". Yet these same people complain when someone is "random" or "lame" or "spammy". Their gameplay is highly respectable, yours is lame. See?\n\n6) Arcade Mode\n- The best part of this mode is the arcade experience. By that, I refer to the "Battle Request" feature. This allows online players to challenge you whilst you play Arcade Mode. (Just like at a real arcade!) Aside from that, it's bad news. Even on "medium" CPU opponents can be unbelievably difficult. (Blocking everything and countering/punishing with ultra/super!)\n\n- A.I. has improved considerably in Ultra. It now fights much like a typical online warrior. Which means it will cheese you to death. It will find a move you have trouble dealing with, and it will spam it. If you have trouble teching throws, it'll throw you at every opportunity. If there's a specific special move that keeps hitting you, it'll use that move frequently. This is both good AND bad. For one thing, it's really annoying. (It's nice to just fight a dumb A.I. sometimes.) On the other hand, it better prepares players for online play. Anything that can do *that*, is a BIG plus. The A.I. will also block/avoid/punish a lot of things that previously, it would ignore. (Like Ultras. Instead of just eating them. Although it still does that occassionally.)\n\n- Seth still too strong. It must be hard to balance a character with all the greatest moves the game has to offer! Still... more than a little ridiculous that everything he does is un-punishable.\n\n7) Ultra Combos\n- Ultra combos are like super moves, only more potent. Ultras are represented by a meter separate from your super meter. The ultra meter is charged as you take damage. The idea is that this gives you a big attack with which to make a comeback. Unfortunately, most characters make it VERY obvious that they are going to utilize their Ultra. As a result, most Ultras are very easy to block or evade entirely. Even worse, your character will just stand there helplessly for several seconds afterward. So, performing your Ultra could lose you the match.\n\n- It is possible to make your Ultra part of a bigger combo. However, this almost always requires a difficult timing that demands precise execution. (Which can be ruined by marginal lag.) It's just another tool for the good players to beat you. So much for a comeback!\n\n8) Old-School Experts\n- Many of Street Fighter's biggest fans (and pros) have joined Capcom over the years. As a result, SF4 is "By pros, for pros." If EVO is any indication, they like SF just the way it is. Many pros acknowledge the game is quite difficult to get into, but they have no idea. If you developed your skills back during the days of S-Turbo, then you don't know what it is like to start these days. A lot of what you have learned has become something you just assume, or take for granted. I'm being asked to learn, before I can EVER hope to win, TWENTY-FIVE YEARS worth of tactics and strategies.\n\nI gave up on this one. I only play to remind myself why I quit! I can't recommend it to anyone. Even if you have LOADS of free time to sink into the game. After two years of effort, I'm ready to say it's just not possible to get into this genre. You have to have natural talent. You simply CANNOT train to be good at this game.\n\nDon't believe me? Have fun losing. Because, if you are not god-like-perfect at fighting games, losing is the only possibility when you play Street Fighter IV online. If you hear that this game is great for casual play, please know this is a lie. This is not a game for casual or even average players. This game is for fighting game PROS ONLY.

It features 5 new characters, new stages, new soundtrack and tons of balance changes to the roster.\n\nA word of advice to beginner fighters: Don't buy this game unless you have an arcade stick (fighting stick) or a good gamepad. The keyboard is not meant for fighting games, even if some people CAN make it work. Being good and enjoying a fighting game takes a lot of commitment. Hundreds of hours in minimum and thousands of hours realistically speaking.\n\n+Great gameplay. A good entry-level fighter for beginners too.\n+A huge roster of varied characters.\n+Good soundtrack with many iconic songs from the past.\n+Active community.\n+Smooth 60 FPS animation and beautiful visuals.\n\n-Mediocre netcode. Online multiplayer is still prone to lagging and connection time-outs. This is has been patched somewhat successfully and will be further patched in the future.\n-Could use a proper tutorial à la Skullgirls.

For example, sometimes the MENUS lag. Yeah.\n\nWidespread frame rate and other assorted graphical issues for almost all users from the get-go, with no clear, definitive way to fix them. There are so many guides and posts for tweaks and workarounds that users can utilize on their end to make the game playable, but there are also so many issues that it becomes pretty confusing. Some fixes work for some users and have no effect for others.\n\nWhatever the Steam transition and the release of Ultra did to this game really broke it. The netcode is infamously terrible and has been covered to death. It has improved but still bad overall.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes and no.\nYes, if you are willing to tinker with the game and your system to get it running right. USF4 can be a lot of fun. With that said, there are issues you WILL need to address if you decide to play, and there are still many issues with the online play. So keep those things in mind before you buy.\n\nI don't know if Capcom will get this game fixed.

It won't even come close to acceptable.\n\nUse forced Vsync via your graphics card (NOT IN-GAME VSYNC).  For whatever crazy and nonsensical reason, this game runs better online with it slammed at 60 fps via Vsync and not just because you have the in-game option set to "fixed".  Also, you'll want to mess around with your Vsync options to test for input lag.  For me, I use adaptive Vsync because the game is generally good at staying at a constant framerate on my setup, so this produces the best in both online environments and in terms of input lag for me.  Regular Vsync and triple buffered Vsync cause a noticable delay on my rig.  For others it is different and it really just depends, but using Vsync in some manner should be aimed for.\n\nThe game is standard SFIV fair: easy to understand, hard to master.  This game is both deceptively accessible and not accessible.  Be warned, you will have the urge to practice.  And if you don't, well time to move on I guess.","March 21, 2015","true","615.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I feel that no fighter collection would be complete without this one. In my personal opinion I'm not the biggest fan of fighters but this one catches my attention. I've always kinda sucked at fighters but this one was easy to learn because of its great range in characters. Some characters are very simple for beginners and get gradually more complicated as you rise in skill level. That being said there are very few to no characters that i would say are "op" or "cheap" and none of which are unbeatable given your own skill level when facing them. The networking isn't the best as we all know, but I can't say that it's been horrid for me when playing with people in my area or others that share the same connection. I've used almost any controller you can think of from consoles to fight sticks and havent had any issues.

It features 5 new characters, new stages, new soundtrack and tons of balance changes to the roster.\n\nA word of advice to beginner fighters: Don't buy this game unless you have an arcade stick (fighting stick) or a good gamepad. The keyboard is not meant for fighting games, even if some people CAN make it work. Being good and enjoying a fighting game takes a lot of commitment. Hundreds of hours in minimum and thousands of hours realistically speaking.\n\n+Great gameplay. A good entry-level fighter for beginners too.\n+A huge roster of varied characters.\n+Good soundtrack with many iconic songs from the past.\n+Active community.\n+Smooth 60 FPS animation and beautiful visuals.\n\n-Mediocre netcode. Online multiplayer is still prone to lagging and connection time-outs. This is has been patched somewhat successfully and will be further patched in the future.\n-Could use a proper tutorial à la Skullgirls.

If you care about tier lists you would see that tiers are pretty close to each other. Of course top tier has a small advantage but tiers shouldn't matter to people that have less than 1000 hours of playtime. There's no god tier like in some fighters. Replayability is off the roof with this franchise.\n\nUltra Street Fighter 4 has the biggest online fighting game community so if you want to have lots of online matches I recommend this. Some people have issues with online but it works well for me as long as you stick with endless.

It won't even come close to acceptable.\n\nUse forced Vsync via your graphics card (NOT IN-GAME VSYNC).  For whatever crazy and nonsensical reason, this game runs better online with it slammed at 60 fps via Vsync and not just because you have the in-game option set to "fixed".  Also, you'll want to mess around with your Vsync options to test for input lag.  For me, I use adaptive Vsync because the game is generally good at staying at a constant framerate on my setup, so this produces the best in both online environments and in terms of input lag for me.  Regular Vsync and triple buffered Vsync cause a noticable delay on my rig.  For others it is different and it really just depends, but using Vsync in some manner should be aimed for.\n\nThe game is standard SFIV fair: easy to understand, hard to master.  This game is both deceptively accessible and not accessible.  Be warned, you will have the urge to practice.  And if you don't, well time to move on I guess.","March 21, 2015","true","615.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It won't even come close to acceptable.\n\nUse forced Vsync via your graphics card (NOT IN-GAME VSYNC).  For whatever crazy and nonsensical reason, this game runs better online with it slammed at 60 fps via Vsync and not just because you have the in-game option set to "fixed".  Also, you'll want to mess around with your Vsync options to test for input lag.  For me, I use adaptive Vsync because the game is generally good at staying at a constant framerate on my setup, so this produces the best in both online environments and in terms of input lag for me.  Regular Vsync and triple buffered Vsync cause a noticable delay on my rig.  For others it is different and it really just depends, but using Vsync in some manner should be aimed for.\n\nThe game is standard SFIV fair: easy to understand, hard to master.  This game is both deceptively accessible and not accessible.  Be warned, you will have the urge to practice.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tfgrhinehart/recommended/45760/","tfgrhinehart","TFG Rhinehart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tfgrhinehart/","151 products in account","[Opening]\nI'm going to have to revoke my previous review for this game because I just realized I've played every Street Fighter game 'cep' 1 and Alpha 1, including the Street Fighter V beta.  And, in hindsight, I've discovered just how terrible the controls are in this game.\n\nI grew up in the arcades back in the day, playing Samurai Shodown, Street Fighter II Champion Edition, World Heroes and whatever else I could stick my quarters into.  I've always known fighting games to have tight controls, and while I haven't always played them competitively (as much as I would've loved to), this game does not have tight controls.  Lemme tell you what you can expect to see a lot of in this game.\n\n[The Cons]\nFirst off is negative edge.  Negative edge is present in all fighting games.  When you press a normal attack button, then cancel it into a special move, occasionally fighting games will take the previous button press and apply it to your next movement.  This usually happens if you take too long to release the first button you press in this sequence.  In Street Fighter IV, you can expect to see this happen a lot.\n\nThe next one is something I honestly don't know if there's a name for yet.  People who play this game will burn meter if for no other reason than to prevent the use of a super move.  They do this because sometimes, when you do a special move with a similar motion to your character's super move, the game will automatically cancel your previous special move into a super move, even if you only pushed the button once.\n\nOne frame links (and two frame links, etc.).  Just one frame links.  This is the only fighting game that has them.  For the uninitiated, a one frame link is when you press one normal attack button, then press another one at ONE VERY SPECIFIC frame of animation from the previous attack.  One frame at sixty frames a second.  Doing this is insanely difficult, ESPECIALLY ONLINE, and takes more patience and practice than anything I've ever had to do and I've been playing fighting games for over twenty years.  I just keep my combos simple.\n\nThe input leniancy.  This is the game's worst offender.  You will get misinputs for days on account of how the game "guesses" when you do any complex motion.  It even lead to a glitch (or "feature") called priority linking, or plinking, in which you press two buttons of the same type.  Say you want a medium kick to come out at the speed of a light kick.  What you do is press both buttons and the game will always give you the attack of the stronger button, but it gives it the priority of the lesser button pressed.  This makes combos easier, but this input leniancy applies to every button pressed.  When the game handles directional inputs...honestly, I don't know.  I haven't really figured out how it handles those at all.  There's been too many times I just don't know how I got the input I got.\n\nAnd before any of you scrubs who never played a Street Fighter game before come running to defend it saying "You just can't do these moves/combos 'cuz you suck," remember.  I've been playing fighting games for over 20 years.  I've put way more practice into Street Fighter as a franchise than any of you.  That being said, however, I'll list some pros, now that I've got all the cons out of the way.\n\n[The Pros]\nIt's got a great cast of characters from all the Street Fighter games and some new ones.\n\nIt looks great.\n\nThe PC version has easily the best netcode.  You'll still get some lag (and laggers), but netcode doesn't fix people's bad connections, it just makes the game flow a little better.  And it does flow well.  When it wants to.\n\nBeing the most popular fighting game currently on the market, you'll never have trouble finding people to fight.  Online is always crowded, no matter which platform you play it on.  It saddens me that I can't blame the netcode for some of the BS that happens in this game.\n\nRanked mode's scoring and ranking is based off the same as professional chess tournaments.  You get points when you beat somebody, lose 'em when you lose and those points determine your rank.  PP (Player Points) applies to your rank as a player and BP (Battle Points) refers to your rank with your current character.\n\n[Closing]\nPlay 3rd Strike on home consoles or wait for Street Fighter V.  If you haven't played this game yet, you're not missing anything.","May 10, 2015","false","816.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

SSF4:AE is something akin to SFII with a glossier coat and several new features, making for a well-balanced game that both novice and veteran fighters can pick up and enjoy with ease. Tons of neat characters, great music, and appealing visuals make this game one rock solid fighter. Unfortunately, the multiplayer aspect requires you to sign up for Games For Windows Live, which, had I known that, would have dissuaded me from buying it.","July 13, 2012","true","41.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sabrewylf/recommended/45760/","sabrewylf","Sabrewylf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sabrewylf/","192 products in account","USF4 is currently the fighting game on Steam if you're at all interested in multiplayer. In terms of playerbase, the only real contender is MKX, but the online infrastructure on that is terrible and as such, most players playing it are actually playing the single player modes. Skullgirls' multiplayer has roughly 1/3 to 1/4 of Street Fighter's playerbase, and while it has an excellent tutorial mode and great netplay, it has the typical 'anime fighter' problem of having very fast gameplay and (generally) featuring more than two characters per match. This can get it in the way of learning; it's not always easy to identify what you're doing wrong or even what move the opponent did.\n\nUSF4 is a game with a steep, STEEP learning curve that is only exacerbated by its tight-knit community and the fact that the game is about seven years old. The majority of the players you'll come across online are hardened veterans and for a new guy like me, it can be maddening. I'm exceptionally proud of my ~15% win rate.\n\nIn my opinion it's the best option you have right now for learning fighting games. It's not too fast like Skullgirls can be, there's a community that's very receptive to newbies and will answer questions, and it's perfect preparation for the big fighting game boom pc gamers will get in 2016. Some time next year we'll get both Street Fighter V and Killer Instinct, and USF4 is your metaphorical gym membership to get ripped for those releases.","October 2, 2015","true","165.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recently was diagnoised with MS and over the past few months gaming and life in general has gotten harder for me due to a number of issues, one of which is lose of motor control in my right hand.  I decide to help battle this by doing my own physical therapy via gaming.  Granted it is rather humbling that my 10 year old daughter is slaughtering me in fighting games, but none the less we are having fun.  Okay this is my lead in for this and a couple other fighting games I am reviewing tonight mostly to just set the some background.\n\nRight now there are three fighters we are playing Injustice, Skullgirls and Ultra Street Fighter IV.  Each of these three have their pros and cons.  Injustice has DC characters we enjoy.  Skullgirls has unique tag teams and artwork.  USFIV has a huge list of playable characters and is very well balanced.  My daughter thrashes me bad in the game.  Yes I am man enough to admit it.  That said we are still having a good time.  I picked up the game while on sale however and can't say that for the normal price that we would like it better than Injustice or Skullgirls.  Mainly because it is a complex game and the skill level is high.  I can't speak at all to online or against AI as I have only played against her.  All in all though we have enjoyed the game.  My daughter LOVES playing as Rose.  One question, OMG what is with the women and their huge thighs?  lol.","July 24, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is rely hard to be good at multiple characters, it takes some time to master one character. I have around 500h hours in this game and can play only 1 character at a decent level.\nCombos are done by 1 - 2 frame links, you need to spend some time in a training room if you want to get a hang of them. The best thing about them, is that in "trials" there are only few combos, all other combos you have to figure out by yourself or just look them up on youtube.\nThere are multiple gameplay styles posibilities with same character. You can be super agresive, or rely passive or just find your own thing. You can play at prety decent level without complicated combos, but you will have to outsmart your oponent more times then.\nThis game is all about multiplayer it runs very smoothly, without lags.\nSingle player is ladder type gameplay with a boss at the end. There a 24 trials for each character that are rely hard, you have to feel the character well in order to complete them.","June 4, 2014","true","285.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I like the way it's so complete compared to it's previous versions, and the new characters are really well done. It seems it's well balanced too, and I had no problems with network play whatsoever, regarding lags and whatnot. I truly recommend you to get Ultra rather than getting Arcade Edition or other previous version, since Ultra also has a "Edition Select" option, where you can switch between versions (not possible during Ranked Matches, off course).","May 17, 2015","true","94.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"World's Greatest Fighting Game" is a bit of a big stretch, I mean it's not smash melee, the actual best fighting game.\n\nPros:\n+Cartoon style graphics (age well)\n+Online\n+Customisable character colours, taunts, actions\n+Multiple modes\n+Plenty of stages\n+Good price\n+Good character roster\n+Great cutscenes (anime and sketch style intro)\n+Sound design\n+Tutorial for moves and some basic combos (Trials/Ultra Trials)\n+Icons and Emblems\n\nCons:\n-Doesn't teach you how to do everything you need\n-Some clone characters\n-Ranking system puts you with people much better (Only won 1/100 matches and only 5 of those people were even close to my ranking)\n\nFinal Verdict:\nI am very impressed by this, though it's my first street fighter I'll probably try other street fighters and maybe even some other fighting games. It's not the best fighting game like it makes it out to be, but as a traditional fighting game it seems like it is up there near the top. It has the problems that all traditional fighting games do, but hey, not all fighting games can be as good\n8/10","May 16, 2015","true","22.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","1"

I recently was diagnoised with MS and over the past few months gaming and life in general has gotten harder for me due to a number of issues, one of which is lose of motor control in my right hand.  I decide to help battle this by doing my own physical therapy via gaming.  Granted it is rather humbling that my 10 year old daughter is slaughtering me in fighting games, but none the less we are having fun.  Okay this is my lead in for this and a couple other fighting games I am reviewing tonight mostly to just set the some background.\n\nRight now there are three fighters we are playing Injustice, Skullgirls and Ultra Street Fighter IV.  Each of these three have their pros and cons.  Injustice has DC characters we enjoy.  Skullgirls has unique tag teams and artwork.  USFIV has a huge list of playable characters and is very well balanced.  My daughter thrashes me bad in the game.  Yes I am man enough to admit it.  That said we are still having a good time.  I picked up the game while on sale however and can't say that for the normal price that we would like it better than Injustice or Skullgirls.  Mainly because it is a complex game and the skill level is high.  I can't speak at all to online or against AI as I have only played against her.  All in all though we have enjoyed the game.  My daughter LOVES playing as Rose.  One question, OMG what is with the women and their huge thighs?  lol.","July 24, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But oh boy how things got better with this one!\nThe learning curve is top notch provided you have the patience to spend some hours on challenges and training room to find out some new tricks and combos. So far, the whole things looks extremely well-balanced and could never complain about a character being too cheap or overpowered (unlike that infamous vanilla-Seth who made me wonder if I was playing Street Fighter or some SNK stuff). The whole gameplay can look pretty SF2esque at first glance but in fact it includes many subtleties I'm discovering hour after hour with pleasure. It's one of those "easy to handle, hard to master" games and even though I'm still basically losing online , the progress I did is extremely gratifying.\n\nOnline playing so far went good, I sure can't complain about the lag when defeated wich is a good thing. They included a replay mode which can record your matches if you wish and it's extremely useful to see where you sucked (no, don't tell me "it's boring to watch" DO IT. You can't imagine all the little flaws you can realize when the pressure went down.)\nDon't listen to guys on forums who speak about cheaters. I didn't spot any cheater here, just experienced players and it's pretty exciting to have such a challenging crowd!\n\nTraining mode is also one of the best if not the best I've seen so far with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of useful options.\n\nFor solo players, IA is ok, but don't ever think that because you just started to master hardest mode you became the Street Fighter God of Battle. Because it's not enough to stand a serious chance online believe me. It will be challenging enough for not so experienced players and allow you to train a bit against characters you don't know (DO IT.) but that's pretty much it.\n\nOne last thing : don't listen to reviews saying online gaming is broken , because this issue has been fixed!\n\nSo well, this fighting game delivers for casual players as well as for experts you can't go wrong with this one, just grab it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","May 5, 2015","true","98.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I dunno, 10 years.  This is the game you basically need to play if you're into fighting games at all, imo.  It's a bit slower paced, yes.  But the roster is huge and varied, there's a character here for just about everyone's style.  The presentation can't be topped, I can't overemphasize how HYPE that ♥♥♥♥ gets.\n\nSF4's neutral game is mostly about footsies and space control, in a really intense and understated way that not a lot of other fighting games can touch.  It's all about fundamentals, here.  You can learn your combos, sure.  You can spend time in training mode; absolutely, you should.  But the mindgames in SF4 are so crazy.  You don't have to be an input master to do well.\n\nIt also just so happens to be incredibly well balanced, especially considering how many characters there are.  It's got a pretty damn good online system, and you can watch other people's replays.  What more could you ask for?\n\nAs of the release of Ultra, there's quite a few new characters to screw around with, including some SF3 characters.  Most of them are pretty cool I guess?  None of them can replace my main, though.  NOW, FACE THE MIGHTY BISON.","July 6, 2014","true","25.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There really isn't any competition when it comes to deep, involved fighting mechanics. You aren't drowned in a quandary of different systems and minutia. Everything simply works.\n\nThe balance is also razor thin. The worst characters (when looking at a 10 point match up tier list) are only 20% below the best. The same can't be said for pretty much any fighting game aside from SF2. Using MVC3 as an example, the best character is actually close to 250% better than the worst (on a match up based tier list).\n\nYou also don't have to sit there and watch the other person play while your character is endlessly juggled for half the match. Combos are there but they are swift and succinct. No more 15-20 second long combos of MVC3 and King of Fighters 13.\n\nThe character variety is amazing. The inputs are tight and responsive while also demanding that you learn your character. There is no dial-a-combo system, so mistakes are still risky but not as risky as Street Fighter X Tekken where stray jabs lead to full out dial-a-combos.\n\nIf you are new to fighting games this is absolutely, positively a 10. If you have the older versions of Street Fighter 4 then this is a 9, seeing as how you've tread this ground before.","September 18, 2014","true","36.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

SSFIV:AE is a very different game to those first few titles but it still evokes the same sense of awe when I play. Ultra SFIV is almost upon us and I am looking forward to the changes and the addition of a few new faces.\nWith all that said though, this game is BRUTAL to get in to as a beginner, even all the years I have played casually never really prepared me for the depth and technical possibilities of the SFIV series. That coupled with the absolutely average connections I get to most people (even in the same area, don't even mention overseas) can mean weeks of losses and probably the most frustration I have ever exprienced in a fighting game. But still, the payoff is there - you practice, you WILL get better.

There is a healthy variety of characters to suit playstyles and the movesets are the same as previous editions of the franchise. Definitely play this one with some kind of joystick instead of a Dpad or keys. Compared to when I played the original with a PS3 controller, the xbox is much more ergonomically sound. It's a solid game offline (haven't played online) and the combo timing is more forgiving  than other titles I've played in the genre. I'd say its major downside is that it feels old, because like most games that come from Capcom, this one doesn't rock the boat much. It's a great title for fans of the genre, but it probably won't win over any new faces. 7.5/10","July 17, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Red focus attacks are a much more powerful version of the focus attack that instead of absorbing 1 hit with the use of "hyper armour" absorbs an infinite amount of hits until the animation ends. A red focus can still be broken however much like a focus attack with the use of a special such as a shoryuken.\n\nAdvanced techniques-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFADC: If you dash during the charging animation of the Focus attack it will cancel leaving your character ready to perform another action.\n\nEXFADC: Certain special moves can be cancelled by using a focus attack to interrupt the animation then dashing which if executed correctly will make your character flash yellow, and it will also consume 2 out of 4 pips of EX meter.\n\nProperties and effects of focus attacks------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHyper Armour: During the charge up animation a focus attack can absorb 1 hit from an opponent. The 1 hit that can be absorbed from an opponent is aptly named Hyper armour, also known as Super armour. Hits that can be absorbed are specific and mostly limited to normal attacks such as LP, MP, HP, LK, MK, HK. Normals that do more than one hit will break a focus attack however, as well as most special moves that a character possesses.\n\nWhite health: After absorbing an opponents attack a portion of your health will turn white. After a time your health will revert to its normal colour. If you get hit while the while health is regaining its colour you will lose the white health as well as take the damage of the attack landed.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","November 3, 2015","true","152.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Initally released in 2008, Street Fighter IV has seen so many subsequent updates and rereleases, some of which admittedly feel a bit unnecessary. Nonetheless, all of these versions have ensured the core game's place in the fighting game scene, It had its ups and downs, but Street Fighter IV is still a very robust and shining example of practically everything the series has to offer.\nPROS\n-Characters from all sorts of games (The original, II, Alpha, III, and a few new ones)\n-The biggest roster of a Street Fighter game I know\n-Several alternate costumes on top of that\n-Easy-to-play, hard-to-master control scheme\n-Version select (only available in local versus(sorry, Omega mode))\n-Evil Ryu is waaaaaay better than regular Ryu\n\nOf, course, it's not without its flaws:\nCONS\n-Character imbalance still sneaks through every once in a while\n-Alternate costumes are paid DLC in spearate bundles organized by character archetytpes\n-Arcade-Last-Boss Seth is still a cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥\n-Lag can pose a greater threat than your opponent, depending on the connection\n-Decapre (Would this be considered petty?)\n\nEven with these flaws, Ultra Street Fighter IV is still the definitive version of the game(even if Seth Killian said that about Arcade Edition), and PC users can mod even more costumes in the game (can you say Spider-Man Fei-Long?). So, in short, I'd still recommend it.

OLD GAME OUT OF DATE DO NOT BUY.\n\nUSF4 basically works now for most of us. Thanks to Valve for fixing the game. Don't expect any patches since Capcom has moved on to Street Fighter V, and once SF5 releases this game will no longer be recommended since the vast majority of players will move to SFV and USF4 will become a ghost town. Until then, there is no reason to not get this game, especially if it's on sale.","December 8, 2014","true","156.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

(This might be because the game was developed and published in Japan)\n* Multiplayer Matchmaking tends to match you with Players ranked alot higher then you.\n\nOverall Verdict:\n86/100.\n\nRecommended Playstyle:\nPro\n\nDownload Size:\n14.81 GB","December 5, 2014","true","90.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
