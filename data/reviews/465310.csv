It's not profound, but I liked it and appreciated it as a noble experiment in media.\n\nTLDR: It's cool - try it. We need more stuff like this.","May 20","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A cyclist having a mid life crisis would be my best guess. It surprised me in that it is all animated on five big screens, I was expecting a static art gallery display so it was a plus and engaging all the more for this, I like all the different things the Vive brings to the table, Art installations to the gamer hell yeah! Support the different and diversify and as in the words of the Pop Group "**** art let's dance!"","May 13","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a good demonstration of what VR can do outside of games.","May 23","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not a game, more of a vr avant garde experiment.\n\nTo the devs however.  I ended up having to watch this sitting down.   The way the screens sort of waver around while I walk/look through them is interesting, but ended up making me sick.  A sort of true 3d environment would be better, at least the option.","May 25","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The surrounding seems to be made out of a stereo cube map, which works only if you rotate on an axe, any translations of your body will cause weird effects and dizzyness. I felt imprisoned because I had to restrain myself from moving to decrease my discomfort before finally giving up during the "show"... I will ask for a refund,  because I can't experience it.\nThe idea is interesting though the execution needs to be rethough.","June 5","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
