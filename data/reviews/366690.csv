I dunno whether it still is, perhaps it's tied with it's sequel.\n\nThe original Cue Club had plenty of games including Killer Pool and a few other fun options for party play. I'm glad they're all here in Cue Club 2. I also love the fact that you have every aesthetic option available from the beginning, unlike the original in which you had to unlock things mighty slowly.\n\nThere were several features now missing in Cue Club 2. Some were quite fun, such as disco lights, strobe, and "dynamic" cue play. Of all of these I miss it's the "dynamic" cue play, as it made the mouse become the friggin' cue. No such feature here. A feature that some might miss from the original is the "chat" feature, but that had too many flaws for me to work it out. I'm glad it's refined so the computer actually feels more human. Pretty cool.\n\nOK, now that I've gotten an old vet's fit out of the way, it's time to put the olive branch where it belongs. Cue Club 2 is well worth your money if you're looking for a pool game. The music makes you feel like you're in a club, which is awesome. The physics are as equivalent to real life as humanly possible, and the visuals can fool you into thinking you're playing the real thing. You actually click the chalk block in order to chalk your cue, in contrast to a command in the original. In my opinion, Cue Club 2 is the very closest you can get to playing a real pool game on a computer.\n\nWould I recommend this over the original? No, I wouldn't. But does that mean I want you to have the original instead? You're silly if you didn't see the fact that I think this game's worth it!","March 31","true","4.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","4"

Realistic table + ball physics, tons of game modes and customisation of cues, ball sets, table cloths. Coupled with chill out jazz. I was really impressed at the developers who are active on the steam forums and even implemented a suggest I made! If you're looking for a pool or snooker game on steam definitely check this one out.","May 17","true","10.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"
