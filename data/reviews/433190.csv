I was actually shocked when I got into the game and was blown away by the scale and feel of the environments.  It definitely feels like early access right now but that's because it is.  You can see this in some of the UI, the AI is predictable and parts of the game aren't accessible yet but the potential is there to see.  One complaint I recall was about there being no content, however that is not what I found and when I checked the hours played of that review, it was under 10 minutes.  I wasn't even flying out of the first hanger in 10 minutes with the database and just hanging around.  Once you get going, this game does have a lot to offer.  I was particularly impressed with the music.  It was not over-bearing and sounds professionally mixed, giving an ambience that set the scene as you controlled your way out of the claustrophic shuttle bay and majestically burst into a huge and artistically displayed zone in space.  One question I asked myself was do I prefer this or Eve:Valkyrie?  Well both seem too different to me.  Eve feels more like a VR experience on rails where Starfighter plays more like a game in VR.  Considering the AAA money and talent that went into Eve:Valkyrie, it says a lot about the indie scene and this developer in particular.  I've no regrets buying this in it's early access state and neither does my son who loved it too.","April 30","true","12.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","2"

But I will try to simplify it for the sake of this review.\n\nSteam is telling me that I have 0 hours played.  I finally found the time to sit down with the game and played for a solid hour and a half.  The only reason I stopped to be honest was because I needed to give my brain a break from VR.  I haven't even looked through the database content yet.\n\nThe quick version is that I had a ton of fun in that hour and a half. The game is very reponsive and beautiful to look at.  Great sense of scale and immersion.  Love the sound assets (non-music).  All in all it's a fun time.  The framework and foundation is very solid.\n\nWith that being said the game is in Early Access and there is still a bit of work to be done.  As mentioned I posted a very large write up in the suggestions forum. so if you are interested you should go check it out.\n\nThe plus side is that the developer is working to fix issues that people are having, lots of updates and is listening to feedback.  My personal experience was smooth, no bugs or performance issues.  Everything loaded quick and was on point.  Keep in mind that you do need a pretty beefy machine to run VR properly (I am running an AMD FX 6350, 8gb RAM and a 980ti).\n\nWith more development in the Early Access phase of this project I think that this title has the potential to be an amazing VR expirence.  Don't count this title out, afterall it's one guy doing the work.\n\nI guess the bottom line is that I had fun and can't wait to see where the game goes from here.","April 29","true","1.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

I had problems with my old card (780ti) but it works great with my  new strix 980.   This game really gives a sense of presence and the scale of the game is great.  I have had a go at most things,  most time spent on scramble which is the most fun.\n\nThe game has a lot of detail, there are a few minor bugs and the hud could do with some more work.    The main problem for me is having to start the game 5 or 6 times before it decides to start with my rift.  This game has a lot of potential and I look forward to seeing it progress.","April 16","true","22.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","6"

(Top right VR icon in steam.)\n\nGot VR?  Want to go on exciting missions as a space fighter pilot?  Want to immerse yourself in a fantastically rendered, battle hardened universe, where you are a member of a topflight squad?  Then this game is for you!\n\nThis may be indie, but the immersion and the gameplay are top notch!  Works great with my H.O.T.A.S  and I got totally lost in the CDF Database, looking through all the ships and space stations.  Clearly a lot of thought and love has gone into the lore and backstory for this game.\n\nThe dev is approachable and is open to feedback and suggestions from the community.  I’m having fun with the game and eagerly awaiting updates - I can see myself losing many hours in the CDF universe as it moves towards a full release title.\n\nBe warned Pilot!  Combat is challenging! o7\n","April 28","true","7.4"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","1"

Choosing weapons, managing shields etc. would be nice.\nBut the devs seems to be on the right track.\n\nSo far i prefer this a lot over the usually mentioned VR titles. 12€ well spent.\nHopefully this game gains some attention.","May 27","true","1.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

A crosshair was added for the menus and many bugs were fixed. Of course its still in a very early state, but it gets frequent updates. And it has huge potential.\n\nThe game itself is an arcade Sci-fi shooter which mostly concentrates on Action. It can cause nausea but its awesome to feel like your in space, and the sense of scale is very good! the Planets are gigantic and the scenery has some great variety so you wont get bored to soon. Graphics would need some more polish but keep in mind that this is a one-man game, give him credit for that.\n\nIn conclusion if you need a quick fix for space shooting in VR, this is a good game to start.","May 24","true","3.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I am Beta-testing the Mac version. I will also be naming some cons. I'm not biased ;)\n\nBut, since I tried it out on my gaming PC, I thought I might as well leave a review.\n\nOn with the review!\n\n\nFirst of all, the pros.\n\nPros:\nGood graphics! Because it’s made in Unreal4, that’s to be expected.\nVoice acting is surprisingly good ^-^\nQuite a few different ships (6 in total)\nCool sound effects\nEasy to install! Worked on DK2 very well.\nWorks well with the Steam Controller.\nEach ship is super different. They each have a different HUD, speeds, and sometimes different weapons.\nStealth mode is awesome! You can't see through your windows, but use a black and orange monitor to navigate! And the sounds it make add to the atmosphere!\nMediocre:\nBetween loading screens, you have the default, endless, white void of the Steam VR set up. Not a real problem, but worth mentioning. This is a problem with SteamVR, not the game.\nCons:\nThe crosshair is off centre. This might just be because of my set-up, but I’m not too sure.\nSometimes there is a bit of doublevision. Might just be because I am using a DK2.\nSome of the ships don't have the Stealth/Scout/Fighting/Flying modes. This might just be because of the type of ship, but it is something I noticed. Makes the Scout/Combat Fighter a bit less interesting.\nCrazy fast AI Pilots!\n(Update: Aiming is fine. By moving my head down a little, the laser aligned with the crosshair. Hence why I removed that from the cons)\n\nNote to the devs!\nThe minumum requirements might be able to go down a little, as my GTX970 handelled it easily on highest graphics. But that might require further testing to find out if it can indeed be lowered.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I do recommend it.\nRight now it’s a  7/10.\nWith the cons fixed I’ll up it to an 8/10 or a 9/10.","May 12","true","2.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I use the very popular X-52 Pro and can't use it because currently CDF only works with HOTAS X whatever that is?\n\nNAILS needs to implement custom bindings for joystick rather than setting a number of preset profiles for a few select HOTAS.\n\nIt took Eve Valkyrie devs a while to do this and they are a big team.  Hopefully NAILS will figure out how to implement custom mapping of controls other than xbox controller.\n\nThere is another single developer game Vector 36 running on Unity engine and that lets the user assign whatever controls to any HOTAS.\n\nThe other thing needed I think is better engine sound with low frequency content.  I use a body vibration system that is fed from any low frequencies in games like explosions, engine sounds etc.  The sound in cockpit is currently a bit flat.\n\nThere is an increased sense of speed which is good... perhaps even more would be possible.  Elite uses star dust streaking past to give sensation of speed and the speeds look and feel higher (should be able to whizz past asteroids much quicker than currently possible).\n\nI like the improved menus and the cockpit.","April 16","true","1.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","8"

The draw of a pick up and play space simulator that didn't have a steep learning curve like Elite: Dangerous and wasn't Oculus exclusive like EVE Valkyrie made it a very desirable title for me.\n\nWhen the game launched at double it's current price point, I held off on purchase as it is an early access title and with just a few maps available, it felt like it may be premature to purchase.\n\nThe developer recently lowered the cost to $12.99 so I eagerly picked up the game and gave it a try.  In fact, I gave it a couple of tries.  It just doesn't work for me unfortunately.\n\nThe graphics could be great but have tons of glitches and even on a 980Ti, the graphics settings in game do nothing to improve them.  The gameplay, what little there currently is, doesn't deliver much on the promise of a space combat game in the vein of Wing Commander or Freespace.\n\nI'm sadly going to be asking for a refund for this game and am reluctantly leaving this review to recommend that others skip this one.  I'm hoping in the months ahead, the developer keeps at the game and improves it but this isn't even a title ready for early access at this point.  Keep your $12.99 and buy the Elite: Dangerous Arenas game for 2/3 of the price that is much more polished and already has multiplayer dogfights and skirmishes.","May 1","false","0.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","3"
