The player at first claimed I was added to a battle he had been having with a 'zombie boss' but then changed his story has his apparant groupies egged him on to say that I was too close to his base.

I played for about a month enjoyed the game and finally spent $43 to get the premium and such. To thank me a week later the moderators posted on the newsboard, that myself and a few other clan members are being warned for using auto clickers which I wasn't and dont believe any of them were. When I confronted them about it I was shown a link to a checkered floor we had built which apparently only a bot could build which is the dumbest evidence imaginable for such an accusation.\n\nWill never play this game again, will never support this developer again. I don't appreciate you throwing private business on your news bulletin, and especially hate your false accusations of using third party software when your wrong. You screwed yourself out of supporting players which is the worst thing you could do. Your player base has fallen by about 30 ppl a day since I joined.

A lot of the game mechanics are intuative and fun. The combat can be dynamic, and there can be excellent elements of teamplay and co-operation. The player community is generally helpful and understanding towards newer players. The bans handed out by the chat mods are, on the most part, entirely fair and justified. The game dev has done an excellent job creating a fun, playable, game that is addictive and compelling once you get into it.\n\nHowever there is a flip side to this. As good as the game itself is, the admin community is appauling. Myself and multiple other players felt forced to quit the game after allegations of cheating were publicly raised against us by the Admin team. After days of fighting in the forums it turned out that there was no evidence to support these claims and they were withdrawn by the Developer.\n\nThe gameplay can be repetative and grindy, as with any crafting game, however if you use teamwork and set personal goals then the time flies by. As the game is still pre-alpha it does not hold your hand, but expects you to hit the ground running.\n\nIn summary, this is an excellent pre-alpha game with great potential, but with a heavy handed over zealous admin staff. Until both the game and the Admin community has further improved I recommend that you tread very lightly, and think hard before investing any real money into the game.","April 12","false","009.2"," 141 of 152 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","141","152","3","0"

In the past I have defended the actions of the moderators of this game and have told players that if they keep their heads down and not stir the pot they wouldn't be targeted by mods for no reason, but it appears as though I was gravely mistaken.\n\nAfter playing for quite some time now, the clan that I was a part of was mistakenly targeted by the moderators for using bots to harvest resources.\n\nThey supplied logs to them stating that this was definitive proof that they had been cheating, along with one screenshot of a floor we had built ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/4nmq1f1z3kw2jxx/123123.jpg?dl=0 ) saying that only bots were capable of such an endeavor.\nThe logs showed breaks where the player had stepped away from the computer for given amounts of time to get something to eat, or to take a bathroom break. Not something that bots are known for doing.\n\nMy warning to you new players interested in playing this game is to not bother buying the premium because you're likely to lose any money you invest.

Game is really truely Great and provides hours of entertainment for casual players and hardcore players alike.\n2. This game is indeed better than the mine craft francise and has a wealth of room for improvements. definatly A game that rewards hard work.\n~ con\n1. No usable guide is provided in english beyond picking up sticks and rocks.\n2. there is no way to learn to use the  Ui for anyone who isnt russian. so althought the game  and the controls are great  over 90% of  non-russian speaking people will never know how good the game reallly is\n3. All the negative reviews about the Moderators are absolutly true. Especially that Exas dude. He is absolutely childish and is ruining the game for all  non-russian speaking players. the reason there are so few players is because this and other moderators only want their friends to play the game.\n\n\nSo to close my review I must say that it pains me to see such a great game brought down by mis-management  of the moderators. the language barrier i was able to deal with because the game rewards you for  science and the wiser players have all made mistakes so its normal, even joked about by most players.\nAnd the fact that the game isn't popular couldn't keep me from playing either. But what will abe the reason I never return to this game is people like Xas.

It gets annoying. I see no reason to have this 30 seconds timer make it 5 or 10 seconds insead. Even after you loss a battle you have to wait 30 seconds before you respawn at your restoration tower.\n\nHoards of zombies  ---> Way too many zombies that will attack you and kill you for sure if you are new. I dont think anyone in game has been able to kill the 50+ hoard of zombies all across the map. And they just keep getting stronger and multiplying everytime they kill a player.\n\nHit chance system  --->  Most of your attack will miss. I have heard in game players say the chance of hitting the enemy is like 35% at the start.\n\n\nMaybe it will be playable after a few updates.\n\n\nUpdate:\nCurrently in game everything is destroyable in combat nothing you build is safe.

The actual team as far as I can tell is in a word...Nationalistic\n\n\nDO NOT GIVE ANY MONEY TO THESE HATERS\n\nIf you are not Russian you do not get the same treatment.\n\nRather than go into ALL of the various places I have seen this exhibit itself I offer the following  comparisons.\n\n5 players had their ranking stripped for specific types of resource harvesting, because it is claimed they used auto clickers to do so. The proof appears to be thes people played for 90 minutes at a time with no substantial breaks, not every click was at the same frquency or any of the usual flags. Literally they played too hard\nAt the same time the #1 ranked player happens to be a chat mod, he stated in chat he was asked if he autoclicked he said no they moved on and went after the rest of the players.\n\nYes the mod claims he was investigated so one argue there is fairness, no player was asked if they autoclicked, they simply were named, shamed, and punished without warning.\n\nThe proof was flimsy at best... the lesson... dont play this game seriuosly you will get punished for liking it.\n\n**3 days later the scores are restored but only after days of various moderators insulting users, calling them liars, deleting posts.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VD2LlPL.png\n\nIn this screenshot you see the developer admitting they can't prove anyone cheated, and offering to undo the punishment.\n\nXas asks for people that were wronged to apolgize to him. (I simply cannot believe the balls on this guy asking the victims to apologize to him)\nI ask the developers to apologize to the people they shamed in the news.\nXas (thats right the moderator) insults me (again).\n\nThe second incident I mention happened about a month previous to this one. I prefer not to take individual incidents as examples but I like this for how directly this viloates rules and how the shown responses to a russian differ to that of the english speakers.\n\n2 players are discussing prices in trade, a 3rd related player who I think is related to the prices takes offense and gets insulting, and then racist.\n\nI didnt recognize any moderators on so I screen shot the conversation for later.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/lIZ2U\n\nthe tldr: is rezoq1 accuses elisa of being a liar out of the blue, then says its because "Elisa for me personally, to you there is no problem, I just thought you all at the gene level cheat, if you are special then sorry"\n\nI brought this to a mod later and showed him the screen shots.\n\nThe result was rezoq1 was chat banned for 10 minutes.\nHe then got angry when he got back on yelled in chat and got a 60 minute ban.\n\nThe player mypethk(something actually cyrrilic) in the screenshots I suspect to be a russian mod, no confirmed mods were on at this time.\n\nI contrast this with Purebattles ban, while I thought it was harsh I didnt disagree with the sentiment, the first time.\nThe fact that everytime his ban is up its renewed without him ever gettng to talk is ludicrous.\nPurebattle wasnt even particularly trollish, but he also isnt russian.\n\nIf you look at the reviews by language a pattern is very very obvious. The Russian players are simply not having the same terrible experience with the moderation that the English speakers are.\n\nI screen shot the top rated reviews for the first 3 pages in both english and russian and the difference is quite clear. I invite you to do the same and see for your self.\n\nthe images are cropped just for ease of viewing\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/kZVMG\n\nI obtained the images using google chrome for translation and using the following links;\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/415860/reviews/?filterLanguage=russian&p=1&browsefilter=toprated\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/415860/reviews/?filterLanguage=english&p=1&browsefilter=toprated\n\nAlso if you add my review to the following list you have over 4500 hours of play between the players commenting by posting bad reviews this week.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198084367076/recommended/415860/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/NotoriousNewfie/recommended/415860/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043522706/recommended/415860/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008152915/recommended/415860/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/atsumichi00/recommended/415860/\n\nThe moderation team continue censoring the forums rather zealosly less than a few days after this incident. I screnshot something I guess they didnt want kept around so he deleted the whole thread.\n\nHere we have Xas claiming he is trying to quit as moderator, in a deleted thread started by nick titled "we need a new english mod"\nHe deleted his quitting comment I posted this screenshot of his comment and the whole thread was removed.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/91TezbN.png\n\nso not even a week later and nothing has changed, I feel bad for the players that are getting suckered back into playing on promises of change.

Possibly here for the same reason I am, I wondered. i then asked the chat about this banning phenonenon. i was responded to soon after by a kid (i assume) with the question on if im a troll here about to just spam with meen words. no alas dear boy im here to get to the bottem of this. Xas i believe was the man that answered me next after i said "are there really just power hungery monglanoids banning kids like crazy?" (something along those lines) and he asked if i was insulting him. i said well im only targeting people that abused their power.\n\nthis is around the time the kid from moments ago who ask if i was a troll (we will call him little timmy) started with some nonsense i wasnt paying attention to. after exchanging some words with xas (all of which were polite and well mannored i assure you from my end) i started to notice after i "poked the bees nest" i was no longer talking but. defending myself. not for the zombies or from harsh comments but by sheer stupidity.them making claims of things that were just not correct. the convorsation of me correcting xas and 2 other kids including little timmy, lasted for about 4 mins before i was given a threat of mute! i found this funny considering that i was only correcting them on false accusations. then xas took a vote with 104 people pressent the vote was "should i mute Diablo" this was met with the obvious "i" from the three i was "talking" with and a few others i had not heard from. i then asked if i was going to be muted for a convorsation that they were continuing and also for the insane majority of 7/104 people.\n\ni was at this point laughing as hard as i could at the sheer stupidity of these people one being a seat of power. and after another vote of "who doesnt want Diablo muted". i made a point again of "your really making 104 people vote on my mute none of which care? and i have broke no rule (as much as this sounds crazy i did not break rule i raise my right hand to say that i came to this game knowing i was going to follow the rules and see if i get banned by starting a convo about the admins who were abusing(note that i did not point fingers to anyone. they just instantly took it personal. therefor ... xas being so defensive. kinda raises a red flag)) then xas said "there was no point in a vote" i replied with "then why have one?" {Player Diablo was banned for 1 min} yup one min guys i then said wow really? as some people protested and after i said "are you really doing this to me for just defending myself(more like... teaching children btw) in chat". {Player Diablo banned for 120 mins} did not swair did not spam did not insult past when i called out badmins for being vile and. banned.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME the staff is toxic and more focused on breaking the rules them self rather then enforce them. never once did they attempt to stop themselves from arguing with a player nah.

I don't get why anyone would play it. It is dull, the UI is awful, the graphics are worse than games made 2 decades ago, the combat is simplistic, and unfortunately I didn't get to experience the power hungry mods before I got too bored with it and quit but I don't doubt it for a second.\n\nThe community is quite welcoming, telling me the game isn't for me and to quit after asking what the appeal of the game is. Someone also threatened to hunt me down and kill me...after I said I was leaving the game. So good luck with that one, buddy.\n\nI don't get why anyone would play this.

To help illustrate this I will tell my story.\n\nRead reviews most complaints about Admins okay so don't use that chat fine that can be overcome with some ease. So download boot up game... Why am i in a desert? That is the first problem you surround a person with literal nothing... okay fine i can work with this. interact with sand... nope need a shovel. Okay fine i'll get a shovel. Walk a short distance. Find work bench okay what do i need to make a shovel... There is no shovel option. So now the only thing I can interact with is a bench and the ground... and no way to interact with the ground. Fine i can do this keep walking. Cactus I can do something with that if I have an ax. I remember seeing an ax. Go back open menu for crafting I need sticks, large rock, and wood fibers? okay fine. lets find a tree. 10 minute walk. I found A tree okay fine I'll grab some twigs. Walk some more see a rock. lets gather large rock. Get 5 small rocks and 1 average rock. THERE ARE NO OTHER ROCKS. okay fine well lets figure out this wood fiber thing. needs sticks and small rocks and about 20 of them each. Well hey look i got some research points lets spend them on something. Clothes would be nice. What does it take to make those. A LOT OF RESOURCES\nSee the problem its a walking simulator with some gathering inbetween, but its not fun. The tools to make it fun are behind the scarce resources I need to find. but If thats what it takes then whats the game about.\nAt first i thought it was a cheap minecraft ripoff which, I'll admit, I would not mind but there is a key difference between the two games.\nIn minecraft I can be dropped in a desert but I can do things Dig sand and often resources can be found to do things with. Here I need to put in I would guess about two hours before i got the basic tools. MC about 10 minutes to get the basic tools I could have a small farm and a mud hut in MC in the time it would take me to get the basic tools in this game. I don't mind working for something. I enjoy setting a goal for myself, but when the goal provides no other challenge than to walk in a straite line until you luck upon what you need to get started on the most basic items, then is it a challenge or bad game design?\n","February 21","false","0.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

Try traveling while looking at your map, you'll realize how large the land spans.\n\n- Technology tree progression to unlock more crafting options from your menu and benches.\n\n- Turn based combat (Unless you don't like that sort of thing.)\n\n- RPG stat spreading every time you level up, making unique stat builds.\n\n- Game actually has a lot of potential, depends on what the developers do from now on and their dedication to make the game better and increase content.\n\nCons:\n\n- Thrown into world without actually knowing how to do any of the basic things. (Meaning take the time to actually learn how the game works or else you'll just be walking around not doing anything and spamming chat on how to do ____)\n\n- Game needs an improvement on how combat is initiated and how it works.\n\n- Generally needs more content. Mainly more enemies and maybe create "Known" places on the map where players know where to go to find ____ material. Maybe make the map have certain areas with names such as ___ forest so beginners know where to find basic materials instead of wandering through empty fields and deserts.\n\n____\n\nFor Starters:\n\n- Bottom right corner, one of the tab icons are for the game space map. In general green is plains/forest, yellow is desert and greys are mountains and caves.\n\n- To collect Straw you must find a tall grass resource tile. Move to the side of it, not on it. Then right click the tile to start collecting from the tall grass and you will find straw.\n\n- To collect sticks you have to travel and go find trees (Not Tubalar Blue Trees). You will have to walk up to the side of one and right click the tree to start collecting sticks.\n\n- To collect stones you have to find dome like boulders, and collect them the say way you do with sticks.\n\n- The C hotkey is the crafting menu, but you cna view more advanced crafting options from a crafting bench.\n\n- The Technology tab in the bottom right corner is used for researching technology. At which will unlock more crafting options in the crafting menu and bench.\n\n- You earn research points by killing entities or over time from playing.","February 16","true","30.1"," 73 of 128 people (57%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","57","73","128","9","0"

The random battles that happen when spawned kill you instantly and half of the map is covered in zombies which makes it impossible to leave from the so called "starting spawn" location which is always in the left bottom corner which has a huge desert and a thicket area in which you spawn.\n2.The Graphics where very simular to "minecraft" which "omg" has not been used before to the maximum by everyone.\n3. The Server side lag is horrible the players keep flinging around the map and causes constant "chunk loading" which a game with substantially low graphic usage in which it shouldn't even be "lagging".\n4. I have seen and played a lot of alpha and beta games before and for this game being on the stage it is... its less then satifactory.\n5.

NONE of the buttons worked at all.\nI tried downloading from an extrenal link that was posted by another user, just hoping that it would work this way and it was just the Steam version that was a bit iffy. ALAS, my hopes were quickly shattered to pieces. The buttons worked but that's all about that did on the non steam version. I can't even register an account to be able to play.\n\nWill be giving this one a miss for a very long time if not forever.","February 14","false","0.2"," 39 of 66 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","39","66","2","0"

I am not going to say there isn't a guide because there is, you just need a browser up first and click any of the help buttons 50 times. But I went into this game with a friend. But the game just didn't make any sense. The guide DOESN'T help because it was translated from Russian in Google Translate. First off things don't go in your inventory, they go into the squad inventory yet nothing explains what a squad is in this game and nothing says "Create Squad". When me and my friend met up after 30 mins of learning how the game works, sometimes the ground would disappear along with my friend. I asked where he went because I was actually teleported about 50 tiles away yet my friend said I was right next to him.\nWe didn't pay much attention to chat as other reviews said about people being banned for unfair reasons. But what did happen is some random guy walked up to me and then it said in big red letters that he was going into a battle and I had a option to not enter the battle, both me and my friend hit no and we were both dragged in anyway. Right before it started, about 20 zombies appeared and they disappeared when the battle started. When it started, I was in a huge arena with no one in it, not even me. My friend shared his screen over skype because he didn't  see the same thing. I saw his screen and his showed those 20 zombies, me, himself and the random guy that walked up to us and the arena was even shapped different.\nDon't play it, it's broken. Me and my friend did have a laugh because of it being broken but other than that, it's unplayable.","February 18","false","1.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

(I like that this game is very community oriented)\n-I have had little to no bad run ins with the admins, which alot of reviews claim that the admins are unfair (i have found this to be untrue for the most part)\n-The progression of the game is set up so that you always have something to look forward to getting (Rome was not built in one day)\n-The farther you progress the easier it is to progress (Tech Points will be easier to aquire as you gain Techs that aid in combat or just spend time playing the game as you gain passive Tech Points for just being in the game)\n-The community has been very helpful towards and is welcoming of new players (I myself am one of those people)\n-The combat is a little clunky and can be confusing but overall is solid (will be improved as game becomes more developed)\n-Trading in the game is a "trust" agreement whenever goods change hands not using GC as there is no interface for trading (This may hopefully be implimented)\n-The economy is driven purely by players which is quite refreshing to see in this type of game (One of the best features of the game IMO)\n-There are constant updates it is not a dead game by any means (Updates 2-5 times a week <3)\n\nTo sum this game up it is a good game that has lots of room to grow with great potential, the community is small (for now) and very helpful and generous.

Developers listening to the people in their steam forums for what to add, balance & fix so thats good. Otherwise it started out very poorly balanced with extremely novice mistakes.\n\nNow the reason I give a bad review rating is the chat censorship issues. I have been watching for a couple weeks and it is NOT only because spamming and disrupting. Chat bans are also for complaining about being too harsh on banning somebody, typing a short line in ALL-CAPS(not spamming it), adding extra letters in frustration/fascination("this map is larrrrge") and more. Rumors that bans were also given out for talking English in the Russian chat channel and the main NAZ- uh I mean morality police officer, Xas, spawn-kill camping a player(tho the many posts like these don't last even 24 hours in the forums before disapearing, tho nobody much left who complains about these things these days). The rules contain no spamming, but do also contain 'no swearing' and 'no insulting' which I've experienced lots of without problem for over 15 years of online gaming.\n\nBasically I can't give a good review if theres a constant fear, 'walking on egg shells' feeling to using chat. I find it not only unnecessary to clamp down on a culture thats perfectly fine with swears, rudeness, insults, sarcasm, but I find it also extremely immature and childish to nanny-state players.\n\nIf people want to use Ventrillo or Team Speak with friends to communicate and avoid chat, thats perfectly fine.

The game is unimpressive looking. Though at less then a hundred megabytess I suppose it serves it purposes.\n\nThe terrains are largely bland, huge flat areas, at least near the start, but even then, seeing the same two tiles per biome copied and pasted screams lazy to me, and disinterests me from the game. Mobs are crammed into small areas, where dozens of them pile up on you and ♥♥♥♥ you up to no end with little warning.\n\nAfter I complained about the lack of trees around me one of the devs, or admins reccomended I "will eat my words at coordinates 1500, 750." So I look on my map, happy to have been helped, and directed, by someone friendly to find I had just been guided to a position 3/4 across the game world, a position that would easily take me 15-twenty minutes of pure walking there.\n\nBut I mean, who doesn't want their first experience in a game being dropped in an area where you can't do anything, are discouraged by the game, again and again, are dragged into battles by stupd npcs, all the battles are turn based, mind you, which makes them slow, and uninteresting, to me at least, and especially early game. On top of that It takes you 30 seconds to enter a battle, in which time you get to sit and stare at a nice count down, and then thirty more seconds to exit a battle, that ♥♥♥♥ is annoying, that's a minute per battle I want to fight that is being wasted on waiting...\n\nNot to mention I couldn't figure out how to attack anything, let alone run away from anything. When you are killed, if you haven't had the innate sense that there are respawn towers around the map and activated one, you will be teleported back to the bottom left of the map, forced to walk your way back to where you want to be.\n\nYeah, you should know everything there is to know about this game the minute you hit the button that says "Game"! Because there is no tutorial, ♥♥♥♥ you player, play this new kind of game and learn everything by yourself. Now there are some guides in existance, but they currently so basic and mostly made by foreign language speakers, so they are not the most comprehensive.\n\nWant to look different then the guy you started next to? ♥♥♥♥ you color palletes! We don't need you, or genders, go suck a ♥♥♥♥, because there are only male models so far.\n\nYeah, yeah, I know this is pre alpha, yadda yadda. But no one has a right to tell me to shut up when these people have already implemented a working cash shop in game. If you don't want us to judge your game like we would for a game we would pay for, don't implement mechanics within your game to push players to try and make them spend money. End of story. Otherwise, you should have your game at least mostly together when it's released, and be confident in the product you are showing. Otherwise it shouldn't be released, and you are shooting yourself in the foot anyway.\n\nDefinately an interesting concept, I thought the RTS part of the game would be more involving, instead it's a bad version of minecraft.\n\n4/10","February 17","false","0.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

There is nothing to even show the players where to go or even do. I was lost for an hour trying to find out what to do. Sure some of the sandbox games like minecraft don't have tutorials but they have been cared and played enough for people to vidoes or tutorials of their own.

Xas has been getting a lot of hate but he saw me chatting in game and asked me what happened based off a comment I made on forums. That shows to me that the admin are active on the community forums and in game. They also seem to be a lot more tolerant to peoples play style.\n\n\nXas explained to me that this is a Russian game with Russian staff and in Russia cursing is very fronded upon so in the Russian chat it is very strict with language.\n\nThere is a second chat room for English speakers and they are much more lenient.\n\nAll in all this game reminds me of an open world sandbox Runescape and I love where it is goign and can't wait to see what comes in Alpha and Beta!\n","February 25","true","43.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I entered the game, which was a completely black landscape decorated only by new players, who looked equally confused as I was. Not only that, but when I tried to lower the graphics quality to see if it was an error, nothing happened. I tried the chatroom, but everyone else was either speaking in Russian (although I had specified in my settings that I wanted the chat in english), or was just as confused as I was. Someone complained about the false promises shown on the page that definetely weren't in the game (if you can call it a "game"), and was immediately kicked from the game by a developer, and of course once I mentioned it my game was immediately closed and I was taken to their website: A blank page not unlike their game, with only one sentence (also in Russian) at the top of the screen.\n\nAvoid this game at all costs, unless you enjoy the large open world (completely black void), interaction between players (running through people and getting kicked from the game if the devs hear any blasphemy against their "masterpeice"), and who could forget the promise of beautiful graphics (my character honestly looked like he came out of Satan's minecraft character's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.","February 17","false","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

And what does that mean? Quite a lot actually, the simple fact that it's in Early Acess stops most of the bad reviews I've read, since most of them complain about things like the start button not working (I personally have not experienced any bug in my playtime), if only they had spent the time reading the Note on Early Acess Games, which states, and I quote, "This Early Access game is not complete.." .\n\nBut you've guys have heard enough about that..\nSo, let's get down the the Pros & Cons, shall we?\n\nPros:\n- Open World fun. (Reminds me of Fallout 1 & 2 in a way)\n- Quite expansive tech trees\n- Active Chat (Yes, people asking for help and how to play.. But you'll find a couple of players who understand the game and are super friendly.)\n- Leaderboards & Ranking (Not seen often in this type of games.)\n- Pleasing art style (Personal Opinion)\n- Turn based battles.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of Tutorial (You're just thrown into the wilderness, along with everyone)\n- Ugly UI (Can't be re-binded or customized)\n\n\nThis game has potential, I'm just afraid that people will wrongly review it and that said reviews will make the developers lose interest in the small community alredy invested in the game.","February 16","true","1.1"," 23 of 49 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","23","49","2","0"

(Thankfully exit works)\nThe game button does literally nothing, as i said before you have to wait around 5 minutes before it does what its supposed to.\nThe options button is of course options.\nIn the video section you can change the screen resolution (Which is always a plus but it doesnt help if the game doesnt work), and you can turn on shadows (Which is amazing, but only helps if you can actually play the game.)\nIn the sounds section, there includes "sounds" which you can toggle off or on -Yay?\nFinally the credits button, which first crashed my game when I opened it, but now gives me a big sheet of russian names, so uh... woo?\n\nEither way this menu is terrible and so is the "game" since it doesnt work.

Not a lot of complicated things to learn/read.\nHowever, If you're looking for an easy game, THIS GAME IS NOT EASY.\nYou will start of completely and utterly useless.\nIt will take hours of play-time collecting resources before you're able to progress.\n\nYou must walk a far distance to find resources, because everything is semi-finite. All of the resources respawn, but not very quickly. If an area is heavily populated.. it's going to get picked clean and most likely stay that way. you need to expand and walk to new areas.\n\nThe battle system in this game is epic. It's a LOT of fun, but it's also very difficult. You start off very weak, and mostly everything will kill you. However, you have a brain. The bots are following code. You can manipulate them in ways that will help you win.\n\nA lot of the reviews here on steam are criticizing the chat moderators. These people are mostly just trying to keep the chat some-what civilized. No cussing, no flaming,don't insult the game or other people, DO NOT TALK IN ALL CAPS, do not spam. 100% of the people who were banned did one of those things. Most of the people that are complaining barely made it into the game, because they just started off with "WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ DO I DO?????".\n\n\nThis game is awesome.\nHopefully there's a lot more content to be added.\nLooking forward to it!","February 25","true","669.3"," 43 of 90 people (48%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","48","43","90","9","0"

This isn't call of duty this is a game that strongly resembles the difficulty of Dwarf Fortress.\n\nKeep in mind this game is not for everyone. If you like Dwarf Fortress, you will most likely love this. If you are used to the instant gratification of call of duty then go away.\n\nNow anyways, I highly recommend this game cause I love games like this and this game is FREE. There's hardly any microtransactions you can ignore them and be completely fine. I have had no problems running the game, I opened it, messed with some settings, and started playing right away. It took a few minutes for me to understand what the heck to do but I realized I needed to find materials, and starting out in a desert, its obvious you have to move somewhere else when you start out.\n\nThe UI is a bit messy but its easy to get the hang of and once oyu understand how gathering materials works its a piece of cake. The game seems easy, but very very tedious, which I don't mind personally.

You're tossed into a giant map with nothing to even think about pointing you in the right direction. Alas, there is a friendly english speaking community that will do their best to help you along. TCO is FRUSTRATING, which for me is a breath of fresh air in tireless titles with no actual challenge. YOU WILL DIE.....{edit} A LOT!!!! Get used to it. Overall it's a title worth checking out if you like retro graphics and non-handholding gameplay. Word for the wise though.

I also learned that most of the reviews are straight complaining about things that were their own fault.\nI'm going to run through a list of the most common complaints and explain why they are bias.\n\n-Again this is a list of things that aren't wrong with the game-\n\n-Bad Graphics: this is basically minecraft style graphics right. what did you honestly expect. And graphics aren't even the focus of this game.\n\n-There are no resources on the map: this is flat out false. there are so many resources that they are constantly in the way when walking around. the problem is because people who spawn in refuse to walk 3 feet in any direction and mine up all the resources directly at spawn.\n\n-The Map is too big: its 2050 blocks by 2050 blocks. while it sounds big, its not. think of this in minecraft terms. 2000 blocks is tiny.\n\n-It takes too long to travel: I've walked the entire edge of the map and it only took just over an hour. you should never have to walk that far or that long. there's no reason too.\n\n-The enemys are too hard: you can't be attacked by enemys until level 5 which takes a while. I have 200 hours in the game and my character is level 7. you also have plenty of time to gear up before level 5, and even then they don't agro that often.\n\n-Players attack other players: you are given 30 seconds to turn down an attack made on you by a player, and a giant popup appears in the middle of the screen. if you get attacked you must have been afk, in which case isn't any different then any other game out there.\n\n-Admin's are out of control: From what i've seen they should be banning twice as many people. There are constantly tons of spammers and rude dudes in chat that get told off. they rarely get banned, and only are when they start insulting and threatining others. And I've seen a few people get banned, who deserved to, then go and make a negative review twisting what happened out of revenge.\n\n-Banned in chat: so what? why does getting banned from the puplic chat matter? how does that effect you playing the game? they never ban people for asking for help. if all you needed the chat for was asking for help you shouldn't be banned. if you are spamming in the public chat things that don't help others and get banned, you only have your self to blame.\n\n-Pay to win: Not at all. I personally see no reason to buy boosts. maybe if you wanted to jump right into mid or end game buying stuff would help. but why would you want to do that? You could buy a little to upgrade your base if you wanted, but there's no need to. its super easy to get most things with little to no time.\n\n-No tutorial: it actually does have one... not sure what else to say about this...\n\nFinally got this out there... it was bugging me. Try this game, even to just see what you think first hand. don't believe everything you see in the negative reviews.","April 5","true","513.3"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","11","25","3","16"

You will not be able to connect at all some days, but when you do connect you'll find a decent game though it dose need ALOT of work. Tutorial was broken for me, but I still was able to learn how to play, so get this game if you don't mind a half way decent game for its curret stage, and don't mind not being able to join 24/7, then this game might be worth trying.  Also servers are unstable if you find your self at the menu screen suddenly that was the server crashing. If I was you though I would give this game at least 5 or 4 more days so the devs can fix the unstable servers.\n\nNOTE:Before continuing this review take into factor my play time and also note that I have not gotten anywhere close to even the middle of the game play at the time you read this.\n\nPROS.\n\n1:Easy to learn mechanics for people who are not new to theses types of games.\n2:A tech tree so everything isn't aviable at the very beginning\n3:A tutorial (though poorly translated acording to some and broken for some like me).\n4:A small but nice community so far though that is only for playing 3.5 hours on low populated servers.\n\n\nCONS.\n1:Problems with crafting items must be pressed 2 or more times to start crafting said item.\n2:Research points are gained fairly slow and can make progressing very hard.\n3:Multiple gathering actions must be activated twice or more before gathering is started.\n4:Map and compass are extreamly confusing.\n5:Low population on servers (though to some it is a good thing).\n6:Only 2 server types beta (current) and alpha both as far as I know are the exact same.\n\nEDIT:I recommend this for sure now because servers are now fixed after a couple of days seeing if they where unstable or they just haven't crashed on me yet so don't take my word for it. Anyway even though there are more cons then pros the cons are just small little things (expect for the research points being very slow to gain in fact I'm not even sure how to get them) I say give this game a shot if anything.","February 13","true","4.1"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","4"

Aside from being isotope this game doesn't seem to be anything differant then that game but its free I guess. This game does not tell you what you are doing at all which is fine if the game is focused around being challenging but this game is not, its focused around mindlessly building. If you ever do get bored of playing don't you worry there is also a pay to win option because why not? Even if its just them putting something into the game for the people who like the game to support them I always red flag pay to win. I myself never was a fan of minecraft so take this review with that in mind.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArunDude/recommended/415860/","ArunDude","FireFury","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArunDude/","28 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAlright, first of all, let me go over the good things:\n\nIt's a great Minecraft-based conept, about going out and getting resouces in order to create, espand, and improve your base. The graphics are great, they don't look to bad.\n\nAlright, I know I havn't played much. And that was because it got quite tedious quite quickly. To make a crafting bench,(which I assumed would be simple) you need to sit there for about 10 minutes slowly gathering resources, because you need to chop down at least about two trees, while this is unrealistic and boring. It adds more to the fact of how I cannot recommend this game. Now of course, I wouldn't mind all of this of course, I mean, it is a free early access game. So it can't be that great. But there is something else that really bothers me.\n\nAs you may have read in other reviews, most of the admins are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. One admin in particular everyone seems to talk about is Xas. In fact I got the game specifically to meet him. After roaming around a bit and telling people how stupid it was that you cannot pick up a crafting table once you have created it, Xas showed up and said: 'If you don't like the game, just leave.' Okay, so this is understandable, since I was talking some ♥♥♥♥ about the game. But, that's the first thing he said to me! It's almost as if he doesnt want to be friendly and attract more people to the game! So this immediately got me an impression that this guy obviously hates people who are complaining about the game. In true fact the only reason I went on the game was to have some fun and troll Xas. So, when I said I had heard nothing but negative stuff about him other people defended him in how 'he keeps the chat clear of insults and stuff'. He explains the rules: 'No insulting, no full caps, blah blah blah'. So then, because I'm trolling I go ahead and:'FULL CAPS'. Just to see what he would do, after that I am saying 'so you are gonna ban me for 560 years now are you?' But before I can send it I see I am already 'banned' for 10 minutes. Yes, it's 'ban'. When really, it should be called something like 'chat ban' or 'mute'. Alright, I was expecting that, maybe. In fact I was expecting him to go: First warning, or a ban. But he Immediately when and banned me. Soooo, that's okay. When the 20 minutes is up(yes, it wasn't a 10 minute ban at all.)I say how I like the conecpt of mining and exploring, but it is a shame it is ruined by people like Xas, he says something without putting a capital letter at the start, and just for banter, I am all like:'Capital letter at the start of a sentence, Xas'. His response was hilarious. He literally banned me for 60 minutes... I mean, how is that acceptable? I am correcting him and he goes ahead and bans me.\n\nBut, to conclude, this game could be fun if it wasn't for the fact that mining is so slow and you need so many resourses to build something simple like a wooden table, as well as the fact that the  tutorial says: Craft a 'workbench', when in actual fact the real item is called a wooden table. But yeah, I wouldn't waste your time if I were you. Go and play a good game, not his old piece of ♥♥♥♥.\n","March 30","false","1.1"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","4"

Wish it didn't.\n\nThe game honestly looks and feels like a weekend project done by a single man. No sounds, limited animation, no tutorial..Simply no direction of any kind. It's simple enough to piece together how things work but the game is incredibly baron. This game actually made me physically exhausted due to the sheer level of depression it brings. Called it quits after 10-15 minutes because i didn't feel like going to bed.\n\nFrom what i experienced as of right now, the only feature that you could possibly claim that is working properly, or at least showing signs of functionality is resource gathering. You won't exactly know for certain if you are doing anything until you stand there watching your character grind it's brick hands together and flop them around for a little while.

Instead of moving around with WSAD or arror keys, you click on the ground, which may be a pro or con.\n\nPros:\n-  Very nice idea for a game\n-  TUTORIAL\n-  Doesn't take a supercomputer to run\n-  Good time waster\n\nCons\n-  Tedious\n-  Extreamly resource based (It took me ten minutes to gather the resources for the crafting bench)\n-  Random starting location may screw you\n\nWould I recomend this game?  Yeah, I would.  I didn't play for long, but I know that there are many people out there that like these games that can get you working for hours on end.  I personally don't, therefore I won't be playing this game again, but if you like taxing games that is just "get in and play", then I would deffinatly recomend this game.","March 14","true","0.4"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

There are bugs and right now there is no tutorial so you have to figure it out for yourself or look at the help page.

I know thats pretty blatant. However this game really does hold up its own, the camera view is interesting and new to play with in the game. The UI may need tweaking a bit as the buttons are very small, but they do get explained with tooltips. The overall feel of the game does feel a lot slower to what im used to though which did make it difficult adjusting.

However you're not alone, the community is pretty friendly and there will always be someone willing to help in the chat if you ask nicely. Do I recommend this game? Of course! However, if you like games that aren't much time-consuming and want to chill for a while you shouldn't play TCO.\nAbout the critics, most of them are towards admins that are 'whiney' and 'abussive'. Me, in the 200+ hours that i have on this game have never been witness of anything even close to that, admins give warnings if you dont follow rules and ban you if you keep doing it, there's nothing wrong in that.\n","March 20","true","249.2"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","3","12","0","0"

I think i may puke this is so bad. My grandma can make a better game than this. This makes me want to gougch out my eyes and give them to a homeless man. I think that im going to find the develpors and have a little talk with them about how to make a game. I think FNAF is a pricelewss peice of art compared to this. This game inspires me to go and be outside for the rest of my life and critize how much this game suxks. I think even a caveman can do a better job than this. I think I am going to shut off my computer and send it back to where it came from and get a whole new computer becuase even having the thought of this being on my hard drive makes me puke. I hope all my fellow rebels see this that way we can overcome the empire and destroy this hidious game. This game literealy sits on my hard drive and does nothing but sit there and look distusting. I have run out of bad insults to say about this game that its not even funny. I am glad to say that i will uninstall this game and jump off a bridge. You swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As they say in Texas. I’ll bet you couldn’t pour !@#$ out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won’t go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.\nYou’re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.\nYou are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.\nI will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?\nTry to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.\nYou snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.\nYou are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.\nAnd\n\n","February 13","false","0.2"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","32","7","22","10","3"

TheSootman ANZAC/4th","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198078158854/","95 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI do not often write reviews for games unless it absolutely warrants it. This game may not be for everyone but I recommend everyone to give it a try.\n\nThere are so many reasons for my recommedation including the community which is also big reason why I have rung up 150+ hours in under 9 days of playing this gem.  I usually avoid Early Access games and we all have our horror stories, but this game is growing with regular updates many of the communities requests/ideas actually being worked into the game.\n\nThe game is a mixture of, in my opinion, a real time strategy like Age of Empires and any crafting survival game with a growing economy. It is not a grafically extreme game though it is very smooth and well groomed and very easy to look at (for hours on end). The map in huge and there is plenty of days worth of walking to cover it. The battle system is good and reminiscent of turn-based JRPG and can be frustrating at first but after a few tries and some handy advice from the community, it becomes a lot easier. The crafting element is detailed and in-depth yet not so complicated as to leave confused or irritated. The amount of items you can craft is huge and as I mentioned before, is being added to constantly. The economy is easy to grasp and is community driven rather than a stardard set by the game. The trading system is growing with improvments only just recently made to the craftable shop and also easy to understand.\n\nThat being said, the chat community and Admins/Mods have been helpful from day one and my experience has been nothing less than excellent. My noob questions were answered without hate or trolling and have even been given items to help me start out. I have seen people get banned and the review from "purebattle" is unjustified and out of context as he still plays the game everyday. I was in chat at the time of his ban. The Admins will give you a warning if you break chat rules and bans will be made if you repeatedly break them.\n\nThe chat rules are simple, no swearing, insults, constant  caps lock and spamming/flooding the chat channel and it these rules and thier consistant enforcement of them has created a helpfull and friendly, except for Praes lol ;). Infact I would even let my young teen children play this game and interact in chat without fear of them being trolled or bullied.\n\nAll in all, I find this an amazing addictive game with an excelent developer/community communication from one Russian developer! It maybe PRE-ALPHA early access and free, but it plays like an A list game and definately has potential. Updates are regular and bugs actually get fixed which is rare in this category of games.\n\nKudos to the Devolper and his team for the great work their doing.\n\nIf you see me in game don't hesitate to ask me questions and I will help as much as I can.","March 26","true","047.8"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

I 100% understand that its early development and they are working hard to get the game working well.

The admins in this game are people who dedicate way to much time of their lives to see this game succeed, and they aren't going to let immature idiots come in and cuss away, ruining the game for the majority of people.  They also aren't going to see people who want to come in and whine that they can't find anything when literally 10 people have told them exactly what to do, and where to go to.  This game is very enjoyable, even if it's a little bit grindy.  There are fun times with everyone, and honestly I have not really seen any abuse from community members.  That is what is special about this early game;  Those that have progressed in this game haven't whined their way to the top, they are geniunely hard working players who have gotten where they are with time and hardwork.  These people tend to be friendly towards those having troubles starting the game IF THEY MAKE EFFORT THEMSELVES.  I literally have not come across a single person who hasn't helped me when I told them what I had done to figure out something but had been unsuccessful (SHOWED MY EFFORT).\n\nTHE ADMINS AREN'T ABUSIVE, THEY JUST DONT PUT UP WITH CRAP IN THIS GAME\n\nSo to those interested in joining, please do.  If you do, please make an effort, it will pay off and we are all here to help you as long as you show us that effort.  DONT WHINE, DONT CUSS, and be friendly.  Nothing in this game will come the first day, but walk around and make friends and soon you will be up with the best.\n\nTLDR:\nthis game has a super friendly community if you are just willing to put in a little bit of effort to figure things out.  Yes it has bugs and unbalances, it's a early EARLY beta game with people who actually want to see it succeed, not become overran by annoying brats who can't keep their language clean or just not troll the chats.  This game takes effort, and whining wont get you anywhere, come prepared to work hard but have fun doing it with friends.\n\nTLDR:TLDR:  Admins are actually very nice, community is wonderful, more than you'd expect in this game for an EARLY beta game.
