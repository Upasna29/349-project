First off, the enemies attacks are impossible to avoid, and instead boil down to "attack, run away until their attack is done, then attack," rinse and repeat. If you get trapped between 3 of these enemies you are pretty much screwed. The shooting 'recoil' feels very awkward and hinder my shots aim, thus making the main shooting mechanic frustrating. The controller feels awkward on an Xbox 360 controller (should allow customized controls, D-pad for movement and anologue stick to shoot definitely doesnt feel very good.) I love the music a lot, although I do wish there was more variation (more tracks.) I also feel like this game would do very well with hidden areas and secrets.\n\nSo, as it stands I do not currently recommend this game.","August 2, 2015","false","2.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","14","17","2","0"
