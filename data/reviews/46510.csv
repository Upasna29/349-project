As an adventure game, it also turned up the puzzle difficulty, sometimes significantly.\n\nLong version:Syberia II is, from beginning to end, one large journey, continuing straight from the ending scene of the previous game. Once again, we participate in a long trip of the returning protagonist, Kate Walker and the mysterious heir she chased all the way through the first game, Hans Voralberg.\n\nSyberia II is a sentimental tale, where the theme of the first game has matured into such questions as how long would someone go to fulfil their old dreams before their days run out, and how one can re-evaluate their purpose in life when they find a cause worthy enough to leave everything behind.\nAs with most stories full of allegories, it is very slow and very dreamlike. The scenery reflects how our protagonists gradually leave the edge of civilisation as the last post of humanity, a small post-Soviet barter town fades into the distance of the vast Russian tundra, where the end of the tracks may hold the answer in their search of the last resting place of the remaining mammoths, the mythical island called Syberia.\n\nThe game uses another tool to let the players immerse themselves in its world and atmosphere besides the slow pacing: the puzzles. They don’t use the warped point ‘n’ click logic that ruined many great games, but many of them rely on trial and error or constantly travelling from one end of a large gameplay area to another. The last third of the plot is especially notorious, where the difficulty quickly rises to almost legendary levels.\nBut all that hardship will be worth it. Worth it for one of the most bittersweet, wonderful endings we can witness in an adventure game.","January 14","true","27.4"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

Although the theme of the story doesn't seem special at all, the developer must be complimented for building a haunting gameplay upon it. Elements of longing, mysticism, fantasy, and mystery are well-blended, and will make you want to play further and further. Dialogues are well-written and entertaining. Visuals are dated and nothing special. While playing it on a 24" 1080p monitor wasn't a great experience – the blurry edges around all objects were quite visible – my enjoyment of the game wasn't impeded in any sense. Puzzles are quite straight-forward, and don't require any critical thinking skills; just be alert to your surroundings at all times, and pay special attention to all objects that your character can interact with, for be assured, such objects will have some use in the game.\n\nThe only irritant – a big one – in the game is its tedious gameplay. Your character will need to walk around a lot in order to solve puzzles and find things and NPCs. All that could've easily been bypassed by making the character appear at the location of interest with a single click. But no! The sadistic game designers make you watch as the character meanders her way to the desired location, which will make you terribly impatient and peeved, and you might even turn-off the game in anger...only to return a few hours later :).\n\nSCORE: 7/10 (3 points deducted for tedious gameplay, average visuals, and unintelligent game design)\n\nPS: To play the complete story, you will need to play this game after Syberia, the first episode that sells as a separate game. However,  if, for some reason, you decide to play this game only, you will be briefed about what happened in the first episode via an option in the main menu. My recommendation is that you play both parts in order. This is a really good, no non-sense game, and its story will stay with you forever.","October 16, 2014","true","12.3"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kell_Pro/recommended/46510/","Kell_Pro","Kell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kell_Pro/","182 products in account","Syberia 2 review\n\nThe Good: The visuals and music are absolutely wonderful; there is a better variety in puzzles which makes the game more challenging.\nThe Bad: There is slightly less character development than before; many of the cutscenes have very hammy dialogue ala the preview for the game.\n\nThe original Syberia was an excellent game that came at a time when great adventures were scarce at best. It told a rich and enthralling story that left fans wanting more. In the two years since the original’s release, the adventure community has been through many disappointments, leaving Kate Walker again the task of breathing a little life back into the genre. There are a few slip-ups on the way, but thankfully Syberia II withstands those enough to succeed at its task.\n\nWhen we last saw our intrepid heroine, Kate Walker, she was jumping onto a train, essentially leaving her former life as a corporate yuppie lawyer behind to accompany the eccentric dreamer Hans Voralberg on his quest to find the land of Syberia. Syberia II picks up exactly where the first game left off, and in reality, this game should be looked at as more of a direct continuation of the first game, rather than a sequel that stands on its own. While there is a video recap of Syberia to assist new players, I don’t think that people who haven’t played the first game will care very much about the objective at hand. Therefore, I strongly recommend that if you have not played through the original Syberia yet, you should do so before taking on the sequel.\n\nAs the game begins, your train makes a stop in Romansburg -- the last bastion of civilization before the endless tundra. After the opening cutscene, you gain control of Kate, and you will quickly realize that the interface is exactly as before: very simple and streamlined. Everything is completely point & click, with hotspots indicating when an item can be picked up or manipulated. By right-clicking you can access the inventory screen to either use or view items. It is so simple that anyone could start this game and ease right into the gameplay without having to consult a manual. There really are no interface differences between this and the first game to speak of, which I see as a good thing; the original interface worked just fine and by keeping it the same it makes the two halves feel like a single larger whole.\n\nThe main complaint with Syberia was the short playing time and lack of challenging puzzles. It is obvious that the game developers took this criticism to heart, because the largest area of improvement in the game over its predecessor is indeed the puzzle design. The most impressive aspect of the game, to me, was the real effort to put a variety of puzzles into the game -- not just inventory-based puzzles as was the case before, but puzzles that run the gamut from the relatively simple inventory-based puzzles to more difficult logic-based ones -- you may even want to anticipate getting stuck for a while!(Something I never would have dreamed to happen in Syberia.) The addition of more varied puzzles that range in difficulty has helped lengthen the playing time to almost double that of the original game, giving the player much more bang for their buck.\n\nWhat the game gains in puzzle design though, it loses somewhat in character development. Kate’s motivations are very murky. In the first game, much of her personality and character arc is explained through her interactions with other in-game characters and her conversations on her cell phone. But as Kate wanders further and further away from civilization, meaningful character interactions become less and less common. In response to general criticism, the use of the cell phone has been marginalized in the sequel; although I am in the minority, I never minded the use of the cell phone as a storytelling device in Syberia. In a journey where your character is by herself most of the time, the presence of the cell phone is often the only thing to give the player insight into Kate’s emotions and thought processes. By all but removing that device, the game suffers from lack of character exposition. The player is left to extrapolate possible motivations for Kate based on assumptions, not by material that is present in the game.\n\nAlso less prevalent in this game are the symbolisms that in part, made the first installment so interesting. The themes of life and death, spirituality vs. machinery, abandonment, loss, and faith are all still present, but they aren’t as tantalizingly de-constructible as before. What are very tantalizing, however, are the graphics. Once again, the Microids art department has outdone themselves. Everything is even more gorgeous this time around than the original, if that's possible. All of the cutscenes, the backgrounds, and the characters look beautiful and are all improved on in some way over the first game. The characters have better expressions, the backgrounds are more detailed, and the cutscenes are even more cinematic. You can tell that they put painstaking detail into everything seen on screen. There are also nice little realistic touches to each frame: birds can be seen flying, wind rustling in the trees, rushing water, animals scurrying across the snow and other things that may be unnecessary to the actual gameplay, but add indubitably to the atmosphere.\n\nEqually as wonderful is the sound. Each locale of the game features a musical theme that is well-suited to the mood of that place. The score is very well done and my only complaint would be that I want to hear more of it; it really is beautiful. The voice acting is also much more solid all around than it was in the first game, and the dialogue remains strong throughout, with one small exception: it tends to get a bit heavy-handed and cheesy during the cutscenes -– very reminiscent of the dialogue in the trailer that was released for the game.\n\nFor many people, enjoying this game to the fullest will hinge on how much of a tradeoff they are willing to make between the story and the puzzles. Many of the original’s most vocal supporters loved it because of the storyline while many of its detractors criticized it for the lack of challenge. The developers took note of this and made a concerted effort to put in a greater variety of puzzles, but in doing so, the story -- in some respects -- falls by the wayside just a bit. However, the quality of the game as a whole is so outstanding that you will be willing to accept what is now a great story with improved puzzles, instead of what was a superb story with lackluster puzzles. Everyone should be able to find something -- most likely many things -- to admire about this game and I recommend it highly to everyone.","April 2","true","4.7"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

Then I saw Syberia bundle on sale so I bought it. Just recently I finished Syberia which was good but lacked a level of polish. Syberia 2 picks up after the first game and you are plunged into the adventure. The voice acting remains really good. The story of the sequel is written very well and it is the high-point of the game. While having a cliche villain it still remains magical and fun. Gameplay is much better and even visually everything is much smoother. Puzzles are fairly challenging and fun .... well, most of them. And here is where I remembered why I had not finished the game back then. Very hard & difficult puzzles! Not many but just the few will make you frustrated with the game. In all honesty, while I get that devs wanted to add a flavour of challenge, the game would have done MUCH better without these. My pro-tip is to look through all the inventories for clues and items, EVERY TIME. And if all else fails look up a guide, there is no shame in that, the story is so good it deserves to be finished. So do I recommend? I indeed do, the game is great! But get the whole Syberia bundle!","May 17, 2015","true","7.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Like its predecessor, the game is set in a post-Soviet backdrop of unspecified geography and features various locations ranging from a Russian mining town, a Monastery, and Subarctic forests, to Youkol settlements and even a dream-trance state of Valadilène (the town from the first game) through all of  which the player guides Walker throguh many difficulties of their journey.\n\nThe plot, straightforward as it appears, features many details regarding Hans' obsessions, as well as Kate's former life, flesh out the storyline. There is an underlining theme of the Hans' quest comes across as one of almost prophetic proportions, which lends the game an odd mixture of magical realism tinged by the Art Nouveau-themes steampunk of many locations.\n\nThe user interface is slightly cluncky and direction arrows may get slightly confusing at times. The same applies for the interface on puzzles: the game features only one icon for interaction (a magnifying lens) regardless of the nature or the direction of the said interaction. While this doesn't prevent puzzles from being solved (as they're not impossibly difficult anyway), it does nonetheless lack intutivity.\n\nOverall, Syberia II provides a fitting conclusion to Benoît Sokal's great duology (soon to be a trilogy, apparently).

I really grew fond of these characters, environments and Benoit Sokal's style of epic storytelling, and I was saddened to see it end. These games have some of the most memorable moments in adventure gaming history, even if the world feels a bit sterile.\n\nThe animation and the graphics are slightly improved over the first game. The gameplay is pretty much identical, however. My biggest gripes remain with the UI and the puzzles: 1) Finding "hot spots" is often like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Oftentimes you get stuck because you missed a doorway or a box of crates in some remote corner. Ugh. I really recommend keeping an FAQ at hand... 2) Especially because the puzzles can be really opaque and strange. Some of the puzzles are very logical and satisfaying. On the upside, the game is not trying to hold your hand. Everything is abstract and solvable. But unfortunately, on the downside, some of the solutions require a bit of psychotic tinkering.\n\n(As far as a good FAQ is concerned, I highly recommend the spoiler-free (!) UHS hint system: http://www.uhs-hints.com/uhsweb/hints/syberia2/1.php)\n\nThose who have invested time into the first game should definitely see the story to its conclusion. If the disappointing aspects of the gameplay - frustrating UI and obtuse puzzles - had been mitigated, this would have been a masterpiece.\n\nOverall: 7/10","March 17, 2015","true","10.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It was everything I expected and more. The story ending was moving and answered all questions.\n\nThere were also some great gameplay improvements in relation to Syberia I. Quicker character movements, removal of dialogue options if you've exhausted them all- in comparison to repeatedly guessing in the first game as to whether or not you had asked all necessary questions, zero crashes, and SIGNIFICANT improvement in dialogue quality.\n\nI HIGHLY suggest that you play Syberia I first, and play Syberia II as soon as you complete the first. Helps keep the game fresh and alive, and is necessary if you want to enjoy gameplay as much as possible.\n\nGraphics are fantastic for the age of this game. It's rather like a child's fairytale book at times :) The adventures and gameplay locations are interesting and the characters are fun and blend well with the story. I thoroughly enjoyed Syberia II- and the ending was beautiful. Kate's journey to Syberia was just as much a journey of personal discovery. And it felt as though I was personally vested in seeing Hans live out his dream.\n\nTwo thumbs up. Definitely a must for anyone who enjoys adventure games with engaging stories.\n\nI absolutely can't wait for the third installment coming out this year.","March 1","true","8.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I was so happy and I have to admit, I'm pleased.\n\nPros:\n1.) The graphics are the best I've ever seen for  PNC game. My bf even compared it to Skyrim quality - not bad, not bad.\n2.) This story is better than the first game. I think this is because Kate has companions in this game, so she feels more likeable and you also get to know the other characters more because well, you're with Hans and Oscar for a LONG time.\n3.) Puzzles range from easy to very difficult. The variation is quite nice.\n4.) If you left Syberia, feeling incomplete, this will help round it out for you!\n\nCons:\n1.) Some items in this game are really hard to find. At one point you have to find dry wood to create a fire and it's almost impossible to find it. It also irritating because you're in a forest, yet you have to click in the EXACT right spot to find the item. Annoying.\n2.)

His name is Hans Voralberg) you will want to play this game. However, a recap is offered of the first game if you choose to skip right to the second one. The second installment of the game is very similar to the first, it's a point and click adventure with some moments where you literally have to backtrack across a town for some bird whistles. Also, before I digress too much, the fact that I accidentally made the candle at the monastery I consider to be a small video gaming miracle. Anyway, this review may make it seem like I dislike this game, I actually adore it.\n\nThis game offers a change of pace from your standard video gaming fare. It is low key and depending on how you want to play it, paced perfectly. Of course with it comes the tedium of having to run around and figure out puzzles that at first seem tremendously random. Sure, a candle cures advanced alzheimers, why not. The story is fantastic, it centers around the protagonist Kate's search with Hans for the mysterious mammoth inhabited Syberia island. The fact of the matter is you don't see a lot of games with an intelligent female lead, and this is one of the better ones.

The puzzles are also a bit harder, but not very difficult, even though some of them require a lot of observation and attention to details. So if everything is better, why I didn't gave a 10 to Syberia II, well, it's because of the puzzles, not because I found them too difficult or too easy, but because sometimes their simplicity is hidden by stupid details, like for example the radar puzzle to eject Kate, it was so simple, but the fact that first we used some numbers to contact the colonel, induced me in error thinking that the puzzle is difficult and that I have to do some calculations, all because the first numbers that I used to contact the colonel had no relevance to the radar display whatsoever, while the second numbers that I needed to find where related to the radar display. Also there are other puzzles that can induce you in error and you can waste a lot of time because they need another puzzle to be completed first and it's quite difficult to know that.  The final puzzle it might be extremely difficult if you don't pay attention to some details long time before you reach that puzzle, I didn't had too much problem with the last one but I struggled with some very simple puzzle just because the answer was completly hidden in the background. Anyway the game is awesome and the story ends quite good, although I would like to know how Kate made it back in New York. 100 % Recommended\n","August 11, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If I'd bought them individually, I wouldn't have bothered with part 2, as part 1 put me to sleep. Even after I gave up and watched a Let's Play instead, THAT put me to sleep. To be fair, 2 is a little less narcolepsy-inducing, but not enough for me to keep going beyond ALMOST getting out of the first area.\n\nIt's rather discouraging, because the reviews are overwhelmingly positive otherwise. Why do so many other people enjoy what feels like a very pretty but dull exploration game? Because that's what it feels like--the "puzzles" are a bit obtuse (having spent far too long trying to figure out the basic controls during part 1), and much of the solutions are just find SOMETHING to interact with and try everything. It's not even enjoyable watching Kate Walker... walk... and walk... and walk... and walk BACK... etc. I can think of so many games that have a world that FEELS larger in fewer screens, just because the amount of interactive content per "room" is so much higher, and the attention to details that convey character in and of themselves. Syberia overall has a lot of empty content for really no reason other than I guess the art department planned out a map and the programmers worked around that. At least in part 2 there are fewer doors for Kate to declare she won't even bother trying to open.\n\nFurthermore, I realized that what I don't like about this style of point-and-click game is the "distant" feel of the characters. Every dialogue is from at least twenty feet away, perspective-wise, so it's more like eavesdropping than actual interaction. There are no close-ups (other than the shadowy cutscenes in part 2), so I get no feel for the characters' emotions except through the (kinda bad) translated voice-acting, because they're as stiffly animated as puppets. The closest it got to providing any depth or emotion was how part 1 kept interrupting what little gameplay there was with random phone calls that only served to show how much nobody really respected Kate, while part 2 took a different tack and put in sorely-needed cinematics (that seemed to inflate Kate's importance far above and beyond her original "buy a toy factory" job... but then I fell asleep through half the story to fully appreciate the drama).\n\nIt's not like 3D can't accommodate the kind of character animation that 2D can provide easily--just look at any Telltale Games game (Sam & Max, The Wolf Among Us) or even a game like Ankh or the Gabriel Knight 20th Anniversary remake... though the GK remake admittedly feels as clunky as Syberia, the interview sections and cutscenes still draw the player out of "watch from a distance like a creepy stalker" mode enough to convey a real sense of who the characters are.\n\nYes, I get that they were going for this realistic world to explore, and they've done a good job of that. Once I've seen a room once, though, it gets boring seeing it about fifty more times in trying to progress the story.\n\ntl;dr: Just watch a walkthrough on Youtube, it's a lot less clicking.","October 27, 2015","false","6.1"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","1"

Some puzzles have no in game explaination, and yet require a specific sequence of buttons to be pressed.\n\nCertainly not a game for anyone wanting a real story game. The story is hollow and shallow, and often makes no sense at all.\n\nAlso you will never again forget the name of the main character, as nearly every sentence anyone spoke to her includes her FULL NAME! First and last name... really? Yes, it is true.\n\nThis game also has a big problem with naming things. Sometimes naming strange, fictional things, with the same name as something real, only with a slight spelling difference(Syberia, not Siberia). Or naming a strange fictional seal-dog animal race with almost the same name as the strange nomadic people you're trying to reach(Youki is a dog thing, Youkol is a race of nomadic people). This becomes VERY confusing.\n\nThere is also some kind of a start of a story thing with the main characters former boss sending someone to try to find her, because her mom is 'making him' ( 'him' being some head cheese of a giant law firm or something, why he'd listen to some lady about one of his employee's who decided to run away, I don't know.) Overall this part of a story piece helped nothing with the game, and seemed only to be a sad way of trying to make it seem like she was embarking on this IMPOSSIBLE journey, since the expert he hires to try to find her just can't do it, it's to hard.\n\nOverall, this game was a terrible disappointment. Back when this game was new, I'm sure it would have been 'top notch', but now it's just confusing, boring, and very aggravating.","February 25, 2014","false","8.1"," 66 of 132 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","66","132","0","5"

Maybe my hopes were too high after some of the great level designs in Syberia 1, but these levels felt uninspired.\n-Puzzles were not as satisfying as Syberia 1.  I found the puzzles in this one to be more tedious than enjoyable.\n-The sense of mystery from Syberia 1 is gone.  You already know a lot from what you discovered in Syberia 1, and there's really no mystery added.  This game is pretty much just about getting from point A to point B.  It kind of feels like filler.\n-The new characters were mostly bland, and the game's antagonist is just annoying.\n-No spoilers, but I was not completely happy with the plot.\n-As with Syberia 1, the game just ends with no real ending or sense of resolution.

There was improvement with the dialogue system but, unlike some people have pointed out, I did think that such difficult puzzles spoiled my experiencing of the story and I'd have to spend ages on the same spot if I wanted to figure them out on my own. Referring to a walkthrough more than just once in a while in order to complete a game can be very frustrating, not to mention the great amount of visual memory (and PATIENCE) required to solve the puzzles; otherwise you'd have to walk back and forth, over and over, halfway through the entire game scenery... and back again. Making the puzzles complicated doesn't necessarily make them clever. More than once did I check the walkthrough guidelines and went, "Oh, come on!!!"

Everything that is “good” about Syberia II is only relatively good when compared with the terrible Syberia I; there is nothing superlative about any facet of this game.\nA good thing about this game is that it has more cinematics than its predecessor. A game that sells itself on story should have many movies, and there are some here. For a game released in 2004 the visuals are not bad, but they haven’t aged well at all and alone they shouldn’t induce you to buy this game. Furthermore, the voice acting won’t make you wince as often; as when intonation is way of or a word is mispronounced, but you will definitely notice strange moments in the dialogue.\nThe main draw of this game is supposed to be the “amazing story” but here is the problem: it never develops beyond the premise that your protagonist wants to help an old guy reach Syberia (and still features the intelligence-insulting idea that he couldn't have gotten there when he built the rails the first time).\n\nIn general, stories depend on the quality of conflict for their weight, and the weak opposition and half-sketched puzzles (either extremely easy or nonsensical due to total lack of clues) simply don’t contribute any to a satisfying conclusion. It’s more like you progress through a series of trivial events and the game stops. Even in its most pretentious moments trying to induce pathos, the characters never manage to be any more impactful than a mildly annoying fly at the dinner table.\n\nSo what should induce you to buy this game? I can only imagine it must be the inflated ratings it seems to be getting elsewhere (why I tried when both games together were $3). Don’t bother unless you have time to waste and the patience of Job for flimsy characters (slightly less) annoyingly voiced.\n\nSPOILER PLOT COMPLAINT: One more thing I could leave off here-I couldn't believe it but the developers actually show you going so far north that you see Antarctic Emperor Penguins. Come on, were they complete idiots, or did they just think I'm one?\n\nREBUTTAL TO COMMENTS:\nOn the contrary, the first game sets up a (boring) storyline which the second fails to resolve satisfactorily. I am seriously surprised you are defending the storyline; clearly I am not the one who hasn't put much thought into what is going on. Problems with the second story are significant and in actuality are catastrophic, ruining what little immersion you got in the first game.\n\nPremise of the First Game:\nA lawyer tries to find an idiot savant because it is buisness.\nShe has a domineering mother and a needy boyfriend that she becomes increasingly distant from.\nShe finds said idiot and decides to escort him (reasons are ambiguous but could possibly be construed as the "adventure and unknown" crap espoused).\nGame ends.\n\nPremise of Second Game:\nHaving made the decision to escort the idiot savant to a location he has already built a train to, said person (no longer identified as a lawyer) solves breakdowns in said idiot's equipment (in spite of the fact that he is the "genius" that built it and presumably understands how to fix it)\nProtagonist overcomes resistance by enemies who have no clear reasons to oppose you.\nProtagonist makes "a tough ethical decision" to eliminate one of the most annoying side characters ever invented in order to help the idiot savant keep going\nProtagonist gets idiot savant to final destination where he rides off into the sunset.\nAdventure over\n\nMore Criticisms of Second Game:\nThe game tries to give you catharsis by helping a fool achieve his life's dream, but it fails because he isn't credible as a character and neither is the protagonist, who is no longer motivated by escape (her motivation in part 2 is actually never further explained than "gee, I want to help this stranger out"). Enemies are less than two dimensional because they have zero motivation to oppose you, so they simply aren't believable. You deal with offensively stupid indigenous peoples and animals that literally could not live further from your proposed location.\n\nYou seriously think those are the makings of a great game?

Because it's an older game there isn't much help from other players through forums, either.\nThe bugs were significant enough to prevent me from playing at all (could not save game, for example, so I had to start at the beginning every time or leave the game running in the background).

What I didnt like about this game - lots of sections where you could walk to the edge of the screen, but there was no sign of that from the mouse (meaning it only lit up in certain spots telling you to go there but not in others), you had to figure it out yourself and that got me stuck a few times not knowing where to go. Also, there were a lot of sections to walk thtough that were pointless. Couldn't pick anything up, couldn't do anything in them. They were jus there for graphics and when you are running back and forth trying to figure out a puzzle thats a pain. I like challenging puzzles but some of the puzzles were insane and there was no hint option or anything which I also didn't like.

A very good game,too, but nothing more from the original.\n\nThe Graphics here are a bit better and it has to be the resolution. The original was probably made in 800x600 and Syberia 2 in 1024x768. If not then the textures are better. But there is a great difference in the look. This game is full cinematic too. Of course, it will never look as a modern game.. That's why a remake HAS to be made.\nVoices and sounds are exceptional and of culture.\n\nThe riddle system is supposed to be the same. But the game instead of the first one has some tiresome riddles without meaning. If you found yourself stucked you may have missed something obvious. The bad thing with the game is that the places have great range and are many. Without the option to change a place instantly by double-clicking on the door that you find in modern games, missing something is totally tiresome. And in this game you'll find many cases that you missed something because there is NO hot spot help as an old game it is. So, the game is NOT difficult at all. You just have to look all around the areas you go carefully.\n\nThe landscapes still are great but because of the resolution I couldn't make a screenshot. But they are really amazing! You'll find yourself in a world based on north Russia in the start of the game and later on who really knows,to an eskimos(we could call them) village below the ice and in the frozen seas of the Arctic Ocean. When finally you find your destination the landscapes look as those of Amerzone(Jungle) another Benoit Sokal's game.\n\nThe story continues from the original.It still is between reality and fantastic with more focus in reality. You'll get across different civilizations and you'll be through their culture in medicine, life, gods and many more. It's really good for a successor to keep you up. Believe me. At this point you'll never been bored. Just try NOT to miss things like we said...\n\nA GREAT successor to the original.

The Bourghoff brothers are sort of cartoonish and kind of unoriginal villains that clash with the sort of somber and ornate beauty of the games environment.  The plotline with the detective is also kind of weird and feels out of place for this game, as do the weird mid-atlantic accents done by marston and the detective.  The puzzles are good though, and the environment is really cool and pretty to look at.  The story with Hans continues to be interesting, if a lil bit sappy, but it doesnt feel so sort of fake like the subplots with the Bourghoffs and the detectives.  Also tbh the depiction of the Youkols is a bit racist with the whole "obviously made up language," how they are all like tiny and round, the shaman's annoying cryptic language and like spiritual insight and weird laugh is all cliche but also kind of an offensive cliche.

You explore to find the pieces needed to get to the next scene in the game.  Great storyline.  Good visuals and entertaining characters.  Controls are easy enough.  It felt like it was too slow getting anything done though.  The story kept me coming back for more, but criss crossing the various scenes to bring items to right places was frustrating.

I originally bought this game on the PlayStation 3.  Do not, for any reason, buy the PS3 version.  It is atrocious.  The sound constantly cuts in and out. Visual glitches abound.  The text boxes are slow and annoying.  The controls are clunky.  The screen transitions are the opposite of smooth.  Visuals aren't as pretty.  After enduring about 20 minutes of this garbage, I immediately bought the game on Steam, started playing, and found myself filled with joy.  Whoever the shiz was in charge of the PS3 port should be ashamed for ruining a fantastic game.\n\nAs for the PC version of this game, if you are a fan of the point-and-click adventure genre, I don't see how you won't enjoy this game.\n\nUpdate on September 1, 2015: I just finished this game, never used a walkthrough.  This one is tougher than the first game.  The story isn't compelling like it is in the first game.  It's a bit goofy at times, and there are some "Whaaaa?" moments.  The scenes from "back at the office" are out of place and contrived.  But this is still a great point-and-click adventure game.  The snowy scenery is beautiful.  The puzzles are hard in a (mostly) good way.\n\n8/10, would abandon man to murderous penguins again.","August 25, 2015","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've played the prequel (which is not absolutely required thanks to an in-game recap, but still recommended) you'll notice that the interface and engine haven't changed and the game plays exactly the same way as the first. I found the puzzles in certain parts of Syberia 2 to be a bit more cryptic than those in the first game, including a clock puzzle and a radio puzzle that are a bit tricky to figure out. Besides that, I found the game to be pretty satisfying up until the ending which is a bit abrupt and leaves a few really important questions unanswered (since there will be no Syberia 3). It's nothing terrible though.","September 8, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was either phrased in a different way, it missed a few words, added a few words... nothing that was important for understanding the story, but it was odd, and I don't see how they couldn't find someone to accurately transcribe the dialogue. It doesn't matter if you are listening to it with volume, like I did, but I found it weird.\n-Running a round was a liiiiittle bit slow when I was backtracking for no reason or running around trying to figure out what to do, but not enough to be annoying.\n-The game as a whole is not extremely fast-paced, but it really depends on what kind of person you are + what you want out of a game. It kind of works with the type of game and the story, but some (the impatient?) might find it too slow and thus boring.\n\nAs a sequal, it gets points for staying true to the original and continuing on with its story without a hitch. It feels identical in almost every way, albiet is even more exciting because you're reaching the end of your journey and seeing even more interesting people and places.\n\nAll-around, it was a great game for me. Whether it's the right game for you I can't say, but if you have a history of point-and-click, mystery games, and adventure games, it's generally so cheap to get these games (they might even show up in a cheap pack -- that's how I got them), that if you think you might be into it, you aren't losing much by giving it a shot. Some games I also have enjoyed that I think have some similarities, though none are exactly the same:\nNancy Drew\nThe Hardy Boys\nAnd Then There Were None - Agatha Christie\nMysterious Island\nMyst\nRiven","July 5, 2015","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
