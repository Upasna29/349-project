"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/260210/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","Assassin's Creed Liberation centers around a character by the name of Aveline, a woman raised from childbirth as an Assassin whom now struggles to find her way and test her faith and loyalty to the Assassin Brotherhood and her mentor - all while keeping her business afloat.\n\nThis game is a remastered version from the original PSVita release. It features MUCH higher resolution textures, some better music cues, and rebuilt lighting to go along with it all. It does, however, still look a tad blocky at times, as is the case with mobile adaptations. Aveline herself seemed to have been upgraded a bit and her animations are slightly better, but most everything around her looks fairly blocky and inconsistant, though this has almost always been the case with every single AC installation. I do have to give special mention to the lighting in this game though, as it gave a more impressive, visual look to the game that expanded upon the coloring and fidelity of the game that wasn't present in the rather monotone PSVita version, which had a more drab appearance and was less colorful.\n\nThe gameplay, for better or for worse (definately for worse) is standard AC, but this particular game has a few issues additional to what's already dreary mechanics. Aveline has 3 different "Personas" which in concept should alter the game marginally - but to me, it doesn't and mainly adds ways to further monotonize the game. The "Assassin" Persona is your go-to - You can use every weapon in your arsenal, can "freely" (more on that later) climb up structures and buildings as well as have the added nuisance of "Yellow Lighting" enemies. The "Slave" Persona is a less glorified version of the Assassin Persona except you can use less weapons and is not as easy to "Yellow Light" guards and the "Lady" Persona, which removes climbing ENTIRELY and severely limits your combat options and of course adds the random nuisance of thugs pestering you. The Persona system in general just ended up being rather underused for me because it requires the need of "Dressing Chambers", and most of the time I would rather just make do with the outfit I had on (except for the lady persona) and just be on my merry way, additionally, it doesn't bring many gameplay alterations to really warrant using any of them except to maybe add or take away certain annoyances.\n\nAs far as the standard AC mechanics go... I would dare to say some here are actually worse than they were in AC3. The combat is very random with very little indicators as to what may work or not. Until you actually pick up the "Whip" later on in the game - combat is still very "Counter-centric" except the game itself doesn't give you many options to varie what you do. Some enemies can counter your counters and there's no indicator as to who they may be, they just do - and is very annoying because it makes you keep guessing as to which one may work, only to find it that it suddenly doesn't work. Combat in this game I would say is by far it's weakest it's every been in an AC game, even compared to AC1.\n\nThe actual climbing and free running mechanics here are fine - they certainly aren't the worst it's ever been, but there's a few issues I have to point out - one is the "Sticky" issue that also plagued AC3 - where your character tends to want to scale stuff you never even pointed to, making you lose time and another where if your camera is slightly off, you have a chance to make Aveline jump to somewhere you didn't want her to do so, even if you were pointing in the right direction. These two issues aren't particularly common, but they are definately present, and it can be VERY annoying. Another personal issue I had with the game was more of a limitation than anything, but I found that this game was more linear than other AC games - particularly having "blocked off sections" that look climbable and are not.\n\nStealth. Well, not much to say here really. It's just as bad as it was in AC3. You can hide in certain bushes, but guard don't particularly respond well to alerts or are as dynamic. There are actual occasions where you're up in a tree and you can see the enemy looking UP at the tree, but doesn't trigger the alarm or Yellow Lights or anything, it's one of those occasions where the AI just latches on to where you are and it serves to severely break immersion. You have the option of using Poison Darts or Berserk Darts (given later in the game). Poison Darts make the enemy stumble about and eventually die, and Berserk darts make the enemy wild and prone to attacking his allies. Both of which are very helpful in situations where stealth is a must.\n\nThe game also has a number of collectibles, which honestly serve next to no purpose. You can collect Diary Pages to uncover a hidden mini story behind Aveline and her Mother - you can collect Jewelry from charming certain people using the Lady Persona, and of course the usual chest hunt for money. There are also purchases available (via in game stores or "Smugglers") that allow you to purchase weapons and pocket watches (another form of collectible), aswell as a minigame in the form of management of trading/selling goods for Aveline's business found in her Headquarters - as well as the obligatory "Abstergo" or in this game "Erudito" hunt for truth - that have you hunting "Citizen E" for added cutscenes.\n\nAll in all though, it's fairly hard for me to really recommend this game to non AC fans. It doesn't bring anything new to an already drab set of base mechanics, is, in my opinion one of the worst AC games in recent memory (Still better than AC3 due to an actual interesting character) due to the extremely limiting gameplay and linearity the story progresses at, as well as some odd bug here and there that make the entire package feel woefully underwhelming. As it stands, it's a decent entry in the AC franchise that is worth a look if you're a fan of the series or if you're looking for a different take on the series - otherwise I would honestly say skip this game, and get the much better Black Flag instead.\n\nPros:\n-Very interesting Main Character, Aveline.\n-Amazing Lighting and texture effects bring out life in a drab setting.\n-The Whip. This needed to be used more.\n\nCons:\n-Combat is weakest it's been in any AC game.\n-The 3 Persona system is nigh useless and serves as mere nuisances that any utility.\n-Purchases and Upgrades are fairly useless.\n-Weak Collectibles and endgame. No real reason to replay the game outside of story.\n-Very short. You can beat the story in around 5 - 7 hours depending on how experienced you are.\n-Enemies pop up contantly from out of nowhere.\n-Stealth is very weak.\n\nAdditional Note: The PC Port seems to have a few issues pertaining to AA. AA in this game SHOULD be turned off if your CPU rating isn't above 3Ghz. It WILL cause heavy lag. Not sure why, but AA in this game isn't very well optimized. VSync locks the Framerate to 30.\n\nEDIT: I only put a "Non Recommended" because it fell right in the middle for me. It's not a terrible game either. Some people DO enjoy this game more than other AC's, that's entirely dependant on you and what you enjoy.","January 19, 2014","false","8.9"," 639 of 880 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","639","880","0","34"

Visuals are basic and animation crude despite the HD spruce, and the featured setting - an 18th century Louisiana incorporating New Orleans and Chichen Itza - feels oddly familiar. A croc-infested bayou bridging the two locations is essentially a murky version of ACIII's wilderness. Granted, it's an interesting period for yet another spot of virtual tourism, Ubisoft casting their historical lens on the French and Indian War, the American Revolutionary War, and the horrors of slavery therein.You play Aveline de Grandpré, the enigmatic daughter of a wealthy white merchant and the slave he purchased. Hers is a unique perspective, able to slink through social classes in order to observe them from within and without. The Persona System is the key.This lets you dress Aveline in three different outfits. As The Lady, Aveline can spend coin to bribe her way into restricted areas and lure guards from patrol routes by turning on the charm.As The Slave, Aveline loses her combat strength but gains the ability to incite riots and blend in with other slaves. And as The Assassin, Aveline can do all that stabby stuff you're accustomed to.Trouble is, donning alternative outfits just isn't appealing.Besides a money-making minigame in which you send out ships loaded with spices and cotton by navigating a dull series of menus, there are no new marquee features. It feels stripped-down.Liberation works best when it gives you a strict set of rules and a large area to infiltrate. Sneaking into a governor's mansion, or disrupting some voodoo ritual in the deepest darkest bayou, are lent bite by strict fail states - get spotted and it's game over. The result is a game with a healthy dose of tension.For a multitude of reasons, Aveline is the kind of character I’d like to see more of in gaming, but Assassin’s Creed Liberation HD is just too lacking in too many areas to make it happen. There’s no one thing to point to as overtly broken; it simply dies by a thousand tiny cuts. Its craft is sloppy, its design remains shackled by ill-conceived new ideas, as well as the limitations of the platform it hails from. It’s the definitive version of a game that had very little going for it in the first place.Overall 6/10.","November 12, 2014","true","20.1"," 129 of 155 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","129","155","0","0"

I remember reading mostly bad reviews about Liberation when it came out for Vita, because many people thought that its linear design is kind of a breach of style for the Assassin's Creed franchise. After beating all the games in the main series I think that Liberation's lack of liberation (ha!) has its advantages and helps to keep the player's focus on the story. Storywise it is safe to say that Aveline's situation is very comparable to Connor's in Assassin's Creed 3, but her character seems more sympathic since she is not so mysterious and uncommunicative as Connor. The Soundtrack, as always, is brilliant and the graphics are nicely remastered.\n\nUpdate: Apparently some people are complaining about random crashes and framerate issues when Anti Aliasing is turned on. I'm running on a GTX770, an AMD FX 8350 and 8 Gigs of RAM without any problems.","January 15, 2014","true","4.1"," 353 of 476 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","353","476","0","14"

This time it's Liberation, a story set in the same time era as Assassin's Creed 3, you don't need to have played number 3 to understand the story, it's completely stand alone.\n\nThe game was initially released as an exclusive to the PlayStation Vita, but was released on Steam earlier this year renamed Assassin's Creed Liberation HD. Sadly the graphics are anything but HD, you can definitely tell that this is a port from a console since the graphical options are next to none.\n\nI failed to follow the story after reaching the halfway point, but the game play is pretty much as you'd expect from a Assassin's Creed game, the earlier stages are actually quite challenging, but once you get your hands on the whip, taking out swarms of enemies becomes as easy as taking candy from a baby.\n\nThis is another that you'll need to play with a controller to fully get to grasps with, but the controls are simple enough to pick up once you start playing.\n\nAlthough this game is good, it is definitely the worst in the series, poor graphics, and the difficult to follow story line really drag it down. I would only recommend you playing this if you are huge fan of the series or have nothing else to play and want to fill ten hours.","August 12, 2014","false","10.9"," 166 of 232 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","166","232","4","4"

Yes, it's a port, and it shows.\n\nIt's supposed to be a HD game, but don't get fooled by that. Though the graphics are not ugly, there's loads of examples of low res textures everywhere. But the worst part, is that the FPS seems to be locked at some very low value, which gets VERY straining on the eyes. And that's my #1 issue with this game, it's painful to play it.\n\nThe new feature that makes this game different from other AC games, is that the main protaganist can change between 3 different "roles", each with a suitable outfit for that role. The roles are Lady, Slave and Assassin. When playing a certain role, there are restrictions to what you can do, or extra things that role can that no one else can. For example, as a Slave, you can pick up crates and walk past guards unnoticed, if you don't take too long.\n\nSounds interesting? Well it isn't. It's a good idea that ends up being a barrier, and restricts you.\n\nElse it's just more of the same. This game is often considered as a standalone addition to AC3, so if you've played that one, you already know a lot about what you're getting. Though it isn't nowhere near the size of AC3.\n\nThe low FPS is the main reason I'm not recommending the game. But apart from that, the rest is pretty much "meh..." and not really worth spending much money on. If you're still interested, pick it up on sale, do not buy it at full price.","March 14, 2015","false","2.7"," 55 of 72 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","55","72","0","5"

Remember this game is a  spinoff and isn't really a huge improvement over IV in any ways .\n\nThe game itself features its first female protaganist of the series Aveline De Grandpre and she herself is an French African assassin. The story starts off with just starting off stopping naysayers who talk bad about her father's company and assassination contracts. The story itself unfold when her mentor agate told her to assassinate the templar prescence in New Orleans starting with the governer,  It was until her confrontation with the governer that she was told what was going to slaves, which is her main goal, to free them. One thing from here lead to the next.\n\nI thought the story to this game was not as strong as the other assassin's creed titles, it didn't really pick up until almost the last section of the game, other than that it really didn't have too many memorable characters in this game and I really only liked aveline.\n\nThe graphics to the game is really well done since they really put effort into the HD rework it looks great on my monitor, the controller support and keyboard was fine.\n\nThe musical score to this game is great and really well done, it is unfortunate that most of the gameplay and scene that accomidated just wasn't exciting enough\n\nVoice acting is also nicely done in this game\n\nI however wanted to beat this game as fast as I can so I rush through the story mode and completed it in  about 7 hours with a few deaths here and there. The gameplay is really easy for me and I just rushed the entire missions, I did do the important mission of killing Citizen E's, if you dont know what this is I wont spoil it for you.\n\I skipped the other things such as finding certain treasures here and there etc so I will go back to it sometimes and do a complete run.\n\nThe ai in this game is even dumber than any assassin's creed titles combine, I was able to rush through mission by running right in front of thier faces, it wasn't until I touched them that I got detected, and the maps are smaller than previous assassin's creed, this is due to the limitation of the handheld I believe ?\n\nOverall I wish aveline storyline was much better than what it is since it didn't excite me too much and it was just so zzz for some odd reason it needed a zing to it, out of the entire franchise this has got to be my least favorite assassin creed title, but hey, what can I say it is a 20 dollar port with HD graphics and I am glad to have played it at all. If anything this game reminds me of an assassin's creed 1 or 2 than anything new and the interface for the ship network trading was just so meh.\nIf anything if you play this game remember, go backwards and finish the rest before ACIV to see its glory. It was really hard for me to go back having played hours and hours of IV but I did it for the story to understand Aveline.\n\n\n+Great music\n+good voice acting\n+Environment is nice\n+Graphics in HD looks great\n\n\n+- you either will think 20 dollars is a good price or you can wait for a price drop up to you\n\n-Story was a lackluster\n-Ai is still stupid as hell\n-Water kills enemies if they fall in has returned! this wasn't featured until ACIV lol\n-no multiplayer of any sorts at all, not even something for itself but then again you could be playing it on ACIV","January 15, 2014","true","7.3"," 175 of 279 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","175","279","0","15"

Liberation takes what should be a great character, and tosses her into an uninteresting story, in an uninteresting land, read to you by bored voice-over artists.  But it is more than that.\n\nIt's the polish.  Ubisoft used to make these beautifully polished games, that were so complete in their inner consistency that after a few hours, you would begin to believe its history.  You could *feel* the swagger while you're walking down the dusty alleys of ancient cities.  You felt like you were part of a story that wanted you to be a part of it.\n\nThis game is missing that.  In my mind, I imagine the money guy coming downstairs and saying, "Make me another AC game. No, no... don't use our good people. Off-shore this. Give this to the interns."  Because that's what this feels like:  A third party expansion to a fairly decent game, done by a team of outsiders who just don't love the material.\n\nThis game is phoned-in and feels like it.

It's clear that the developers tried to actually add some new things, and took some risks where the mainline entries play it safe. Ubisoft Bulgaria has been relatively successful too with these changes and additions. The persona system in particular is a welcome addition, as it makes the stealth elements of the game somewhat more sensible and adds some welcome diversity. If Aveline dresses as a lady, she has limited combat ability and no free running ability, but can be far more stealthy and can conduct actual assassinations from time to time. If she dresses as a slave, she has somewhat greater combat ability, can free run and can still slip into quite a few places unnoticed, but she is easily spotted if she does anything out of character and in open combat is noticeably inferior to the assassin persona. The assassin persona then is what people are used to from the AC franchise, with the exception that as an assassin, Aveline is always regarded as suspicious by guards, which makes a good deal of sense given the veritable smithy she carries around with her.\n\nAnother positive aspect of the game is that the protagonist is a significant improvement over both Connor and Edward Kenway, who both were wasted opportunities. Aveline is a strong character with a clear independent streak, and who has sensible relations with other people in her life. Her voice actress also does a good job, which is especially noticeable in the short section of the game where she meets Connor. Her background is also used much better as a way to tell stories from the perspectives of slaves, where this opportunity was largely wasted for Native Americans in Assassin's Creed III. It is of course still not perfect - game developers still hesitate to show the full brutality and barbarity of slavery in the way that films now do - but it is a significant step ahead of other big budget games.\n\nThe game is however not perfect. While Aveline is an interesting character, and they do showcase some interesting things, the story is on the whole not very interesting, and fails to feel like a cohesive whole. I suspect that much story content has been cut over development, perhaps in an effort to cut the game down to a suitable size for handhelds. I should also mention that with regards to story, the game does not have you leave the game world at any point, so for those who hate the present day sections in all the other Assassin's Creed titles, that might be a big plus.\n\nWhile I can only guess when it comes to the story, when it comes to other elements, it is undeniable that the game suffers from being originally developed for a handheld platform. Missions are generally too easy, with even the side objectives incredibly generous, so as to be more forgiving to compensate for poorer handheld controls. There is also noticeable cutting in missions, with what would normally be one mission cut into several smaller chunks to facilitate the start-stop nature of handheld gaming. While some might not mind, I found it reduced the flow of the game and on the whole made it feel like less of a 'grand' affair and more of a mundane experience where you complete small tasks. In presentation too the game suffers from being developed for handhelds, because while the HD port has unquestionably improved things massively, it has left the game with a rather inconsistent visual appearance. Some sections look excellent, but a terrible draw distance and the  sparse design of many parts of the game world make it all too clear that this was not a game initially developed for a capable platform.\n\nOverall, I would recommend AC:L to fans of the franchise. The game is generally a successful entry in the series, and I think most people who have played through the other AC games will appreciate some of the new mechanics and the other ways in which AC:L differs from its console counterparts. I also hope that those developing future Assassin's Creed titles will try to incorporate some of the things AC:L does well, rather than just discarding them, as has been the case with so many added mechanics and features throughout the series. 6.5/10","February 13, 2014","true","12.4"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

And that's not even based on the fact it was originally a portable title which received a much desired HD update that seems to be what all the cool kids are doing nowadays.\n\nThere is very little I can actually praise in Liberation because it will feel like a letdown even, if not especially, if you're already a fan of the Assassin's Creed series considering how disjointed story-wise and obviously rushed in design it feels with even more pointless collectible gathering if you're foolish enough to give in to mindless scouring over that carefully pinpointed map and awkward trading interface because that's what people apparently want in Ubisoft's distorted mindset. Actually, scratch the first part - there are precisely TWO things I would like to single out as good ideas: the trio of personas you get to use (Assassin, Lady and Slave) which are distinct enough but sadly underutilized, and the credits ruse which genuinely got me at first. Shame the game didn't have more of that courage to do something with its story aside from bland predictability and stilted characters abound.\n\nHey, at least the credits are skippable this time.\n","January 11, 2015","false","8.1"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","25","30","5","5"

Released along side Assassins Creed 3, Liberation was meant to be a PS vita game, it was later ported to the Xbox 360, PS 3 and then later the PC.   As a port of a vita game Liberation doesn't feel like a full fledged Assassin Creed title, it seems sort of bare bones, although with that said you can still fully expect all the same type of gameplay you've grown to love from previous AC games..\n\nStory  -  Liberation is an attempt by Abstergo Industries (yes that Abstergo) to commercially release interactive experiences to the general public.  Abstergo being all evil and sinister they censor the content to block out mentions of Templar's and Assassins, but fear not, thanks to hacktivist group you'll eventually discover the full story.  Unlike other previous Assassin Creed titles, the game has no alternate storyline set in the current age, you stay in the game (Animus) the entire time.   You will play the game as  Aveline de Grandpré.  Aveline is the daughter of a wealthy French trader and an African slave mother.  She'll set out on an adventure set in New Orleans in 1757's as a child, following your mother,  after being distracted by and chasing a chicken (Chicken Chaser...  oh wait that's Fable 1) Aveline finds herself lost and her mother missing, fast forward 13 years, a now grown Aveline lives with her father in his mansion.  Her father has since married a woman who cares for Aveline and treats her like a daughter.  It's from this starting point that Aveline starts on her grand adventure, to help free slaves, discover and stop the temper's grand schemes, potentially find love and discover a secret 13 years in the making.\n\nGameplay - nothing much has changed from previous Assassin's Creed games except the size, being a port of a vita game Liberation is shorter, has fewer collectibles, and generally seems rather lacking of extra content.  The game is comprised of 3 main areas, New Orleans city, The Bayou and Chichén Itzá.  The major addition to the game that wasn't seen in previous games is the Blowgun, which in my opinion is a total game changer.  This allows you to use a a weapon which can quickly kill enemies from stealth.  This weapon alone makes every mission easy mode.  Hide in bushes, blow a few darts, loot more darts and move on..   Another addition is three alternate persona's, the slave, assassin and Lady.  Each of these has their advantages and disadvantages.  The Slave has a weapon restriction, no guns, no main weapon, only the hidden blades and blow gun, also notoriety is very fast to increase.     The Lady has the same weapon restrictions as the Slave, as well having jumping disabled.  notoriety increases the slowest of any persona.  Lastly is the Assassin, which has no weapon or jumping restrictions, but has a 1 notoriety at all times.\n\nRecommended  -  Liberation was your typical Assassin's Creed fair, it really isn't necessary to play this game, nor is it part of the Abstergo storyline the other games followed.  Aside from being software released by Abstergo this game is a total stand alone.  In future AC games you get some mentions of Liberation but they are rather limited from what I've seen.  While this game is good, it doesn't quite live up to the other games, it's still a pretty good game but just not quite up to the level of previous games.  Going forward to Black Flag Liberation will seem really dull..\n\nWith that said I'd still suggest you play the game, after all who wants to play a serious and skip out on one of the chapters, even if that Chapter isn't the best game in the series.","March 3","true","13.5"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","23","27","2","1"

Personally, I am a huge fan of the (pre-) American Revolution setting of this and the previous AC game and the story is really not too bad as many other reviewers have said. Of course  the plot is not as convulted or rich as, let's say, AC III, but considering it's a PS Vita port, Ubisoft really did do a good job. The revamped graphics are also very pleasing to the eye. The combat and the freerun are as fluid as you'd expect from an AC game.\n\nSo go on ahead, fellow Assassins!

Here's the bugs I spotted without even searching for them in my 31 hour play through:\n-Game controls locked up repeatedly when pressing the wrong button after B when being attacked by a wild cat.\n-Canoes about 30-50 feet floating in mid-air (unsuable).  Restart game required.\n-Mounting and dismounting canoes often is more difficult than it should be.\n-The mission where you are supposed to scout out the three camps, I was a slave and looted the chests without alerting the guards.  The subesequent mission where you are supposed to loot the chests therefore breaks because 2 out of 3 are still in looted condition.  I have yet to find a way to replay the mission to reset the chests.\n-Game will only accept input from keyboard+mouse or controller at once; it does not accept both; moreover, when my wireless controller turns off and I turn it back on, the game switches to and stays in keyboard+mouse mode instead of going back to controller.\n-I've had a flickery static effect that usually only happens on level transitions keep happening over and over again.  I had to restart the game because it was driving me batty.\n-When exiting combat and sometimes looting, the look controls often lock up while it is finishing a painstakingly long animation.  Very annoying.\n-Typo on Lady Persona page.\n-It takes too long to open/close map/menu.  When are developers going to learn to stop animating menu entry/exit?\n\nI also have one general complaint that applies to Assassin's Creed III as well: get rid of or automate the trade system.  It feels like work to use it which is a lot like Mass Effect 2's planet probing.\n\nDespite all of that, I still recommend the game and the reason why is simple: it's better than Assassin's Creed III.  Not as long, not as varied, and no manning the helm of a ship, but the story in this game was actually enjoyable and the new mechanic of personas and the addition of the whip was a nice change.  Granted, if you're tired of Assassin's Creed gameplay, especially Assassin's Creed III, avoid this game.  If you like Assassin's Creed despite this title's particularlly glaring shortcomings, by all means grab it, play it, and enjoy it.","December 4, 2014","true","31.6"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

It's nice!\nIn this game only Single player.\nStory: at the beginning of the game we play for a little girl - this is the main character. After we show it as an adult, she grew up with a step-father and mother. But we can not tell how she got into the brotherhood of Assassins. On one quest we meet with Connor from Assassin Creed III.\nAs a result, the main enemy of the Templars is the stepmother of the protagonist. (I will not tell you everything because you will not be fun to play).\n\nWeapons: choice of weapons is small, there is an interesting weapon: a gun with two barrels (you can buy in the shop shopping), whip (you get it at some point through the game), a tube for firing poison darts, tomahawk Connor, an umbrella from which you can shoot poisonous darts (you will not discover if you will stand at a distance).\n\nGameplay: gameplay from Assassin's Creed III: running through the trees, combat style and other... But in this game to much bugs!!!! Bugs with audio, with combats, with textures, with items!\nNew in gameplay: in the forest, where a lot of swamps you can control canoe, we can change into three types of costumes: assassin, hired worker (I do not remember the correct name) and the lady (in this dress, you can use an umbrella with poisonous darts). By default, any location in the assassin outfit you will be the first level of fame - the guards will notice you. Also, if you climb and jump in - you will raise the level of investigation. In previous games had no such problems with the search. New enemies in the forest - crocodiles, they can be found in nests in the forest, where they guard the eggs.\n\nGraphic: 50% of graphic looks like in Assassin's Creed III. other 50% graphic is bad, have much bugs (for example problems with the drawing of buildings on long distances). You can say that I have a weak computer, but in Assassin Creed III I had no problems with that.\n\nI don't recommend this game...\nYou may ask why ?!\nAnswer: a lot of bugs in the gameplay and graphics, a lot of inexplicable moments in history and this game was boring for me.\n\nP.S.

Mock me if you want, but ACLHD takes you to awesome places, gives you awesome weapons, and the story goes beyond expectations of a $20 spinoff game. You play as Aveline, a female assassian who has 3 Persona's to swap. The "lady" persona can only use weapons such as the hidden blade and a parosel that shoots posion darts (best weapon ever) as well as charm guards and gentlemen, the slave persona can carry utility weapons like hatchets and long knives and start riots but has no armor, and the assassin persona has full access to the rather large weapon library including pistols, swords, daggers, hatchets, and some old favorites like the blowpipe and connor's hatchet (Uplay reward). The game also brings in new weapons like the whip (like rope darts but 10x better and cooler). The places you go in the 12 hours I've played is amazing. New orleans is a very interesting city that heavily changes physically as time goes on. When the spanish take over you can see little skirmishes in the streets with citizens fighting off soldiers and blockades imparing movement. Muggers begin to pop up everywhere as well and the lady persona will be robbed by them if you don't fight them off. You also spend alot of time in the Bayou, which is like 4x better than the frontier from ac3 and at least 60% of the size. There's gators, smugglers, small camps, forts, and alot of collectibles to find. You also travel to mexico twice and explore awesome landmarks there like chichen iza and underwater caves.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/okayfrog/recommended/260210/","okayfrog","okayfrog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/okayfrog/","749 products in account","I had hopes for Assassin's Creed Liberation. I saw the negative reviews and thought, "Well, it can't be any worse than Assassin's Creed III." Sadly, I was wrong. The game is littered with problems. The framer rate is noticeably jarring and the whole game has a weird, molasses-like feeling to it that a game involving flowing parkour should not have. The gameplay is unchanged from previous games. Enemy attacks. I press "B" on the Xbox 360 controller. I counter. I then press "X" to kill or I press "A", "B", or "Y" if the enemy is immune to kill counters. A lot of time, one has to experiment to find out whether or not an enemy is immune to kill counters, which makes getting some of the "don't get damaged" optional objectives fairly annoying. There are numerous tailing missions, probably as much as any other Assassin's Creed game which is definitely saying something as this game's about half as long. The tailing missions are just as enjoyable as they were in the previous games in that at best, they're boring time-wasters, and at worst, they're frustrating and not enjoyable.\n\nI encountered numerous glitches whilst playing. At one point, my character fell through the ground in the bayou area and I was stuck swimming in nothing. At another point, an alligator lunged at me to eat me, but ended up falling through the ground himself. Aveline then seemed to have an epileptic fit and I was desynchronized. Sometimes counters just won't register and enemies will attack without the big glowing emblem on their head -- and I'm not saying that they should always have that or else I wouldn't be able to counter them (I've played through the Arkham games with no problem on Hard where there are no emblem notifications), just that it is discouraging to see the game seemingly break its own rules. I also experienced a glitch with the ship trading system in the game. In order to make the money required to buy all the weapons and outfits, one has to send out ships to sell items. This is similar to the Brotherhood assignments in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and Revelations and to the Homestead missions in Assassin's Creed III. When a ship arrives and sells its materials, the player is notified and given the money. Sometimes when I would be playing a mission, I'd see a notification and receive money, and then desynchronize afterwards due to an error I made and start back at a checkpoint prior to when I received the money. I'd play for a few minutes and notice that the notification hasn't popped up again. That's right: Desynchronizing during a mission after receiving money for ship trading missions sometimes means not gaining money that money. It's something that's so broken that I honestly cannot comprehend how it got past play-testing.\n\nThe side missions are all forgettable, as are most of the characters and the story. The game plays out like how one would imagine a smaller version of a normal Assassin's Creed game would play out, sadly. Everything feels compacted and not enough is expanded upon. Because of this, I had a hard time keeping up with the story until I was around halfway done with the game. There are plenty of collectables to find in the game, yet not much of a motivation to gather any of them. Switching between various personas is a novel concept, but only being able to do this in a changing room usually means (1) coming across an event that requires one persona then (2) running across the map to a changing room then (3) running back to the event so that one can actually play it and then finally (4) running back to the changing room to switch back to the persona one was before. It all becomes a slog without any form of quick travel. Some events are also only viewable on the map for certain personas and custom waypoints disappear when switching between personas for some godforsaken reason.\n\nI think that's enough problems I had with the game. As for the good things about the game, uhh... Aveline is more tolerable than Connor and she looked nice in a dress. Playing as different personas -- as I mentioned above -- is a novel idea and can be enjoyable at times due to the slight differences. There's also some modern day/conspiracy/Mayan weirdness in this game which I enjoy in the Assassin's Creed series (one of the only things that keeps me playing the series).\n\nIf you REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY enjoy the Assassin's Creed gameplay, you should be able to enjoy this. If you just tolerate it, stay away. If you play the Assassin's Creed games for the story, you can skip over this one as it doesn't have much of a connection with the overarching storyline.","August 22, 2014","false","14.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","16","20","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Remuson/recommended/260210/","Remuson","Remus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Remuson/","380 products in account","Welcome to Assassin's Creed: Liberation, where the Templars have become a mere afterthought to the much more looming threat: game controls. The developers clearly wanted to break the mold of tight, fluid game controls and go in the polar opposite direction with design. Every spare moment between cut scenes and dialog is dedicated to combating Aveline's sense of direction and agility. Want to chase someone on the ground? Good luck not jumping into a tree 90 degrees from the angle you're trying to run. Want to race someone across the rooftops? "Are you sure you didn't want to fall into a crowd of guards on the ground while making a simple, obvious, short-distance leap?" asks the game, then takes its own advice with your character. And hey, that combat system, right? Most people would think improving the notoriously quirky combat system is the right direction for development, but Ubisoft is obviously thinking on a whole different level and decided to go meta, making the battle actually take place in the real world, against your game pad.\n\nThe story is probably the most confusing and pointless in the Assassin's Creed universe, and that's saying something. There are several head-scratching moments where it appears the story editors either forgot a whole scene or accidentally cut the wrong segment. There are side missions missing dialog to make any sort of sense of them, and cut scenes irrelevant to the missions. Meanwhile, overlaid on all of this is the baffling notoriety system that doesn't follow a reasonable logic (accidentally climb on a box while running through the streets in the slave persona, suddenly wanted posters are plastered on all buildings across the Caribbean). The notoriety doesn't mesh with the fact that a well-known noble woman is hiding her activities from her father, a well-known business man, or from the rest of the city for that matter.\n\nAll that being said, Aveline is a nice addition to the Assassin's Creed character lineup, even though no one else in the game, aside from a cameo from another important character, is interesting and all the rest border on annoying and/or excruciating (Gerald would have been vastly improved if his entire dialog was just removed from the game). She is the only compelling reason to play all the way through this otherwise frustrating, confusing, thin game.","February 3","false","24.1"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","13","17","8","0"

You play as Aveline De Grandpre who was raised by her stepmother and father after her mother was freed from slavery and forced to leave Aveline behind. The story for this game is actually really enjoyable with a few twists and turns here and there. It is the first game in the series to bring in two assassin's side by side from different games, even though it was only for one memory, but it was a fun one. Although the story is mainly about fighting for freedom from slavery, there is some interesting characters in this game and some funny moments. Aveline also is the first assassin to have 3 different personas for her character, each of them have their strengths and weaknesses, and they implement well into the story. There is also a few good side missions to do and collectibles to find.\n\nThe game from a graphical point of view is actually nice, originally this game was made on the Playstation Vita system and there are massive improvements on the PC version when u compare the two of them together. The game is also well optimized and i had a constant 60FPS! at 1080p with all graphical settings maxed out. I had no weird bugs or glitches and the game performed quite well.\n\nIf there is anything negative about this game, I suppose it has to be that the game is rather short, which being honest is expected since the game was ported from the PS VITA and if it was a bigger title it would have been on PC and other consoles at launch instead of being renamed HD.\n\nOverall i do recommend this game to you as it is rather interesting and it has for the first time a female assassin, and the game looks good enough too considering it was ported from a handheld console. The gameplay is smooth and it is also another good entry into the assassin's creed franchise.","October 26, 2015","true","10.6"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","17","25","3","0"

A portable game ported to HD machines, like most portable franchises, the game proves to be a stripped version of the main game it's name sake takes after. The story itself also falls victim to this kind of second-hand treatment. While the main game usually has great writing, this game has poor writing conisistently throughout.\n\nLiberation's gameplay is very similar to previous Assassin games, in that you have chests to open, items to collect, viewpoints to sync, and people to assassinate. Unfourtantely this game takes after it's console brethen at the time, Assassin's Creed 3, which makes this game a poorer version of that one. There are plently of glitches abound in the gameplay, sometimes the guards mark doesn't appear over their ahead once they are about to attack and there is no way to see secondary objectives. The assassin gameplay is good enough, but other games in the series have already done it better.\n\nThe enviorments in the game, New Orleans, The Bayou, and Mexico are well detailed like any Ubisoft game, but they are also the smallest enviorments. They are so small that it's hard to consider the game open-world. The graphics are also a bit of a mixed bag. If you play this game after Revelations and before 3, then you will appreciate the higher fidelity in the enviorments, however the character models are pretty bad all around. Their clothes and attire are detailed, but their faces are clearly of a lesser quality. Revelations itself has more expressive faces.\n\nUnfourtantely the story is hardly ever engaging or interesting, mainly due to the fact that the game itself covers such familiar ground. Aveline is after an artifact like other Assassin's and in this case it's a disk (At this point you might wonder if Ubisoft will eventually make a table a Piece of Eden at some point.) Although to the game's credit we do see Ubisoft cover different enough territory. I love the fact that we see the situations Aveline has to go through as a woman who used to be a slave. There is also a nice side excursion with Connor, however it does little then connect this game to that games universe, in other words Connor's appearance is little more than a glorified cameo that adds little to game. Eventually the game does veer off into a different enough story bits, but does so to mixed results. In the intrest of spoilers, I'll say this, Rogue, 3, and Black Flag cover the opposing idealogies and how they are different and better in some ways in a much clearer way.\n\nThis is the time that I wish Steam had a middle ground, because while the game is decent, it definetly is not good enough for the casual fan. If you are a hardcore fan like me give the game a go, but know that in the end even as a harcore fan I was a bit dissapointed. It's a shame that story with potential with an interesting character is regulated to a game that comes across as mediocre for an Assassin's Creed game.\n\nSome notes\n\nI played this on a GTX 970, i7, Windows 10 computer\nI had some peformance issues. Random drops in FPS that I could never change.\nThe game's Ultra setting for Anti-aliasing seems to be bugged as it easily halfed my framerate in half on my system.\nI got 68 % synchronization.","March 19","false","10.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

The settings are well crafted and beautifuly displayed; each viewpoint feels unique making every climb feel different from the last. The game also loads quickly taking you straight into the action. The story develops seamlessly as it takes you into the mission area and lets you take control, the only thing slowing you down being the occasional mandatory changing of clothes before proceeding. Avelin takes up one of three personas: The lady, The Slave and the Assassin each having unique abilities.

Listing all the flaws would require a separate article or two but it all came down to not being fun to play. Liberation was intended as a Vita-exclusive spin-off sister to III but turns out to be refreshing in a way the big brother never achieved despite all his hard work.\n\nLiberation is led by Aveline de Grandpre, an Assassin of mixed ethnicity and belonging to the upper classes of society by birth. From the very first moment she is welcome company: practical and resourceful, preferring accomplishment to analysis. Her driving motivation is the plight of slaves, based partly on the realisation that she could have been worked to death just as easily. Given how many game stories are based on homicidal vengeance this is downright humanitarian. Aveline has a no-nonsense dedication to the duties of her vocation but she is never the wooden locomotive Connor was and has a sense of adventure and is allowed moments of banter as well. She is given both understated style and human warmth by Amber Goldfarb who cannot help herself from shaming the gray, gray droning of Connor.\n\nOther characters make an impression as well, particularly the intelligence officer Gerald who plays Q to Avelines 007. Gerald is a highly amusing nerd gentleman who most likely keeps an emotionally intense journal of his unrequited passion for Aveline when not supporting her assassinations with information and resources. Given Avelines highly practical attitude towards life this turns out to be a clever pairing, not just reversing the expected for the sake of doing so.\n\nIt is the clothes that make the man but based on Liberation they appear to have significance to women as well for Aveline has three distinct Personas with their own strengths and weaknesses. The Assassin is most familiar and allows full combat ability. The women of the period were not supposed to carry weapons so it is logical the guards will always investigate Aveline when in this guise, making stealth highly impractical. The polar opposite of The Assassin is The Lady, which lets Aveline assume the appearance of a noblewoman which maximises stealth but removes free running completely and makes attempting combat a foolish endeavour. Striking a compromise between the two already mentioned is The Slave. All in all I was very happy with this system for it manages to make a point about class and appearance without resorting to bullhorns and the various gameplay strengths and weaknesses also encourage creative problem solving.\n\nLiberation comes to PC with HD improvements. Of these, the visuals are comparable to the Ezio titles while the new persona-specific questlines added are some amusing gameplay and absolutely no fiction. The music on the other hand is absolutely beautiful, restrained and tasteful, adding greatly to the atmosphere. There is also no present-day gameplay proving yet again what a toxic cloud Desmond was and how relieving it is to be away from him. The story also begins with Aveline being a fully trained Assassin doing important work which also contributes to the sense of forward motion I always felt in Liberation. Some of the sequences also withstand comparison to the best ones in the whole series, particularly an undercover assignment to Chichen Itza. Many other features from combat tools to the trading map have been simplified in a healthy way as well, many of which Creed fans will definitely appreciate.\n\nThe greatest flaw in Liberation is not what is in the game but what is not. Of all the games in the series this is the one where I constantly hoped more would have been done instead of less. From the highly atmospheric New Orleans setting to the story combining a sense of adventure with symphatetic characters and serious themses, to the slight but meaningful refinements to familiar things -- all the seeds of greatness are there, sometimes in hints and sometimes in something much more. I spent 20 hours in Liberation but this included very many collectibles and all the side quests because I did not want the game to end.\n\nTo label Assassins Creed Liberation HD "fans only" is redundant because the entire series is for fans only. From that perspective I can say Liberation was a fresh drink of ones and zeroes and I am certainly appreciative of being finally able to play. Liberation is more adjustments and refinements to the familiar than the thrill of discovery and certain adjustments to the level of expectations had to be made as well. But once the illusion was allowed to take hold Liberation not only entertained for the duration but left behind some good gaming memories as well and I can recommend it on this basis alone.","January 28, 2014","true","19.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I'll just say what I really thought of it.\nFor some ♥♥♥♥ing reason that no one understood until today, Ubisoft remembered to spend a PS Vita game to other platforms.\nFor me, they could continue to work were an upcoming Assassin's Creed, and ensure that it won't be a ♥♥♥♥ like III was(Connor fans will revolt..).\n\n● And let's start out there, they could have released for PC, PS3 and XBOX 360 Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines, which would complement the story of Altair, but no, they had to go put the continuation of the worst Assassin's Creed ever, which basically is the DLC Black Flags: Cry Freedom.\n● I know many people were bugging Ubisoft to make a game with a female character, I want it to happen. But I don't want a game made in months just to shut up the fans.\n● I just think it was ridiculous lauching a game so close after AC IV. After such a good game, people will play it and will think "R.I.P. Assassin's Creed".\n● Not that the story is that bad, because it's not, but it's monotonous. At no point you're gonna want to keep playing with that desire to know the story, if you have to go to sleep you will go, and you won't play the game for two or three days. And it makes me confused, being assumed fan of Assassin's Creed as I am, I did not understand the purpose.\n● I even like Avaline, I find her to be strong and warrior, demonstrates some times be stubborn and that she believes in herself. Aveline has as much skill as Edward, Connor, Ezio or Altair, and she can still shake her ♥♥♥, huh? But, no one will remember it in a few months, no one will immortalize as they did with Ezio. No one will be crazy to get the game to go in search of collectibles, no. There is nothing attractive about it, not ♥♥♥♥ nor ♥♥♥ will save it.\n● The graphics are not the best in the world. At the beginning I hated it, but some settings resolve this. I did not expect them to be TOP, as if someone thought that paying 20€ for a game that came from PS Vita and have the most power overpowered graphs, right? I like the scenery, I think that diversity is even minimally acceptable.\n● The gameplay is typical of Assassin's Creed, it's fluid and at this level I don't think that I could criticize much. Being that came from a portable platform, the adaptation was very good. Just explain to me why that "E" does everything, but it's ok.\n\nI must confess that I was surprised with the game, it's not as bad as I was expecting. Initially I thought it would be about five hours of gameplay and bye, but I was wrong. However there are a lot of negative thing I have to point out, especially that the story is so boring. AC always scored in the story.. In addition to the circumstances in which it was launched in.\nFor the fans, I recommend you play, but if you don't play, your not losing much, and neither will be happier because of it. Seriously, this somehow hurts to score an AC game like this, but after all that said I think they know that the classification is valid.\n\n★★★★★★☆☆☆☆ 6/10\n","January 23, 2014","true","17.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

That may be the case this one feels like it has more of an interesting story. You play as Aveline de Grandpré, the first female protaginist in the series. She is a half black, half french woman in Lousianna during 1765 to 1777. Her father layed with one of his slaves, and once he found out about her mother's pregnacy, gave Aveline and her mother their freedom; As well as allow them to live as nobles. So one day when they were out and nobling around the city Aveline's mother disappeared. So from now on she wonders why her mother left her. And for some reason she manage to one of the last Assassin trainer in Lousiana to train her to be the killer that she is today. The unique mechanic in this game revolves around her "Personas". She can look like an Assassin, a noble woman, or a slave. Each of them have their pluses and minuses. The assassin is the best fighter, using plenty of weapons and gadgets in the game. The noble woman charms men, and uses an umbrella that fires a poison dart (really cool and sneaky.) Finally, the slave, she can fight, just not well. She is better use for her free running and to disguise herself as a slave to get past guards. Personally I enjoyed this game a lot more than Connor's tale. It feels like if they focused on this one instead of AC3, it could of been an amazing title. My only regret is the lenth of the game, and the length of the missions. Since this was originally on the Vita, the missions are much shorter compared to one of the main series' missions. Also I'm still waiting for my "Voodoo pack" items to appear but I just don't have them.

The character that you play, Aveline, has a strong background about how she was left on her own by a child and has been raised by a her 'new' mother.  The map is very detailed and there are lots of different things to collect.  The fact that you have three personas is a great idea and more games should implament this into their games.  For each persona, there is a diffent wanted level, meaning that if you gathered a lot of noriety in the assassin persona, change to the lady persona and bride gueards.\n\nAlso, the fact that when you're in the slave persona, you can get into any plantation by picking up and carrying a crate is amazing!  It may not sound like much, but when you're in a lazy mood and need to get into a plantation, just change to the slave persona and walk straight passed the gueards.\n\nThere are many things I have seen in this game that were in Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, like icons etc... For example, when you're looting someone, the icon is the same as Assassin's Creed: Black Flag!  This just makes the game look a lot smoother and polished.\n\nWhen I pre-ordered the game, I didn't know what to expect.  I thought the game mechanics where going to be incredibly bad (as this has just been re-ported - used to be a PS Vita game).  And to be honest, ubisoft have done really well.  There will be many moments in the game where you just want to throw your computer out of the window (as I wanted to while recording a walkthough) because some things are fairly glitchy. Also, the free running (like in all Assassins Creed game) is really frustraiting.\n\nOne more bad point, this game has quick time events.  These are really annoying!  I was trying to do a mission but couldn't until I took down this crocodile.  However, it was a quick time event.  If you pressed a button just a second out of time, you will have to restart all over again!\n\n\n\nHowever, over all, ubisoft have done really well porting this game over to PC!  Even though the missions may be a little short, that's fine because they're packed full of information!\n\nIf you would like to see gameplay, feel free to check out my walkthrough over on YouTube!  www.youtube.com/tomthecubegaming","January 21, 2014","true","4.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

It's an embarrassment to the entire franchise.  Plagued by bugs and glitches, terrible story, not very well explained.  Movement controls are some of the worst in the series.  Voice acting is atrocious.  To no surprise, the game is not optimised for PC.  The only good part of the PC version is that the textures have been redone to look nicer.  There is no fast travel in the entire game, the persona's are a neat idea but the lady persona is just annoying and pretty much irrelevant (you run slowly and cannot jump or climb).  Too much running around without any reason why, very repetitive missions, lack of side quests.  The Trade System is kind of fun.  Nothing more than glorified DLC.  Ubisoft Sofia really dropped the ball on this one.  If you're looking for a great Assassin's Creed title, I would recommend skipping this one and playing Black Flag, or Rogue.","April 1, 2015","false","14.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

The last three Assassin's Creed games (AC3, AC3:L, and AC4) have almost completely gotten rid of the idea of a guild or Creed. The premises have comprised of the main characters story and nothing more. Though we see the Creed amongst the natives in AC4, we do next to nothing with them for a big portion of the game. Though it looks like Unity will be bringing back that Creed feel, I can definitely say I am tired of feeling like I am only playing a character that is only an assassin because they "knew a guy who knew a guy."\n\nAs far as Liberation goes, it is one of the worst Assassin's Creed games yet. First off, the story was atrocious. I was getting pretty freakin bored when there were entire sequences devoted to helping the fathers company. The story telling felt chopped up and your only real motivation was because you were being told to. I cared very little for the characters in this game. Even with Aveline, her character was not very rounded and I could have cared less as to what happened to her in the end. Practically the whole story was told by you going from point A to point B and pressing activate on something, that is seriously about 90% of this game. Liberation was probably the worst yet about this, but something has got to give with Assassin's Creed games when it comes to gameplay. I can only do tailing and eaves-dropping missions so many times, its getting insanely old Ubisoft! And whats up with this thing in Assassin"s Creed games where they will spawn you in after a cut-scene only 10 feet away from where you need to run to in order to trigger the next cut-scene, I mean why bother? Though a lot of people claim the climbing was awful in this one, I found that it was acceptable, with one exception being a cave area near the end that frustrated the ever-living sh*t out of me. Oh and MY goodness the voice acting in this game... It had some of the worst voice acting for a decent budget game that I have heard in a long time. As far as the graphics go, they were okay. Though you could tell it was a port from the Vita, the graphics were not really all that bad, but it does not quite compare to any of the other Assassin's Creed games.\n\nOverall this game sucked. It just simply was not fun. I would only recommend getting it if it went on a huge sell and you happen to be a big fan of Assassin's Creed games, otherwise spare yourself.","September 30, 2014","false","11.7"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","21","37","2","0"

It turns out to be the worst I've EVER played.\n\nIt's a port from PS Vita; really obvious from the monotonous music.\n\nThe first thing that frustrates me is the controls. Aveline, though slimmer than her male counterparts, is much more clumsier. Freerunning through the trees in the Bayou is a pain. Somehow the system can't detect another branch on the other side of the trunk unless you press left or right. The leaves can be hard like walls and nothing can get through. Some of the gaps can be slid under while other gaps, much higher, are simply see-through walls.\n\nAnother really annoying thing about the game is the environment sounds and Aveline's sounds. Everytime she hops, or just getting onto a barrel, she grunts or groans. Freerunning through rooftops comes with a series of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ from her. The most irritating sound in the game is the questioning "enh?" from the passerbys. In the end I just stab them when they issue such a sound.\n\nThe dialogue in this game is really illogical. No wait, they're ILL-logical. Take, for example, sequence 3. Aveline and Elise both crashed through the fort and "wrecked" the slaves' "chance for work" (more likely to be sold). But somehow the slaves had grudge only on Aveline, and Elise is able to take the slaves back, not to mention giving Aveline a sarcastic sneer of her "incurring gratitude" when she herself had a hand in this. The mentor Agate questions Aveline's loyalty when she came to him instantly upon receiving his message, and then he stole her idea to assassin the governor and gave her an order that apparently she was going to carry out, regardless the order.\n\nThe quests themselves are just unreasonably difficult. Guards can detect you with their backs to you. Cutscenes are long, boring and unskippable, and the checkpoints are scarce. Don't even hope for the fast-travel: the "fast-travels" marked on the  map means "ship from New Orleans to the Bayou".\n\nThe innovative aspect of this game is the personas. BUT don't get you hopes high about changing persona whenever you want in the quest - impossible.\n\nDon't waste your money on this. This is even worse than AC3. The only game in the series worse than this is AC3 DLCs.","March 20, 2015","false","16.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/260210/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Assassin's Creed Liberation HD feels like any other AC game. You can definitely tell that it's a port because of the way missions are set up. There seem to be more checkpoints, and missions overall are shorter in comparison to other AC games.\n\nThe game also uses less areas and the story can be roughly completed in 8-9 hours. That doesn't mean you finished the game, however, there's still tons of stuff to do, like finding secrets, buying different types of properties, stuff like that.\n\nLiberation allows you do stuff that you can't do in other AC games and vice versa. For example, there's no hunting this time. Is it sorely missed ? Not at all. That's all just mindless, but enjoyable filler. But I still missed it. Same goes for naval combat, which is not included. Liberation allows your female assassin to charm people, and switch between different outfits. It's a fun idea that's poorly executed, because it basically limits your freedom. The assassin outfit allows you to move freely, the slave outfit allows you to blend in with slaves and the lady persona allows you to be a lady that can be harrased by smugglers, which is absolutely useless. Ok, that's not exactly what it's used for, but come one, it doesn't even allow you to kill someone while wearing it. As I said, the idea is good but it needs better implementation.\n\nOther fun new additions to the AC formula are the whip which is great for combat and also for traversing certain areas. Chain kills are also great and are very handy at times.\n\nThe graphics are hit and miss. First of all, the game doesn't run at 60fps, but around 35-45fps, which is already frustrating, because a port like this should definitely run at 60fps solid. And while most of the graphics have been improved, the faces of some of these characters are still terrible. I also missed a lot of fine detail in many scenes. But considering the price they're asking for it, I can't complain I guess.\n\nVoice acting is pretty solid, and exactly what've come to expect from an AC game.\nThe story isn't as interesting as many of the other AC games but still managed to impress me, with its slave theme and female lead.\n\nLiberation is a flawed but interesting AC game that's still very much enjoyable if you can look past these flaws. You might be disappointed because it's probably not what you've come to expect from the series, but as a game it's all good fun. Is it better/more fun than ACIII ? Absolutely !\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","January 19, 2014","true","8.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Some other reviewers complained about the persona system, but I think it allows you to play with your style a bit more, since you can choose whether you want to prioritize combat, stealth, etc. The graphics are pretty, though the resolution is still lower than AC4, but I enjoy it just fine when it's not full screen.

I have played better and I have played worse.\n\nI actually quite liked the story, I thought there was a nice twist at the end, but there was nothing particularly mindblowing in it. Also I feel that Aveline's character was okay, but I did not find her that engaging. As the first and only female assassins (so far) I was hoping that she would be a very strong character, she just felt the same as the other assassins to me.\n\nI think the persona/clothes changing mechanic was interesting and it was one of the things I liked about the game. Depending on what you are wearing you get different limitations and abilities. I would have enjoyed the mechanic more if I could have used it to accomplish missions with different appoaroaches, but the game more or less tells you what clothes you should wear in each mission so I felt they lost the true potential of this mechanic.The environment had quite a bit of exploration, but the game did not really engage me enough to explore and collect things. The gameplay is the same as other Assassin Creed games except for the persona mechanic.\n\nOverall I liked the story albeit a bit basic and I found the persona mechanic interesting enough to just enjoy this game. I found Aveline rather unengaging.\n\nI believe this game is a port, but I am one of those people who cannot tell the difference between 30 and 60 FPS (I did a test to check this) so I cannot comment on that, but I should make you aware that  I have heard it is ported from PS Vita to PC[/b]. Also as someone who still plays PS1, PS2, NES, SNES etc. I find graphics an impressive bonus in the modern era, so I do not really care how good a game looks only that it plays well. This game did play well I did not have any problems with really bad lag or lag time between buttons presses and actions on screen.

The "persona" system is a bit annoying but does serve a well placed purpose, but I get the sneaking suspicion it was implemented in a sort of "we'll hook the girl gamers with these dresses" sort of marketing executive decision.\nA few bugs, dont engage the jaguar's in the bayou first, let them attack then get them off you and shoot them.

Also, this time you are given a whip, which is like having an infinite number of rope darts. Other than that, there are not many differences compared to AC3.\nThe downside of this game for me definitely was a scenario. The story itself is not bad at all, but the way it's being portrayed is quite poor and gives me a feeling that the developers haven't put a lot of effort into making of the game. I understand perfectly that this game is cheaper than Assassin's Creed 3, but still one expects more from the addition to the series.\nAll in all, if you are a fan of Assassin's Creed or have some money to spare, you should spend a couple of evenings with Liberation and help young Aveline in her efforts.","February 4","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'd like to think of Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD as Assassin's Creed III's little brother (sister?) in terms of graphics, gameplay, story, and everything else. Don't expect too much though; the game still has the trappings of a Vita port (e.g. shorter missions, smaller locations, not that many side quests compared to games in the main series) and there's a good chance your PC won't run it smoothly due to stability issues. Though fixes are usually easy, I suggest holding off until Ubisoft releases a patch addressing this and other issues. Otherwise, this is a fun little adventure through 18th Century Louisiana and a great complement to Assassin's Creed III.","March 16, 2014","true","34.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're a fan of the series and absolutely must play every AC game for the whole story, then I'm not going to stop you. It's why I got it. But let me warn you, this is not a good representative of the series. The game is boggy, the controls feel soft and floaty. The action will slow to a crawl from a memory leak or just an overambitious engine. The story is told in bursts, that I assume fit when it was on the Vita, but now just jerk you out of the experience. The cut scenes are out of sync, sometimes by several seconds. The combat can be unresponsive, so when the mission says don't get hit, and you're mashing the smoke bombs before the heavy starts swinging... yeah, good luck.\n\nWhat's good... If it matters or not, you are the first female lead in an Assassin's Creed game. They have an interesting mechanic regarding your Personas, diguises you wear to infiltrate different levels of society. But a lot more could have been done with that than what was used.

It functions fine and feels like an AC game, specifically AC III, so if you enjoy AC games then this is perfectly serviceable for no more than the $5-$7.50 sweet spot. If you like AC multiplayer then you're SOL with this game, but me personally I always enjoyed the single player aspect over the multiplayer so that didn't bother me too much. The story is kind of interesting for the first half of the game but then falls apart toward the end before finishing with a completely unsatisfying ending. The worst part is since this is a spin-off you're left with the feeling that Aveline's story didn't mean much of anything in the grand scheme of things regarding the overall AC mythos, but I still need to play Black Flag, Rogue and Unity so perhaps they reference it in any of those games. This is a spin-off, though, and much like Altair's PSP sidestory was lost in the ether I get the feeling this is the last we'll ever hear of Aveline and the First Civilization mystery disc that this game is about. I thought the graphics were fine considering this is just an upscaled Vita game. The graphics and resolution options are barebones so look elsewhere if you're looking for a game to make your rig purr. As it is, it's a serviceable spin-off or "expansion pack" to AC III.\n\nI'll recommend this to only people that enjoy the Assassin's Creed games and only if you get this for $7.50 or less.

My  character constantly is jumping into or running up things that I was not trying to, constantly gets stuck trying to run up a part of a tree high in it when I am trying to just instead jump to another branch, and at one point at the very top of a tree right under the sync point got stuck under a branch clung against the tree and wouldn't move and the only option was to jump off and die. It was especially aggravating since I had to run/canoe/swim all the long f--king way across the map back to where the quest started. When those things aren't all happening, you can do other things like while trying to jump to a new branch, she will glitch backwards and just hang on the branch you started from. The parkouring controls are a broken unfun chore mess.\n\nPerformance also suffers from problems like most AC for PC games do. I had to fix horrible stuttering common in AC games by disabling the game from trying to access online through my firewall. There's still slowdown issues in certain places of the maps where there shouldn't be, all because Ubisoft still hasn't learned to code pc games right, although AC Rogue does run nicely.\n\nThe game can be fun as AC games usually are. Playing as a chick is fine I never cared about my characters gender as long as the gameplay is fun. The weapons and gadgets are all faithful to AC and combat flows the same as past games.\n\nOther than that there isn't a lot to say because the game is very short. I completed Freedom Cry in 7 hours but could have done it in less. This one feels the same because I just started playing and am already 23% done with story progress. Graphics are good and it is fun when things all work right. Oh well.

And I regret spending each cent on this tittle. Why ? I'll explain down below.\n\nFirst of all textures and modeling looks ok, something between AC2 and AC3. However environment looks empty, it lacks additional decorations, stuff like bushes, grass, flowers etc. Animations are also weird and glitchy. Aveline  moves a bit weird, lip-sinking often is off, in a fight weapons go past enemies and so on. Also there are reasonable number of bugs in general which often will make you stuck in environment or not allow you to progress the current mission, so you must restart the game all over. Autosaves sometimes don't work even if the icon shows that they happened, and there is just so much more I could mention.\nAnd the sound design ? It's a mess as well, voice acting is nothing impressive with over the top french accent and unmemorable music.\n\nLast thing i didn't cover, is the game-play.\nGame is really easy with free run being  just too forgiving. However it filled with bugs as well, especially in wilderness. Combat is the same AC stuff, but here guards are more less likely to detect you and i found they are not that much around in environment as well.\nThere are some new mechanics, which are poorly implemented and are waste of time.\n\nSo to sum it up. You should avoid this tittle even if you are die-hard AC fan like I am. Game is glitchy and buggy. Gameplay is boring. World and characters are poorly designed. the list just continuous.\n\nFrom what I played, I won't give it more than 4.5/10 !!!\nThanks for reading.\n\n\n","January 3, 2015","false","7.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Her three modes: Lady, Assassin, and Slave, add a nice dimension that is not present in the other AC games. The Graphics are pretty good, but a slight step down from a recent release like Black Flag.

It doesn't take that long to finish the main plot and the side missions aren't nescessary nor overly time consuming. The games most appealing quality is the only female assassin protagonist to date, 'Aveline'. She is an in-depth character working to abolish slavery, once being a slave herself. Through the game you can switch between her three personas, 'slave', 'lady' and 'assassin'. Each comes with different 'skills' if you will, and some missions are only completable as a certain persona.\nThe combat and free-running feel very familiar to other titles.

That's pretty much how AC: Liberation was after beating the last mission.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the animators, modelers, artists, and programmers did a splendid job, especially with the HD upgrade from the Vita version. It's the story that's largely uninspired. It's boring, it never drew me in and it almost felt like a chore just to continue playing. The only thing that kept me going is my necessity to complete an Assassin's story as I do find myself enamored in the AC universe.\n\nAveline is an interesting Assassin, and the first playable female one in the series, despite not being part of the main canon. Her goals and ambitions are there, although they're generic as fudge, but her story never had a 'wow factor' either. There wasn't anything remotely interesting about it, and there wasn't anything surprising either. The intro has just about no context as far as Aveline's mother disappearing. And then suddenly you go from child to full on Assassin. It's like, where's the training, or mentorship? Where's the self discovery? Basically there wasn't any character development because of the significant time jump in character.\n\nThe story itself is predictable. Actually, no, it's not. It jumps all over the place concerning locations, and which character's you'll be interacting with, but the whole "The slavers are Templars, you're the liberator uncovering a plot" was just so typical and there wasn't any interesting spin to draw you in. Plus the dialogue was laughable and the cutscenes were overacted.\n\nI feel like I shouldn't have to continue, basically, the plot wasn't that great. There's a good story in there somewhere, but the approach wasn't good.\n\nI will continue though, the gameplay and everything else was pretty good, but there are also parts towards the end of the game where Aveline bugs out while climbing or will randomly get stuck at the edge of dock while an enemy attempts to flail their weapon at you. You'll find instances of being randomly stuck, or the level design in one-off areas are kind of poor, you could just tell that the devs were being rushed to push this game out. Soundtrack was a bit random at points, music from the bayou still playing in New Orleans and is African influenced even though the main character was raised in a French family, like wtf. The sound design seemed empty too, like crowd chatter in New Orleans was kept to a minimum. The ambient sounds in the bayou weren't prominent enough. New Orleans itself was designed well enough. I'd imagine that over 200 hundred years ago, it was as small as it was in this game, but none of the buildings were interesting.\n\nEven the historical context in the game is kept to a bare minimum, like there's in game codex appearances when seeing historical buildings or people, you just see them and maybe they're in the data aspect in the main menu. Maybe.\n\nOverall, it wasn't a bad game, but not a great one either. Just an okay one.\n\n6.5/10\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this unless it's uber cheap or if you're a hardcore AC fan.","May 12, 2015","false","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

WOW I really enjoy it and while sure it may have crisper graphics but nothing you havent seen from a well funded 2011-2012 game in the year 2014.... its affordable and the story is gripping and quite deep... Aveline is a crazy great character to play and has possibly the most intriguing back story i have witnessed in a long time of gaming! The fighting and climbing is slightly slower and grittier as Aveline is tall and solid but slender, still only a 70-80kg woman which they totally take into account! The climbing and fighting rely on finnesse and her ability to misdirect and avoid taking damage instead of the usual counter then become unstoppable i hear about in other creeds games.... Its political, smooth, gritty, realistic, quite beautiful, mature and frankly alot more fun than driving a pirate ship like its a formula one car in the pinnacle of unrealism that is the "latest" creed to date.... Liberation offers alot more for alot less money and wont ♥♥♥♥ you off with complete and utter pirate nonsense....\n\n\nUpon killing all CitezenE characters and unlocking the true story.... which isnt hard.... this game was a 9.5/10 for me... considering this games background and history that is a perfect score for any creed game i am not really fans of... this is refreshing, smooth and an incredibly interesting story that will keep you wanting to play just to find out the truth!

Lady Persona memiliki tingkat notoriety yang rendah di mata pasukan dan bisa mengakses banyak tempat namun pergerakan dan senjatanya terbatas. Slave Persona memiliki memiliki notoriety yang cepat naik di mata pasukan namun memiliki pergerakan dan senjata yang lebih baik dari Lady Persona. Yang terkhir adalah Assassin Persona yang memiliki noriety yang selalu tinggi (dan mewajibkan kita menghindari pasukan) dengan pergerakan dan senjata terbaik selayaknya seorang assassin.\nAveline dapat menggunakan senjata unik yang tidak dipakai sebelumnya, seperti pecut untuk menarik musuh dan menghabisinya sekaligus bisa dipakai untuk mengayun di dahan pohon ala Tarzan. Selain itu Lady Persona Aveline dipersenjatai dengan payung yang dapat dipakai untuk menembakkan poison darts secara tersembunyi.\n\nGrafis (7/10)\nBila dibanding dengan game terbaru Ubisoft yang lain, ACL mungkin memiliki tingkat grafis yang pas2an tapi mengingat ini adalah port dari PSVita yg notabene adalah handheld game, grafis yang ditawarkan tergolong baik apalagi melihat ukurannya yang cuma 3,2 GB.\nUbisoft membuat ACL HD dengan menambahkan graphic setting dan kualitas yang kalau saya bilang di antara AC Brothehood dengan AC III, ini membuktikan kalo Ubisoft tidak setengah2 dalam mengerjakan versi HD ini.","March 21, 2015","true","9.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

A much welcomed surprise, Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD (also referred to as Assassin's Creed III: Liberation) is a game that feels and controls like any other triple A title. It introduces a new and unique character that is easily more lovable than the original protagonist from the third game. In terms of gameplay, the game roughly revolves around the same mechanics found in the universe, but offers a new twist in the form of changeable personas. The main lead in the game, Aveline de Grandpré, can alter her attire fulfilling the roles of an Assassin, Lady or Slave - each providing their own incentives. Assassin’s Creed: Liberation HD shouldn't be passed up by gamers especially by those who know and love the franchise. The game's price point does draw attention since it is less than regular releases, but it's certainly not something disproportionate.

The PS Vita version got some pretty mixed reviews, so I was skeptical. Ultimately, Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD won me over. It's pretty short compared to the main Assassin's Creed games, but for only $20 it's ultimately a solid deal. The game plays mostly like Assassin's Creed 3, with the exception of the cool, new kill chain feature, which allows you to quickly target up to 3 enemies at once and kill them all in quick succession. It's fun. There's also a new take on the notoriety system called personas. Aveline, the game's protagonist, may change between 3 outfits that change how guards treat her. The standard Assassin getup allows for full mobility and equipment usage, but you always have your notoriety meter at least a quarter filled. Her slave disguise also allows free-running, but she's restricted to blow darts, her hidden blade, and a machete. She can sneak right into restricted areas as long as she looks like she's working, but socially unacceptable actions carry a much higher noteriety penalty than usual. Aveline's Lady persona, aside from making her look pretty attractive, makes her nearly impossible to discover in restricted areas, but the dress she is wearing prevents her from climbing at all, and allows her to move on foot at a jog at the fastest. She is also limited to just her hidden blade and a parasol gun. It was an interesting new idea that was mostly successful, but could have used a bit more freedom and variety in practice.\n\nOn the story side of things, the game is pretty irrelevant. I couldn't help but often question why Aveline was going through any of the scenarios I was playing. There's no sense of urgency to the game that drives the plot forward, unlike the main series. Visually, the game is pretty impressive. Again it's roughly on the same level as Assassin's Creed 3 in that regard. The game world itself is a decent size. Over the course of the game, you visit New Orleans, the Lousiana bayou, and Chichén Itzá: a templar controlled colony in Mexico. New Orelans is similar in size to AC3's Boston, while being a fair bit more colorful and varied. The Bayou is dwarfed by the Frontier, but it's still farily expansive and takes some time to fully explore. Overall, If you're looking for a little bit more Assassin's Creed to tide you over while you wait for Unity, Liberation is a worthwhile buy.","June 10, 2014","true","12.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As for the story, just wish it was *alittle* bit deeper like who's the descendant for Aveline it can't be Desmond, right? Assassin’s Creed® Liberation HD also brought up a new gameplay mechanic call persona, some sort of disguist. And it's also something new to see, a female protagonist in the Assassin's Creed franchise. I hope to see more of female protagonist for the future Assassin's Creed games.

As soon as the first civilian is rendered he immediately walks into a giant wooden pole right in front of him, stumbling back slightly and then tries to figure out how to walk around it. I'd say this sets the stage for the rest of the game pretty well.\n\nWhile not as pointless and forgettable as Brotherhood's campaign, I'm glad I skipped the Vita version because even with the improvements it's still a glitchy, boring game. I've fallen into bottomless pits and just landed on my feet to walk around down there, I've had missions break thanks to AI groups that were supposed to stay together who then split up because they got caught on each other and couldn't walk forward, I've had the battle icons just vanish entirely making counterattacks and such literally impossible, there's typos in the text, and so on. It's nowhere near the mess that ACIII was at launch but even overhauled it's still pretty janky. The three guises that can be donned are probably the most interesting part, although they feel almost completely ignored as a gameplay element for most of the missions.\n\nThe compatively small areas for the series are also a drawback, and combined with the same lackluster low vertical height for climbing that ACIII had ends up with the game feeling more like a rushed cash-in instead of a major entry. The interesting additions and okay campaign put it somewhere in the middle-to-low range of this series, better than the original to actually play but well below ACII and Revelations. However, just like Brotherhood, it adds nothing to the series as a whole and can be completely ignored until one has finished all the other main titles, and even then only if they're still hunting for more.","June 25, 2014","false","11.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

I knew it wouldn't be quite as good as "actual" AC titles, but I never expected it to be THAT bland. First of all, the story is a disjointed mess. It just doesn't flow well enough like the others, nor does it really capture your attention. The voice acting sounds uninterested half the time, too.\n\nLiberation can't decide on where it wants to take place. You're constantly switching back and forth between New Orleans, the Bayou, and other locations best kept secret for plot purposes. It's mainly the first two, though. There's barely anything interesting about them, with little ambient noise happening, making each place feel emptier.\n\nThis game's gimmick seems to be the "persona changes." With three personas to pick (Assassin, Slave, Lady), each has their own look and gameplay style. The game cannot decide on this, either. You're switching between these way too much, as it's mandatory. Assassin is what you'd expect. Slave doesn't carry weapons, and can blend-in with real slaves. Lady can barely run, cannot climb anything, and also has no weapons. Each persona less fun than the last. You'll be jumping for joy when the game lets you use the Assassin persona every single time.\n\nI will give credit to the visuals .They did a great job porting this over from a handheld device. Obviously, it won't look as good as something like Black Flag, but the graphics still hold their own. So, they actually did something right in that regard.\n\nWhile there are a few actual cool parts in the game, they are not enough to justify the current price of $20. Even AC3 is a better title, and that used to be my 2nd least favorite AC. If you're still curious enough, I'd wait for a sale.

Smooth and clean without mucking up performance. The gameplay is very tightly constructed, which means that the storyline is quite linear with a few scattered side activities. While this does give it less of a sandboxy time-waster feel, it's important to remember that the original release of this game wasn't designed for the fully-fledged Assassin's Creed experience, and what is important is that it manages to be a stellar release nonetheless. The controls are a step backward from AC4, though, and as you'll play you'll feel the clunky weapon selector and naval trading interfaces weighing you down like a ball and chain. I know, I know, it was developed on the AC3 template, but how much effort does it really take to update the layout instead of chucking all the work that occured based on fan feedback out the window? Overall, though, this game is a great experience.

The story is set between 1765 and 1777, and it primarily features series' first female protagonist, Aveline de Grandpré, an African-French Assassin around the end of the French and Indian War, in 18th century New Orleans. The game takes place in Louisiana around the end of the French and Indian War, where France's defeat caused the city of New Orleans to be taken over by the Spanish government.This vial plot was later uncovered by the Assassin Aveline de Grandpré, who infiltrated the governor's mansion and assassinated him. In 1766, the Templar Antonio de Ulloa arrived in New Orleans, to serve as the Spanish governor. However, he left the control of the area to some French officials and allowed the French flag to remain over the city. Two years afterwards, he made strict trade restrictions and set up a covert slave-trading operation to transport some slaves to a Templar worksite in Mexico, creating big rebellions among French officials and most of the citizens of New Orleans. Assassin's Creed Liberation uses the same engine that runs Assassin's Creed III, allowing for the same gameplay experience as a console release. Aveline also has her own new set of animations as well as you having the ability to dual-wield weapons, such as the new blowpipe as well as lots of familiar swords, knives, pistols and a hidden blade. Overall I will give Assassin's Creed Liberation a solid 10/10 it is just fantastic they have really improved it so much that it feels like a completely new game rather than just a port of the PlayStation Vita version. So I really really recommend you go get this game because I am just absolutely 100% sure that Assassin's Creed Liberation will definitely without even the tiniest doubt blow you away!.","December 1, 2014","true","7.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The story is absolute bare minimal, and the characters are all two dimmensional and it's hard to give a damn about any of them. The gameplay is alright, your basic Assassin's Creed gameplay, nothing special, but nothing bad either. Also, the game runs like absolute garbage. I am currently using a 660ti, and I'm getting ridiculous amounts of frame drops. It's usually fine, but if there's more than five people or ten buildings on screen at one time, the frame rate dips below 40. And it isn't the power of my graphics card, either. It ran Assassin's Creed 4 far, far better than it runs Liberation, and AC4 is a much more graphic intensive game.\n\nIf you are a die hard Assassin's Creed fan and need to play every installment, you'll probably get some enjoyment out of this, but it's nothing special. Otherwise, I do recommend staying away. It's not a bad game, it's just underwhelming as all else and really isn't worth the time or effort to play.","June 21, 2014","false","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This absolutely does. It runs 100x smoother, has more longevity, and above all, feels more realistic.\nI've thought time and time again that Ezio (and the other assassins) stick out like sore thumbs in their robes, and finally, it got addressed. Aveline can dress as a Lady, to blend with the elite crowd and charm/bribe guards into letting her in restricted areas. She can dress as a Slave, to blend with other workers and get in to places only slaves would be allowed, as well as being able to free run and climb in this persona. And thirdly, we can dress as an Assassin, but the attire looks more pirate/sailer in my opinion. The only downside is that in Assassin persona, you're always slightly notorious.\n\nAnother issue I've had with previous AC's is that you can't climb trees...the one thing even most regular people could climb. Aveline not only climbs trees, but can take advantage of hanging vines to swing from tree to tree. You also get a whip some 1/4 way in to swing from things with, and to catch and drag back enemies that might be running from you.\n\nThere are plenty of side missions, a large amount specific to each persona, which means you can switch as you please to do missions you're in the mood for. You make money in Liberation by using the ship trading system, which is pretty fun and easy to use.\n\nMy only qualm with this game is that it uses the newer fighting system, and I find it a bit player unfriendly.","June 5, 2014","true","108.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've only been able to play about an hour of the game.\n\nFrom my limited perspective, the game appears to work as any Assassin's Creed game should. Avoid detection, blend into the crowd, etc etc. The concept of switching clothing seems awesome at first, but I've all ready found pretty early in the game that this doesn't seem executed well.\n\nThe limitations of, say, the Slave Girl versus The Asassin make sense story wise, but makes for awkward play. I believe a different reviewer pointed out s/he would just wear whatever Aveline happened to be wearing at the time to get the job done. It's this disjointed execution of limitations that give rise to a more complicated combat system, but not really depth. If one were to pick at this thread a little more, it would seem odd how an assassin would lose access to tools simply because the clothing was different. Assassins are assassins regardless of their garb. I think this observation is part of the blocky combat issue noted by other reviewers. In other words, Slave Girl should be as effective as The Assassin and vice versus, but this is not the case.\n\nIt's still early for me in the game, and so for now, I will recommend the game because I'm enjoying it. If the game somehow completely breaks for me, I will note it here and change my recommendation if I feel its warranted.","May 13, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'll preface by saying I'm a big AC fan.  I have played all the other games and enjoyed every one of them except 3 (it was pretty meh).  Overall I would say Liberation is priced at the right point for the amount of content.  It took me about 10 hours to finish the game doing about half the side quests and completing the alternate ending.  Since this game comes up regularly on sale at $10 that is a good bargain in my book.  The combat and parkour handle a lot like AC3 and many of the available weapons are similar, with a couple new additions.  The addition of multiple personas for Aveline that have different noterieties and different abilities makes planning your approach to missions pretty interesting.  I would say the story is decent, it is pretty concise, but some parts are a bit difficult to follow.  The revamped visuals make the game look way better than anything the 360/PS3 can do so that was a welcome surprise, and the game runs pretty well.\n\nOverall I would rate it 7.5/10.

I wouldnt say its any worse than AC2\n\nI REALLY enjoy the combat in this title. the way you can chain attacks together, the enemy reactions and the varied sync kills you can achieve are very nicely put to gether. Aveline's combat style is far better than Ezio ever was, I dont know how else to describe it other than it feels far more... Viceral... not in the extent that Revelations was but more... efficient, flowing.\n\nits a nice change of pace to the other AC titles in my opinion and I am enjoying it far more than Revelations.\n\n","February 10, 2014","true","14.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For one, the feel of the game was much more like ACIII than its newer compatriote ACIV, though this might have been intentional. In fact the style of ranged weapons worked more like the ACII system, while other combat systems and graphics looked like ACIII. The worst thing, I would say is the dialogue, the voice actors pretty much feel flat to me.\n\nOther than those few minor discrepencies, I actually like Liberation. It might be takin better as a move from revelations to ACIII, instead of a game after ACIV. I did really like the changing costumes part of gameplay and it seemed to add a little more realism, just a little, to the wanted level.\n","March 18, 2014","true","20.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This absolutely does. It runs 100x smoother, has more longevity, and above all, feels more realistic.\nI've thought time and time again that Ezio (and the other assassins) stick out like sore thumbs in their robes, and finally, it got addressed. Aveline can dress as a Lady, to blend with the elite crowd and charm/bribe guards into letting her in restricted areas. She can dress as a Slave, to blend with other workers and get in to places only slaves would be allowed, as well as being able to free run and climb in this persona. And thirdly, we can dress as an Assassin, but the attire looks more pirate/sailer in my opinion. The only downside is that in Assassin persona, you're always slightly notorious.\n\nAnother issue I've had with previous AC's is that you can't climb trees...the one thing even most regular people could climb. Aveline not only climbs trees, but can take advantage of hanging vines to swing from tree to tree. You also get a whip some 1/4 way in to swing from things with, and to catch and drag back enemies that might be running from you.\n\nThere are plenty of side missions, a large amount specific to each persona, which means you can switch as you please to do missions you're in the mood for. You make money in Liberation by using the ship trading system, which is pretty fun and easy to use.\n\nMy only qualm with this game is that it uses the newer fighting system, and I find it a bit player unfriendly.","June 5, 2014","true","108.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'll preface by saying I'm a big AC fan.  I have played all the other games and enjoyed every one of them except 3 (it was pretty meh).  Overall I would say Liberation is priced at the right point for the amount of content.  It took me about 10 hours to finish the game doing about half the side quests and completing the alternate ending.  Since this game comes up regularly on sale at $10 that is a good bargain in my book.  The combat and parkour handle a lot like AC3 and many of the available weapons are similar, with a couple new additions.  The addition of multiple personas for Aveline that have different noterieties and different abilities makes planning your approach to missions pretty interesting.  I would say the story is decent, it is pretty concise, but some parts are a bit difficult to follow.  The revamped visuals make the game look way better than anything the 360/PS3 can do so that was a welcome surprise, and the game runs pretty well.\n\nOverall I would rate it 7.5/10.  Worth playing if you like the series and it is concise enough that even if haven't played the other games your should still enjoy it.","June 27, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story is absolute bare minimal, and the characters are all two dimmensional and it's hard to give a damn about any of them. The gameplay is alright, your basic Assassin's Creed gameplay, nothing special, but nothing bad either. Also, the game runs like absolute garbage. I am currently using a 660ti, and I'm getting ridiculous amounts of frame drops. It's usually fine, but if there's more than five people or ten buildings on screen at one time, the frame rate dips below 40. And it isn't the power of my graphics card, either. It ran Assassin's Creed 4 far, far better than it runs Liberation, and AC4 is a much more graphic intensive game.\n\nIf you are a die hard Assassin's Creed fan and need to play every installment, you'll probably get some enjoyment out of this, but it's nothing special. Otherwise, I do recommend staying away. It's not a bad game, it's just underwhelming as all else and really isn't worth the time or effort to play.","June 21, 2014","false","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I liked playing a game that actually had a female lead and made for it instead of a choice of male or female as the dialog in the plot and in the streets in the game seems better than in others thus if you are looking for that plot element to be there it is. With the plot there are 2 endings a " false ending " and a " true ending " but no matter what you do you get the same plot up to that point. The ending that you will get will come after the first thing of credits also so i suggest skipping through that one to get to the ending.\nBugs / Gliches: ..... most of the bugs are in the way of annoying things with the 2 keyboard + mouse button combos maybe it is just my hard ware but it did not seem to deal well with that. You also have a few dealing with the time senstive "constaints" running out between 4 and 7 seconds before hand and you will be amazed at how much you can do in 4 to 7 seconds for those missions. The last one that i noticed anyways was with cut scenes dissolving in certain characters mid way through what i think is when they should have been on screen also the same with some of the land in the swamp all of it seems to happen in the swamp though no where else in the game.\nPersonal enjoyment of the game for me now. Well it was worth the 4.99 USD that i paid for it and the HD -Bonus Pack on sell but if it is worth the standard price .... i will say no as it has no replayablity in my mind but yours might be differnet for what you like. I enjoyed it just i will not play it anymore as i already beat it and the plot isnt that game to want to play through again is all.\n","June 6, 2015","true","17.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And what makes the game much shorter.\n\nOn the downside I had many crashes, one time even a bluescreen, which ocurred at no other game before.","March 25","true","7.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was waiting because as a fan of the series I like to have this one under my belt. To compare it to a full price release would not be a fair. It's about a good 7-9 hour side story during Assassin Creed 3's timeline/era. For what it has to offer it does it well. As like all other Assassin Creeds it sets out to tell you a great story and it accomplishes that, gameplay and mechanics stay true.\n\nI can only really recommend this to die hard assassin creed fans, looking for a fix between mainstream releases. It's brings a couple new ideas to the table, but nothing absolutely amazing. The story like always is great, but as a change of pace it features a female lead.

The bugs ruin it at the worst possible moments. The Graphics are great but it runs like crap (compared to AC3 or Black Flag for example), the voice overs and the sound effects are also fantastic... music is very mediocre though...\n\nBUT THE DAMN BUGS!!! Most of the time it's not so bad, it's ok dealing with the AI most of the time... but wow, this one mission? "The Secret of the Cenote"?? It makes me want to uninstall this game. Fighting De Ferrer and trying to get the "Take no damage" constraint wouldn't be so bad... IF THE AI WASN'T SO MESSED UP! Half the time I try to do it? The AI bugs out and goes into "chase" mode where they disengage from combat.. and all 5 of them rush to a signle point on the combat zone and then start shooting or throwing rocks at me... and if I try to fight them? One of them attacks without the option to block and I take damage. Great. Restart... Next? There's the tougher guard and De Ferrier... Both can't be killed with counter-attacks. You can disarm the one guard on counter attack and follow up with normal attacks until he dies.. but De Ferrier will attack usually half ways through it and YOU CAN'T COUNTER-ANYTHING TO HIM OR HE PUNCHES YOU AND YOU FAIL THE TAKE NO DAMAGE!!  Needless to say? after about an hour of some of the most furstrating experiences of mine in recent times since Quake 4 multiplayer online? I gave up and skipped the Full Sync.\n\nSame mission, now I'm jumping along and it shows the "W + SPACEBAR + Right-Click" so I do that... she jumps to her death! WTF!? The prompts right on the damn screen!!!\n\nSkip this game. If it goes on sale? Be warned...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MedinaGaming/recommended/260210/","MedinaGaming","The Flying Cromwell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MedinaGaming/","126 products in account","I gave this game a Thumbs Down rating overall because I cannot recommend it to anyone but diehard Assassin's Creed fans. If you have not played and enjoyed every game in the series then this game is not worth it to you, because there are several much better Assassin's Creed games avaliable to play and buy than this one. On to the review.\n\nPros:\n+The concept of playing an Abstergo made version of history that has been censored is interesting\n+Very polished and free of bugs\n+good preformance\n+persona system is a good concept as well as unique\n+DLC Connor mission\n+Nice Music\n\nCons:\n-Story is very lackluster and doesn't contribute much to the series\n-Aveline as a character is very one note and boring.\n-The graphics (although better than the Vita) are still very lackluster. Textures in particular are muddy and undetailed.\n-Mission design is standard and offers nothing new or unique\n-Complete lack of a modern day\n-Terrible voice acting\n-Persona system although unique is not implemented very well.\n-New Orleans lacks charm and atmosphere and is not fun to explore\n-No incentive to do any of the side missions or care about anything in the story besides completing the game\n-No multiplayer of any sort\n\nOther Notes:\n-Please remember that this is a port of a Vita game and because of that it's not going to be as good as a main series AC game.\n-I recommend it with caution to diehard fans because it is interesting to see the Abstergo altered side of things and the backbone of the story is at least interesting a;though terribly executed.\n\nConclusion: If you either want to complete your AC collection or are looking for a way play more AC, get this game. If not, avoid it. It's not a bad game, but it's also not very good. It's average. The reason it has a negative rating is because there are simply MANY more games out there that are far better than Liberation, even in the AC series (1,2,Brotherhood,Revelations,3,4,Rogue,Unity). Play those if you're an AC newbie or just lokking for a good action-adventure game.\n\nOverall Score: 6/10\n\n","December 30, 2014","false","11.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Though there are some problems that are to be expected in a game ported from a portable console. Lip-sync issues, multiple time the character clips through the environment, and occasionally the game locks up when entering the pause menu. It's is still well worth the price and you will certainly get hours of enjoyment out of it. The game's take on a female protagonist is very good, not overly focusing on her gender (for the most part she could be a male), however not ignoring it either, she uses her feminine charm in a way only a female could.\n\nOverall, 7/10.

Obviously the keyboard-mouse doesn't get the same love in a console port.  Also, despite far exceeding every requirement, anti-aliasing comletely crashes my framerate.  There is so much good about this game, but QA wasn't the top priority. One of your "personas" cannot parkour, yet she is capable of falling into the water but not able to climb out---must be lead weights in her dress.  At one point I was mugged while dressed as the "Lady," and as I was blocking the town guard comes running up and starts bayonneting ME, leading to an enormous WTF moment.  And finally, in a game that really revolves finding all the little guffins and bawbles, there is no Quick Travel within the maps.  Add in that each of the 3 personas highlight a different set of doodads, and it means you will be running.  A lot.  I officially give up on 100% synch.

Even though it is a ported game.\nDisguises are really what makes the game more stylish, diverse and stealthy. Having played Hitman for the first time just recently, I realised how much a disguise can mean. And here, to be able to change is what the game really needs. Each disguise has different tailor variant, different weapons (sometimes not ownable by other personas), different blending, different notoriety. It’s a pity that by now this was only implemented in this game.\nFixed convoys and trade system. Now it calls for investments and regular check ups.\nUnderwater missions are really good and if you play the games chronologically, this will come before marvelous diving missions from AC4BF (technically, here they tested it out, the same they did woth Aquila in AC3).Of course, since the game was small, the city is smaller, the ‘Frontier’ (here – Bayou) is smaller, the gameplay time is less, but it good since you don’t grow tired of it.\n\nOne of the most correct games in all the franchise, totally recommend it.","October 6, 2015","true","41.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even though this game is brought to us via a PlayStation Vita port it is a smooth playing game with beautiful graphics (Thumbs up RECOMMENDED!!)\n\nThis game is GREAT, but its is a game that is maybe done a little bit TOO well in some areas which is why it is getting some poor reviews I think... Let me explain.\n\nIn my honest opinion I think this game reaches out to the female audience a lil' more than any other Assassin's Creed title has ever done before.  As men we don't really care about changing clothes to suit the situation, or to achieve a desired outcome, or effect, we pretty much do whatever we need to do in whatever we have on at the time whether it be church or getting our oil changed.  So the costume changing system is lost on alot of the younger guys, but if you were to ask a woman about that game concept you would get a whole different answer and that concept of game play would be imperative and VERY necessesary to her.\n\nAs men we muscle our way through most situations with brute force, and mayhem in games and in life... but women tend to strategize more, and use image and looks to make up for not being able to run rough-shod through a situation... If you approach the game from that angle of thought everything "Assassin’s Creed® Liberation HD" was designed to be makes perfect sense.\n\nI had not one single issue with the game, Im a fan and as I said before I highly recommend it.\n\n-MoonKnight-","January 3","true","20.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even though it is a ported game.\nDisguises are really what makes the game more stylish, diverse and stealthy. Having played Hitman for the first time just recently, I realised how much a disguise can mean. And here, to be able to change is what the game really needs. Each disguise has different tailor variant, different weapons (sometimes not ownable by other personas), different blending, different notoriety. It’s a pity that by now this was only implemented in this game.\nFixed convoys and trade system. Now it calls for investments and regular check ups.\nUnderwater missions are really good and if you play the games chronologically, this will come before marvelous diving missions from AC4BF (technically, here they tested it out, the same they did woth Aquila in AC3).Of course, since the game was small, the city is smaller, the ‘Frontier’ (here – Bayou) is smaller, the gameplay time is less, but it good since you don’t grow tired of it.\n\nOne of the most correct games in all the franchise, totally recommend it.","October 6, 2015","true","41.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game works very well with the controller, plays just fine with the keyboard and mouse, and the graphics are actually HD! Be warned though: Some people have reported having trouble with the anti aliasing, myself included (though my issue was minor); others claim to have performance issues.\n\nThe thing that separates Liberation HD from the other Assassin's Creed PC games, gameplay wise, is the persona mechanic. You are able to switch between disguises: Assassin, noble and slave. You have different properties/abilities and wanted levels while wearing each of those different disguises, which gives us a nice break from the usual gameplay (from AC 1 - 2.3) that was becoming stale.\n\nFinal verdict: Worth it!","January 16, 2014","true","7.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/persianshawn/recommended/260210/","persianshawn","Shawn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/persianshawn/","330 products in account","As an avid Assassin's Creed fan I purchased the game right off the bat, having deliberatly avoided all form av spoilers of AC:Liberation. Granted, I had no objective mindset regarding the game. This proved too be both a positive, as well as a negative experience, as I shall explain below.\n\nFirst off, for those of us having played AC3 and the more recent AC4 the intro of Liberations lands between the two, quality wise. It's not dragged out like 3, but it's not so much of an intro in the sense of giving the player a sense of going forward. With that said, it could've been pulled off better had they chosen to have an intro where we as the players are more curious as of giving that "what-happens-next"-feeling, which was the case of the excellent intro of Black Flag.\n\nAs we progress through the game, we are introduced to several new game modes, unique to Liberations: the three different types of "clothes" Aveline can wear, each "unique" in their own way. Without going into too much details, this idea was a good one, but I happened to find it somewhat tedious and not that much of "change", gameplay wise. It felt more like disguising in the different clothes for the sake of appearance. Once again, I want to emphasize, the idea is GOOD, but fails to deliver gameplay-wise, making it almost irrelevant and only important for those missions where you've to change in order to progress in the story.\n\nAnd now for perhaps the most characteristic feature of Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD: the HD part. Yes, the game is "only" a port, and a GOOD one at that, which Ubisoft cleverly mentioned in several of their ads throughout the release of the game, which could've turned out ugly if they tried to "fool" us gamers. Nevertheless, the graphics has its own share of graphical problem. It's worth to mention that I ran this game on the highest settings possible with a GTX 770, still there were notable stutter, the occasional water turning into extacy-rainbow-colored water instead, important side-characters making faces like they're having a diarrhea and the constant failure of the game to render thing from a long distance. Furthermore the voice acting has to be one THE WORST I've ever witnessed in gaming, let alone how bad the combination is with several of the charachters, "speaking" but with their mouthes barely open. It's really sad, but the few moments the game shines is the alliance with the french smugglers, and Avelines colonial Brother Connor in the side-mission.\n\nSo APART from all of this, what good comes out of this games? Well, for one, it has definitely a more cohesive story than AC3 managed to achieve, the story of Aveline is intriguing and interesting, the FEW moments the "HD" part really lives up to the name doesn't pop up until later segments of the game (no spoilers!). I feel like Liberations as a game per say, is NOT a good game at all (read above), as an overall AC-experience is not a bad one, but not a solid one either, making it only "OK". The game is recommended for all of those Die-Hard AC-fans, itching to know more of the Assassin's Creed Universe.\n\nI'll give this game a solid 2 out of 5!","January 22, 2014","false","9.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/willowsdale/recommended/260210/","willowsdale","Willow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/willowsdale/","7 products in account","This has to be my favorite Assassin's Creed game so far. Aveline is the most interesting and likable protagonist in the series so far. There aren't many strong female protagonists in video games but Aveline stand amongst the best including the new Lara Croft( Tomb Raider 2013), Heather Mason( Silent Hill 3) and Ellie( The Last of Us).\n\nThe three persona system works well and improves as the game goes on. The parasol dart gun is a really nice touch; nothing quite as satisfying as dressing as a lady and assassinate your targets with your cute little umbrella( giving that Hitman vibe to it) There's also quite a number of puzzles and mini games littered throughout the main storyline and side quests. They range from fairly challenging to downright annoying( I'm looking at you, fragile canoe with health bar!) The updated textures looks really amazing up-close and the color feels richer than the Vita version making New Orleans look beautiful and lively. On the negative side, the water animation is so flat that it breaks the immersion a little. More sound effects could have been great during cutscenes. Controls are quite fluid and on par with the recent Black Flag.\n\nAt this time of writing the review, my pre-order bonus is having some issues( happens to quite a number of people especially those who bought from Steam) and not showing up even after registering them in Uplay so i don't recommend anyone getting the Voodoo Pack DLC until the issue is fixed. The vanilla game itself will provide many hours of entertainment for fans of the series and newcomers alike. For the low price it's offering now, you're getting a fairly large game with many hours of content. One could almost forget this is a Vita port.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/disassembler/recommended/260210/","disassembler","Disassembler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/disassembler/","464 products in account","Probably the most boring part of the series, featuring New Orleans as enlarged village with nothing interesting to do in it. Shallow dialogues full of annoying pauses in speech (er... um... eh... how-do-you-say...), narrated in frenglish are definitely not helping the story.\n\nThe missions themselves do not make sense sometimes. Eg. mission objective 1 - Infiltrate the base and find someone. Do not get detected. Mission objective 2 - OK, now that you've found the guy, kill him using the freaking powder keg explosion. Why exactly did I have to be stealthy before?\n\nThe added actions and game mechanics not present in other ACs are a bit weird as well, and nicely complement the overall twisted thinking and sloppiness of the game producers. Here I’m referring mainly to beating down a fevered people in order to administer an antidote, murdering civilians to get extended cutscenes, and the ridiculous tank-like handling of canoes.\n\nOnly part of game mechanic which is kind of interesting is the concept of personas – various outfits enabling different gameplay style and exploiting different opportunities. Unfortunately there are not enough moments in the game which would actually require thinking about which one would be best for the job, so you can finish the game using just one of them. To add insult to injury, the game from time to time forces you to use different persona as a mission objective or even directly changes you to one without any warning, just to fit the upcoming mission or cutscene. A good idea, but rather poorly executed.\n\nDo not buy unless you’re a die-hard fan of the AC series, in which case I also advise buying a pillow which you can bite down on, to help you overcome the awkwardness of the jokes an clichés present throughout the game.","February 28","false","9.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Aside from the cutscenes and soundwork, it's difficult to tell that this was originally a handheld game; the gameplay is nearly identical to Assassin's Creed III and IV, though the mission structure seems like it was instead pulled from the Assassin's Creed II trilogy. The story is okay, though it would be much, much better if it weren't so fragmented, as it feels like there are a lot of cutscenes missing in-between memory sequences. If you enjoyed previous games in the series, then you'll most likely enjoy this one.","January 16, 2014","true","14.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Nothing special here.\n\nThe setting and the protagonist are different, but not different/original enough. The Lousiana bayou was definitely an interesting setting but other settings such as New Orleans felt somewhat like Boston from ACIII. Aveline has character- but not enough. The Templar baddies are rather generic. There are a few interesting mechanics such as the three personas (assassin, lady, and slave) and a very confusing chain kill mechanic but none of them were well implimented. This game just felt like a filler and was rather boring. I couldn't even finish this one.\n\nSave your money and give Assassin's Creed Liberation a pass.","October 4, 2014","false","2.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It has also got the usual combat system and countering is as overpowered as ever although this is an issue with many games and would be pretty hard to balance out. The graphics aren't exactly ground-breaking but considering the fact this is also on the older consoles this should be no real suprise. This is still a spin-off game. I can say however that it bridges the gap between the old and newer assassins creed games. One thing that took me suprise was that the games install is less than 4GB which considering the content is rther suprising even though New Orleans is realitivly small when compared to the other cities found within the franchise but thats most likely due to the constraints the Vita version had.Also the loading screens are nice.\n\n8.75/10","January 17, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darklaystill/recommended/260210/","darklaystill","mr. brightside","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darklaystill/","179 products in account","I recommend this because it does offer some new features, something the AC franchise has done quite well. However, while Aveline is a very unique character, I feel Ubisoft squandered their first female assassin with this half-done game. It just doesn't feel like they put as much effort into this as they did the others. The story is okay, but it's not very engaging. I also notice some of the animations are poor compared to the previous games. For example, when Avenline slows down from sprinting to walking, there doesn't appear to be an animation that shows her actually slowing down like Edward or Connor. Instead, it seems as though she's just walking, but her slowing movement speed doesn't match the animation. As well, when she is sprinting and she moves left and right, the animation is just not right. Connor and Edward's animations showed their pivot foot push them in the direction they are strafing in, and the upper-body twist responding accordingly. Aveline just turns the direction she is strafing towards. It looks awkward and unrealistic compared to Ubisoft's beautiful animation work in Black Flag and AC:III.\n\nI have not beaten the game yet, but again, the story also doesn't appear to be well-invested. I do enjoy the features like the chain kill feature that I am still getting used to, and I think a female assassin like Aveline offers new gameplay options, such as Aveline's ability to change personas. That's a great feature, and I hope to see that be expanded into a male assassin in future games. I can only hope that where Liberation's shortcomings begin, make for a great experience in the next AC; I hope that perhaps we will see another female assassin (personally, I want to see Shao Jun's story in an AC title), and Liberation was more or less an introduction to it, like naval combat in AC:III to Black Flag. Liberation is a nice addition to the Assassin's Creed Franchise, but it seems like Ubisoft just got lazy in this title and put only half effort into it.","January 18, 2014","true","10.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The game throws a bunch of plot hooks all over the place, but none find purchase. Things just happen and Aveline has no real agancy, which for a large part of the game I thought would be the theme. One gets a vague sense that interesting things might be happening in-between playable segments, but nothing is resolved. The game even throws in a meta story element by framing itself as an entertainment product developed by the Assassins' enemies, Abstergo. At three or four points in the game, you are told to kill game abstractions to unlock cinematic sequences Abstergo removed from the narrative. These sequences add nothing to the plot or explain character motivations. One is inclined to ask, "Why would Abstergo cut these segments where people advocate more action against the slave trade?" In addition to these cinematics, your sparse journal entries on some of the characters you encounter are changed, but not in any surprising or meaningful ways.\n\ntl;dr - What would have saved this game for me would be if it had Shaun or some Shaun analoge to give context to this mess of a story.","January 17, 2015","false","50.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or I did, until I experienced Assassin's Creed Liberation. The game-play was even more repetitive and unimaginative than previous games (if you can believe it), and the story might as well have not even be there - it was so uninteresting and uneventful. It's the first AC game that I won't even bother finishing.\n\nWhat happened, Ubisoft? The first game was great because you got to roleplay in a very distant historical time and place, not the ♥♥♥♥ing pre-industrialized, deep South. The story of the first game was enthralling because it surrounded the mystique of the Nizari Assassins and was heavily driven by science fiction and deep conspiracy.

The same was with Liberation, which is not a 'normal' game as e.g. Black Flag, but a port of a PSP's version. However I have enjoyed the time spent with Aveline. Liberation offers the same as the other games, but everything is just smaller. There are the same pros and cons as in other AC games. It offers us canonical for series: story similar to the previous ones; impressive fights, parkour great as always. There are also three different locations, which I prefered more than the ones in ACIII. On the other hand we find here a very  stupid ending, sporadic camera problems and a few frustrating missions. Also the visual side of this game could be better - it is clearly seen, that the game was not made to work on the powerful computers.\nThe items collectors will also have fun - there are many chests to be looted and diary pages or alligator eggs to be found.\nThe game is smaller by all means. You should include the time needed to complete it - it took me 6,5 hours to complete 86% of Liberation (including the items, mini missions etc).\nI recommend this game as much as I recommend any other AC game.

The first time playing it and changing wardrobe my character came out missing all her body except her face and the game lagged and eventually I had to suth it down before it crashed. The story was a bit blant at times and finding Citizen E was a pain sometimes. The ending was nice though; the first ending not the 'real' ending that ERUDITO shows. Even though I couldn't feel the life of this version much and I rushed through it a bit (something I never usually do in the AC Franchise) I think I will rate it a 6.5-7.0 from 10.0.","July 3, 2014","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The player also has a new set of animations - exclussively introduced for the protagonist Aveline- as well as have the ability to dual-wield weapons, such as the new blowpipe as well as the familiar swords, knives, pistols and hidden blade.\nLike it's predecessors, the game set in an open world in which the player uses a combination of stealth, parkour, and combat to complete various missions.\nLike in Assassin's Creed III, freerunning been simplified to allow for more fluid parkour in the cities and wilderness, such as climbing and running on trees, cliffs, houses etc.\nPlayers no longer need to manage the lock-on mechanic from previous games.\nHuman shields can be used against firing lines of enemies. Medicine is no longer used as health recovers automatically. Stealth is also revamped, allowing players to use natural elements such as tall grass and trees to hide, along with the ability to blend between any two people.\nSince the game is a port from a Vita-game, it lacks a few of the qualities that for example games originally released for PC has.\n\nStory:\nUnlike most of the Assassin's Creed-franchise, this game does not feature the normal present day protagonist Desmond Miles, but focuses on Aveline de Grandpré, an Assassin of French and African heritage, who lived during the 18th century.\nBorn in 1747, to a wealthy French merchant and an African slave, Aveline de Grandpré is raised in a comfortable and privileged environment. At the age of 12 she is rescued from slavers who tries to kidnap her, by an Assassin called Agaté.\nAgaté recruits Aveline into the Assassin Brotherhood and thus becomes her Mentor.\nLiberation is set six years after this event, near the end of the French and Indian War, where France's defeat causes the city of New Orleans to be taken over by the Spanish government.\nThe citizens are upset over the transition from French to Spanish control and Spain's new occupation within the city. However, in 1765, the French governor Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie makes a negotiation with Templar Rafael Joaquín de Ferrer to stay as governor of New Orleans.\nThis plot is uncovered by the young Assassin Aveline, who infiltrates the governor's mansion and assassinates him.\nShe also discovers their deal to ensure d'Abaddie remains as governor, provided he smoothes the hand-over of the colony to the Templars and supply de Ferrer with workers for a secret Templar operation.\nTogether with her loyal and trusted friend Gérald Blanc, Aveline delves into a sinister Templar conspiracy and discovers a statespanning slave trafficking operation...\n\nMy opinions:\nAssassin's Creed: Liberation fulfilled most of my expectations. When I bought the game, I suspected it to be a bit buggy or unstable since it was ported from the Vita, but it functioned surprisingly well.\nThe graphics are basically what you can expect from a "HD-version" of a game previously solely released for consoles; they look good, but not AS good as other games in the series.\nThe world in the game is rather small, which I had also expected, but took a fair amount of time to explore in order to get all collectibles. Don't expect any major animation wonders, though - it's ok, but not fantastic.\nAs for the story, I am a little disappointed. Not that the HD-version of an already released game could have another story, but I felt it to be both uninteresting and rather boring. It mostly felt like the "go-here-kill-him-go-back"-kind of story. A lot of running and killing without much variation in terms of objectives.\nThe characters were, likewise, quite uninteresting and the only character I actually cared for at all was the protagonist herself.\nVoice-acting is clearly not the strongest side of this game, but it was not all bad either.\nFinally, one thing that surprised me in a positive way: the combat. The fighting mechanics in the game - as mentioned above driven by the same engine as the one in Assassin's Creed III - were a lot better than I had expected. The combat flow, counter-attacks and parrying looked better than I had expected.\n\nAlthough it has some flaws, I decided to put a thumbs up on this game.\nIt isn't the best game in the series, but it is a surprisingly good port.\nI mainly recommend it to fans of the Assassin's Creed-franchise, but it is also unusually playable for people not yet introduced to the series.\nIf I were you, I would do like I did; buy this game on a sale.\nIt is not a bad game, but it deserves a discount to be worth buying.","July 28, 2014","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So what's to say about this game, that was made as a Portable version (PlayStation Vita) and then ported towards XB360, PS3 and then PC?\n\nWell first of all, you won't miss much, in fact, at all if you don't play this game. It doesn't add much in the storyline of the AC plot and in that area alone, it was very lacking. Secondly, the gameplay mechanics, albeit being very similar to previous AC games, was very clunky and unresponsive very often. Maybe a strange transition from PS Vita to PC? What's very annoying with the clunky controls is especially on The Bayou area, where tight controls are a must, but still feels laggish (and I played this game with the XBONE Controller).\n\nAside from those gripes, the main character, Aveline de Grandpré, is an interesting character. Her abilities are, again, similar to previous AC protagonists. The only notable variation is the "persona system (lady, assassin, slave)", where you change clothes and "impersonate" one of the three roles, mainly used for secondary missions. This persona system adds a new dynamic in the game but most of the time, it is just annoying to switch roles and especially that this game has so little if not fast travel system.\n\nPROS:\n+Cool main character and I gotta admit, Aveline de Grandpré is way more interesting than AC 3 Connor! Just sad she was under developed in Liberation.\n+Decent story but it lacks depth though.\n+New Orleans area is fun to explore.\n+For a portable game ported to PC, the graphics and visuals are very decent... mostly!\n+Aveline and Connor doing a mission together... sadly, it doesn't last long.\n\nCONS:\n-Even if good looking, AC Liberation has lots of inconsistent graphical glitches, faulty draw distance (enemies popping right in front of you when running).\n-Must be the weakest soundtrack of all AC games... it is excellent for sleeping use though!\n-NPCS are very forgettable.\n-Boring missions (same old investigate here and there and tail this guy, don't be seen... ohh, you missed an objective! There, a big red cross on that pointless optional objective from that checklist! At times, these optional objectives don't even appear at a mission start. You are only reminded that they're present when you either fail the mission completely or a optional objective. Clearly, I really hated this integration in AC: Revelations and I'm quite irritated that it is still being used in further AC games... ).\n-Persona system (each has different abilities and restrictions... and the restrictions are often the cause of frustration!).\n-Not enough fast travel system.\n-The Bayou area is a real B*I*T*C*H* to navigate.\n-Gaining money in this game can be tedious for a while until the trading system opens up more ports for your ships.\n-Limited replay value. Unless you seek 100% achievements? Still, this ain't a game that you will replay someday. I had invested lots of playtime in this game (22 hours) since I did wanted to explore the most I could and wanted until I finished the main story and many side-missions) but honestly, you can finish this game under 10 hours of playtime!\n\nOVERALL:\nIf you haven't played the Vita version, well now's your chance to pick Liberation up and give it a shot. Although, do it only when the game is on sale! I'm having mixed feelings on this game and clearly, this game has a lot more CONS than PROS and it is hard to recommend such a weak game.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nFor Assassin's Creed fans only. This is clearly not the game to start the AC franchise so if you haven't played any AC games before, skip this one and do your homework and backtrack to the main AC games!\n\nBut if you're an AC fan like I am, you should definately give this game a shot\n\nRATING:\n6.0 / 10\n\nAnd now, AC 4: Black Flag... here I come!

I don't know the history, but there's a reference at the start of AC4 during the tour of Aspergo where Liberation is described as the first game in the series. I suspect this is just a very old AC game updated with higher-res graphics (thus the HD on the end), and it really really shows.  It certainly feels like pre-AC1 quality, awkward, stiffly-scripted mission segments that seem to suddenly get interrupted just as you're getting into it, horrible restrictions on movement (i.e. terrain) and none of the polish and finesse of AC 3 or 4.  And a very strange and creepy sexist vibe to much of it.  It is not a sibling to Freedom Cry at all.\n\nI've given it a good try but won't bother playing it any more.  It is not a pleasurable experience, and I find it frustrating to play.  I consider it a complete waste of my $20.  At $1.99 on GOG, I might be able to give it a thumbs up, but at $20 on Steam, it's just the AC brand cow being milked and users not being properly warned it's old content being regurgitated.\n\nI have learned to be much more careful in assuming quality in purchases now, even in the same brand.  The developer needs to recognize that this kind of release damages the branding, even if it grabs a few extra bucks.","March 1, 2014","false","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original was bland, and the port doesn't do the game any kind of justice. It uses the same engine for AC: III, which is not as fine-tuned as it's successor (AC: IV), meaning the gameplay sucks. Aveline de Grandpre was a character of massive potential, but due to the constraints of the original system the game was made for, the story fails to impress, and it's characters don't make it any better. She was also very slippery to control compared to Altair, and Ezio. The costume changing felt more like a pointless gimmick rather than a meaningful endeavor to add some sort of flavor to the story. The game also doesn't add a whole lot to the Assassin's Creed lore either, so it's really not worth checking out.","March 3, 2014","false","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The true strength of the Assassin's Creed franchise has been their ability to meld well thought out stories with a gameplay that makes it exciting, dynamic and fun. I experienced nothing of the sort in this game. The quests and segments were merely a series of banal and pointless tasks strung together by a dialog so oversimplified and cartoonish I could only assume it was designed to cater to the 4 year old demographic. There was no sense of character development or plot, the gameplay was dull at best and the implementation of the wardrobe system was a desperate, derived grab to add a new dynamic to the game which ultimately did nothing but annoy. I've sincerely tried to find something good to say about this game and I honestly can't, I've played more entertaining games made by elementary school kids on a sprite game builder.

I really like the storyline, which is the main thing for me.  It's really complex, more than just going about in a straightforward way.  However, the gameplay itself isn't the best.  I know this was originally made for a PS Vita game so the standards will have to be a lower.  I've seen a few glitches in movement, but doesn't really affect the game that much.  My biggest gripe is the controls.  I can run through roofs and treetops fine, but I don't like how the game shoots long range weapons.  I liked the way it was done in AC3 when you could just aim with Q and let go to fire.  Here, I have to click F to focus on the person, aim at the target, and do some Q tap or double tap to execute the movement.  It just about never cooperates with me the first time I want it done.  Fortunately, a lot of the times I want to use darts, the target has not discovered me so I could take my time trying to shoot them.  The other thing I didn't like is the alligator fighting combat.  There's never enough time for me to see and press the button to kill it.  I had better luck in AC3 so in that game, fighting wolves was a piece of cake.  The only way I made it through the first alligator killing mission was to spam every possible key they could ask of me, which I spent 20 minutes on.\n\nOverall, I like Liberation.  I don't know if those are actual historical people she killed, since I haven't checked yet, but the process Aveline used to find each target was very logical, not unreasonably sudden.  The business sending goods overseas was a nice touch, a break from the usual sending Assassins to secure areas from Templar influence.","August 8, 2014","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game mechanics are the same as in AC III, so if you have been there, you can jump right in here, knowing that your fingers will automatically do the right moves. It was also very refreshing to play a female assassin in these series. There is this elegance of getting rid of competition while wearing a charming dress and holding an umbrella and Liberation delivers on that quite well. The whole setup of New Orleans is very nice and the AI inhabitants do their parts in making you feel like you are in a real city. The trade system is also rather unobtrusive – a nice way to make money in the background without diverting attention from the main game. Complaints? The story; which is made a little too easy and simplistic to jump into and doesn’t really shed much light into the series, the transitions between events; which are a bit abrupt and lack this flowing feeling other installments in the series had and generally this feeling that the game should have been just a bit more “polished”; little bits and pieces here and there, whether it be the sound acting or the way you canoe moves through the water. All in all though, these things do not damage the overall enjoyment of the game. Try it.","April 29, 2015","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The true strength of the Assassin's Creed franchise has been their ability to meld well thought out stories with a gameplay that makes it exciting, dynamic and fun. I experienced nothing of the sort in this game. The quests and segments were merely a series of banal and pointless tasks strung together by a dialog so oversimplified and cartoonish I could only assume it was designed to cater to the 4 year old demographic. There was no sense of character development or plot, the gameplay was dull at best and the implementation of the wardrobe system was a desperate, derived grab to add a new dynamic to the game which ultimately did nothing but annoy. I've sincerely tried to find something good to say about this game and I honestly can't, I've played more entertaining games made by elementary school kids on a sprite game builder.

I don't know the history, but there's a reference at the start of AC4 during the tour of Aspergo where Liberation is described as the first game in the series. I suspect this is just a very old AC game updated with higher-res graphics (thus the HD on the end), and it really really shows.  It certainly feels like pre-AC1 quality, awkward, stiffly-scripted mission segments that seem to suddenly get interrupted just as you're getting into it, horrible restrictions on movement (i.e. terrain) and none of the polish and finesse of AC 3 or 4.  And a very strange and creepy sexist vibe to much of it.  It is not a sibling to Freedom Cry at all.\n\nI've given it a good try but won't bother playing it any more.  It is not a pleasurable experience, and I find it frustrating to play.  I consider it a complete waste of my $20.  At $1.99 on GOG, I might be able to give it a thumbs up, but at $20 on Steam, it's just the AC brand cow being milked and users not being properly warned it's old content being regurgitated.\n\nI have learned to be much more careful in assuming quality in purchases now, even in the same brand.

The original was bland, and the port doesn't do the game any kind of justice. It uses the same engine for AC: III, which is not as fine-tuned as it's successor (AC: IV), meaning the gameplay sucks. Aveline de Grandpre was a character of massive potential, but due to the constraints of the original system the game was made for, the story fails to impress, and it's characters don't make it any better. She was also very slippery to control compared to Altair, and Ezio. The costume changing felt more like a pointless gimmick rather than a meaningful endeavor to add some sort of flavor to the story.

I had never played an Assassin's Creed game seriously before this one - I dabbled about a bit with Assassin's Creed II, but stopped playing after I found Ezio and Desmond to be thoroughly boring and unlikeable. Since this game was supposedly not tied into all the silly meta-narrative and didn't include a single appearance of Desmond or cartoonishly-evil Abstergo employees, I figured it was as good a time as any to stop laughing at the series from afar and play one of these games myself to see what all the fuss was about. Plus, it was five bucks on sale - what have I got to lose?\n\nAs it turns out, I ended up enjoying myself. A lot. More than I thought I would, and more than I was expecting based on the reviews it's been getting. The parkour system, even though it's been used as the framework for this series since the start, is still tons of fun, and I often just fire up this game sometimes and run around just to relax myself. Every animation is incredibly fluid and seamless - with just the push of a button, Aveline can scale wooden buildings, swing around a tree trunk as she runs across its branches, use lampposts and hanging signs as stepping stones to cross a street ten feet below you...it's all so much fun to watch and it's even more fun to be the one doing it. Sure, there are times where you can't grab a ledge you can clearly reach (the Bayou in particular is a bad offender in this regard) but for the most part, the free-running is sublime.\n\nAs the first female Assassin, and thanks to both her African and French heritage, Aveline is capable of changing between different personas with nothing more than a dressing chamber, each with a different set of strengths and weaknesses. The default Assassin persona is always at least a little notorious, but it's the best suited for combat and can use any and all weapons. The Slave persona limits the weapons and health, but allows you to blend in with groups of slaves - and since this is set during the American Revolution, slaves are in no short supply. The Lady persona has a massive hat and dress that allows Aveline to be seen as a respectable member of the nobility, but the hem of the skirt makes it impossible to do any kind of free-running and makes combat incredibly difficult. Each one is used throughout the story at different times, and all feel well-balanced and rounded - it's a great example of a game telling a story through it's mechanics alone.\n\nCombat, however, is a different story. Enemies are really fickle and trigger happy, and guards will be more than willing to fire a musket as soon as you come within line of sight. And when you get a high enough notoriety, they practically send the whole force after you - and if you're in the Lady persona with just a hidden blade and no smoke bombs, you're gonna have a bad time. There are plenty of ways to approach an encounter, however - the hidden blade is the standard Assassin weapon of choice, but Aveline also has access to swords, axes, slave tools, guns, and assorted gizmos to work with in combat. Not all weapons are available for all personas, of course - you can't swing around an obsidian axe as a lowly slave, for instance - but as long as you keep on top of upgrades and stay stocked up on supplies, you'll have everything you need to get out of a situation alive. Most of the challenge in combat comes from timing your counters to do special instant-kill moves - it's a quick-timed event, but the animations look REALLY good.\n\nOverall, I'm having a lot of fun with Liberation. It's substantial enough that I can play it for fifteen minute bursts to ease some stress in between classes with free-running and trading, but still engrossing enough that I can sit down and play it for hours on end. If all Assassin's Creed games are like this one, then I can see why people are getting tired of it after a while - but as for me, it's easily becoming one of my favorite games that I played this year.","November 12, 2015","true","39.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So what's to say about this game, that was made as a Portable version (PlayStation Vita) and then ported towards XB360, PS3 and then PC?\n\nWell first of all, you won't miss much, in fact, at all if you don't play this game. It doesn't add much in the storyline of the AC plot and in that area alone, it was very lacking. Secondly, the gameplay mechanics, albeit being very similar to previous AC games, was very clunky and unresponsive very often. Maybe a strange transition from PS Vita to PC? What's very annoying with the clunky controls is especially on The Bayou area, where tight controls are a must, but still feels laggish (and I played this game with the XBONE Controller).\n\nAside from those gripes, the main character, Aveline de Grandpré, is an interesting character. Her abilities are, again, similar to previous AC protagonists. The only notable variation is the "persona system (lady, assassin, slave)", where you change clothes and "impersonate" one of the three roles, mainly used for secondary missions. This persona system adds a new dynamic in the game but most of the time, it is just annoying to switch roles and especially that this game has so little if not fast travel system.\n\nPROS:\n+Cool main character and I gotta admit, Aveline de Grandpré is way more interesting than AC 3 Connor! Just sad she was under developed in Liberation.\n+Decent story but it lacks depth though.\n+New Orleans area is fun to explore.\n+For a portable game ported to PC, the graphics and visuals are very decent... mostly!\n+Aveline and Connor doing a mission together... sadly, it doesn't last long.\n\nCONS:\n-Even if good looking, AC Liberation has lots of inconsistent graphical glitches, faulty draw distance (enemies popping right in front of you when running).\n-Must be the weakest soundtrack of all AC games... it is excellent for sleeping use though!\n-NPCS are very forgettable.\n-Boring missions (same old investigate here and there and tail this guy, don't be seen... ohh, you missed an objective! There, a big red cross on that pointless optional objective from that checklist! At times, these optional objectives don't even appear at a mission start. You are only reminded that they're present when you either fail the mission completely or a optional objective. Clearly, I really hated this integration in AC: Revelations and I'm quite irritated that it is still being used in further AC games... ).\n-Persona system (each has different abilities and restrictions... and the restrictions are often the cause of frustration!).\n-Not enough fast travel system.\n-The Bayou area is a real B*I*T*C*H* to navigate.\n-Gaining money in this game can be tedious for a while until the trading system opens up more ports for your ships.\n-Limited replay value. Unless you seek 100% achievements? Still, this ain't a game that you will replay someday. I had invested lots of playtime in this game (22 hours) since I did wanted to explore the most I could and wanted until I finished the main story and many side-missions) but honestly, you can finish this game under 10 hours of playtime!\n\nOVERALL:\nIf you haven't played the Vita version, well now's your chance to pick Liberation up and give it a shot. Although, do it only when the game is on sale! I'm having mixed feelings on this game and clearly, this game has a lot more CONS than PROS and it is hard to recommend such a weak game.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nFor Assassin's Creed fans only. This is clearly not the game to start the AC franchise so if you haven't played any AC games before, skip this one and do your homework and backtrack to the main AC games!\n\nBut if you're an AC fan like I am, you should definately give this game a shot\n\nRATING:\n6.0 / 10\n\nAnd now, AC 4: Black Flag... here I come!

The notoriety system for the slave is a little frustrating, if you bump into a box or wall while running you generate notoriety.

I really enjoyed the story. Sure it doesn't blow your mind, but I'm starting to think we're expecting too much from these games, amount of dumping on story I'm hearing across the board. They give us a new area to explore, a new slice of the story, a new perspective on a point in history, and some new mechanics every time. I don't quite know what's more to expect, but then I play for enjoyment not a road to Damascus  moment.\n\nPros I experienced:\n*First female lead I've played that felt like a real character.\n*Cool mechanic of multiple guises with seperate stregths and weaknesses.\n*Cool story from a perspective usually not depicted in media without skirting about the issue.\n*Not too short, not too long. 24hours in total if you do almost all the side quests.\n*Enjoyment\n\nCons I experienced:\n*Unplayable framerate at first, reinstall fixed this. Played near perfectly from then on.\n*Occassional dissapearance of map markers.\n*Occassional Freezes. (4 for me)\n*Not Challenging. (but is Creed ever?)\n\nThe glitches were actually better than the ones I experienced in Black Flag on my 360, and in Unity on the same PC. Woah nelly, don't get me started on Unity glitches.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kusko25/recommended/260210/","kusko25","Kusko25","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kusko25/","191 products in account","This is the best Assassin's Creed since Brotherhood.\nI stand by that statement despite the various shortcomings other reviews have already mentioned. The story sometimes feels conjointed (mainly due to timejumps) and inconsequential which doesn't bother me so much though. The game does not portray world shaking events or an artifact that can bring nations to their knees, because of that the story can focus on the work of an Assassin who still does assassiny things. Aveline is conflicted between following the creed, serving her mentor, who has largely become self absorbed and self righteous, and the Templars whose ideas are presented as tempting but extreme. Aveline is a well rounded character who is likeable, relatable and badass. The fact that she is a woman, a perfect opportunity for showcasing Ubisoft completely feministic and open mindset, is not showcased at all, which I think is the strongest argument for feminism you can make. It presents the facts without agenda.\n\nAnd lastly the reason I would have recommended this game no matter the story is the persona system. While it requires a bit of time until you fully get the hang of it (I think the tutorial didn't do a great job) it is worth it. It allows for actual infiltration and secrecy (something both Unity and Syndicate tried and failed at) As well as a certain amount of planning for your missions. There are unique equipments for every persona that you can use to upgrade their capabilities like a hidden pistol or a parasol with a dartlauncher build in.\nEquipment for the Assassin persona is fun as well, I especially like the whip both for it's capabilities and the symbolism.\nLastly worth mentioning is that future you is not working for the Assassins or the Templars you are literally just a bloke who plays a videogame but get interrupted by some ominous voice that doesn't try to convince you to do anything (or ask you to press A to join the Assassins) but simply chimes in after a cutscene and says "Yeah that's nice but just take a look at the uncut version and make up your own mind". It gives you perspective on how the perception of history changes how we view both it and the present.\nDefinitely worthy of your attention and the direction Ubisoft should have taken the franchise.\nNothing is true.

Turns out it is not very stable with many fps overlay programs. Thats ok, i can play with them off.\n\nVisuals are up to par, if not better than AC1, graphic textures look sharp in most areas, sometimes noticably tiled,  but it seems to run very smooth fully maxed out at 1080p.  The voice acting is average, a lot of times off-sync, some alright accents, music seems to mix well in most areas. Story does not relate much to the other games but without spoling much, it ties in a slight bit into AC3, I feel also in more ways than the obvious but also visiting a similar setting in the Mayan ruins, and time-frame.  The basic gameplay mechanics are the same as the previous titles, run climb jump work pretty good. Fighting and blocking is almost the same as in AC3. You get a good assortion of weapons and gadgets, and many brutal kill-scenes.\n\nPlease take into consideration this is still a port of a PSP game, even so, it still feels very much like a normal assassins creed game. It includes plenty of side missions, collectables, trade import and export, treasures, character outfits per persona, notiroity system, stealing, stealth, eagle vision, open world, various open environments, viewpoints, its almost all there.\n\nSome cut-scenes could have felt much more epic and grand with a replaced soundtracks, better lipsynch and voice acting, but hey, i got this on sale for $5. There's really not much to complain for the amount of content at that price. The dlc was worth it as well, it contains some good weapons.\n\nWas it worth the $5? Hell yeah, 10$? Yeah why not.\n\nDo i recommend it? If you are a fan of the series and have been following, yes.\n\nIt should take you a good 18 to 20 hours to complete, i idled a lot but I found the city of New Orleans to be nicely detailed and fun to explore, like many AC players, i spent a lot of time reading DNA entries and comparing them to the real life counter parts and googling alot of names, I think thats my favorite part of this series!","January 23","true","27.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The plot is interesting, but the storytelling is at times weak. Interesting and relevant parts of Aveline's life (such as why and how she became an Assassin) are not covered in any detail. Unlike earlier games in the series, I sometimes ended up killing a large number of people purely because it was the objective, without really knowing why. I didn't connect as emotionally with the story as I did in ACII and Brotherhood.\n\nThe voice acting was generally strong, but a few of the minor characters were a little overdone. The soundtrack is brilliant and well worth listening to on its own.\n\nA couple of the bosses (first swamp boss and tower) were pretty tough if you tried to kill them using conventional means, but all were entirely trivial if using a smoke bomb or a chain kill.\n\nI'd reccomend this game if you like the AC series, but not as an introduction to it.","September 5, 2015","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Liberation is a mobile port so the graphics are not quite as sharp as others, but the story and gameplay are fun. Liberation is riddled with bugs and can sometimes be hard to make it do what you are trying to do, but it's gripping enough that can't stay away for long.\n\nThe division of personalities was a brilliant, if somewhat underused concept. Sometimes you are locked into one personality, or you randomly change from wanted status. Switching to Lady mode, you can finally run around the city without fear of accidently climbing on top of a crate or lamppost.\n\nEach personality has collectables and mini missions hidden around the different zones, encouraging you to explore in all roles. But the game often prevents you from having the freedom it needs you to have. This leaves you frequently frustrated, trying to please the game rather than have assassins creed style fun.\n\nAt the end of the day, with the multiple zones, personalities, story and collectables, this was a very good addition to the series and I recommend it.

This is rather significant, since as the player character is actually the user of the Animus (or, in this case, the Animus-derived video game), this basically removes all rationale for why they should even keep playing. Why try for high synchronisation? Why finish side quests? Previously, this was justified by Desmond working through the motions to discover what he needs to know, but now it feels like I could take it or leave it.\n\nThe game itself is rather short and half-baked. The story seems quite far removed from the central themes of the series, and while there are some neat little mechanics that make it feel like more than just a filler -- the different roles Aveline can assume, and the introduction of the whole trade fleet mechanic, off the top of my head -- it definitely seems like the work of the studio B or C team.","September 8, 2015","false","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had never played an Assassin's Creed game seriously before this one - I dabbled about a bit with Assassin's Creed II, but stopped playing after I found Ezio and Desmond to be thoroughly boring and unlikeable. Since this game was supposedly not tied into all the silly meta-narrative and didn't include a single appearance of Desmond or cartoonishly-evil Abstergo employees, I figured it was as good a time as any to stop laughing at the series from afar and play one of these games myself to see what all the fuss was about. Plus, it was five bucks on sale - what have I got to lose?\n\nAs it turns out, I ended up enjoying myself. A lot. More than I thought I would, and more than I was expecting based on the reviews it's been getting. The parkour system, even though it's been used as the framework for this series since the start, is still tons of fun, and I often just fire up this game sometimes and run around just to relax myself. Every animation is incredibly fluid and seamless - with just the push of a button, Aveline can scale wooden buildings, swing around a tree trunk as she runs across its branches, use lampposts and hanging signs as stepping stones to cross a street ten feet below you...it's all so much fun to watch and it's even more fun to be the one doing it. Sure, there are times where you can't grab a ledge you can clearly reach (the Bayou in particular is a bad offender in this regard) but for the most part, the free-running is sublime.\n\nAs the first female Assassin, and thanks to both her African and French heritage, Aveline is capable of changing between different personas with nothing more than a dressing chamber, each with a different set of strengths and weaknesses. The default Assassin persona is always at least a little notorious, but it's the best suited for combat and can use any and all weapons. The Slave persona limits the weapons and health, but allows you to blend in with groups of slaves - and since this is set during the American Revolution, slaves are in no short supply. The Lady persona has a massive hat and dress that allows Aveline to be seen as a respectable member of the nobility, but the hem of the skirt makes it impossible to do any kind of free-running and makes combat incredibly difficult. Each one is used throughout the story at different times, and all feel well-balanced and rounded - it's a great example of a game telling a story through it's mechanics alone.\n\nCombat, however, is a different story. Enemies are really fickle and trigger happy, and guards will be more than willing to fire a musket as soon as you come within line of sight. And when you get a high enough notoriety, they practically send the whole force after you - and if you're in the Lady persona with just a hidden blade and no smoke bombs, you're gonna have a bad time. There are plenty of ways to approach an encounter, however - the hidden blade is the standard Assassin weapon of choice, but Aveline also has access to swords, axes, slave tools, guns, and assorted gizmos to work with in combat. Not all weapons are available for all personas, of course - you can't swing around an obsidian axe as a lowly slave, for instance - but as long as you keep on top of upgrades and stay stocked up on supplies, you'll have everything you need to get out of a situation alive. Most of the challenge in combat comes from timing your counters to do special instant-kill moves - it's a quick-timed event, but the animations look REALLY good.\n\nOverall, I'm having a lot of fun with Liberation. It's substantial enough that I can play it for fifteen minute bursts to ease some stress in between classes with free-running and trading, but still engrossing enough that I can sit down and play it for hours on end. If all Assassin's Creed games are like this one, then I can see why people are getting tired of it after a while - but as for me, it's easily becoming one of my favorite games that I played this year.","November 12, 2015","true","39.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kinda\n+ Nice graphics for a Vita port\n\nCons:\n- No longer able to pet dogs\n- Glitchy in the worse ways, such as not even appearing!\n- More trees that don't respond well to imput\n\nIf you want to play this game, by all means go ahead. Just know that it only slightly touches the main story and the lack of content is a bit troubling.\n","August 8, 2015","false","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy that or other AC games you'll likely enjoy this too. In fact I was pleasantly surprised how much it resembled the other games even though this was originally a game for handhelds. Steam doesn't mention it, but this game does have (Xbox 360) controller support. I played it with controller nearly exclusively and it works very well.\n\nIt took me 16 hours to beat this game, that includes a lot of getting full synchronizations, collecting stuff, doing all missions. I haven't finished everything yet, so I'd say this game takes about 15-20 hours if you do everything and get every achievement. Compared to the other AC games, which all took me about 30-35 hours to complete everything this is quite decent for a game originally intended for handhelds! The graphics mostly look quite good as well, most textures in particular are really good looking. Faces are still not the most visually impressive but this has always been a 'problem' with AC games. Some of the locations are just gorgeous, particularly the Bayou and the Mayan Ruins.\n\nI liked the soundtrack, though it did get slightly repetitive after spending a lot of time with this game. But I think that is a problem with a lot of games so I can't fault this game too much for it, there is enough variety between locations.\n\nI encountered only a few glitches during my running time and nothing game-breaking, the game was generally playing quite smooth on my computer.\n\nThe weakest parts of this game is the writing. The story, characters and dialogue all feel jumbled. It was hard to make sense of it and there's not a lot of depth to be found. In some ways this too is similar to the other AC games but I'd say this game is worse. The characters and voice acting are kind of bland, a lot of people had issues with Connor as the protagonist in ACIII, I never had a problem with him but I did feel like Aveline could have been more interesting. The story also doesn't add anything to the main story arc of the series, which I guess has been screwed up anyway with ACIII (haven't played Black Flag and later entries yet).\n\nConclusion\nAll in all I'd recommend this games to fans of the Assassin's Creed series. If you've never played any of those games before this will likely be a decent starting entry, the story stands on its own with perhaps a few references here and there. If you don't like the AC games this game most likely won't change your mind.\n\nCriteria        Grade/10                Visuals        7.4                Audio        7.5                Gameplay        7.5                Story & Characters        6                Technical polish        7.5                Amount of content        7.4                Overall        7.4","June 13, 2015","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
