"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nejco/recommended/301640/","Nejco","Nejc <3 SaSHA | GG Boyz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nejco/","223 products in account","Zombie Head Popin' Simulator 2015 has arrived!\n\nZombie Army Trilogy is Rebelion's third attempt to make awesome zombie game. It includes full content of Nazi Zombie Army 1 and 2.\n\nHow this game compares to Nazi Zombie Army 1 and 2?There are many good things and changes:\n+ proper gore\n+ graphics are better\n+ game runs better = better performance than NZAs\n+ more enemies\n+ more things to detonate\n+ kicing is funner, and useful\n+ many small gamplay tweaks that make game less annoying to play then NZAs\n+ less bugs\n+ 16 compared to 4 characters in NZAs\n+ way better UI (both HUD and menus)\n+ option for more than 4 players zed number scaling\n+ if you are from Germany, you can play with people who did not buy game in Germany, even though you won't see nazi symbols, but they will\n+ horde mode that adds replaybility value\n\nThen sadly there are many weird and sad changes that make me wonder WHY?!?!:\n- graphics in old campaigns, specially NZA 2 campign lost cool colors they used\n- some zombies got nerfs that are not needed like fire zombie dies from 1 shot anywhere\n- nerfs to rare weapons like bazooka and preacher seem sad and not needed too (bazooka sucks in this game against elites)\n- it's hard to explain, but it feels like zombies don't look as sharp as in first game (textures seem a bit downgraded)\n- small zombies had eye shine effect, that was really cool in both NZAs. Not here. WHY REBBELION :(\n\nCampaignGame has 3 campaigns (as mentioned before 2 are from previous games and one is new). You can play them alone or with up to 3 players. The game is Steamworks title and includes features like achievements and inviting. You can create private matches to play with friends. There is sadly no split screen although game supports Xbox 360 controller.\nLike majority of games with campaigns nowdays, this game is using checkpoint system is well. It's really bad. Checkpoints are too rare, and that really sucks, because you will have to replay a lot of parts of the game if you die.\n\nGoreIt includes new gore system that looks sick: http://gfycat.com/GiantSickDesertpupfish\nAs huge Killing Floor fan, the gore iss main reason why I bought this game. Powerful weapons will not only make their head and body parts explode, but also cut their entire body in half. X-ray camera from Sniper Elite series is back, and looks awesome.\n\nGameplayGameplay is very similar to Sniper Elite V2, 3, and both Nazi Zombies Army games. Weapons feel the same, recoil kicks feel the same, hold breath mehanic and hearthbeat mehanic work the same,  as do movement, reloading, and pretty much anything.\nIn case you haven't played any of Sniper Elite/Nazi Zombies Army games let me quickly explain gameplay. There is sprint, mantle system, no jumping. Also you can aim down with every weapon including sniper rifles. That is very good on close range when zombie is few meters away from you. Of course you can also use scope on rifles. There's no loadout system or unlocking weapons (or leveling), instead you select weapons and explosives before the match starts.\nYou can loot zombies to get ammo for anything, even explosives.\n\nHorde mode Horde mode is new addition to the Nazi Zombie Army games. It is endless, and you can play it on any difficulty and modify amount of zomibes (same for all campaign levels).  There are 5 maps designed fort his game mode.  Some maps were taken from previous Nazi Zombie Army Games or/and V2 and optimized for this mode.\n\nZombies and zombie typesThere are small zombies without weapons, with pistols, with SMGs, with melee weapons, with heavy armor. Then there special zombies and big zombies: elites (huge zombies which carry machine gun), chainsaw elites, suiciders, skeltons, armored skeltons, and more.\nOne of the reasons why I love this game so much is because there are so many types of zombies, that I cannot even remember all their names.\nDifficulty will make zombies react faster, and therfore a lot deadlier. Those who carry ranged weapons also get more accurate on higher difficulties.\n\nDifficultyGame has 3 difficulty levels:\n- cadet (no bullet drop, no wind, zombies react slow, and don't do much damage)\n- marksman (bullet drop, no wind, zombies reaction time is slighty faster, they do more damage)\n- sniper elite (bullet drop, wind, zombies reaction time is really fast, they are very powerful)\n\nYou can also modify amount of zombies in both campaign and horde mode. In previous NZA titles you could set it up to 4x setting. But because we are PC masterrace, the greatest platform ever, we have special difficulty called elite, which will change amount of zombies to insane amount.\nI must say, I'm happy with difficulty options. If you want hard game, turning up to max difficulty will make game really hard.\n\nModdingWhat I don't like about this game (and Rebellion in general) is no support for modding, no tools to design levels, or characters.\n\nCheckpointsThis is probably the worst thing in this game. There's not enough of them, and if you die (what happens a lot, specially with random new players), you'll have to replay a lot of things you already completed\n\nSoundtrackSoundtrack is just perfect. It fits well to the game, and it's done by someone who clearly knows how to make awesome music. Would be a shame to not play this game with default music.\n\nLagThis is another negative side. And if you are reading this think twice before you put your money into the game. If you don't host, it's very unlikely that you won't lag. And lag is very noticable in this game. Sadly it seems developers won't do anything to solve this problem. And no it's not me, and it's not who hosts match, because they live really close to me. Only workaround is to be selfish and host. But your friends who will play with you will still lag.\n\nAll in all, I can say that game lived up to my expectations, and I will definitely play it a lot, and will recommend it to everybody who want great zombie game with both campaign that can be played solo or with up to 3 players, as well as horde mode for solo and coop.","March 6, 2015","true","105.0"," 569 of 648 people (88%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","88","569","648","60","20"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/301640/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3204 products in account",""The hit sniper zombie trilogy you did Nazi coming."\nLadies and gentlemen, it's back, it's shinier, it's smoother, it's more graphically up to date, it's running on the V3 engine, it has EVERY EPISODE GATHERED TOGETHER for your playing pleasure, it's got Zombie Hitler, it's got so much B-Movie genius contained within it that it's going to need a book of horrible references and puns to go with it. It's the game that is the equivalent of a chilli-chutney-fried egg-bacon sandwich. It's ...\n\nSNIPER NAZI ZOMBIE ARMY TRILOGY. THE HD EDITION.\n\nZombie Hitler. It has Zombie Hitler. Shut up and take my money.\nWhere do I even begin. Do you even need me to critique this other than to say that the game makes absolutely no sense, but at the same time it's possibly the best fun you could possibly have with your pants on? The gaming media stare at this game and have no idea what to do with it. It's hilarious, they have to try and give it scores. You can't score a game that revolves entirely around putting bullets into Zombies from a great distance and grinning in glee as an X-ray shows your work up close. You can't pass moral judgment on a game that clearly has made a point of going so far into B-move territory that it might as well have terrible slogans littering its' art. It's just a waste of time.\n\nThey try to review it and fail to understand that this game isn't something you can actually review, it's not playing to the same mentality that goes and works out if Call of Duty is an 8 out of 10 or if Halo is deserving of X rating or whatever. This game is about one thing - shooting zombie nazis. It does that really, really well. It has a co-op mode which allows you to do this one thing with friends even better. Now granted, this is very much a one note game. It's very clear on what it wants you to do, and if you are not interested in doing that, well, you've come to the wrong place.\n\nGender equality in the sniping of Nazi Zombie Armies...\nThe creators have included eight characters this time around, four male, four female, all with surprisingly decent backstories that make for interesting (if brief) reading, and mean that along with the all american apple pie munching Karl Fairburne.. Fairbanks... whatever the hell his name is.\n\nYou've also got some actually interesting choices in the mix, including a British Lady who is an ex painter turned sniper, a german woman bent on revenge, a Wermacht captain, an occultist who finds out that the zombie apocalypse is something you really should believe in, two hardasses from the russian army, and so on and so on. You'll easily find two or even three choices who you could quite easily settle on for your choice of zombie butchering avatar (I've gone for the German captain, because awesome uniform and trenchcoat).\n\nIt does one thing, but it does it really, really well...\nLike in previous iterations, the game runs on a single beat, you start at Point A in a level, you head to point B, you kill everything that is not you. Everything that is not you is generally Nazi Zombies. You do this with a variety of weapons, the sniper elite engine doing away with all the silly concepts like stealth and trying to be sensible and instead focussing on squishy killcam shots as you wreck a zombie and cause brain matter to eject out of the back of its' head. Or awesome sniper trickshots as you put a bullet through the head of one zombie and INTO THE HEAD OF ANOTHER IN SLOW MOTION.\n\nSince you've got the full toybox and unlike in the normal Sniper series you're not worried about how much noise you make you've the ability to fling grenades, set mines and traps and generally turn the ground into a complete killing field, useful stuff and entirely hilarious when several soldiers get turned into juicy kibble.\n\nThe evil undead never looked this good...\nUsing the V3 engine means that the game gets all the welcome benefits of current gen graphics and there's a slew of options (although maybe not QUITE as extensively tuneable as the V2 engine) to ensure that the game runs on a wide variety of systems and specifications. It looks and runs silky smooth on a fairly standard gaming rig setup that mine represents, and the shooting feeling from V3 carries into ZAT perfectly cleanly.\n\nThe simplest of questions...\nUltimately there's one question that the whole premise of the game rests on : Do you enjoy murdering nazi zombies en masse? If yes. Get this game. If no, you can safely skip it. For me, the loyalty discount made it easily cheap enough to warrant the upgrade and it's easily proving worth every second.\n\nVerdict : Do you enjoy sniping nazi zombie armies? If so, this is an automatic purchase. If you like shooters, wishlist it. If neither, well, you're at the wrong review.","March 6, 2015","true","5.3"," 310 of 376 people (82%) found this review helpful 217 people found this review funny","82","310","376","217","14"

I already own games 1 & 2, but i decided to get this game because of the 60% discount.  At first I thought, "wow, i'm buying 1 and 2 again?"  I just want the 3rd installment..  But I'm so happy that I made the purchase.  Game 1 and 2 have truly been remastered.  You can definitely see the difference.  And of course, Rebellion added a few new goodies for my enjoyment.  I don't mind playing one of the male parts in the game, but i was really happy to see that they added 4 more characters which are indeed females.  Anya is my favorite.  The 3rd game is awesome!  With many new challenges and twists.\n\nMy favorite thing to do in this game is snipe, and this game has it all.  The slow motion x-ray kill cam that fans like myself know and love.  Headshot after headshot, this game never gets boring.  There's action from the moment you begin the game till the very end when you defeat Hitler.  (I loved that part)\n\nThe downsides:  I wish I didn't have to use Skype in order to play and communicate with my friends.  This push to talk crap has got to go..  Also, I hate the fact that there are no x-ray cams when you're playing coop.  You can only see it while playing single player.  Coop is great so long as you can find friends to play with you.  It's very challenging for just a single player.\n\nAll in all I give this game an A+.  Give it a try..  I'm sure that you will love the series too.","April 19, 2015","true","69.3"," 215 of 265 people (81%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","81","215","265","18","30"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/301640/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Criminally underlooked at the time of writing. Surprisingly atmospheric, backed with excellent and somewhat unnerving sound design, and a great John Carpenter-inspired soundtrack. Fog effects are well-handled, and the lighting can be impressive. All backed with an excellent 80s-grindhouse horror aesthetic that brings out colors and shadows almost like a Giallo horror film.\n\nThe game is enjoyably schlocky, with gore and dismemberment up the wazoo, and intensely satisfying gunplay, with snipers stealing the show with the well-done mechanics of the Sniper Elite games, but just as much satisfaction coming from the other firearms, and a variety of explosives and traps you can lay. But even with this, the game is challenging, with a large variety of enemies (ranging from your typical nazi zombie, Ray Harryhausen-esque skeletons, the ghost of nazi generals, fire-spewing demon incarnates, crazed-slasher chainsaw maniacs, and much more) that can be a challenge to take out and can manage to either overrun you or sneak up on you from behind. Zombies resurrect with satanic circles bringing them back to life until their brains are blown out or you dismember them beyond repair. The locations are vast and varied, both in layout and theme, ranging from the streets of Berlin, underground war bunkers, demonic infested forests, high-speed trains, haunting church chapel catacombs, and much more.\n\nIt's co-op is a lot of fun, allowing strategy and different play-styles to mesh well, to find the perfect sniping spot to pick off zombies and compete against friends for the highest scoring or longest shot, to go lone-wolf and carry the most kills for your team, or to come together when plans go awry and struggle to survive by the skin of your teeth. But even with the co-op focus, the game is also an excellent experience single-player, the game allowing you to scale how many enemies there are (enemies for one player to four players, or if you're insane, 'Elite' number, with spawn numbers those who thirst for stupidly large hordes and a need for a challenge), among three different difficulty levels.\n\nA lengthy meaty campaign with 15 stages (each being around an hour long), side-missions to do in the third episode, an addicting Horde Mode, all at a reasonable price tag. If you love co-op games or zombies, it'll be quite the undertaking to find something better than this. Dumb fun, but intelligent and challenging in surprising ways, it wears its inspirations on its sleeves, but through slick execution and presentation, matched with pulling it off in a way no one has quite done it before, manages to be one hell of a game.","March 8, 2015","true","31.0"," 133 of 159 people (84%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","84","133","159","11","0"

Compared to that, this requires a lot more skill aiming-wise imo - with L4D2 you can get through campaigns pretty easily without going for headshots, even on Realism Expert. Here, on the other hand, you really do need to go for headshots. I have to try a lot harder in that regard.\n\nOn the other hand, the Special Infected added a lot more variety in enemies and tactics that I feel this game is lacking. Plus, many of the weapons in this game are just crap - submachine guns are pretty useless, and so are most of the pistols (the weapon you'll probably need to pull out in an oh-crap moment). I've been mainly sticking to the Kar98k, shotgun and revolver as a result. It'd be nice if the weapons could be more balanced.\n\nBonus: I get to play using L4D characters.

The Zombie Army Trilogy runs on Sniper 3 game engine tech - it is smoother, sleeker, faster and good-looking. Tremendous value (3 games in 1 package). There is no deception on the part of the developer/publisher: this is a zombie shoot-'em-up and you're either into that or you're not. It's fast-paced and often quite overwhelming (especially on the insanely hard difficulties).

The genre is completely over saturated right? Well I thought so myself till I gave this title a play. Zombie Army Trilogy (ZAT) puts a really fresh spin on it. The game is set in World War II Germany, where as a last ditch effort Hitler unleashes plan Z to stop the Allies. OK your not here for the plot, and this one is hilarious at best. So lets talk about the game play! The game play is 3rd person perspective. Your equipped with your choice of sniper rifle, small machine gun, pistol, several traps, or explosives. Since ZAT is part of the Sniper Elite universe, there is an emphasis using your rifle. The enemies come at you from multiple directions, most walking at a traditional zombie pace. While the threat sounds minimal, they are traveling in massive groups. So at first site, you break out your sniper rifle and start making as many headshots as possible. If you pull off a really long range shot, you may trigger a cutscene where you watch the bullet fly and slowly dismember your enemy (similar to a Mortal Kombat 9 X-ray attack). This never gets old. Watching a two second replay of your perfect shot is just awesome! To aid in dispatching the Zombie horde, you'll find your other tools useful as well. The machine gun can bail you out of a tight situation when your overrun, the trip wires and landmines can provide an alarm if the building your sniping from is attracting visitors. This game was meant for co-op, four players working together can really make the difference. That being said single player requires dying, a lot. You don't have a buddy to revive you, and no one is watching your back. This provides a nice challenge for strategist players, as you must make every trap count. Wasting one will most likely result in certain death. The music is excellent! It's in the key of John Carpenter, played on an 80's synth, and inspired by B-side horror classics. I was able to run this on a 2013 laptop on low settings. If you enjoy Zombie killing co-op, or a single player Zombie slaying challenge this your game.\n\nDisclaimer: Gore, slow-mo exploding heads, regular exploding heads, and an occasional skeleton.\n\nOLDER GAMER APPROVED  POTATO PC CERTIFIED\nVisit our Currator Page","January 20","true","27.3"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","45","49","4","0"

The mechanics and weapons management are all handled the same way. What's drastically different however is the general approach. Fighting against hordes of zombies, stealth is kind of not an option here. Instead you'll be brute-forcing your way through the undead with whatever weapons, ammunition and resources you can get your hands on, be it from searching corpses or refills at the occasional safe house along the way.\n\nAs the title suggests, the game is actually three chapters, the third of which is exclusive to this package. The first two were previously released on Steam separately, but are supposedly enhanced using the latest game engine. Though I couldn't tell you how big of a difference that is as I've not played the originals.\n\nThe game is generally fun and a good challenge, but enemy variation feels a little lacking at times. It does get annoying encountering the same machine gun totting Nazi Hulk that slowly advances on you for the 20th time. Fortunately new enemy types are gradually sprinkled in as you reach the second and third chapters to this package. It could have done with just a bit more variety to spice it up further is all.\n\nI bought this game in the first week due to an applied loyalty discount as I already owned the two previous games. Sadly the offer has since expired, so I would wait for a sale discount before picking this up. The asking price is a bit high, especially if you already own the two previous releases.\n\nWho honestly doesn't love the idea of being a one-man army ploughing down a mass of Nazi undead with nothing more than a Sniper Rifle, Shotgun, sidearm and a couple of explosive gadgets?","April 24, 2015","true","20.5"," 50 of 61 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","50","61","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/301640/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Zombie Army Trilogy is a third-person shooter and yet another game in a Zombie Army spin-off of Sniper Elite series. But this time it also remasters the first two campaigns, gets an endless horde mode and brings it all to consoles. Made by Rebellion in 2015.\nIt also was ported to Xbox One and PS4. Nothing you miss.\n\nTechnically, it shouldn't explode. But it has some glitches. Mostly, what I remember is that last siege on 4th level never ended when I played coop with 4 people. Maybe some other multiplayer glitches. And it can still stop recognising mouse after soem alt-tab'ing.\n\nMultiplayer community is alive, from what it seems. It might take up to five minutes of sitting with opened lobby but it's going to fill out with all 4 people eventually. So yep, got to try out both campaign and horde mode. The only problem is that netcode doesn't amuse a lot of people. It sure can look as if it takes a full second for action to take place with some hosts.\n\nAnyway, you still shoot zombies. Many, many zombies. There is still no stealth like in Sniper Elite, levels are linear. No randomization. Still setting up explosive traps. And the setting is same classic horror theme, with slow zombies against whom headshots are most effective, lots of blood and guts in dark environments and 80s synth horror music. Music, heck yea! Best part.\nAnd it's still annoying to having to check dead bodies of zombies. There are just too many and process it still too long.\n\nIt also is now running on new engine and was ported to consoles. They also added ability to dismember zombies. And while it's cool and blood flows out like ketchup, you can see that they had to optimize it more and actually cut some of graphical stuff. Mostly that zombies have same uniform now. Probably because otherwise it would push memory limits with all the gibbing. But on good side, Trilogy actually runs better than older Zombie Armies. So I am happy enough.\n\nOne of the thing that this Trilogy does is to make it feel like it's own game and not just mod for Sniper Elite. Useless leftover features from SE like cover system and binoculaurs got removed for example. HUD now always shows what inventory items you still have and is just more comfortable. Two similar grenades types were fused into just one, with you being able to hold up to four of it. You can even select shotgun and revolver from a start.\n\nIt also finally balanced thigns around by realizing that it's more about close range where player moves around a lot. As a result, you recover breath quickly this time around, allowing you to use scoping abilities, like holding breath or even having time slow down in single player, much more often than almost-never. Some also even say that they have to compensate more for bullet drop now, which makes sense as battles now take at much closer range and you gotta keep that challenge of compensating.\n\nThey rebalanced things around. Turrets are now weaker, so some zombies can still pass through and you gotta watch out. Weapons that aren't rifles were made weaker. And most importantly, kick attack was made to be strong. It can knock enemies anytime and it now can finish the ones that lay on ground. It's quite powerful on single zombies. But skeletons now dying from one kick is a bit of a drastic changes. So big that they are now a challenge break than the challenge itself.\n\nAnd yes, these balance changes impact the original two campaign. Not to mentioning that such things as amount of spawning enemies and some other changes were made to them. Most noticeably a single turret was placed into one level of the first campaign, the lighting style of the whole second campaign was changed to be less painfully orange and there are now less of difficulty spikes, somehow. And yea, kick is more powerful so all the skeletons are easy breaks from action. Some people may agrue that it was casualized, but you know what, I actually felt that it was less tedius to beat these levels in Trilogy than in original. And monotomy is the biggest problem of these games, so I welcome these changes.\n\nAnd then there is a new, the third chapter made out of five levels. A special note should be taken about the first level. It's awesome and gives off a completely different feel from other levels, with a bit of feeling like you are part of NPC town and some basic exploration, setting false expectations for the remaining chapter. After that it goes back to normal traditional Nazi Zombie structured levels. Ah well.\nAnd yep, it's better than previous chapters and even more varied. I actually recommend new players to start with this one. It also introduced a new theme: zombies and skeletons in armor. And chainsaw dudes. And this is where the balance changes show that they were designed for this chapter. Turrets are placed in such way that they would have been overpowered if not made weaker. And kick is countered by skeletons wearing armor and by huge Panzer Zombies who you can't even knock down!\nAlso, you get to kill zombie Hitler.\n\nAnd sure thing the multiplayer plays a big part of this game. Don't even try to solo. Not because it's hard, it's actually quite possible, but because it's just plain tedius. It doesn't have any coop bots to fill the team up either. This game was designed for up to four players cooperative play. There isn't much of team-helping tactics aside from reviving each other, but all the combined firepower helps. It's more fun than solo, trust me.\n\nAnd it also includes Horde mode, where you are locked in a small map with infinite zombies coming. Well, not infinite spawn, it's divided into waves. But there is no proper final wave. Maybe. I didn't research it much. It's completely boring in solo play but becomes fun with four player team as you run around and try to cover everything, only to get surrounded by three elite zombies. Maps are different, there is even one that is nothing but a dead end corridor. The enemies that it uses there also seems to have balance of Trilogy in mind - there are absolutely no skeletons but really really many zombies in armor.\n\nIt's pretty nice and fun. But if you already found previous parts too repetetive, then don't bother with this one, it doesn't fix much. As for others who want, please, play the third episode immeditly in 4-player coop. Or else you will end up getting bored due to monotomy before you reach the better part of a game.","April 30","true","29.9"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","36","44","5","0"

It's still a good deal anyway.\n\nDecided to write this one a quick review because at the time of writing it's on sale.\n\nI bought this game a few months back when it was $20 and it was worth it. It's a fairly challenging coop shooter with Zombies and it's a lot of fun. Plus it's 3 games in one, so for $8.99 it's a steal.\n\nThis game features the stories from NZA 1 and 2 with updated textures, an exclusive third story continuing on from the other two that you can only buy in this collection, and a decent survival mode which is also exclusive to the trillogy. All are available in 4 player coop.\n\nIt has a fairly healthy online community, but it's certainly best with friends, which is why I don't have much time on it. That said, it has a certain dark humour to its story which makes it both endearing, but also a bit terrifying at times. If you're a fan of Call of Duty Zombies, particularly World at War, you'll probably love this.\n\nI have a fairly mid range PC (AMD FX-6300, R9 270x) and I run this at 80 fps 1080p on high with supersampling off and it runs beautifully. The graphics are pretty decent too.\n\nIf using an Xbox controller is your thing, the controller support is fantastic. Simply turn it on at any point and it'll work just fine. I use a 360 controller, but the game most certainly supports an Xbone controller too (it's image is used in the controls section of the options).\n\nBasically, buy it now while it's on sale because it's great. If you happen to read this after a sale, it is still worth getting it over the other two if you want both.","May 6","true","8.7"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

That being said, this review contains minor spoilers relating to game style and weapon selection.\n\nDo you want to know what you get for $45 with this game? You get several sniper rifles. Half have 5 rounds in the clip, the other half have 7-15. All do more or less the same damage, the ranges are equal, and the scopes vary in the slightest. All of these rifles have indistinguishable feels to them as well regarding how they fire (some have slightly more recoil or a more muffled sound).\n\nYou also get secondary weapons, fun right? I guess. There are several smg's that do next to no damage. There is a single smg that easily outpreforms the rest. There is also a shotgun...be ready to use that for the next 6-8 hours of your playtime.\n\nThe pistols in your third space are all the same with one exception. The revolver is one shot kill with a chest or headshot. I found myself switching between guns just to feel like I had some choice, but they are nearly identical so it never made a difference.\n\nNow let's talk about how the game works. You are given tasks: get to the safehouse, defend this position, survive this assault, finish off the zombies, find this key. You are always forced to go somewhere, kill everything in order to progress, and then go somewhere else and do the same thing. There is no straying from this formula. Might I mention that the same guns for every mission make these tasks more like chores?\n\nWhat does the game do well? The question we should really ask is "Who is this game trying to please?" This game is trying to entertain an audience that cares for nothing but aiming and clicking at something and seeing it die. There is no strategy apart from running past as much crap as you can before being forced to clear an area. There is no story aside from "Hitler has a zombie army." There are 3-4 models for the zombies, there are 2 models for the skeleton enemy, and there are a couple other enemies that you will always feel are just an annoyance.\n\nI had fun for about the first 2 hours. Then I realized that the game was not changing. The story does not progress. You spend hours shooting the SAME THINGS with no goal. There is no reward for your efforts aside from seeing a skull explode every time you shoot a zombie from over 50 meters.\n\nHow is this different from Call of Duty zombies? It has less selection, less story, less variation between weapons, no increasing difficulty aside from number of zombies that are all equally easy to kill. Is CoD zombies great? It has its flaws, but Zombie Army Trilogy takes a strong backseat with an unoriginal idea and less fleshed out development.\n\nDon't waste your money on all three of this trilogy. If you must, buy the first game and then replay it twice more; this would be no different than playing two and three because they are all the same. Differences between the three? I believe the third has about 4 more enemy types. oh, and the atmosphere changes about two times somewhere in there.\n\nThis is a waste. Buy the first or just save your time and money. Stay away from this package. I am sorry that I bought it, hopefully it can be returned.","March 26, 2015","false","7.7"," 179 of 310 people (58%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","58","179","310","30","7"

Those were my initial impressions after seeing some videos and screenshots of the game, and I'm not afraid to admit I was wrong. Aside from running on the Sniper Elite engine and some control scheme similarities, Zombie Army Trilogy draws about as much inspiration from Left 4 Dead as the developer's more serious World War II simulation. And it's not just the awesome, free Bill and friends skins, either.\n\nThe basic structure of the game is: kill a bunch of zombies, get to a safe room, restock, kill more zombies, repeat. Such a simple formula (combined with the current oversaturation of zombie media) is an easy target for bashing mindless, violent, derivative repetition. If you were to play a level then I told you you'd be doing that same loop more or less for the next twenty hours I wouldn't fault anyone for grumbling and calling out my bad taste, which I wouldn't deny. However, there's an undeniable beauty, stupidity, and brilliance to the game that I found entirely endearing and entertaining. It's as if an immature kid with an overactive imagination sketched out a basic outline of what he thought was cool, then just ran with it without giving a ♥♥♥♥ what anyone else thought. Then he got a sizable budget and talented team underneath him, and didn't let any external pressures compromise his original vision. Then that idea grew larger and more batshit insane over years, and he got better and simultaneously more creative as it went on. It's the gaming equivalent of a joke that gets a good belly laugh when you first hear it, wears out it's welcome to the point of annoyance, then circles around to being funny again.\n\nThe slow motion, skull cracking, lung exploding long range sniper shots are here, though toned down just a touch because the walking dead don't really give a ♥♥♥♥ and have rotten blood. Plus there's thousands of them. Tossing a grenade into a crowd usually racks up half a dozen kills on a bad throw. The undead make for tricky sniper practice as they shamble unpredictably, so going prone and picking off ghouls from half a mile away is really just the first line of defense for thinning the herd. Much of the action in Zombie Army Trilogy ends up in your face, whether you intend it to or not. This means your pistol is an indisposable tool for encroaching threats, and a generous kick will help you out of tight spots. Secondary weapons like SMGs, shotguns, and panzerfausts are useful against special enemies and specific situations, and traps like landmines and tripwires can act as early warning devices or crowd control.\n\nWhat elevates Zombie Army Trilogy from B-tier mediocrity are the tone, environments, and enemy variety. The soundtrack has to be called out as being particularly awesome: it sounds like a lost John Carpenter score or alternative takes to the original Dawn of the Dead. The minimalist late '70s/early '80s synth goes a long way to selling the pulpy horror setting. There's such commitment and attention to detail on every level: Nazi zombies is pure B-movie schlock, and developer Rebellion is well aware of this and they dive right in. The easy write-off would be the half-♥♥♥♥♥ “wink wink, nudge nudge” route, but there's real affection for the genre here. Part haunted house, part best of horror movies, the game is full of nods, cliches, and Easter eggs. One beefy special enemy wields a chainsaw and reminded me of the classic Resident Evil 4 infected, then he straight up starts doing the Leatherface dance from the end of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. There are portraits of real world monsters like Elizabeth Bathory and Vlad the Impaler, and clicking on them results in nonstop fountains of blood pouring from the paintings. If you inspect a baby carriage occupied by an ever-present demonic doll, your character becomes possessed and feasts on a human body. On the lighter side you can also get drunk, and keep an eye out for a statue performing the Village People's YMCA dance in the distance. Zombie Army Trilogy is as dense with detail as it is with the undead.\n\nThe “Trilogy” part of the title isn't just there for the hell of it or the three chapters in the game that connect the story and amp up in zaniness. I guess these chapters were available as separate games (presumably one for each Sniper Elite game), but the remaking of them here is handled so well I would have never known had I not read up on it. It feels entirely cohesive, though the quality and design does get markedly better as the game progresses. Along with the three main chapters that took me twenty hours to complete on Normal difficulty, there's also a Horde mode available on half a dozen maps. I only briefly messed with it, but for those who like co-op zombie action it's added value to an already lengthy game (which can also be played co-op). I came into Zombie Army Trilogy expecting cheap thrills and B-grade gore. I certainly got that, but by the time I took down giant zombie Hitler I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the game in an honest, unironic appreciation. Zombie Army Trilogy knows horror, comedy, and gunplay, and that's all on display in the game to greatest effect. It's worth it just to see what a fight against zombie Hitler looks like.","March 5","true","19.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

If you are thinking about getting NZA, get this one. Nazi Zombie Army Trilogy contains all three games in one easy package, and is much cheaper if you already own one of or both of the first two games. THIS GAME IS NOT FOR RUN AND GUN! NZA is a sniper elite title and as such, it requires a bit more finesse than standard shooters. The ordinary sniper elite was a stealth sniper game. NZA has no such "stealth" gameplay, trading that in instead for slow moving enemies moving in large wave based hordes, requiring finesse to place your shots accurately and a bit of keyboard agility to lay out traps and out pace the zombies. The games sound design reminds me strongly of old horror movies, as was the intention. The levels are structured with funneling, traps, and long range combat in mind, with portions of tense close up action. If you don't like evenly (slow) paced zombie shooters and would rather play something like COD zombies or L4D, then don't bother. If on the other hand you like the satisfaction of watching a bullet travel in slow motion out of your gun, across a courtyard, and bury itself in the groin of a zombie to burst it's useless testicles, then yes.

I really enjoyed NZA 1 & 2, but this one has fallen short. I'll  run through a few things that I don't like with the new game:\n* They have removed the binoculars,.......making it extremely hard to find bottles of blood.\n* You can no longer climb up on objects/walls/vehicles etc.....\n* Skeletons have been made WAY TOO easy to kill.\n* Regular soldier zombies now require more shots to kill them because the aim is "off" therefore using more ammo &     wasting more time......\n* Rifles do less damage & it's alot harder to get the 5-for-1 or 10-for-1 kills we used to get regularly in NZA 1 & 2.....\n* Pistols do considerably less damage,...even headshots,.....the only pistol worth using is the Webley, but it has a low rate of fire & reload time. Not even the Colt .45 does one-shot-kills, I've found myself firing two or even three shots to the head to kill enemies.\n* MG turrets are a waste of time & again do alot less damage, which is a pity cause the MG-42 was a feared weapon of WW2, nicknamed "The Buzzsaw" for a reason!....\n* The fire soldiers that the Fire Demon spawns are WAY too easy to kill & have been slowed down so they don't run as fast.\n* Searching corpses now wastes more time as you have to "Hold E" instead of "Pressing E"\n* The shotgun has had it's damage reduced & is now less effective.\n* The cross-hairs on the Preacher are now bigger making aiming more difficult & is now less effective & does less damage.\n* Explosives do less damage.\n*Hoarde mode has a large annoying scoreboard that blocks a quarter of the screen\n*New colour palate has reverted to a green-ish colour, instead of the red  hell-ish colour in NZA 2.\n*The "kick" has been over-buffed so now in parts you just have to stand there & kick enemies & not use any ammo....\n*SMG'S do alot less damage, the only one worth using is the Blyscawica, & even then still does less damage than in NZA 1 & 2.\n\nSo overall I think Rebellion has dropped the ball on this one guys, so save your money & don't bother wasting it on this game. Even the "new & improoved" versions of NZA 1 & 2 in this trilogy suck big time!......because of all the alterations. The originals are still the best.\n\n"If it ain't broken,.....don't fix it!"........\n\nThanks for a steaming pile of crap Rebellion!........game deleted!\n\nWaste of money!      :(","March 9, 2015","false","14.3"," 93 of 165 people (56%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","56","93","165","7","10"

However, there are some things in this game that some people might consider boring and tedious. The way that this game advances through is normally kill some zombies, go into a safe house, exit out and deal with a zombie siege then go into another safe house. Each mission lasts around 30 minutes to an hour, and that's normally all you do in them. You should also consider playing this with friends. I'm personally playing it solo, but it does get kinda lonely and boring sometimes when playing this for a long period of time. Playing with friends can always be a fun experience no matter the game.

The graphics reminds me of Sniper Elite v2.\n\nMore lazyness on Rebellions part is that they reused maps from Sniper Elite v2 they didn't even make new maps for this game, they also didn't make new weapons for this game either, just used the old ones.\n\nBasicly if you break it down, they added some mist, some zombie sounds and changed enemy skins.\nInfact the group you travel with in the storyline, they don't even talk!\n\nJust so much lazyness on the Developers part, I'm not sure people even notice it.\nAlso this game is not made at all for solo gameplay, it's so not balanced. (yet again lazyness)\n\nSame go's for horde mode playing that solo is just as stupid as it can get.\n---\nWell thats all the negative stuff about the game, I did have fun playing this game just the lazyness has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.\nI thought the storyline wasn't great, but it was fun to play.\n\nHmm let's think, well I finished the game and the storyline was alrighty.\nCan't think of much more to say...Would recommend it at a price of 7,50 or lower.","July 19, 2015","false","18.2"," 195 of 363 people (54%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","54","195","363","16","13"

BUY THIS GAME AND SURVIVE WITH US!\n- The progression of the gameplay is pretty much hard. Example, you want to finish the Village of the Undead. You did reach the safehouse but it took all of you a lot of time to get there (worse if you are playing solo). You're like 1/4 complete from the Village of the Undead.\n- Few X-Ray Vision Killcam moments (because you can't focus enough when aiming at the zombies).\n- Your "focus time" runs out so fast.\n- The tutorial of this game is wonk. You need enough Sniper Elite and/or Nazi Zombie Army experience to know the controls because most controls given won't appear on the tutorial.\n- I can admit that sometimes the level design of the game doesn't fit to the Sniper Elite combat system. It's zombies we're talking about, not living human beings.\n\nRATING: 8/10 would kick skeletons and run away from suiciders again.","May 8","true","44.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

The ammobox for machinegun ammo is now also the ammobox for the shotgun, which is a very nice upgrade.\nThe reloaded missions on the other hand from NZA1+2 are changed in a bad way; they should have left it in the original first released way before the changes (if it ain't broke don't fix it).\nThis is just another game you need to play in Coop if you want to survive it and with players you can rely on. Playing it in Single on the hardest difficulty is annoying and not doable because in this version you don't have the possibility to think out of the box, like in the previous original versions. There is no jumping in and out of windows anymore (like in NZA 1 + 2) and no climbing on things, so you only can play it the way they want you to play.\nThe spots where climbing and jumping over is allowed are very limited which makes the game pretty much 'just a game like any other modern game'. The controls for jumping over and climbing have also been changed and they must have had a reason for that, but it's a bit annoying sometimes.\nThe original NZA 1 + 2 were very unique games in which you were allowed to think out of the box in order to end the missions even in the hardest difficulty and in many different ways. They were not just another zombie game and therefore alot of fun to play, at least for me and my friends. Version 1 and 2 gave the player the opportunity to play the game in many different ways, whereas this new version the player forces to do only what the devs want. It seems that creative thinking in this game is not appreciated, which in my opinion is a pitty because creative thinking is exactly what makes games more interesting to play.\n\nThe turret mounted machine guns don't have the same kind of power/impact as in NZA 2 so don't rely too much on those guns.\nThe explosives don't have the same effect as in NZA1+2 and the panzerfaust is pretty much useless against the new armored Elite.\nThe shotgun and the preacher aren't as powerfull anymore as in the previous version, but it can do the job. The cross for aiming on the preacher is way too big now and the ammo is very limited. The preacher should be more accurate since it's supposed to be a double barrel big cailber elephant rifle with alot of devastating power. In this game they reduced all that.\nThe pistols aren't as accurate and powerfull anymore as in the previous versions, especially when you're being swarmed by zombies.\nThe reloaded versions of NZA1 + 2 are not as fun to play as the original versions because they changed it in a negative way. No climbing and jumping anymore, just the same sort of gameplay as the new maps. That means that when playing on the hardest difficulty and/or Horde mode you really need to know what you're doing because ammo is scarce and there's no changing the scenario like jumping and climbing in and out of windows (or whatever) whenever you think is necessary.\n\nSo in all, if this new version would be just like NZA 1 and 2 (before the major update where several things were changed) but with all the new features, this game would be way more fun to play.\nSadly it seems that developpers don't like to listen to what gamers really want.\nFor those who just want to play and have fun in games without needing to think too much, this is another zombie game..., but for those who like to think out of the box and like to play a game in many different ways (or in your own way) this is definitely not that sort of game.\nPeople who haven't played NZA 1+2 won't notice the annoying changes, but the people who played NZA 1+2 from the start and before the changes will agree that they changed the games in a bad way.\n\nSame with Sniper Elite 2 and 3; version 2 is to my opinion still the best game. The changes they made in version 3 didn't do the game any good. People expected to see an upgrade but find the changes more or less a downgrade :(\n\nSo, basically only Chapter 3 is a bit interesting for the people who already own the previous versions but I can't say that it's worth the € 16,79. It surely isn't worth the € 41,99 but that's only marketing strategy because the previous games weren't really a succes due to the changes they made.

Initial release: broken, so they had to patch it within a day, as to be expected.\n\nProgression blockers was listed to be fixed, but I still am experiencing it myself.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=418595920\n\nAnd broken matchmaking is still there...\n\nSad, but I might change this to NOT RECOMMENDED if they don't do anything soon.\n\n---\nOriginal review below:\n\nIs the game fun?\n\nYes it is. Buy it. That's my recommendation.\n\nBut to be fair, I'd like to say about some glaring problems that the Developer should solve, as it is their responsibilities to us their playerbase.\n\nBad points:\n1. Glitches everywhere. Progression bug mainly plagues this game. I've personally encountered a door that downright refused to open, forcing us to restart. There's been a report of achievement bug as well (of being unable to find the Bottle object required to get the achievement)\n2. Terrible AI. Zombies getting stuck or walking on random directions anyone?\n3. No AI partners when playing Solo.\n4. Rebellion's slow response. They seem to be so slow releasing patches to fix the game. Not a single patch after 10 days of release or so. They told me to send them a ticket for my problem and they didn't give me a reply. Simply wtf.\n5. Horrible, terrible, idiotic matchmaking system, locked by regions. In short, if you use top of the line region e.g New York in your Steam download setting, most likely you'll meet other people and can play together. If you use some weirdos' region e.g Indonesia, expect to find zero all the time, as nobody plays or uses this region. Not to mention they require player to set up router to be able to find lobbies. Strict NAT = GG WP no lobby for u.\n6. No more scope toggle. What kind of madness is this? This is 3rd person shooter game, scope toggle is a must. Read more here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/301640/discussions/0/610574394223205818/\n7. Can't hug the walls/cover system with simple button press like previous NZA games.\n8. No anti-cheat for online matches. So you can cheat to your heart's content.\n9. No workshop. Expect the game to stale fast and once the playerbase leaves, it will be a dead town. For MP aspect that is.\n\nNow the good points:\n1. Promoting teamwork. It's fun when you play with teamwork even with strangers. To survive, you need to help each others, especially when downed. One man down means greater danger for entire team and this game's good at forcing people to help each others. And yes yes, it's uber fun when playing with prearranged team / friends.\n2. Great Soundtracks. I have to admit, one of NZA's strong points is the soundtrack. In particular, I like Freight Train's OST, very good.\n3. Horde Mode. While it only has few maps, but finally Rebellion addressed one of major flaw in this series that was often requested by community.\n4. Unified community. This game stitches together all three episodes (last one is brand new) on Nazi Zombie Army. The original levels from NZA 1 and 2 are present, and we can play together in one unified community.\n5. Frightening atmosphere and level designs. Dead walking everywhere.\n6. Good new zombie arts. While it sounds like impossible in reality, a zombie can now wield chainsaw and walking towards you. At the very least it's refreshing to see new types of zombies and they didn't use only the original designs but introducing new ones.\n7. Combo system. It's for scoring, and it's satisfying to see your scores going up because you successfully pull a great string of shots. Requires practices and good computer, though, as lags pretty much kill this system.\n8. Achievements! It's something interesting and adds replayability value to the game.\n9. And of course the sniping mechanic. Probably has the best one out there in terms of Sniper games - aside of their original IP Sniper Elite series.\n\nDon't forget if you still have a chance, use the loyalty discount. Game's good, as long as you can tolerate what I wrote about this game's bad points.\n\n8/10. Would give better scores if they fix the lingering problems.","March 15, 2015","true","86.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","3"

AND TRADING CARDS!\n+ The soundtrack that I've heard is well done but often looped.\n+ Customizable difficulty tweaks. Seemed relatively balanced for my gameplay duration.\n+ Playing with L4D characters reminded me that I have better games in my library I could be playing.\n\nCons:\n- Levels feature short ranges, confined buildings, and lots of obscuring fog and smoke. Why the hell are you making sniping the focus when literally EVERY other attack I have works better in most situations?\n- Enemy variety isn't very inspired. Ranged juggernauts that need an insane amount of headshots to take down, lightning quick kamikaze style enemies, and the boring shambling Nazi zombies that are very rinse/repeat. I understand it's the zombie and sniper maxim to "aim for the head", but frequently resurrecting non-headshotted enemies gets quite annoying.\n- Bad checkpoints. Often we'd have to restart a 30 minute segment because the enemies in the last 5 minutes would obliterate us.\n- Lots of weapons are blatantly better than others. While in the main Sniper Elite games, you might ditch the semi-automatic magezine loaded rifle for something with greater range and stopping power. Most all enemies die in one headshot and are within a joke of a range for a sniper: you have no reason not to take the M1 Garand / Carbine every time. Some secondaries and pistols are near useless as well.\n- Equipment is based on a stealth element. Tripwire, landmines, and dynamite that needs to be shot to be triggered. Only in the infrequent hold-out events (which give you probably 10-15 seconds to set up) are these defenses remotely useful. They were meant to gate off your sniping position in the main Sniper Elite games, but yield little benefit here. I'd rather just carry double grenades\n- There's nothing "cooperative" about co-op. In games like L4D, co-op synergy is TIGHT. You rely on your team mates to heal you, scavange supplies for you, cover you while you accomplish objectives, revive you, kill enemies pinning you, etc. In this game, the only benefit to having a companion along is that they can revive you. I have the same amount of banal "not fun" playing this alone as I do with friends.\n- Again. The sniper theme. WHY?! Who in the right mind would prefer a percision weapon when there are literally hundreds of enemies?! Extra mags for secondary SMG/Shotgun and pistol are heavily reduced. Sniper clips/bullets/mags are in sheer abundance. You're supposed to be using (scoped only) rifles.\n- Bad net coding. I play L4D, Killing Floor, and now this with a group of Steam friends a few states away. Those former two games are MUCH more responsive when it comes to hit detection and third party animations.\n\nI bought this 66% off for about $15, and even that was way too much for this game. Sniper Elite is ketchup, zombies are ice cream. They're fine on their own but you need to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to attempt to mix them. If you insist on using outdated weaponry against zombies of a politically unfavorable preference, then buy CoD World at War or Black Ops 1. This game has almost nothing going for it.","August 25, 2015","false","3.4"," 30 of 54 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","30","54","4","4"

Up to 4 player Co-Op, zombie hordes to shoot through, 3 'stories' with 5 chapters each, with safe rooms along the way to break up the tension and let you restock on much needed ammunition. As an added neat feature, the cast from the Left 4 Dead games are selectable characters!\n\nThe first game in the triology can start off a bit slow, but it builds up great in terms of difficulty and tension. The second and third games are solid all the way through with difficult fights, incredible, gory, creepy level design, and environments that are so different with each map as to keep feeling fresh and interesting as you shoot your way further and further into Hitler's bloody, gore-filled empire.\n\nWhile this is built on the Sniper Elite 3 engine, this is not really a sniping game. You are generally engaging enemies at ranges of 50 or less meters, with only the occasional long shot of 100 or so meters. Considering the volume of enemies you have to go through, this is in the game's favor, since sniping 100's of zombies from 100+ meters away would probably get old fast.\n\nOther than the first chapter, I played the game through on Solo Mode. Solo Mode has more frequent check points than Co-Op so it manages to keep from being frustrating most of the time. In Co-Op, you have to respawn at the safe rooms if you wipe, so that can make certain stretches incredibly difficult. There are a few incredibly hard engagements later in the series, but I did beat the whole thing on the Marksman level of difficulty.\n\nMy only criticism of the game is that there is almost no choice in terms of what primary weapon you use. Since they all do the same damage per shot, and you're not firing at super long engagements, the M1 Carbine is the only one that makes sense to use with its 15 round magazine and fast reload. Every other rifle is only a downgrade in every way that counts with how the game works. I would have liked to see it tuned such that there were legitimate reasons to consider using the other rifles.\n\nIn the end, if you enjoy zombie shooters of any kind, you should find this fun. If you have someone who will play through it with you, even better.\n\nAny game where your final action is "Throw Zombie Nazi Hitler into the Hellmouth." can't be wrong.","March 20","true","23.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I tend to wait for higher price games to go on sale for a very deep discount so I usually don't get to play games like this untill they're almost ancient. This game looked pretty good though so I decided to take a chance and buy above my usual price range (though still on sale).\n\nPros:\nGreat atmosphere, the maps are very dark and eerie. Great mix of wartorn city, WWII tech, and ocult mystisim.\nFun gameplay, especially in coop. Even though it's mostly centered around sniping you can still manage different rolls with placement and secondaries.\nYou get the other two games campaigns in this one. Kind of makes buying the others a bit pointless.\nMultiple ways to adjust difficulty, you can increase the actual difficulty to add bullet drop and other realistic aiming difficulties or you can just bump up the number of spawns from the horde, or both.\n\nCons:\nLimited weapon types\nConfusing story, I'm not even too sure what it involves. In the first chapter you get a book to shut down an altar but it doesn't seem to do anything. In the second you assemble an artifact that repels undead but again it doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n\nNit-picks:\nHow is it that undead ressurected recently die if they're shot in the head, yet skeletons ressurect without a brain in their head and can take headshots all day. One's weakness is the brain the other is the heart (not sure why they still have one). It's not super important just something that doesn't feel right with me.\n\nThis one's definitely a good buy in my opinion.

Insanely repetitive, it gets boring very quickly. There are two game modes; horde and campaign. Both feel mostly the same with the only difference being that the campaign has very simple objectives. Basically get from point A to point B, killing all enemies to progress. The maps are very linear and simple. I can't imagine playing more than one play through of the three campaigns. The weapons aren't the most balanced (revolver and shotgun are clearly op) or the most varied. The game runs fine most of the time, however, I personally experienced significant lag in full matches whenever the carnage was high. This game feels like a watered down COD zombies with less variability than Left 4 Dead. If you are really into zombie horde games you might find some enjoyment here because it is by no means a terrible game, just suffers from a very low replay value. If you do plan on buying this game, get it on sale because it is not worth $44.99.","August 23, 2015","false","1.0"," 24 of 45 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","24","45","0","1"

At the begining that looks very cool,\nbut after, you´ll switch it off because you´ll be full of seeing shattered skulls\na lot (if you have good aim for the headshot).\n\nThe game as the name sugest, are three games in one, making it a very long road\nto the end, that in my opinion, is a good thing, comparing it with games that\nyou finish in 5 hours, and also a good cast of characters (including the cast\nof Left 4 Dead 1 and 2), multiplayer of 4 players and horde mode (also, for 4\nplayers) it´s just the icing in the cake, but after you finish the game, unless\nyou have other 3 friends to play, the game is not going to see much action after\nthat.\n\nThis is a good deal either if it has or not has a promotion, so, if you like zombie\ngames, this is a good option.","May 16","true","70.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Zombie Army Trilogy is an absolute blast, whether you're with friends or going solo. Naturally, with the similarities, you'll think of a certain Valve series to play instead but as a long-time player of the Left 4 Dead series, I'm quite happy to say that this achieves and even passes it. But hey, with the latest update, you can now get the best of both.\n\nThe influence of schlock cinema and directors such as Tarantino, Carpenter and Rodriguez and old school, B-grade films is great to see and, similar to Killing Floor, the game often doesn't itself too seriously. But how does the game actually work, I hear you ask?\n\nYou play as one of four survivors or, if you have no Steam friends who have it, all alone, and are dropped straight into the action at the end of World War II. Unfortunately, the War and Nazi dictatorships aren't the only thing ending as the world has gone to ♥♥♥♥ in usual (and glorious) grindhouse style. Just like real-life, the Fascists can't handle defeat and after some Occult hijinks and a certain undead nightmare, it's up to you and your buddies to put them back in their place. Again. Campaigns are structed in terms of your team of survivors going through a series of levels, each split with a safe room between the carnage and each episode, usually finishing with a boss fight or hold-out. I won't spoil the narrative of any of the three, (not that it does a BioShock Infinite or anything like that), but what sets it apart from a certain other is that Zombie Army Trilogy has a campaign that is less obscure and with more interesting characters, (along with the difference of third-person perspective obviously.) Not to mention killer gameplay to boot.\n\nBrilliant sound, level and character design along with a good soundtrack and polished interface and gameplay each shine in their own right but it is the magnificent and highly detailed gore system that will really draw you in. Similar to the reboots of Mortal Kombat and Bethesda's V.A.T.S. in the Fallout series, the mechanic from Rebellion's Sniper Elite series makes a welcome return into true gratuitious and satisfying style. As a result, gameplay focuses on the use of rifles and headshots, but a wide array of weapons and explosives with an easy-to-use interface and loadout system streamlines the game without simplifying it to the point of boredom and you'll be a master of your guns in no time.\n\nSeperate to the campaign is the survival-like Horde feature, which is exactly what it sounds like. Good, just not mind-blowing.","August 21, 2015","true","24.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Busverpasser/recommended/301640/","Busverpasser","Busverpasser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Busverpasser/","186 products in account","I bought this game because I really enjoyed playing Sniper Elite V2 and 3. So my expectation was quite high when I started playing this. In the beginning, I was a little surprised that the gameplay does actually differ quite a bit from Sniper Elite. Instead of focusing on stealth, you need to kill Zombies pretty fast here. This makes the other weapons way more important than they were in the sniper series where I never used any with the exception of the silenced gun. Even the kicks are required here which adds to the variety of combat behavior.\n\nEnemy variety is pretty decent as well. Yesterday I met the summoners and really enjoyed the work when I saw how they hold their head all the time as if they were in pain -> headache relief is a great name for an achievement in this context :D. I haven't tried out the multiplayer yet but all the fun is definitely worth the asking price from my point of view even though you will recognize all maps/buildings from the Sniper games. It's a great game and hope to see more of it in the future!","September 9, 2015","true","44.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I had to go round and shoot them in the ground to advance to the next stage. It took some friends and I about 15 minutes of running around to figure this out.\n\n2) Another time a large metal door in a bunker swung open while I was close to it, forcing me through the wall of the map and to my death. I had just got out of the previous checkpoint 10 minutes beforehand.\n\n3) A particular mini boss that comes around in a few fights has invulnerability frames when you shoot him in the head, or so it seems, the game didn't explain this to me so I spent a good half of the game trying to figure out if I was wasting ammo or not. The feedback from hitting mini boss enemies is very little in general.\n\n4) Many of the automatic secondary weapons such as the Thompson and the MP40 are near useless on ZAT, in Sniper Elite they were much better because the enemies you shot at were only mortal. But the recoil, accuracy and small ammo storage makes them very hard to use. The shotgun is basically king for secondaries most games. Same would go for some sniper rifles as well, many of them are weak in most situations, with only a handful standing out.\n\n5) On that point, there is a real lack of weapon variety in the game, which means that you will probably stick with the same load out for most of the game. There are special weapons that lie around the map (many hidden), but they require special ammo that you can't resupply for like a normal weapon, as such their use is situational.\n\n6) Furthermore, beyond the story mode there isn't much to do, once you play through it once you know what is coming and you prepare for it, I can't imagine playing through it again in a casual way.\n\n7) Lastly, the cutscenes are all mute, none of the characters speak and therefore I spent a good couple of times going "what do they mean?" or "what is happening?" The majority of backstory comes from the radios in safe rooms (about 3 per level) or from people around you.\n\nConclusionI can't imagine playing this with anyone but friends, it's something you will have great fun with playing but suffer from burnout afterwards and maybe never touch again.\n\nPlay with friends... laugh, panic and head shot your way through it, it's created some pretty memorable moments for me, and for that. Despite all the bugs and issues. It's worth it.","September 2, 2015","true","29.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","1"

But the sale price of $15 absolutely warrants it, especially if you're a fan of the original NZA games.  You basically get all three NZA games in one, so if you don't have the others, start here and don't bother looking back.  It is everything good about the original NZA series but on the newer Sniper Elite 3 engine with a new campaign and the ability to select 16 characters.  There's now 4 female characters and the entire 8 player cast of Left 4 Dead 1 & 2.  The new PPSh-41 tommygun makes close range combat a blast when you're mowing down large crowds with it.  Close combat situations with the other weapons, esp on hard difficulty levels were something that to me was a bit tedious in the older versions if you got cornred and couldn't use a rifle.  If you were trying to play solo on hard forget it.  But this game has a lot more game options to customize how you want to play, if you want low, medium, high, or insane amounts.

Buggy throughout, but okay. The first two were quite well-conceived, with some really well thought-out scenarios to exercise your sniper skills with plenty of difficulty to make it very interesting. Then I headed into the third game of the trilogy. I'm now well into it....\n\nThe third game is WAY TOO MUCH close-quarter combat against absurd quantities of zeds, and where you are NOT a "sniper" in any sense that matters.\n\nThe third game just went the LAZY route to "offer" entirely artificial difficulty rather than to craft really interesting scenarios in which, as a SNIPER, you must use SNIPER skills to clear out the zeds (as the first two of the trilogy did).\n\nIf you want a close-quarters game, you want KF2, which is MUCH better conceived and executed than ZAT is for that style of play. I mean MUCH better! And even being early access, KF2 is a more solid, less buggy game than is ZAT. Progress bugs in ZAT? In this "mature" of a game? Really?\n\nAnd ZAT's approach to close-quarters combat in the third game of the trilogy is just downright STUPID.\n\nReally, having played the first two games in the "trilogy" through, I'm finding the third one to be a HUGE disappointment and do NOT recommend it. If you enjoyed the play style in the first two, the third is NOT IT!\n\nEVERY level involves a LOT of close-quarters combat where you are artificially hemmed in and then mobbed. You have 24 shots in a shotgun, and it's not enough. Not nearly enough!\n\nThe sniper rifle is almost useless because you can't see anything so up-close when you are scoped. Your pistol had better be the Webley, but it doesn't have NEAR enough ammo.\n\nSo, you have two actual close-quarters weapons with not NEARLY enough ammo, and your sniper rifle is horribly hampered by lack of range. So, level after level, it is ARTIFICIAL difficulty and not a SNIPER game at all (like the first two games were).\n\nEither wait until game three is offered on its own for like $8 or less, or wait until the entire ZAT drops to like $15 or at most $20 (that value really being in the first two games of the set).\n\nIf you already own the first two, DON'T bother buying until they are virtually giving either the third game or the whole set away. The third game of the trilogy is close-quarters, artificial difficulty and really nothing like the first two. Rebellion got LAZY with the third, and they clearly just repackaged the "trilogy" to fire up the ol' cash cow again.\n\nI am REALLY put off by Rebellion's handling of this whole thing, especially now that I see HOW much they took the easy, LAZY route on the third game just so that they could "repackage" a "bundle" to crank out more cash. This will be my last Rebellion purchase ever.\n\nI had never played the first two, so I don't feel entirely ripped off. But anybody buying the "trilogy" after owning the first two got RIPPED OFF by Rebellion. Well, actually, at the $45, so did I.\n\nSo, WAIT until they are virtually giving this "trilogy" away, and then enjoy the remastered first two. Then, completely change your expectations as you head into the third, because it is NOT a sniper game anymore. If you could somehow get rid of the sniper rifle in exchange for some high-ammo-capacity close-quarters primary weapon, you WOULD. The sniper rifle is that useless by comparison to a good shotty with enough ammo for it.","May 19, 2015","false","63.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Pick this up if you enjoy massacre'ing zombies to the point of genocide!\n\nIn all seriousness though, I love the Sniper Elite mechanics in a zombie game. So satisfying to land those multi-kill (head)shots. Takes a bit of figuring out to get past a few difficulty bumps (in my experience) Like when facing multiple elites, the first time. But it's always fun to figure out, and feels good to progress. The story isn't anything intricate, but interesting enough to want to know what's going to happen next. Not a lot of dialogue though aside from radio messages. But the main characters never seem to speak. That's probbably the only criticism I have.\n\nOther than that it does seem to be a demanding game. My PC is not the BEST, but it can play most modern games fine at 60 fps 1080p. However in this game It seems more like a constant 40 FPS with dips into the 30 and 20, (Explosions, and for some reason Skeleton Spawning lags me out in particular) Other than that, and even despite that I still enjoy this game more than most recent games I've purchased.\n\nI give this game, 10 out of 10 dead zombies!","November 6, 2015","true","35.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having bought it at 15 bucks I found it to be a real treat.\n\nThe game is best played with at least one other player and three is even better.

It's the kind of game that'll keep you both focused and entertained, although the game progression reminds me a lot of Left 4 Dead (progressing through hordes and safehouses until you secure the finale).\n\nProbably the best zombie game available on the market right now if you've already beaten others like Dead Island and Dying Light. Only two issues I've found so far are zombies' sudden change of stance to make an attack, making it unnatural and unpredictable - but hey, you won't let them get close enough for that, will you? - and the lack of iron sights, which makes ammo conservation a tough task if you're not handling a sniper.\n\nNow stop reading this, get this game and let's bash some zombie heads together.\n\n9.5/10","August 21, 2015","true","34.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I was not a real fan of the dead island type of game.  This game though is impressive, a completely different type of game play, high points on the morbidity action.  I am very postive on this game.  Having bought it at 15 bucks I found it to be a real treat.\n\nThe game is best played with at least one other player and three is even better.  Playing solo can get a bit monotonous, and difficult but with the right range of players the game can be done very engrossing.","August 23, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_GameOn/recommended/301640/","_GameOn","Kendrick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_GameOn/","74 products in account","Sniper Elite + Zombie Hordes = Zombie Army Trilogy\n\nThis is easily one of the most enjoyable Zombie games I have played in a long time. In a market that has become increasingly saturated over the years, mostly due to the ongoing popularity of Call of Duty's Zombie modes, it is refreshing to play something that feels so balls out ridiculous and designed purely for enjoyment.\n\nThere are no deep metaphors about the state of the human race, no morally ambiguous choices to make, just waves and waves of Zombie scum to obliterate in any means you deem fit. Don't get me wrong, there is definitely a place for a deeper exploration of the Zombie theme in gaming, but it's just so refreshing to see something deviate so whole heartedly from that and pull it off without just seeming like a stupid cash in.\n\nObviously this is not a game that will suit everyones tastes, but if you have any kind of love for classic B movie zombie fare or just want to spend a few hours watching heads explode with a few mates, I can't recommend this highly enough.\n\nRating: 4/5\nHighly Recommended Purchase.","May 7","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sniping.\n\n(Mind you that I haven't played the other Sniper Elite games which this ZAT is based on, so this review is solely based on my impressions of this game only.)\n\nWith that said, this game if you can snag it off a 75% discount is most likely worth it, but only playable for a short amount of time as it gets repetetive real quick and you start to get bored with the game and you may start to think about other things you have to do whilst playing ZAT, thoughts such as what you are going to make for dinner tonight, and if you forgot when you booked the washroom if it was for tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.\n\nAnd this ladies and gentlemen, is the issues I have with ZAT. It's not lack of story but the excessive amount of sniping all the time, it turns to be just a gimmick (a cool one nonetheless) and without that creepy feeling in the back of your neck that you may die at any given moment, takes away alot of the elements that this game had you going on for, initially.\n\nSo with that said, go ahead, buy the game, play online with some friends and snipe away for all your dollars worth but just don't say that I didn't warn you.","May 22","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Enjoy :)\nZombe Army Trilogy is a three part episodic game developed by Rebellion Developments, the same people behind the Sniper Elite series and this is a spin off to that series, Hitler is losing gradually in 1945, however, a devious plan known only as Plan Z will awaken the Nazi zombies from their graves and reek havok across Europe, you play a set of characters (if playing Co-Op, singleplayer, you play as a sniper) and in the three part episodes it is your task to defeat Hitler and put an end to the Nazi zombies\n\nThe game is pretty much the same as Sniper Elite V2, you are a sniper, you use your sniper and you shoot Nazis, in this case, Nazi zombies. However, I rarely used my sniper in the game as most of the time your are not at a vantage point but your thrown into the action with zombies crawling up to you, so I mainly used my secondary weapon and pistol, don't know why they added the sniper in the first place\n\nThe famous action cam is back! And the gore inducing detail of you shooting your enemies is absolutely glorious, but as mentioned previously, you hardly get to use the sniper\n\nStealth is completely gone in Zombie Army Trilogy and the game mainly focuses on you shooting a heck load of zombies. The shooting is fun and very satisfying and the sniper is awesome when you get to use it\n\nI really liked the music, it made me think of 80's and 90's horror movies mixed in with the music from John Carpenter's The Thing (great horror classic). The voice acting is okay, the characters you play are completely silent, which I don't know why, and the majority of the voice acting is Hitler and his wife Eva Braun and some other people who I do not know their names and the game doesn't bother to tell you\n\nThe story is somewhat interesting, Hitler is at his last breath and unleashes a plan that if WWII was happening in 2016, this zombie awakening thingy could happen... however, the story got squashed with the boring and repetitive objectives and safe rooms\n\nThis game was mainly designed for Co-Op in mind and the difficulty shows, I died a ton playing on singleplayer and sadly I cannot play co-op because I have no friends so I can't comment about that\n\nThe game does offer multiplayer but after the bad multiplayer in Sniper Elite V2, I couldn't be bothered to try\n\nZombie Army Trilogy is a good game, not as good as Sniper Elite V2 but good enough to stand on it's own two feet. If you liked Sniper Elite V2 and want to play something else before heading on over to Sniper Elite 3, then Zombie Army Trilogy is the thing for you!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","May 14","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

But I never thought they make computer games, and ZAT shows me how they make a difference between PC and mobile devices. More chapters, bigger maps and more complicated controls.\n\nPersonally I don't prefer any shooting games that are not first person view. Though this one is like a third-person shooter for me, I found it very easy to get on to the controls. The long range adjustments, stability and range of weapons are well detailed, which make the weapon selection very significant to the tactics you use.\n\nThe sound in game is stunning. In my very personal point of view the musics are great, together with the roar of zombies,   the sound of gun fire and some mysterious/creppy sound effect(don't want spoil it, so find them yourself) made up the intense and thirll atmosphere. Sometimes the background music is strange, in a chapter you kill tough zombies with a very moody, kinda peaceful background sound. Also, the use of children laughter and voice is very creepy, I still can't find what makes those sound, they really put my heart at edge.(I am scared to face an enemy who makes sound like that, must be very powerful:p)\n\nThere are some aspects of this game I don't think is good. Such as the little bit dull story line. Characters don't speak themselves, you can only hear radios and the voice of unknown as guidance. Type of zombies are limited, the only challenge is the number of them are huge. And the last bit, I bought the game at a discount, the original price is little bit high for me.\n\nNote for multiplayers: I tried it many times, seems like not many people online. And aim&fire won't be that easy in single-player mode, there is a latency when you kill, other players can block your bullet, and most important, in default settings the amount of zombies will be much more than in single-player, it requires teamwork.","May 13","true","33.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The kick you get was also a bit wonky in which direction you where facing.\nIt got a bit repetitive with the zombies and colors of the environment.  It was nice when they changed the scenery every now and then, but overall it was city block after city block.\n\nOverall a great game, at least the single player.

Then you will like this game. Consider this my condensed review...\n\nStill here.. Well then...\nYou shoot, you run, you get trapped by magic fog, but that's OK because you get to shoot Zombies in the head. Would you like to play an open world shooter where decisions matter to the story ? That's not this game, but you do get to shoot Zombies in the head. You can play in co-op mode, Shoot even more Zombies in the head with your friends. Turn on or off Friendly fire, your choice.\n\nThe Game is linear, it's "old school" console man, meaning you can't save your progress,  ever!  Each time you start a level, you'll play without the resources you worked so hard to collect, no one knows why, best not to think about it too much. You have the Peta factor of playing thru a whole level just to get to the boss battle you quite last time because you were frustrated with being surrounded and thus couldn't shoot Zombies in the head fast enough.   Ain't Old school charming, but; you get to shoot Zombies in the head.\n\nThere are zombies:                     Shoot in the head.\nElite Zombies that shoot back:  Shot in the head; a lot.\nZombies with explosives:           Shoot anywhere.\nSniper Zombies:                          Ditto.\nZombies en fuego:                      Ditto\nZombies summoning other zombies: Shoot in the head.\nOverall, there is a lot of shooting, you can also kick.\n\nIt's an entertaining game, if a bit repetitive, It's not immersive, the story is as shallow as a Presidential candidate, but some battles are creative, you can blow things up, some zombies are on fire, and there is gratuitous Zombie shooting, in the Head.\n\nIs it art ? alas no, but you get to shoot Zombies in the head.","November 25, 2015","true","57.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Zombies will usually revive shortly after being killed unless you headshot them or beat them to death with melee attacks. So precision aiming is key here, you can't just go in guns blazing with the worst accuracy possible if you expect to do well.\n\nThen you got your usable items such as grenades to deal with groups, you also have your mines and tripwire to set clever little traps to effectively take out hordes, or tougher enemies.\n\nBesides your normal zombies, you have the occasional sniper zombies, tanky machine gun zombies that have the thickest head in the world, exploding suicide zombies that like playing wack-a-mole with you, and sniper minigame nightmare floaty skulls boss dude.\n\nIt's a challenging sniper adventure that you should take on with at least 1 friend due to the revival system.

You can pick whatever difficulty and the game will tailor the number of zombies to your number of players, or a higher number if you're really feeling masochistic. And yes, the early stages of the very first mission will be playable and maybe even enjoyable as you snipe Nazi zombies at long range in glorious slow-motion and watch the bullet tumble away like a drunken ballerina. But, trust me, it won't take long before the fun starts to dry up. Why?\n\nHordes.\n\nThere are points within that first mission where you're forced to stand your ground and deal with a massive number of zombies. This seems pretty standard fare for games in the zombie genre, so it's not something I didn't expect. But that's also exactly where Zombie Army Trilogy loses its fun factor.\n\nZombie Army Trilogy is basically Sniper Elite v2 but with zombies instead of living, breathing, Nazi soldiers. This means that the enemy has no sense of self-preservation whatsoever, and will simply continue to shuffle in your direction - and they always know where you are, regardless of whether they've seen you or not. You'll simply hear a howling sound from nearby, and then there they come, hobbling your way. In areas where there's a long run-up between you and the enemy, or in buildings where you have to switch to a secondary weapon like a shotgun or pistol, this is fine.\n\nPartway through the first mission, however, there's a big crossroads intersection. At first, targets spawn in small waves from one of the different directions the roads take. But then they start spawning from every direction at once. If you try to use your rifle, the weapon this game and Sniper Elite v2 are all but crafted around, then you'll die. If you try to use your secondary weapons outside of a shotgun, you'll die.\n\nIf you've got a dedicated group of friends who you can count on to want to play co-op games any time you ask, then give Zombie Army Trilogy a shot when it's on a deep discount during one of Steam's bi-yearly sales. If you're like me, and you do most of your gaming alone whether you want to play solo or not, then I'd seriously think twice before buying this game. And because my experience is the latter, I'm marking this game as "Not Recommended."","May 19","false","4.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In which you kill nazis who died once already.\n\nWeapons:\nThe weapons you can choose from at round start are the same as in SN2, except that they replaced the silenced pistol with a shotgun (SMG slot).\nThough you can find weapons like a rocketlauncher and a double barrel shotgun. Maybe even more, but i haven't played that far yet.\n\nZombies:\nThis game feels like a zombie apocalypse, if it was real.\nThe zombies can carry random weapons like metal rods of any variaton and even limbs of others.\nThere are "special" zombies too. Suicide zombies, big dudes with a machinegun, skeletons...\n\nMaps:\nACTUAL GERMAN LOOKING TOWNS unlike other Nazi Zombie games *looks at Call Of Duty*\nThe maps in this game, location and ambience, make this game feel so awesome. Especially when you know that the maps are german towns where it would make sense to have nazi zombies.\n\nMissions:\nThe missions i have played yet are mostly just walking through a map and killing zombies, while every once in a while a mini boss or a boss shows up. So that's a minus point. Maybe it gets more interesting further into the game. I'll update the review once i get further.\n\nPlayable characters:\nYou can choose from eight players, 16 if you cound the DLC L4D characters.\n8 male and 8 female characters from various countires, including an ex Wehrmacht Fighter. So the game really feels like a bunch of people just got together to fight to survive.\n\nAll in all, this is one of my favourite zombie games that exist.\n\n","March 22","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now, I'm reviewing this on the stance that I have played the first two, and replayed them again and again before purchasing this game. Zombie Army Trilogy is a remake/sequel to the surprisingly successful Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army games. This game, while containing remade versions of the first two games, includes and entirely new third chapter. I shall go over the pros and cons, and the final virdict.\n\nPros~\n- The graphics are VERY nice, and compliment the world and atmosphere greatly.\n- The soundtrack is very likeable. It reminds me of those 80s snuff horror films with the synth soundtracks.\n- Gunplay is fantastic. This was a given with a Sniper Elite game.\n- This is a fantastic co-op game. Team up with up to 4 of your friends to take down the zombie menace!\n- Kill Hitler. Zombified. If that's not a selling point, I don't know what is.\n- You can now, unlike the others, play as a female.\n- For some reason, that I'm NOT complaining about, you can play as the Left 4 Dead characters. M'kay.\n- Hours and HOURS of replayability. I went back and was constantly discovering things I didn't see.\n- The brand new Horde mode. Fight of waves of the undead until your eventual downfall!\n\nCons ~\n- The AI is not very smart. The only enemy that will give you any REAL trouble is the Heavys.\n- Voice acting and story is mediocre at best.\n- The full price. $44.99 is not what this game is worth.\n\nFinal Virdict: 8.5/10\nZombie Army Trilogy offers a fun game to play with your friends when you feel like being a hero and taking down both the Nazi and the Zombie regimes. While still suffering from bugs, I personally recommend this game. It's definately fun, and you won't be disappointed, but it's not worth the $44.99 price tag. I suggest picking it up when it is on sale. Have a great day, and thanks for reading!","August 23, 2015","true","22.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055440042/recommended/301640/","76561198055440042","Blasbo Bibbins","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055440042/","120 products in account","A really solid and enjoyable shooter that's given me many hours of entertainment and made me scream every time a zombie moved awkwardly and cost me my fifty kill combo.\n\nThe game has a very nice selection of weapons to choose from. Obviously the focus is the rifles, of which there are plenty of varieties, from the British Lee Enfield which has ten rounds in its magazine and is suited to people like me who can't aim very well, to the powerful Mosin Nagant which packs a punch at the cost of a small mag. The only secondary weapons I have found to be of real worth are shotguns and the panzerfaust however; the submachine guns feel too difficult to control, seem very weak (I seem to pepper even the most basic zombie with half a mag and it won't go down) and are infuriatingly prone to costing you a good combo. At close range you want your pistol out but occasionally they can feel a little lacklustre too, the main exception being the Webley revolver, which destroys zombies nicely.\n\nThe mechanics are fun, challenging and rewarding, especially if you go on the highest difficulty where you really have to adjust your aim to counter the wind and gravity. It's also great when you land a perfect grenade and obliterate fifteen zombies at once, and mildly amusing to watch a few of them stagger around without a head. The x-ray kill cam shots are brutal and make me very happy when I see my bullets mangling skulls and popping organs like balloons.\n\nThe secrets are very well hidden, so much so that I've begun to doubt their existence entirely. This is a good thing as secrets are meant to be challenging to find.\n\nEnemies offer a range of difficulties for you to overcome. Hordes of zombies give plenty of opportunity for massive combos, assuming you can aim better than I can, which shouldn't be hard. The screaming kamikazes that occasionally charge you can prove quite useful in taking out said hordes.The one thing I hate in terms of the enemies is the sniper zombies, who fly around far to liberally and laugh at you in a trolltastic way every time they land a shot and you don't get them. It makes it all the more rewarding when you plug them in the head at 100 plus metres. The slow but purposeful zombie elites provide a target that's just right in terms of toughness: get to close and you're screwed. You may be out of range but it will certainly take more than one headshot to bring him down.\n\nIn terms of horde mode, which is like Nazi Zombies from Call of Duty except third person and a bit harder, don't do it alone unless you're actually half decent at the game. You will get eaten. If you're me, the snipers will troll you to madness. Bring friends who can aim.\n\nIn conclusion, give Rebellion some money and shoot zombies. You will have a lot of fun. This is also the first game since Wolfenstein 3D that I know about that sends you on a mission to kill Hitler. Why have no other developers capitalised on this simple yet absolutely brilliant concept?\n\n\n\n\n","August 20, 2015","true","68.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

While your main weapon was a sniper rifle.(You must have good aim and good graphic card so that the game would not hang and all your shots will miss like crazy)\n\nFor what I like about this game, Firstly, I would really recommend the graphic and the x-ray kill shot but it gets annoying especially when you are fighting with hordes of zombie.\n\nSecondly, There are different zombies in this game which make it more interesting(sucider, normal, skeleton, soldier elite/ chainsaw and fully armoured zombie) but this game will get bored after awhile it became repeated.\n\nThirdly, I would recommend gamers that really like nazi(HITLER FANS) but the finally boss is quite easy in my opinion.\n\nOverall, I would hope that you will enjoy this game as I do.\n","November 26, 2015","true","22.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

This isn't enough maps to play on.\n-The game's mechanics make it so that you rarely use the sniper simulation (bullet drop happens at distances further than you tend to engage zombies at)\n-The lack of stealth makes sniping at range an unlikely event.\n-The price I paid ($15) is too much for the amount and quality of content provided.

Saying it blew COD Nazi zombies out of the water. No. This game is really cool if you like Sniper Elite 3, then take that and turn it into a zombie game. That's what this is.\n\nIt's a pretty cool game so far but the aiming is super annoying. Zombies right in front of me, I shoot point blank in the face, and it hits them in the stomach, or flies over their shoulder. Then there are these boss zombies who I can only assume have indestructble metals in their head because they can for some reason take 50 shots from my rifle straight to the face. Then for some reason my ability to kick zombies seems stronger than all my weapons combined. There is nothing overly special about this game.\n\nLike I said, I really enjoy Sniper Elite 3, so I do enjoy this game, it's just not as good as everyone is claiming it is.","March 8, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And don't forget the World War 2 era themed germany, It's well designed and creepy enough with Bodies and human organs everywhere  and the fogs surrounding the area. The gameplay is not as fast as Left 4 dead's gameplay mechanics, also we play the game in Third person Perspective which is good, giving more feels to your character. The Zombies are slower (yeah, they're walking), but slow doesn't mean that they're easy to kill and harmless, You must shoot them in the head or they'll just ressurect in front of you, And... The amount of zombie here is massive, so always prepare your mines and grenades because you don't want to end up surrounded by them. Most zombie games are virus-related, but here, the zombies are more of a ritual creature, and with the Gothic WW2 germany surroundings, the vibe is creepy and scary.\nAlso, gotta love the music of the game, it's good and catchy. The retro electronic music fits perfectly in the game.\nI recommend this game, It's fun to play alone and much better in co-op, Cheers..","August 25, 2015","true","37.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I miss the abilty to hack zombies apart with a machete or other melee weapon but, most enemies are dead before they get to you if you manage your sniper rifle ammo correctly and make the shots you need to.\nAll in all, a great game and i have only played some of the campaign so far. If you are sick of the usual shooters and would like something like... Day of Defeat meet Left for Dead then this is the game for you.\nRather addictive, just make sure you are wearing headphones or have your sound down or people will think you are speaking in satanic tongues.

Having the first two installments as individual packages not only narrows the amount of players in multiplayer, but also divides the market. I had previously purchased Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie, and I thought this would have all three as separate games. It's actually all three packed into one. The improvements are notable, however, it still seems unfair to those who bought the first games already.\n\nThis game is pretty damn fun, and for the amount of enjoyment it has given me alone I'd recommend this. Even if you own the previous two games already, this one is worth picking up for the modifications in the gore system, and all three campaigns in one. There is a Horde mode I haven't played much of, and so far it didn't seem to offer the same excitement that the campaign does, but I suppose I should hold off on judging that aspec of the game.\n\nIf you like similar games as Killing Floor, this one would easily be among your favorites. Mindless slaughter, although I will say the hitboxes do matter. So not so mindless as you should choose where you shoot your enemies. Head is most effective but you can dismember basically an entire zombie before you put it down. Chop off its legs, its arms, watch it crawl around for awhile, then pop it in the head.","August 26, 2015","true","19.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

From the name and the advertising of the game is not hard to figure that this game has its action set in the last days of the Third Reich where a deluded Hitler has created an army of zombies. The visual quality is great and it makes the player realise not only the horrors of war but also that he is going to have some fun. With 16 characters and a horde mode it is already bringing something extra into the offer, plus if you haven't played the previous games you have all three of them in the package. The music is straight to the point and enhances the situations. The creators have also given you the option of playing the campaign or the horde mode into co-op, in total being four players and for the things not to get boring the number of enemies is increased.\n\nBut there are some negative aspects which are worth mentioning. If you are a fan of games which have a complex story, this is not a game for you as it can turn up pretty boring because the characters do not speak and therefore there is no dialogue, just some recorded tapes in safehouses which give you extra details about the plotline and how the situation has turned from worse to living nightmare. Having played this game quite much I totally recommend it. For me it is 8.5/10.","May 8","true","57.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Only one I have found in the staff side of Rebellion Support is worthy of comment. Don't assume your going to play this game and reach for the star of First Place. There is a serious bug in their database that they cannot figure out. I managed to get to that star, and fall over the edge with a negative 2.1 billion point glitch.\n\nI had to go an unusual route to get the Rebellion staff to wake up, hats off to Paul for kicking them in the pants and getting them to answer my request after 2 months.\n\nI had a goal - now I am not too sure I want to try to dig myself out of an existing hole and climbe up that ladder twice as high.\n\nThe game over all plays pretty decent. There are a few bugs here and there, but overall the game is OK. A team of 4 can have a blast in most situations. take advantage of your surroundings when the time is ripe. There is a coop campaign, which seems very short, and a Horde mode which lacks a good selection of maps.  These can be played on a variety of difficulty levels, whether coop or solo.\n\nI have a unique situation, to become #1 of nearly 200,000 players who have tried this game. I think the respect for such commitment should come from within the manufacturing of the product at hand. Don't shove me an inferior product, then thell me the issue cannot be recreated or fixed. Its not only my issue, there are at least 6 others in the same boat.

Just in the time that I have played, which is 0.7 hrs at this time, there is a bug that should not be attempted. If you are playing full screen, and you minimize your game, [Alt]+[Tab], you will force the mouse on the corner of the screen and when you click, the game will minimize again. You'll have to force close the game at that point. I haven't played a lot, but the game is fun. Just wish the zombies were further away when spawning.\n\nUpdate.\n6.2 hrs played and this game is proving to be rather challenging and there are some free shot moments. Melee kills don't count towards your multiplier. Noticed blood footprints up the walls and ceiling in one building. I've been playing this game on Ultra settings using a GTX 660 with 2Gb VRAM. 99% of the game will run smooth without hickups, depending on what is going on. Not sure if just a little more power is needed or just more VRAM, but the game performs very well. It's not too demanding, so the video card exceeds recommended, but just a hair shallow of Optimal.\n\nUpdate #2.\nAfter completing this game, 21 hrs, the game has been both fun and challenging. I enjoyed it. Was disappointed about the ending, didn't realize it was the end until the credits. I was hoping for more, that's how much I enjoyed it. I've had a second monitor plugged in while playing and for some reason, performance is diminished. When the second monitor goes dark, the game runs better. It's when the second monitor is unplugged that there are more frame issues, but how then do you manage that? The challenges of this game are really impressive. Just on single player I had fun. I'm eager to play this with other people. If you own the older versions, I do recommend getting this game for cooperative play. I did catch an easter egg on one level involving a castle. My only disappointment is the Prologues not autoplaying at their appropriate times during the game. I didn't skip any scenes since I had never seen or played the original versions. Now to try the game on more difficult settings. Maybe later, I'll increase the spawn of zombies.","March 7, 2015","true","30.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Lots of secrets and easter eggs to discover.\n\nIf this game played more with the environment and had more melee options it would rival Resident Evil 4 in the level of fun i extracted from it. On sale its perfectly priced.\n\nThe sniping aspect is wildly exaggerated, if your rifle is not high velocitiy it has massive drop and takes a dozen head shots to kill the MG zombies.\nHigh velocity, however, will rip through a line of undead which is far more entertaining. Why pick anything else?\n\nSide arms suffer from some balance issues also, the polish smg and revolver hands down outclasses any other option.\n\nAnd of course you get a show down with the fuhrer in hell.

Just to turn the difficulty up a few more notches, they also only die from headshots- unless you utterly destroy the body, they will simply resurrect.\n\nIt has campaign and horde modes, but I recommend playing both in multiplayer. It's a lot funner (and easier) to have people alongside to watch your back and help out, as well as provide witty banter.\n\nThe game itself is heavily polished, with great graphics and controls, a dark and tense atmosphere, and fun gameplay.","April 22","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Don't believe the hype.\n\nNegative aspects of the game:\n1. Swaying crosshairs. Unless you hold your breath to steady the crosshairs, you find yourself most of the time "playing" prediction with it.\n2. Uses quick match system so you have no choice of hosts to connect to. It would be nice to select from multiple hosts instead of the game randomly selecting it for you.\n3. Shotgun seems like the only effective close quarter crowd control weapon.\n4. The CTRL aim (hip fire) is absurdly inaccurate. The crosshairs for your secondary and sidearm are spread out that it's a task to perform precision shots. The shots you perform are more prediction than precision.\n5. The hits on the zombies don't have that organic feel. It's like your shooting the wall. It reminds me of playing No More Room in Hell.\n\nThe Left for Dead add-on doesn't even compensate for the poor system of gameplay.\n\nIf you want a good zombie co-op game, get Killing Floor or Left 4 Dead.","August 22, 2015","false","12.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Since the Left 4 Dead characters were added a lot has changed for me!\nAim is all over the place, the rifle which is your primary weapon , looks up at the sky not at the target, if I'm lucky enough to manoeuvre the scope to a target's head , 9/10 times  I will still miss even with focus aim,\nbecause it continues to shake . This also uses up lots of ammo in the process .\nThe Side arm or Pistol's aim is gone too, I aim, the crosshair is on the zombie's head , then I fire , crosshair moves to the left of target , so I end up shooting air , not good when being attacked.\nThe Secondary weapon, the Machine gun, for me in this situation is the best one, but you can't find secondary ammo all the time .\nThe L4D update IMO has upped the difficulty too, especially on Solo mode. There are missions you could not play solo anymore.\nCO-OP is a lot of fun, but if your the one who's weapons don't work, not fun for your team lol.\nCO-OP also has it issues , either the host being booted to lobby or some of your team will be.\nI also think some of the old missions have been removed from the game, I remember not far into the game, playing a cemetery mission where you had to clear it of zombies ,that is not there now.\nThinking that maybe the aiming had something to do with my controller, I played some sniper elite and headshots for days, so the problem is this game.  Would I recommend this game as it now is? No I wouldn't .

One thing I'm sure, many people say it's hard to get people to join in your game. Well, IT IS NOT, I was worried at first but turns out it's not that hard for someone to join in your game. Just start up your own game, soon or later surelly someone will join you. I did host 3 games and within 5 minutes, all my 3 games are full of people. they constantly connect and disconnect though.\n\nBack to the problem at hand, this game does not really pique my interest. I gave it a try but it just doesn't work for me. As a huge KF 2 fan, I thought this will be "almost" the same but well, it doesn't. the first problem is, who will pop zombie heads using sniper rifles? Sure one or two from a distance is awesome, but not if 700 zombies plunging themselves toward you. Using sniper rifles in those kind of situation is just "dull".\n\nSecondly, if that still interests u, well, the control is damn wonky. I mean, super wonky. if you used to play KF 2, you know the control is smooth and when you stop moving your mouse, the crosshair will stop moving. not the case with this game. it gives you "after movement" even after you stop moving your mouse. maybe that's just the rebellion way of engine, i'm not sure. One thing I know, I don't like it.\n\nThirdly, how scarce the ammo is. This, might be hit or miss also. Some people love it because it gives extra pressure on the whole situation, but i like a game which will give u too much ammo to slay thousand zombies. the ammo in this game is damn scarce, and since i like to use my sidearms more than that wonky sniper rifle, it stressed me out.\n\nOverall, I really wanted to explore all the storyline, they look nice, the graphic is also commendable, but the wonky engine (aiming), the ammo scarcity, and the idea for the sniper rifle (i tend to use shotgun/SMG/pistols more) really brings this game down, in my opinion.\n\nIf those things can be fixed, it will be one damn good alternative to KF2.\n\nDid I recommend? personally, no. And it's my mistake not to try the cheaper NZA 1/2 first, I just jumped and bought ZAT. If only I can get a refund..","July 18, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It really seems like fun, but one of the things that sucks about PC gaming is never knowing how well the game is going to place on your PC. You read the reccommended specs and more than meet them, watch gameplay footage and compare the the resolution of the graphics and mechanics vs another game on your PC and try to make a reasonable judgement and fall completely on your face. There's nothing terribly complex or high end in this game, watching videos I thought, oh about resident evil 4 level game mechanics and graphics, I should be able to at the very least play the game smoothly on the lowest settings, but alas no.  So much stutter and lag. I really want to enjoy the game and it seems like fun, but most people probably won't have a high end enough PC to be able to enjoy it so I can't reccommend it.","November 10, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

What kept me playing so long was the graphics, which are quite lovely, and the slow-motion, head-'sploding kill cam stuff.   Ultimately, after 18 hours, I have no wish to play it anymore.  I did boot it up when they introduced the Left for Dead characters but that was hardly a big update.  Why aren't there more guns?  That would be the single easiest and most effective aspect to change to actually add some form of variety to the gameplay, instead of having five rifles that all feel the same, and five machine guns that all feel the same, and three handguns you'll never use because two are just a tad better.\n\nSo, fun for a while, and not without potential, but burns out fast.","January 22","false","18.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

And, most importantly, the co-op multiplayer is downright empty.\n\nThe rifles feel more or less the same (some have better zoom or faster rate of fire), there is no heavy hitting option with a lower ammo supply, for example. Yes, the original game is all about landing long-distance headshots, but this one is about routinely killing lots of zombies.\n\nThere are basically four types of enemies - the common zombie - takes 2-3 shots to the chest to die, the skeleton - dies to a single shot or kick, the suicide bomber - runs at you, but drops dead from single shot and the machinegunner - takes quite a few headshots to kill while you backpedal around.\n\nThe tasks. again, all rely on killing everything. I have not seen any stealth segments requiring you to kill enemies only with headshots or any situations that would require strategy. It's all about shooting center mass. And there are a lot of targets to shoot.\n\nIf you want a good experience you should bring many friends and few expectations.","March 27, 2015","false","16.6"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","12","27","0","0"

Successfully combined elements of Left for Dead and Sniper Elite make for a fun and rewarding experience. The game can be equally fun solo as it can be with others playing with you, allowing you to test your skills against multiple campaign missions; each getting progressivly more challenging. Although some areas were difficult to solo, I managed to complete all missions available, and what fun it was! I reccomend anyone who is a fan of Left or Dead or Sniper Elite to pick it up. It is an excellent package that provides many hours of longevity.\n\nAdditional Note:\nThe game does suffer from poor optimization in certain areas.

It says there are three games... no there isn't. It's more episodes. Highly overpriced, I mean to the point of how are they getting away with this false advertising? Screw this company...\n\nIT IS ONE GAME. Don't be fooled by the text... because you think there would be some regulation and someone could sue them, or you could get a refund for the blatant lies. But you can't... because it's only 30$ when it should have been 5$\n\nThe gameplay isn't great either, it's not the worst but it isn't done very well. Ammo is scarce, it has redundant weapons that don't show you anything different and barely any difference in them anyway. Some are so overpowered it is pointless to use anything else. Ammo is the most annoying part of the game, they give you 3 weapons though so you never run out, it just sucks to use anything else. So the game winds up being annoying to play when you have to use a weapon you don't like. Not like there is any reason to play the game because there is not much of a story, all you do is kill zombies and hitler shows up and you kill him. The End.

This is like Dark Souls, with no armor, no health recovery mechanic (that I have found yet), no dodge and really crappy guns. You have a half-♥♥♥♥♥ melee kick you can attempt, but it only reaches about 75% as far as zombies, so if you are in range to use it it's likely 3-5 are in range to hit you. I can't even figure out why the L4D chars were attached to this mess. Excessively linear "story" mode. I've never played a game on such rigid rails. I think multiplayer could be fun if you know people, but don't expect to get in a PUG game. Everything I've read actually says the multiplayer servers are empty when there isn't a sale filling them with new suckers. Movement controls feel like your character is neck deep in quick sand, aiming is laborious and spastic at the best of times and god help you if anything gets inside of 10 meters because the close range weapons are garbage.\n\nThe environments are immersive and kinda pretty really, but the game mechanics shove it all out the window. This is a $5 game from that bargain rack by the checkout at your bookstore. Pay no more than that, ever. The only reason I'm not filling out a refund form right now is my very slim hope that maybe some day, years from now, some great modder will  make a L4D total conversion lol.

If yes, then this game is for you.\n\nThe thing I like the most is how much more real it feels, and the headshots required to kill the zombies. Unlike in L4D/L4D2 where you can run in all guns blazing and get the mission over and done with, this actually requires a bit more skill and effort, and I think it's great! It takes a little bit of getting used to, but the function keys are almost the same as L4D/L4D2. The only different thing that took getting used to was the walking around, I always bump into things, but after a few minutes of playing, it gets easier.\n\nAlso suggest playing it with a group of 3-4 people. The more people you have, the more zombies you get! Just way more fun with more people in my opinion. I prefer to play games with others anyway! Makes the game more enjoyable. :)\n\nDefinitely recommend this game to anyone who is bored of playing L4D/L4D2.","January 2","true","4.3"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

When I got the 1st Zombie Army a couple of years ago I used to have trouble doing headshots because of the way the Zombies move back and forth. After playing through Sniper Elite 3 I seem to have gotten a lot better. I use the 3rd difficulty level. On long shots it actually shows you where to aim. I looked for a way to turn it off but I couldn't find one. It actually helps because there are places where you have more than one snipers you have to deal with at a time. There was plenty of ammo and more exploding barrels than I needed to get rid of masses of Zombies. I recommend this game to any Sniper Elite or Zombie fans. This game just became on of my very best games and I have over 100 games. The only way it could have been better is if you could save the game at will like you can with Sniper Elite 3. One of the best things about this series for me is that I bought some of the DLCs with extra weapons. I play single player only. These rifles are available in the solo mode also, as well as Multiplayer.  A bit of advice. Don't try to just hold a position! Keep moving around! When they start getting too close just run away for a bit and then stop and pick them off as they come to you. There is plenty of explosive material laying around to kill them with also.","March 10, 2015","true","80.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though when i saw that if you had one or both of the previous games the price was reduced by a third or two, which went to lengths to sate that disappointment. Then i was worried about the gameplay. I play on a laptop that was very far from being made for gaming and the first two games ran like ♥♥♥♥ on it. I loved the first two i just wish there had been better gameplay quality. I started up the first game in the pack and was immediately shocked as to how much better it ran! Not only that, but there was far more zombie variety! There are few things in these games that i thought could be improved, and this is definitely an improvement on all fronts.\n\n\nGameplay: 27/30\nGraphics: 7/10\nReplay Value: 6/10\nZombie Killing Fun: 50/50\nOverall: 90/100","March 13, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you haven't played the first two Nazi Zombie Army games, don't bother, just play this version instead. The original two games are included, with some nice improvements. But if you have already played them, this is still worth picking up as you'll get improved versions of the first two, the 3rd installment, and the new horde mode.\n\nThe game works fine as a single-player experience, but it really shines in co-op. My friends and I have played the first two and jumped on this new release. Take that into consideration though when purchasing and consider talking some friends into attacking the undead hordes with you. It definitely gets grindy if you are looking to 100% the achievements, but is still a fun co-op experience.","April 6, 2015","true","36.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first two chapters have been updated with better graphics. Playing them is fun even though they show their age. The third chapter is the main attraction of the package and is the best of the 3.\n\nThe gore has been fantasticly done and is very enjoyable blowing bits off zombies, especially blowing a zombie in half which I found highly entertaining. X-Ray killcam is as good as ever and adds to the feel that you're actually shooting them.\n\nGameplay is a mixture from Sniper Elite V2, 3 and both the NZA games. One thing I noticed was that the SMG's feel less powerful, taking me at least two shots to blow off a zombies head compared to one shot from the previous games often resulting in having to resort to the shotgun for a decent chance of survival. Bit of a shame in my eyes as I really enjoyed using SMG's in the aforementioned NZA games. What is a shame is that the cover system has been completley removed which leaves you vunerable to snipers and super elites, but is slightly lessened by the stomp feature which will certainly save your hide!\n\nHoard mode is a complete blast, highly enjoyable and better when played with friends. Similar to COD's zombie mode with the exception of being more of a challenge rather than just a simple run and gun. A very welcome addition that will provide much entertainment.\n\nThe enemies are what I personally feel make this game. The snipers add the challenge of getting them while trying to deal with the other undead. The elites are more dangerous being able to tear apart your team in seconds if not careful, more so with the Chainsaw Elite which proves a challenge and requires thought before taking him on. Skeletons compliment the bog standard zombies being very easy to deal with (a swift kick deals with them!)\n\nIn summary, is this game worth it? Hell yes! The experience is better in co-op than solo. Generally a well rounded package that will provide hours of fun. Kudos to Rebellion for their efforts in producing this game.","March 6, 2015","true","66.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original two titles in the Sniper Elite spinoff series had their ups and downs, but Zombie Army Trilogy takes all the best elements and throws them in a blender, giving them better play mechanics, better graphics and a much more enjoyable overall experience.  Sure, this looks and plays mostly like the originals, but you'll quickly find that a lot has changed, and for the better.  Zombie models are more varied and unique, and nearly all get much better coats of paint.  Enemy balancing has been improved, giving you a fair shot against opportunistic zombie snipers, while toning down the strength of enemies like skeletons, to make them more realistic.  One of the best new features of the game is the good ol' boot that you use to kick enemies away.  No longer a means to give you some breathing room, the kick is now a damaging move that gives you an edge during combat.  A single kick will knock a zombie back (with some enhanced physics, I might add) and chance a kill, or you can kick a zombie when he's down to finish him off by footballing his head across the pavement.  It's a great feature.  The presentation of the game is now more polished, and feels more like a story with appropriate titling and captioning during cutscenes where needed.\n\nAlso introduced in Z.A.T. is a new Horde mode, similar to the survival challenge mode seen in Sniper Elite V3.  Playing in the church was a game of run and shoot, until later levels started packing the cramped hallways with armored and MG42 zombies, forcing me to run every few seconds.  Definitely a difficult mode!  As usual, weapons and tactics play a huge part in your survival.  Setting traps at appropriate locations can maximize your chances of survival, and knowing the layout of your surroundings is absolutely crucial, as zombie hordes can emerge from any direction.\n\nSure, it's a simplistic and potentially repetitive title, but I love the Nazi Zombie Army games, and "Trilogy" brings them together in the best version of the game so far.  I haven't yet hit the third chapter of the game, but I'm looking forward to seeing what's to come!  Here's to hoping that the game sells well, and Multiplayer gets a shot in the arm.  There's far too few people playing the original two games, and that's a shame.  Co-op on this game is a blast!\n\nDefinitely a YES for me.","March 6, 2015","true","43.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is supposedly a new engine but the only difference I've noticed is the inclusion of dismemberment and reduced strength of submachine guns.\n\nThere are 15 lengthy levels that takes Karl, the star of Sniper Elite V2, and 3 other playable characters through Zombie cursed Nazi Germany.\n\nPros:\n==================\n+Intense gory zombie action; maintains the formula of the older 2 cult-classic titles with new content and improved gore effects\n+LOTS of zombies to shoot at\n+Variety of elite or "guardian" zombies, ranging from machine gun-wielding brutes to chainsaw-swinging maniacs\n+Amazing graphical detail in the level environments\n+Great atmosphere\n+Works well for solo and co op play\n+The 80's synth-style soundtrack compliments the horror vibe nicely\n==================\n\nCons:\n==================\n-Unnecessarily long "survive the assult/seige" sections feel like padding\n-There are a few frustratingly and punishingly difficult fights (especially in the final level) involving HORDES of elite bullet--spongy (and sometimes endless respanwning) zombies in narrow close quarters\n-The submachine guns feel less powerful than the separate NZA games\n==================\n\nI would give this game an 7/10 rating.\n\n==========\nFinal thoughts\n==========\nBased on my Pros and Cons I would have given it a 8/10, but when I have second thoughts about my playthrough, I am not exaggerating when I say the final level contains frustrating difficulty spikes that are near torture.  Granted, the bigger the challenge the greater the satisfaction upon beating it, but I really have no desire to play that level ever again, zombie Hitler or not.\n\nI would recommend buying this game when it is on sale (such as now up til April 3, 2015) to get the most bang for your buck.  You will have fun playing it alone and with your friends for a while with this one.","March 7, 2015","true","33.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want more weapons and maps to play, you have to buy every single DLC. In the ZA spin-off series, there are no DLC. Every single weapon and map are available from the get-go.\n-New characters: Each of the four playable characters now have a female counterpart. Perfect if you're a gamer girl or if your favorite character is taken and you are ok to settle with the next-best. These are not rule 63 version of the characters however: They wear similar clothing but have their own faces, hairstyles and character backgrounds.\n-The full campaigns from the first two games plus new third story all in one game. No more swapping between ZA 1 & 2 in order to find a game to play.\n-New "Horde" Mode: Every game of this genre needs a survival mode. Pick one of five maps where you fight against endless waves of increasing zombies for as long as you can. Three of these maps are based on areas from the first ZA game, the other two are completely original.\n-The previous two campaigns have been slightly remastered. By this I mean it uses the more polished graphics of ZAT and SE3 as well as the changes ZAT made to how some zombies work.\n-In conjunction with the above point, we have some tweaking done with zombies. Whether this sounds like a pro or con is up to you: Zombies such as the burning ones summoned by a Fire Elite are no longer simply standard zombies on fire: They are faster and turn into ash upon killed or coming into contact with you (which deals dmg to the player) but are all killed with a single hit from any weapon. Skeletons have been given a visual update, they are now more detailed, but they are also weaker. They can be killed with a single kick. The exclusion is the new armored skeletons who appear in late medieval or early renaissance plate armor: It takes several hits with standard weapons to chip it off, but once the heart is exposed, they can be one-shot like all other skeletons.\n-New types of zombies: everything from standard zombies with Lugers and MP40's and an inherent Stormtrooper accuracy (geddid? Nazis - Stormtroopers?) to the aforementioned skeletal knights or the weaksauce Armored Elite all the way up to the horrifying Chainsaw Elite (this guy makes all the other elites feel normal).\n-Tweaked combat mechanics: You can now dismember zombies, making them easy to pick off when they crawl at you without legs or lash out at you with little stumps instead of arms. SMG's and the shotgun has had their dmg "nerfed" in order to balance it out with the improved kick mechanic: Kicking is now much more important and usable: you can kick all standard zombies down and then kick again to stomp their heads. This is often more prudent as it can be more time and ammo efficient to pick off stragglers or escape from clusters. It's also the most efficient way to deal with skeletons.\n-Improved arsenal: No more swapping between grenades. Instead of two stielhandgranates and frag grenades each, you know can carry up to four stiels instead. The shotgun has been nerfed down to the level of the other secondaries, but it and the Webley revolver have been added to the standard loadout. Yay! The Panzerfaust and the Preacher remains as the biggest dmg-dealers to be found across the maps.\n\nBut of course there is no completely perfect game, so here are the "cons" that I feel needs to be addressed\n\n-The inability to "cover". In the other ZA and SE games, you can use the "cover" mechanic to press yourself against a flat surface, keep your head down and only "pop out" when aiming for a shot. This was a key function to dealing with zombie snipers and machinegun elites. I have no idea why they removed this function. It's not a deal-breaker for me, but it's definitely a bad move on the developers part and a "con". It's not like they ever FORCED you to take cover, it was your tactical/strategic choice to either duck and cover or run-and-gun. Or play/shoot in anyway you want really.\nYou can technically still simply crouch behind an object and hope the MG/sniper guy will miss you, but it's nowhere near a substitute for being to "cover" almost anywhere where there are walls or objects with flat surfaces.\n-Bugs/glitches that were carried over: For instance, on the terminal map from the second ZA installment there was an area before the finale where lots of skeletons are buried in the walls. These are prone to hovering in the air right next to the walls, an issue they didn't fix when they ported and "remastered" the 2nd campaign into ZAT. On the same level, at the finale, another issue they didn't fix when porting was that it is impossible to pick up some of the ammo satchels on the bridge during the finale. Tsk tsk Rebellion!\n-The camera angle is still awkward when it comes to picking up items or aiming/turning around when "downed" (when you are hurt to much you fall down and are only able to use your pistol until you either bleed out or someone rescues you. Zombies can keep hitting you until you're barely conscious and unable to do anything but wait). being able to look directly "up" when a zombies is teabagging you is still messed up and thus making you quite unable to shoot his balls off.\nYou'd think that after three games they would have fixed things you the camera could recognize that you are looking at THAT specific weapon and not the one right next to it, or at nothing at all really, preventing the option to pick something up from triggering at all. But nope. Annoying, but not a deal-breaker to me, because I don't really swap to a new weapon at every saferoom.\n-Throughout the franchise, kills are awarding you points. The more kills you get in better ways (headshots, explosives etc) without missing (increasing your combo chain) grants more points. This is a terrifying double-edged sword: While it's nice to feel the satisfaction of improving your own score, it makes the Multiplayer aspect more competitive and less cooperative, which is technically bad for a survival co-op shooter based on teamwork. People WILL fight you for getting kills and WILL ninja-steal "your" kills, stealing "your" score and breaking your combo-chain, instead of playing the game 100% strategically/tactically and use teamwork for the best results. Of course, this all depends on who you're playing with, but it WILL happen to you, because it happens to everyone.\nAlso, kicking/stomping kills only award points against skeletons, but not against any other kind, for some inconsistent reason.\n-Woefully overpriced. While this game is tons of fun and the "pros" HEAVILY outweigh the "cons", unless you have the money and/or is itching to get it, this game is not worth 42 Euros. 20 should be enough. I got it cheaply because the pre-order for those who owned the first two games chopped the price down by 60%, but sadly that discount was pre-order only. Even if you have one or both of the previous installments, you're screwed if you didn't pre-order. Now the game HAS been on sale once or twice, so if you're not willing to fork out more dosh, keep an eye out for these sales.\nThe bloated pricetag of this game sadly backfires for Rebellion: The playerbase would be much larger if the game was priced in accordance for it's fair value, and thus they would earn more dosh from each "copy" sold anyway. We can only hope that the company eventually learns the basic rules of marketing.\n\nAll in all, this is a great game, and if you feel like this is something for you, I definitely recommend this game for you. Even if you're like me and don't hold any special interest in zombies over other things, but love WW2-era and co-op games :3","May 17, 2015","true","54.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun to sink time into, but don't expect innovation or reinvention here. With that said, though, I do think it's a game worth picking up if you like these kind of games or are even curious as to how the game is.\n\nI didn't have any performance issues like other reviewers did, so I can't complain there. But, the graphics are pretty much the same as the other Zombie Army games. Though, what good are graphics if the game isn't good?\n\nAs a game, it's a fun experience that is even better when played with friends. Going back to the arcade comparison, you are scored at the end of each mission. You can rack up points by slaying the undead in various ways. You can also find collectible gold bars and bottles for your end-mission results. The simplistic yet fun gameplay, and the pre-game loadout screen make getting such scores even more fun.\n\nOne thing I personally wasn't sure of was the soundtrack. I don't know what exactly, but some sound queues and songs just didn't seem to fit in with the game. Just a personal grievence, though.\n\nIf you plan on buying this game, it would not hurt to wait for it to go on sale.\n\nLike I said, the game has this charming arcade feel that I love, but that could be an aquired taste. I'd say if your interested in this game, pick it up (or wait 'til it goes on sale), grab some friends, and have a good time.\n\n10/10 would MLG collateral headshot 4 zombies again.","March 11, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original two titles in the Sniper Elite spinoff series had their ups and downs, but Zombie Army Trilogy takes all the best elements and throws them in a blender, giving them better play mechanics, better graphics and a much more enjoyable overall experience.  Sure, this looks and plays mostly like the originals, but you'll quickly find that a lot has changed, and for the better.  Zombie models are more varied and unique, and nearly all get much better coats of paint.  Enemy balancing has been improved, giving you a fair shot against opportunistic zombie snipers, while toning down the strength of enemies like skeletons, to make them more realistic.  One of the best new features of the game is the good ol' boot that you use to kick enemies away.  No longer a means to give you some breathing room, the kick is now a damaging move that gives you an edge during combat.  A single kick will knock a zombie back (with some enhanced physics, I might add) and chance a kill, or you can kick a zombie when he's down to finish him off by footballing his head across the pavement.  It's a great feature.  The presentation of the game is now more polished, and feels more like a story with appropriate titling and captioning during cutscenes where needed.\n\nAlso introduced in Z.A.T. is a new Horde mode, similar to the survival challenge mode seen in Sniper Elite V3.  Playing in the church was a game of run and shoot, until later levels started packing the cramped hallways with armored and MG42 zombies, forcing me to run every few seconds.  Definitely a difficult mode!  As usual, weapons and tactics play a huge part in your survival.  Setting traps at appropriate locations can maximize your chances of survival, and knowing the layout of your surroundings is absolutely crucial, as zombie hordes can emerge from any direction.\n\nSure, it's a simplistic and potentially repetitive title, but I love the Nazi Zombie Army games, and "Trilogy" brings them together in the best version of the game so far.  I haven't yet hit the third chapter of the game, but I'm looking forward to seeing what's to come!  Here's to hoping that the game sells well, and Multiplayer gets a shot in the arm.  There's far too few people playing the original two games, and that's a shame.  Co-op on this game is a blast!\n\nDefinitely a YES for me.","March 6, 2015","true","43.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is supposedly a new engine but the only difference I've noticed is the inclusion of dismemberment and reduced strength of submachine guns.\n\nThere are 15 lengthy levels that takes Karl, the star of Sniper Elite V2, and 3 other playable characters through Zombie cursed Nazi Germany.\n\nPros:\n==================\n+Intense gory zombie action; maintains the formula of the older 2 cult-classic titles with new content and improved gore effects\n+LOTS of zombies to shoot at\n+Variety of elite or "guardian" zombies, ranging from machine gun-wielding brutes to chainsaw-swinging maniacs\n+Amazing graphical detail in the level environments\n+Great atmosphere\n+Works well for solo and co op play\n+The 80's synth-style soundtrack compliments the horror vibe nicely\n==================\n\nCons:\n==================\n-Unnecessarily long "survive the assult/seige" sections feel like padding\n-There are a few frustratingly and punishingly difficult fights (especially in the final level) involving HORDES of elite bullet--spongy (and sometimes endless respanwning) zombies in narrow close quarters\n-The submachine guns feel less powerful than the separate NZA games\n==================\n\nI would give this game an 7/10 rating.\n\n==========\nFinal thoughts\n==========\nBased on my Pros and Cons I would have given it a 8/10, but when I have second thoughts about my playthrough, I am not exaggerating when I say the final level contains frustrating difficulty spikes that are near torture.  Granted, the bigger the challenge the greater the satisfaction upon beating it, but I really have no desire to play that level ever again, zombie Hitler or not.\n\nI would recommend buying this game when it is on sale (such as now up til April 3, 2015) to get the most bang for your buck.  You will have fun playing it alone and with your friends for a while with this one.","March 7, 2015","true","33.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The bullet cam feature, which shows your bullet in slow motion as it passes through an enemy on longer range kill shots, is extremely satisfying, as there are quite a few zombie movement patterns, and their heads don't stay level like in many shooters, they flex and bob, and this makes head shots feel like a great accomplishment, even when you're continually making them.\n\nStrategy figures into the game a ton as well. The game regularly puts you in "defense" type situations, where you're at a location and you just have to survive until all the enemies are dead, and in these situations use of non-typical weaponry, like land mines, trip wires, and dynamite (which you have to shoot to detonate), makes or breaks your success.\n\nThe guns. They all feel pretty different, but none seems especially superior or inferior to me compared with others. I find this impressive when you're mostly limited to a rifle, an SMG (or one of two shotguns), and a pistol.","May 20, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Should this prove dull, you can shoot NAZI ZOMBIES in the face with SMGs, ARs, pistols, or, if you are feeling particularly inventive, you can blow the NAZI ZOMBIES apart using grenades, trip mines, or other barrels of boom lying around the place.\n\nIf you're lonely, you can gang up with up to three other human players to destroy the NAZI ZOMBIES, just like Left 4 Dead.  Except that you're shooting NAZI ZOMBIES and not Infected, and there is no AI director to spam more hordes at you, making ZAT more methodical and, you know, snipery.\n\nAs a bonus, you occasionally get to see, in gruesome detail, what one of your nicer shots does to the innards of a NAZI ZOMBIE.  It usually involves multiple wisdom tooth removal via a 7.62mm chunk of lead.  Unlike ZAT's parent game, you aren't specifically told that you wiped out Johan's tonsils, kidneys, and left testicle with one shot, but Sniper Elite is all about being a psycho bell-tower wannabe and ZAT is all about graves registration.\n\nStuff like graphics controls blah blah blah are all fine.  My $11 was well spent.  I wish I had bought this prior to buying ZOMBI (for $20).  ZOMBI looked liked ♥♥♥ and pretended to have a story.  ZAT looks far better and cheerfully brushes the "story" aside in favor of atmospheric 80s John Carpenter music.\n\nI would have liked the game to let me know best score I've ever achieved on a level, rather than just display the my latest score.  Not showing this is a weird thing for what basically amounts to a score-attack game.\n\nThumbs up.","August 23, 2015","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
