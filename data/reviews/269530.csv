Items are great and bring a fresh air to this kind of game, the only problem is that some fights became longuer and more complicate if you use all items availiable.\nAs an example 2 items gives you health, and 1 item, the most expensive, gives you the ability to nuke the map and kill everybody. All items have a cooldown but in general the more bolts or gold you have the better the chances you have to best your opponent.\n\nIn the main menu you can buy gear, see your level status, your global stats and a browser to find matchs or even do some "jobs" to gain few bolts.\nTheses jobs are not in-game missions. You see a progression bar near the name of the mission: Kill rats, escort scientists, ect... with a required amount of time. You can't fight during jobs, so you have to wait for the result and it last for hours. The shortest ( 30 mins): "Killing Rats" gives you 4 bolts, the longuest (8 hours) is "Exploring the Zone" and gives you 150 bolts . This system is not bad but forces to plan exactly when you will be back on the game. The job continues even if you're offline but all the progress will be lost if you cancel it to play a game !\n\nGold can be scavenged if you log on the game often (like Warframe log bonuses), if you win a match or get a new level. Gold serve most of the time to buy weapons, ammo and valuable items.\nthere is always a way to spend some bolts if you're short on gold but the gear won't be the best.\n\n\nYou gain experience by killing players, it unlocks new levels and of course new gear to slaughter in mass. A good aspect of the item store is (contrary to the very bad Counter Strike Nexon), ammo upgrades are granted forever and there is no time limitation for weapons.\n\n\nBut this is not a clone of Stalker, there is no story, no different characters.\n\nYou start with an uggly skin, maybe the most usefull i've ever found on a fps.\nIt's a man who has blond hair and a head band, to be fast: as if you had a target on the head...\nThe chacracters have strange  movements and ways to hold their weapons, like in the inventory where the dummy you have to try you cloths holds a rifle in front of him but it doesn't aim straight.\nYou can customize them, you can even buy a femal skin or masks.\nThe problem is: nearly all players doesn't change the skin of their characters. I choosed a dark cap and a dark armor and surprisingly... i was shot down quite rarely.\nAnd i'm not saying i have amazing skills in fps, read the following.\n\n\nFIGHTS:\n\nMy pc for gaming is out of order, so i downloaded the game on my 5 years old laptop.\nAnd the game is very slow. It's so slow that some times i just cannot shoot right in front of me.\nSo okay it's my problem and i assume it.\n\nBut with an average ping of 70, i was deadly even with the basic sniper rifle. From lvl 1 to lvl 8 i had the upper hand (the 11/20/2014 after 5 hours on the game: I'm number 4 in the global ranking with 267 headshots for 465 kills so i've done around 57% kills with headshots... ). Fights are extremely boring. People are rushing mindlessly on enemy spawns and runs around players until their 4 secs of invincibility finish. In general when they doesn't fire at each other, players spams grenades everywhere to have at least one kill (you have 5 grenades, on a regular game with 10 players... you can imagine how "noisy" it can be sometimes). Even if the game gives special items such as traps or ways to summon beats and anomalies, spawn camping and sniping are too much rewarding. Mutants are uggly, they are far from the ones of Stalker except the pig, and it's the same for anomalies.\n\n\nAn example of a basic fight: behind a crate you explode dozens of heads, raise your mp5 or better when a dude rushes at you, throw grenades everywhere when you respawn in the bad spot. Continue that until you get a next level.\nOH ! ! !\nI was close to forgot that you have a radar to locate players and when somebody is close to you, you see his name with his health under floating trough walls and ceilings. You can't disable it !\n\n\nBut the worst is coming...\n\n4 different game modes: Death Match, Team Death Match, Capture the Flag, Zombie.\nYou can host 10 or 16 players and you can enable or disable loadouts for players. Change the duration or select one of the few maps available (around 16 inspired of Stalker: Good point !).\nYou can choose 2 global lobby, lvl 1 - lvl 8 players, you start quite at ease. Sniping safely blond heads all the time and laughing when grenades are falling everywhere...\nAnd when you are at level 8, you can buy new cool gear but your new lobby is:\nLvl 8- to ..... LVL 60 !!!!!\n\nOf course you can't give a level limit to the game you create.\nAnd it's obvious that when you enter a game you are slaughtered by bigger levels in exoarmors (the best gives you 170 hp, nearly 2 times the basic health without other upgrades) and of course heavy gear that kills you in one shot. The funny thing with theses players, quite smart in fact, they camp your spawn and farm you.\nFrankly i would do the same but there is not fun to grind 52 levels by this method...\nEspecially in a game like this.\n\nBecause, Like Counter Strike Nexon, they dared to put a zombie mode.\nIn the first lobby, you are infected by a virus, it gives you 6000 hp and if you kill a human (with your 2 uggly arms that shakes as if you were dumb) he becames like you. Humans can shoot at you to slow you  or, with luck and and tons of ammo, to kill you. In general zombies wins due to overpowered stats. Allready annoying things turn bad when you go to the second lobby.\nEven with 6000 hp, human takes you down so quickly that you have no ways to do something.\n\n\nAdd to that the fact that nobody talks to you in english.\nIt's is like as a stupid guy who said during a game on TF2: "I have the right to say fu''' you without any reasons. Enjoy the magic of the internet !".\nBut frankly even on a game like Armed Assault where Russian and Ukrainian are numerous, they try at least to speak to you and the game is much deeper !\n\nSo you laugh in the first lobby in front of such a messy game and when you are cursed to level up and go to the second one... you cry. Maybe it's the voice they are talking about in the title...\n\n\nTO CONCLUDE :\n\nThis game may have potential, if they really work to stick to a universe and a gameplay like the Stalker we know.\n\n26/04/2015\n\nReview update: They've added some new weapon skins and gave more balance to the second lobby (apparently) however the game is still buggy and the most important: boring. I've joined a game and like few months ago it's the same awfull player base and poor gameplay. Heavy machine guns that kills from 100 meters, or mindless rushs to the enemy spawn and being unable to counter attack because they have a clear view on you.... I only played 15 mins because i couldn't endure more.\nLike the fact that they've kept the radar or the name floating above player models.\n\nAfter 5 month nothing changed.\n\nVoice of Pripyat is boring, uggly and punishing.\nThis is not a game, it's a torture... don't buy this game at any cost !\n\nN.B: I want to say again that this version has no item shop, you pay for the title and the rest in unlockable via in-game play (contrary to the browser version).","November 20, 2014","false","8.7"," 280 of 311 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","280","311","5","5"

I don't even know what else needs to be said. It is not related to the STALKER franchise in any way and you'll easily get outclassed by anyone who spends money on it or has played it for an extended amount of time, because nothing is for free. The graphics don't help either, they remind me of Half Life 1, and it's not even a tactical shooter because you can see anyone's health bar and name when you are anywhere near them, even through walls. What is the point of that? It is also very crash happy, and the game modes are sub-standard. If you like this kind of game, you can at least do better and find one that only has the in-game purchases, but allows you to at least start playing w/o shelling out ten bucks on this piece of garbage. My word. The worst part is that nothing indicates the developers have any interest in improving anything about this game but the ingame store itself.\n\nHere is some gameplay footage if you want to see more:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soWtJDiuzBI","November 20, 2014","false","1.2"," 218 of 248 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","218","248","3","26"

It's sells itself as a "3D first-person shooter in a post-apocalyptic world. Zombies, anomalies, huge maps, intense realtime battles!" Well it's not, First off it's just a port of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ web browser game with the same name. Second it looks like something a 9th grader made as an assignement. Graphics are horrible, game is unoptimizied and the "art" is just something that the developer bought off unity store. The dev even stole the artwork from Stalker; I'm pretty sure that's illegal.\n\nI wanted to believe this had any resemblence to stalker what-so-ever but it does not. Don't be as foolish as me. Don't buy this horrible web-game.\n\nBuy Survarium instead.\n\n1/10","November 27, 2014","false","2.5"," 103 of 120 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","103","120","2","0"

I wouldn't really call that massive, but it's early access so who knows.  but being a facebook game, I don't see them making a true MMO out of this on a grand scale but if they could get the maps 20 times bigger and add tons more users it might start to feel like one.  to me I would say a game that has an inventory system, experience points and levels to have RPG-like characteristics, not MMO-like.  or maybe any RPG where you can play with your friends is an MMO, I'm not really up to speed with the lingo.  maybe there are lots of huge maps but i played 3 matches and 'quick match' at the top always brings you to the same map.  will check back again!\n\n- lots of potential.\n\n- there seem to be a lot of users already because of facebook.  this is a good thing because games are basically dead when no one plays online.  this game has that huge advantage where there is always people playing.  hopefully they can add some graphical abilities to the Steam-user side of things because the graphics seem toned down to the point where it looks like it was rendered in a browser.  I think they could do that though.  being the first day of release on Steam, I can't expect that to be done yet.  if they can't do that, then it's pretty much a bad facebook game that happens to be on Steam.  the graphics have a bit of a charm to them too, like if you wanted to play goldeneye-on-N64 graphics in an online FPS, this is a very well-functioning example of that.\n\n- I can't see people on steam having access to so many FPS games sit down and actually play this game because of the gaming experience isn't a fraction of what you would get for your $10 elsewhere.  but I totally understand, it's far done and I am glad to contribute towards the end result.\n\n- i've changed my review to negative.  i didn't like the idea of posting a negative review on launch day but maybe that would have been the better thing to do.  is is a pretty bad game overall, but like I mentioned earlier, they could turn it around with a budget, it could be a niche for those who want a budget fps.  the RPG-like elements are relatively unique.","November 20, 2014","false","2.5"," 110 of 137 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","110","137","2","3"

YOU CAN PLAY IT FOR FREE ON FB.\n\nDecember 2015 edit I contacted the developer and he asured me the game is not dead, but being built on. He announced that "the game will be taken up to steam standards". Wait for those changes before buying, or play free on Facebook.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Ugly graphics. Like, REALLY ugly, the textures don't feel to belong toghether, sometimes they are not even in the same scale. Many objects in some maps still miss textures.\n\n-Terrible animations. Can't stress this enought. "Running" seems more like skating, the "reloading animation" is non existant. The character's don't even hold their guns straight (which afects aiming).\nEDIT 05 JAN 2015 This has been adressed, and there's new animations for a couple of weapons (knife and AK47), but it's a long way from fixing the game. A step in the right direction, none the less.\n\n-Lame gameplay. Just a deatmatch game with a zombie twist. But the zombies are akward to play and really badly animated.\n\n-Weird ballistic. Weapons don't feel very real, it's not easy to aim, some weapons don't shoot straight. (For real).\n\n-Fully featured "pay-to-win" store, with 2 currencies (gold and bolts).\n\n-A port of a browser game YOU CAN PLAY FOR FREE. I'll advice you to try that, or wait for future releases, before buying.\n\nI'm going to post in the forums my general views on the game, and if the programer improves it, I'll change my review.","December 1, 2014","false","5.1"," 70 of 84 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","70","84","0","13"

Like REALLY bad. I feel bad for getting it, in a bundle, that cost $2 total (so like 50 cents for this game).\n\nThe game might be early access but that doesn't excuse how horrible it is, this doesn't seem like early access, this seems like "First playable rough", like they threw it together as fast as possible with as little effort as possible and are trying to sell it.\n\nCould it be a good game later on down the line? MAYBE, highly doubtful. There's almost no animations, the textures look like straight PS1 rips, the UI is badly done, the matchmaking is bad and laggy, the maps are tiny and empty and thus, bad.\n\nStay away, wait until the game comes out of early access, it MIGHT be a decent game, but so far it's not looking like it.","April 14, 2015","false","0.2"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","28","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketsurgery/recommended/269530/","rocketsurgery","rocketsurgeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketsurgery/","3787 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game seems to be little more than an attempt at a cash grab. On the one hand, you are expected to pay for the game, but then, once you start playing it, it turns out its no different from any number of F2P games with in-game cash shops, and while it is possible to earn the in-game currency through play, we all know that in practice, not paying real money for the in-game currency for equipment and consumables will put you at a huge disadvantage against those who do.\n\nNow, I do say "attempt" above, because there is one, um, redeeming quality that will probably save you from the temptation of throwing good money after bad, once you've purchased the game and started it, and that is the fact that the game is terrible. Poorly implemented with what looks like generic assets, most players will quickly conclude that much, much better experiences can be had elsewhere, and, if you're willing to put up with a cash shop, usually for free.\n\nAs with many other incomplete and/or shoddy games of late, the developers try to get away from responsibility for their pathetic mess of a game by slapping the "early access" label on it, but hopefully, at this point, most of us have learned (usually the hard way) that by and large, the "early access"-label really means "stay away". Sure, there are a few notable exceptions to this rule, but for the most part, it seems accurate enough.\n\nFinally, if you had any sort of impression that this game in any way is related to, similar to, or in any other way associated with, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, let me assure you that this is not the case. I'm sure that the developers, when naming and picking the theme of the game, were hoping to muddy these waters to capitalize on that (excellent) series of games good reputation, but that willful confusion of matters is as far as the relationship between the two go.","May 23, 2015","false","0.3"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","29","34","2","1"

Facebook, Steam, and it looks like a couple of other platforms. Is it a Facebook game, though? I'm not sure. It's on early access on Steam and has achievements and trading cards. With my short time playing it, I had a good time. I don't think this is going to become my favorite game, but it's a purely multiplayer stabby-shooty fest that isn't too awfully hard on system resources.\n\nSound\n\nIt's too loud, and it's kind of lame. It's early access, though, so not too many complaints.\n\nPotential!\n\nHuge potential. I believe this was gifted to me, and it just took me awhile to get around to playing it. The words "post apocalyptic" get put onto any game, and I'm up for playing it. I think that's a twist to attract people like me to play this, since it really is just your typical clone of any basic multiplayer first person shooter.\n\nI like the leveling system, and the gameplay is okay, but it's very clearly an early access title. It's something to watch, but it feels like something that's not going to go anywhere in the long run.\n\n6/10 - cut the price down a bit and I would say it's a good multiplayer game, but it's still just a bit too clumsy to charge 7 bucks for. For 5 bucks, you'll have a couple of hours of fun.\n\nThere are PLENTY of servers to play on.","May 8, 2015","true","1.9"," 8 of 29 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","8","29","0","0"

Anomalies are fun by themselves though, especially PSY anomaly with instant LSD effect :D\n\nThis is an early access review and from what I see is already implemented at early access release, I am very confident that there is plenty of nice stuff to be expected.\nTherefor I recommend to get the game and support the Devs by doing so!\n","November 20, 2014","true","4.3"," 20 of 249 people (8%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","8","20","249","5","0"
