"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anonymouschum/recommended/409560/","anonymouschum","Chumo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anonymouschum/","161 products in account","Run Rabbit Run is similar to Super Meatboy. Itâ€™s a relatively short game around forty levels plus the ten bonus levels. So you should be able to complete the game in a short amount of time. It has potential to be added to if the developer decides to do that. There is only one power up in this game, itâ€™s a half of an apple that you can slows down time with for a short span of time. I find this somewhat weird, since I have never associated apples with time manipulation. There is only one big very noticeable bug in this game, thereâ€™s a delay between pressing the button and jumping. This is not a bug that happens all the time but it does happen and should be fixed. Overall this is a fun challenging platform game thats worth the price.","April 2","true","1.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

If you played Super Meat Boy, you know what to expect here. There's a bit of a learning curve that will have you staring at the screen, timing the individual saw blades. After that you're constantly dashing around, and the A/D side-scrolling controls make that easy enough. That is until you find yourself met by the game's sense of inertia, with the rabbit under your control being constantly turned to mince meat.\n\nThere is also a great sense of accomplishment once you beat a level, after nearly 100 deaths! With plenty of carrots to collect along the way.\n\nPros:\nShort intro that lets you play right away!\nGreat soundtrack.\nAddictive levels.\n\nCons:\nYou yell randomly at your screen.","April 1","true","2.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

Reaching the goal is one thing but getting all the carrots along the way ratchets up the difficult several notches.\n\nSadly much of this difficulty comes from an unusual air physics design which causes the character to stop immediately in the air when the player lets go of the input.  Combined with noticeable input delay when jumping results in an experience that's imprecise and unresponsive.","April 7","false","1.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

You go out there and try to gather carrots while all sorts of things trying to kill you. The game is great, fast and fun good to kill some time.","February 7","true","3.8"," 7 of 24 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","7","24","0","0"
