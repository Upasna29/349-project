I didn’t recognize who sent it and the message along with it went as so:\n\n“Dear Withering Soul,\n\nYou are lost in your pitiful life. Test your limits.”\n\nI downloaded it with hesitant fingers clenching the mouse with building tension. The game started and I was thrust into a dark forest. I clicked a birdhouse, then a doll, then A SPOOKY .JPG CAME OUT! I was now by a crying woman. I clicked a swing set, then the woman, then A SPOOKY .JPG CAME OUT! Later I went to Hell for some reason and there were three hanging, farting dead people and A SPOOKY .JPG CAME OUT!\n\nThis was Real Horror Stories Ultimate Edition. I hated this game. I hated it. I hate, hate, hated it. I don’t hate it because it scared me, but simply because it bored me. The only thing scary is that the creator is getting money for this bull. You loosely swing between random places and have things pop out at you. What people forget is there is a difference between being horrified and being startled. This game startles you for brief seconds. Which can be okay, but I didn’t get startled at all. This game TRIES to startle you for brief seconds. The only problem is that you’ll be bored to tears between the “scares,” so you just don’t get scared. My shoulders jumped once and I think it was because a fly landed on my arm.\n\nI can’t recommend this unless you saved up money from selling cards and you don’t feel like buying DLC. Don’t tell all your friends not to buy this because they’ll go out and do it anyway. Just ignore the game and forget about it. That is the worst thing you can do about terrible horror games: feel nothing and see them as irrelevant.","April 1, 2014","false","1.1"," 762 of 846 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","762","846","0","14"

A series of illogical, almost static point 'n' click one-screen 'puzzles' with jump scares heaped in.

If it had some semblance of plot or didn't feel like a game I could easily play for free online then it might be worth it's pricetag. The ExMortis series is available on flash gaming sites, is longer, better made and much more interesting.

My parents were killed in the wars, and I was left an orphan.  I was adopted by an old turnip farmer, and he raised me as his own.  I thought that my life was going to be ruled by poverty, but one day, fortune struck.  An old laptop fell off the back of a truck. and it was mostly unharmed.  I knew what I was destined to do:  make Let's Plays of Minecraft and Spooky Games.  I started squatting in an abandoned house above a Starbucks, stealing internet from them and luckily, the old house still had power.\n\nI had hit a brick wall, though.  I didn't have any money, and I only had food and water from the farm, and from discarded pastries and half-caf diet iced caramel frothaccinos with cigarrette butts in them that people so carelessly left on the tables as they left the store, or went to the bathroom.\n\nAfter months of despair, today, yes today ladies and gentlemen, was the day I finally found a game I could afford.  For only nineteen cents, this game would launch my Let's Play career, and I would make millions of Youtube dollars.\n\nI fished a quarter out of a wishing well and ran as fast as I could to the farm.  I asked my adopted father if I could have the money from his Mastercard if I gave him the same amount in cold, hard cash, and when he said no, I just took his credit card and bought it anyway.  Don't worry, I put both the card and the quarter back in his wallet soon after.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, today is the day I start my Let's Play career, and when the money I get from videos from this game starts rolling in, I'll finally be able to buy Minecraft and start making millions.\n\nLadies and gentlemen...you're looking at the next PewDiePie.","August 19, 2014","true","3.5"," 142 of 200 people (71%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","71","142","200","33","20"

Want to demo the game on your browser? Try using google and you'll find it. The idea behind it is nice, but it is badly executed. Lack of clues to solve puzzles, one annoying puzzle that forces you to have great mouse control with lots of trial and error, a puzzle that requires you to memorize a word from a large text, etc.\n\nThe game's sounds are good, but become very repetitive if you take too long to finish a room. There are some very weird and disgusting scenarios that fit the game well. The jump scares can frighten some people, but they are overused and predictable, with a B-horror, funny effect.\n\nI bought this because of the huge discount (75%) and because the game gives you cards, so I ended up paying a negligible price for the game after selling the 3 cards it gave me.\n\nUnless you want this game's cards, stick to the free version, which never got some annoying endgame puzzles.","January 28, 2015","false","2.3"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","0"

It was REALLY scary. This game has been a very enjoyable thrill-vill ride of chaos, suspension, and candle-lighting. None in all my gaming career have I ever been faced with such challenging and promising puzzles. I think I can sleep easy now knowing that games like this exist purely to give us that special butterfly feeling in our tummys.  Truly a standard the gaming industry should partake in. Why would you want to ever do micro-transactions like in Dead Space 3, when instead you can enjoy a good old-fashioned spooky transaction. Countries should learn a thing or two about this kind new currency that is currently only available in the pure spook of Real Horror Stories.™\n\nThis is a story about a man who is haunted by the visions of his dead daughter, boy, mother, and wife. It is revealed in the later-plot that they were killed by asphyixation, and dumped in the well by the protagonist. In response to the protagonist's evil doings, the massacred family strike a deal with the spirits of the forest, and, using their combined power, created a mystical labyrinth to test the protagonist. (Who we learn name's is Belial.) The spirits and the family design the rough, ardous challenges of tracing your cursor (Which we later learn is a satan conjuring wand.) through a difficult, poor-hitboxed maze made on purpose to test the protagonist's frustration of the hatred for his family. When the story finally comes to a climax, you must finish what you started by defeating Pudge, (From Dota 2) who frequently appears on your screen, and returning your wife to her watery grave. Then, you are left with a choice. The guru of stone is finally able to reach you, and presents you with both his hands.\n\nThis final epic climax demonstrates the deep moral choices of the protagonist. He must chose between his left hand, (the will of the few, since most people use their mouse (Satan Conjuring Wand) with their right hand.) and the right hand. (the will of the Protagonist, since most players would use their mouse (Satan Conjuring Wand) with their right hand.) If the Protagonist choses the left hand, he is released from his prison, and his family and the spirits are sealed in the well. If he choses the right, he choses his own selfish desires, and is doomed to endless fire and brimstone.\n\nEndless Replay Value\n10/10","August 28, 2014","true","1.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","7","8","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnbonne/recommended/281370/","johnbonne","Fistfantastic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnbonne/","472 products in account","If you're looking for anything associated with the game's title, do not so much as entertain the thought of purchasing this title. The words "real", "horror" and "stories" should not exist in the same sentence apart from "this so-called 'horror' game was a real nightmare; the story of its critical mauling will be more entertaining than the product being reviewed!".\n\nSo what's the issue, besides not being a video game by any definition? Essentially the 'game' consists of 17 levels, each a single screen with interactive objects. Because the game thinks you're a malfunctioning automaton which can't think for itself, you can't express your excitement for this wonderful game by clicking crazily on the whopping ~3 items on screen; instead, you have to mash the left mouse button for each interactive object, and hope that you've done it right.\n\nThe most disempowering I felt during this game was not when the game made a very weak - and predictable - attempt at a jumpscare, but when I didn't know what the Hell I was doing. Not knowing that I'd "failed" because I clicked an interactive object one too many times, or simply not understanding a puzzle because there's no context was a common issue in my experience. I had to resort to GameOre's walkthrough for around 6 of the rooms and even then they were not just vague, but completely inaccurate. Thankfully there's members of the community who had played further than I had so they could help, and for that they have my sympathies.\n\nBut that's the gameplay in a nutshell - you click on things. I love point and click games and I could talk for hours about them, and "you click on things" would be the very least I could say. However this game just doesn't offer anything else, besides the reward of a jumpscare.\n\nSo what stories are we talking about here? Urban legends? Creepypastas? Unsolved mysteries? Absolutely none of those. The game begins by discovering a haunted forest coming across past murder victims' ghosts, before that story is abandoned to tell another about our journey into Hell. It essentially goes from being a ghost story, which I found was the most terrifying part of the game, to a bad retelling of Dante's picnic in the underworld. Not only is it a bad story, or rather two stories that have absolutely no ties, it's horrendously told. No, it's not even that - there's no story being told. There's no narration, barely any text besides from the beginning, and you're just supposed to pretend that the previous level has something to do with the next.\n\nAs for the horror I have to give some credit to the creepy scenery, as well as the quite scary images used for the jump scares. However the game relies entirely on those jump scares, and while I'm OK with them in moderation, this game lacks the talent to pull them off effectively. While I was shaken up because I'm a complete wuss, I won't dignify its cheap thrills by remembering them.\n\nAll in all, this game offers absolutely nothing besides jump scares. There's no horror stories being told, and the definition of horror can be argued by people far better qualified than myself. The gameplay really is just "click on object and wait for thing", and it's a disgrace to both the point and click and horror genres. The day I forget this game exists can't come soon enough.","April 14, 2015","false","1.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

Shocking to say the least, the game's amazing replayability can largely be attributed to the stellar use of foreshadowing, irony, and other literary elements in the plot.

This cutting-edge work of art manages to juxtaposition fear and comedy; a feat that has, until now, never been done before in all of literary history. For years to come this masterpiece will be remembered among the likes of the works of Shakespeare, Mark Twain, F. Scott Fitzgerald, George Orwell, James Cameron, and Steven Spielberg.

And it actually does manage to scare, if you turn off all the lights, put on some headphones, turn the volume up real loud and don't tire too easily of some spooky face zooming suddenly up at you from the middle of the screen approximately every 2.5 minutes of gameplay (something which does admittedly seem to work on yours truly again and again and again, but then again, I honestly do believe one of the scariest moments in cinema history is that shot in the Exorcist of the guy with the painted face suddenly bursting onto screen...so I may be somewhat biased here).  And the puzzles...oh, the puzzles...I especially loved the one where you have to write "Belial" in the tiled letters of a floor...everyone knows who Belial is, right?  I personally just thought it was the ugly little round thing from Basket Case, but apparently he's also a world-famous demon...I really do need to read my bible more, apparently...\n\nWhich brings me to the next, er, curious point about this game.  If you read the Steam Store page, you'll be under the impression this is a game about "urban myths", and it does manage to keep up that particular thematic, more-or-less (possibly less, but let's not be pedantic), for at least the first quarter or so of "gameplay" (note the inverted commas; they're not entirely accidental).  But by the end we're seeing Popes on crosses in fiery barren landscapes, coaxing blood through lines carved into ancient Egyptian doors, and stabbing babies on altars just to see where the blood dribbles down to so we can solve the next puzzle.  All "urban myths", apparently.  I don't know about you, but nothing cries out "urban" more loudly to me than Egyptian tombs and desert landscapes.\n\nIn all seriousness, this is a rival for the "worst" game I've ever played.  Having said that, I still managed to enjoy it much, much more than many other games which are undeniably more aesthetically accomplished, not least of all on account of its stupidly short playing time and the generosity of the game-makers themselves in including a "hints" section which all but tells you exactly what to do.  AND it only cost me twenty cents, on super-sale.  If it ever gets down to that low, low price ever again, I'd actually recommend you buy it.  It does have some really nice imagery, which you can make some pretty groovy screenshots out of.  The only downside to this is, in order to get said screenshots, you may actually have to play the game.\n\nVerdict: 4/10 (for the pretty pictures and spooky sounds).","May 17, 2014","false","1.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","2"

At first things seem fine, but within the first 5 minutes you are losing brain cells, and possibly even sanity. Truly a marvel for it's time. I would even go as far as paying 30 cents for this game, and folks, I'm not much of a rounder.\n\nPros -\n*Real documented footage of true paranormal experiences.\n*Incredible voice cast (Troy Baker as Ghost, Mark Hamill as Smily Ghost, and Luci Christian as Luci Christian Ghost)\n*Soundtrack by the one and only Nobuo Uematsu.\n*Free copy of The Blair Witch Project 2.\n\nCons -\n*I had to buy a new pair of pants.\n*A ghost actually came out and touched me.

Good ambience. And things do make you jump (as much because they just appear). But the link between chapters is so tenuous and light that there is no story or journey at all, merely a collection of images. It's nice to see games like this, but they need to be a journey (like Year Walk), a story (like Midnight Mysteries) or far more interactive (like The Path). This one alas gets 9/10 for nice effect but 4/10 for story, thus 8/10 overall. I recommend to point-and-click fans if you can get it for cheap, it's quite quick to complete, an hour or two.

If you want to play it at all(NOT RECOMMENDED IF YOU VALUE YOURSELF), get it while it's 20 cents. I could have used that extra 25 cents in my wallet for a GOOD game, but this is what I made the poor choice to spend it on...\n\nI'm glad I got this for 20 cents rather than for the 1 or 2 DOLLARS, yeah. DOLLARS! That this poor excuse for a game asks for. Here are the major problems with it:\n\n1. NO OPTIONS MENU! That means you're pretty much screwed if you have a resolution bigger than 1024x768, adjust quality(which consists of pretty much none in this game) or want to turn down the in-game sound...\n2. The scares, if you can even call them that, are pretty much impossible not to see coming\n3. The same scares on almost every screen are used at least 2-10 times each\n4. The game looks like someone found a bunch of pictures on the internet, added a black and white filter and then put it into their game.\n5. A baby who has just been born in these past few seconds, or maybe even an UNBORN FETUS could make something scarier than this game.\n\nIf that didn't steer you away, prepare for one of, if not, THE WORST "gaming" experiences of your life.\n","May 19, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigglesbringsdanoize/recommended/281370/","bigglesbringsdanoize","Biggles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigglesbringsdanoize/","508 products in account","This game calls itself Real Horror Stories.\n\nAnd I believe it. In real life, I find myself poking things until they make a *slightly* different noise than before, and I get a jump-scare, usually in the form of police. Yep, that's Biggles' good ol' day-to-day.\n\nThe problem, you could say then, is that this game is TOO real. I don't want to be reminded of that time I played Simon Says to unlock a spooky door, or that time I hung out with a crucified Pope. Those were rough days!\n\nOh, or how about that time I could only progress by lighting an arbitrary pattern of candles? That Slayer concert didn't go well at ALL.\n\nYou see, this game, much like life, is a sequence of poorly-photoshopped flitered .png files. Occasionally, by which I mean literally twice, it does present a challenge with some logic and reasoning that you can sorta see if you squint hard enough and tilt your head and hold your breath nearly long enough to pass out. Too often though, the solution is simply to poke a random object MORE TIMES. While this happens more often in life than you'd think (ask your parents, kids), it's not exactly fun.\n\nSo, let's move onto word #2 of the title.\n\n"Horror". Horror, according to my handy pocket dictionary, means "an intense feeling of fear, shock, or disgust". Wow. I was disgusted pretty intensely when I learned the corner shop near my abode sells those awesome lollipops with the bubble gum inside for $0.25, the price I paid for this game. Those were a crucial part of my childhood, and a big part of why I'm a blubbery bear today. And I could have had that nostalgia trip instead of this game. Consider me horrified.\n\nWord #3: Stories\n\nAs far as I can tell, this game's overall branching narrative was to throw some dude my girlfriend affectionately called "YARRRLL" based on the noise he makes down a well. I don't know what the devs have against YARRRLL, but he seemed like a cool guy to me.\n\nWord #4: Ultimate\n\nThis sure was as ultimate as a game about clicking things in the hopes they'll throw me some progress if I promise to stop is ever gonna be.\n\nWord #5: Edition\n\nYep, this was an edition of the aforementioned game.\n\nSo that's 2/5 categories in which I was satisfied. Not good enough in today's cutthroat gaming industry.\n\nFor my $0.25-\n\nYou know what?\n\nMy heart's not in this anymore.\n\nIt's just not good, as you all already expected.\n\nGo home.\n\nLeave Biggles to his sadness. Could've had that blubber pop.\n\n*sigh*","July 30, 2014","false","1.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","3","5","3","0"

In Real Horror Stories the story is explained on a screen that says you are visiting a forest which is filled with all kinds of demons and that few survive. But since theres no story hows the gameplay ? The game is an abomination which you need to stay away from and let me explain why. The game is an expansion of a free Flash game of the same name. All the game does is it adds two new levels and MORE JUMPSCARES. The gameplay is comprimised of completly random puzzles that bases itself on clicking random objects to progress through the game. The game has a great atmoshphere but theres nothing after that. The game is considered a horror game but all it does is it throws random jumps scares. The game also has illogical puzzles that dont make any sense. And plus paying two dollars for two new levels isnt a selling point. This game is a horrible excuse for a horror game and shouldnt be on steam. Overall a boring game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ level desing and stupid jumpscares that isnt worth youre time and money.

No joke, it was really scary!\n\nThis game has been a very enjoyable thrill ville ride of chaos, suspension, and candle lighting. None in all my gaming career have I ever been face with such challenging and promissing puzzles. I think I can sleep easy now knowing that games like this exist purely to give us that special butterfly feeling in our tummies. Truely a standard the gaming industry should partake in.\n\nWhy would you want to ever do microtransactions like in Dead Space 3 when instead you can enjoy a good ol fashion spookytransaction. Countries should learn a thing or two about this kind of new currency that is currently only avalible in the pure spook of Real Horro Stories.\n\nI have to admit, I have been lieing, this game made my eyes water. It smelled like a newly picked rose and I instantly fell in love. The water in my eyes were tears of spooky blood of joy and I couldnt stop playing. I have put in more than 100 hours of playtime and I can safely say that there is endless replayability found in this masterpiece.\n\nThis game clearly puts trashy, cleche games like Star Citizen to shame. My mind hand flop its stupid flops as how this game is as inovative as it is. Almost as good as Gone Home, but it has more charm by far.\n\nI've heard rumors that EA picked it up to make a sequel that we may get our grubby, little, fleshy, gross, spooky fingers on.\n\nOfficaily, however, this game has solitified the argument between console vs PC. As this is a PC exclusive game, there is no doubt in my mind that PC will with the life long question every single time of my life.\n\nDon't tell anyone, but Valve had a hand in developing the game. They managed to have guest apreances of our favorite DOTA 2 character, Pudge, in many scenes of this game. Speaking of scenes, I hope this game becomes a movie as it would be even spookier than Food Fight.\n\nMany people may speculate on such speculations that I am a liar.

Nothing can kill you and for some reason you carry on forward.\n\nThe forumla eventually becomes over done quickly and you easily ready yourself for any jump scare because you'll learn the method from repetiton of gameplay.\n\nThere is no story, So you wont know who you are, where you are going or why you have chosen to walk through this except for a few newspaper articles at the start of the game. which still dont reveal much or connect to scenes later on.\n\nThe game can be finished within an hour, probably less and some scenes you can work out the puzzles within seconds or some puzzles are so cryptic that you'll be googling an answer ASAP. One puzzle even relies on a clue left in a previous scene that you cannot turn back and obtain.\n\nThis game may be scary to some but it wont bother the most experinced of horror game veterans, it might scare off little children but I think its probably more suited for your grandmother who is currently dealing with a mid life crisis thing and wants to do something different with their life before they kick the bucket.

Nope. Denied. If you were looking for real jumpscare, atmospheric horror? Nope. Denied. Honestly, I've been scared more by watching the teletubbies go to rainbow and unicorn land.\nThis "game" basically just involves repetitively pointing and clicking anything possible on the screen until you just accidentally figure out wtf is going on.\nIn my opinion, it is just an excuse for some clown with a torture porn fetish to act out his real-life fantasies in a way that won't get him arrested.\nThis "game" is such an epic failure that it does the words epic failure an injustice. It's that bad.\nI wish I had have spent my 20c contracting a nasty disease from the cheap hooker on the corner. It would have been more fun.\nDo not buy this game. No. Not even for 20c.\n\nI don't mind horror, I don't mind gore and blood and guts, I don't mind mindless violence, but seriously. What sort of sick ♥♥♥♥ thinks killing a blood-splattered, crying baby on an altar belongs in a P&C adventure "game"? Let alone any game for that matter.\n\nIt's no suprise this is a mobile company.

It's prose and insightful narration is among the best i've ever come across--it's a subtle use of these devices place this game among the greats, i find that it could be likened to the famous works of Wilde or Hemmingway. The abhorrent treatment of the native Khatagin tribes by the repressive Nazi party in their pursuit to establish Nationalsozialismus is a chilling reminder of the past and perhaps things yet to come.\nOverall the game lacks no substance and finds no excuse to exercise it's right of poetic critique, especially when the actus reus is considered. I will not reveal it for i feel it is an experience that must be contemplated alone.

There doesn't seem to be any kind of story or plot to follow it's just random 'scary' scenes that you waste time on waiting for something to glow so you can continue on since clicking the area before it glows does nothing at all!

You can tell in the first thirty seconds alone that the "Storyline" is going to be a tired patchwork of cliches from the most overdone horror concepts. Child murdered, so-and-so butchered, spirits lingering in a forest...but wait! It gets worse! Not only do they rely ENTIRELY on the shock value of random bloody faces popping up to scare you in order to pass this off as a horror game, but the images don't even make sense. I actually scare pretty easily which is why i enjoy low budget horror clickers, but by the time i stopped playing i was almost asleep on my keyboard. The best part is, you don't even get to click to move. It moves you automatically from scene to scene, none of which are even remotely sequential: "Oh look bloody doll", "Oh look a ghost sitting in a swing", "Oh look a dead woman crying on th-awwwww and she exploded for absolutely no reason." Seriously I don't know who the hell Game Ore is, but I hope they can take some pride in knowin that my interest in the horror genre has suffered a critical blow after this shoddy travesty. Please don't try again.","November 25, 2014","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesis4/recommended/281370/","thesis4","Thesis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesis4/","95 products in account","My friends and I have a game during Steam sales in which we buy each other terrible games and then we have to stream as we play them. Due to that, I now own this gem.\n\nLet me preface this review by saying I love horror films. I love scary stories. The Final Girl is my spirit animal. All this being said, I have a low tolerance for scares. During particularly terrifying films, I will sit, feet up in my chair, knees under my chin, hands plastered to my face as I watch between my fingers like a frightened five year old. But I will suffer through when it's worth it.\n\nReal Horror Stories Ultimate Edition is not worth it. It is terrible. It is awful. As a point-and-click adventure there are no real puzzles or mystery, just following the cues on-screen to get to the next part.\n\nAnd on top of all of this, the game relies on jumpscares. The atmosphere is shoddily built, with shadowy figures flickering the background or glowing eyes in the depths of a cave, and as you play you know when the scary moment is going to happen as it is based on a predictable pacing. When you jump in your chair, it is more from a release of your own tension and your imagination of what might be coming than from the game actually being scary. Because anyone's imagination is freakier than what this game can come up with.\n\nThough my friends were disappointed, I quit playing this game after just a half hour because it wasn't worth it. I quit because I knew that I would be jumping throughout this game, but hating myself for it. If I wanted that, I would go back and grit my teeth and play through Dead Space. (One day, Dead Space!) But this game is something that, if you're like me, you're just going to be a bit freaked out and irritated at yourself for being suckered into the lame scares. Or, if you're someone with a higher tolerance for atmosphere and jumpscares, you're just going to be unhappy that you wasted any money at all on a Flash game that is offered for free online[www.gameshed.com].","September 23, 2014","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are some very effective jump scares, mixed with plenty of disturbing scenes that you may have trouble getting out of your head. For such a low price, you'll certainly get your money's worth in horror value.\n\nOn a side note, I've been a fan of horror games and horror movies most of my life, and I was honestly surprised at how disturbing and unsettling this game is. Of the hundreds of horror movies I've seen, this was easily more scary in the first 10 minutes than 99% of horror movies are in a full 2 hours.

You would have noticed by now that I don't recommend this title? It largely depends on what you think of horror flash games. If by any chance they float your boat? There are numerous free flash horror title to pick from online, many better ones too. 81% off or £0.31 isn't a large amount of money and the cards acquired from playing would pretty much be a return of the 30p investment.\n\nThe game itself is a point and click, horror jpeg, of still images. The issue isn't much of the use of still images, its the fact that puzzles are largely random clicking with no order or sense to them. I had a walkthrough open throughout the playthrough due to the random nature of it. It also over plays many jumpscares (if you call them that) most have a face like a microwaved Tony Blair, the only thing more used then jumpscares in Real Horror Stories is having some random shadow running passed the screen like you've downloaded a illegal movie online shot on a cam recorder, truly like some dude getting up for a ♥♥♥♥ halfway through.\n\nIf you've ever wondered what hell would be like?

You would have noticed by now that I don't recommend this title? It largely depends on what you think of horror flash games. If by any chance they float your boat? There are numerous free flash horror title to pick from online, many better ones too. 81% off or £0.31 isn't a large amount of money and the cards acquired from playing would pretty much be a return of the 30p investment.\n\nThe game itself is a point and click, horror jpeg, of still images. The issue isn't much of the use of still images, its the fact that puzzles are largely random clicking with no order or sense to them. I had a walkthrough open throughout the playthrough due to the random nature of it. It also over plays many jumpscares (if you call them that) most have a face like a microwaved Tony Blair, the only thing more used then jumpscares in Real Horror Stories is having some random shadow running passed the screen like you've downloaded a illegal movie online shot on a cam recorder, truly like some dude getting up for a ♥♥♥♥ halfway through.\n\nIf you've ever wondered what hell would be like? Try it out! Its straight out of the read the developers mind textbook.","May 12, 2015","false","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I absolutely enjoyed every second of this beautifully hand-crafted game and I would recommend it to any fan of the horror genre and maybe even just fans of gaming in general. This game pushed my expectations to the limit and delivered. The puzzle solving is genius and the subtle storyline was carefully written by three world-famous story writers and published by one of modern gaming's most well-known publishers. For a final opinion I would say that this game will change your outlook on the genre and on life itself.\n\n10/10\nWould kill myself again.","January 13, 2015","true","0.8"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","45","9","20","10","0"

Really I did. It sounded neat and I thought it would be interesting right up until I loaded it up. OH how wrong I was. This game is for all intents and purposes a new grounds flash game, and even in that category it's out-shined by far by other games that are legitimately creepy. The scares actually made me laugh, a couple of them to the point where I had to step away from the computer to collect my composure. The puzzles are simple, though a few are rather obtuse since you have no real way of knowing what you're doing. I breezed through this quick enough and got both endings. It has a save feature which is nice I guess though fairly pointless. Over all I'd say skip this game if you're looking for something actually scary. If you want a good laugh or a game to play while drinking then...actually just go play something else in that case as well, there really is no way to justify paying any amount of money for this game.","January 22, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was during dinner time, and while there was little to no flatulence, the smell which was at first indistinguishable from mother's brussel sprout and spinach cassarole, gained flavor and bouquet as my parents and I began gagging. She had brought a few bird carcasses inside after the neighbor's cat was done playing with them the night before, so I can only assume that this was the culprit. My parents were kind enough to ignore this indecorum, as Katie had spent several minutes trying to clean the mess with her tongue before we discovered her, but this didn't change the combination lemonade/brownie cake in the carpet, nor the dribble trail following it from the doggie door.

Yeah, I know, it’s supposed to be based on urban legends and the like, but if that’s the case then the developers must have made up some of their own because virtually nothing in the game seems to be based even remotely on actual events/folktales.  Ask yourself:  When did some Pope-looking dude ever get struck by lightning in a place that looks like the cover to a classic rock album while a horned-Yeti-looking-thing goes gallivanting around?  That’s right, never!!\n\nI guess stuff like that was added to make the game more appealing to horror fans; to make it scarier (if that can even be said in this context because that’s the one thing this game most certainly is not).\n\nRegardless, nothing makes sense in this game and the point-and-click mechanic, especially when it comes to how you solve most of the puzzles, was so poorly conceived and implemented that you’ll likely be pointing and clicking as quickly as possible to delete all local content while you still have some sanity left.  At that point, alas, no one can give you back the time you spent playing the game….*sigh*….\n\nI got this when it was less than $1 – I now realize in retrospect that that simply wasn’t cheap enough but at least it now has trading cards so you can kinda recoup the anguish and mental scarring this game causes (the cards are truly the only plus side to this game).\n\nConsider yourself forewarned!","March 7, 2015","false","4.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The jumpscares aren't even that good either, they're just sudden images jumping on the screen accompanied by screams.\nThere are two redeeming qualities that I noticed about this game. First, it doesn't have any bugs, which is nice, although it's kind of expected for something so simple, and second, the art is pretty good.

The gameplay was overly simply, and very un-intuitive. The point and click mechanics would have been fine, if you had a visible reaction when you clicked. The game left me clicking on everything, unsure of what to do next, while giving no real hint as to the next move. Each move should naturally flow to the next, and in this the game failed completely. You shouldn't have to click repeatedly to make something happen, without any indication that you are clicking the proper things att he proper time. It is annoying and frustrating when you aren't sure just what the hell you should be doing, and the game is giving you nothing to go on.\n\nB. The "scares" in this game were nothing more than cheap "jump in your face" shock value type scares, which leave nothing to the imagination, and definitely doesn't leave you wating more. Quite the opposite, in fact. After the 3rd level, I was already bored, and by the 8th, I was done,\n\nSeriously, nine candles and nothing else to clue you in on what you should do? Really? Of course you light them. And when nothing happens, then what? Spend all day lighting candles in various configurations until something happens? Not here. Give me a clue when I light a key candle, and I'll keep at it. Leave me staring at a monotonous screen with nothing but those candles happening, and I'm outta here.\n\nFrankly, this game was a waste of $0.29.

The dark images did lend to the imagination which I did enjoy, but the repeatitive sounds of the crying and moaning did have me needing an asprin. The last two challenges, the cages and the letter bridge did stump me the longest. (thank goodness for that red light that appears if you've stayed on a screen or puzzle too long lol!)  I think that if this game had a couple more clues, or an intro that explains clickits, it would be more friendly to first time users of the game style and may get a bit more favorable reviews. Clickit games are made to be frustrating as hell, but aside from the soundaffects hitting pitches that hurt my ears and the predictability of the jumpscares, it  kept the short game engaging. I don't like clickit games but this one was alright.","August 22, 2014","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Really I did. It sounded neat and I thought it would be interesting right up until I loaded it up. OH how wrong I was. This game is for all intents and purposes a new grounds flash game, and even in that category it's out-shined by far by other games that are legitimately creepy. The scares actually made me laugh, a couple of them to the point where I had to step away from the computer to collect my composure. The puzzles are simple, though a few are rather obtuse since you have no real way of knowing what you're doing. I breezed through this quick enough and got both endings. It has a save feature which is nice I guess though fairly pointless. Over all I'd say skip this game if you're looking for something actually scary. If you want a good laugh or a game to play while drinking then...actually just go play something else in that case as well, there really is no way to justify paying any amount of money for this game.","January 22, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's just click click click, a shadow moves around, click click click, something rots away or explodes into blood, click click click, jumpscare. No real variety there. The jumpscares aren't even that good either, they're just sudden images jumping on the screen accompanied by screams.\nThere are two redeeming qualities that I noticed about this game. First, it doesn't have any bugs, which is nice, although it's kind of expected for something so simple, and second, the art is pretty good. However, these points don't change the fact that this game is not worth it. Seriously, I've seen better stuff online, for free.","February 19, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yeah, I know, it’s supposed to be based on urban legends and the like, but if that’s the case then the developers must have made up some of their own because virtually nothing in the game seems to be based even remotely on actual events/folktales.  Ask yourself:  When did some Pope-looking dude ever get struck by lightning in a place that looks like the cover to a classic rock album while a horned-Yeti-looking-thing goes gallivanting around?  That’s right, never!!\n\nI guess stuff like that was added to make the game more appealing to horror fans; to make it scarier (if that can even be said in this context because that’s the one thing this game most certainly is not).\n\nRegardless, nothing makes sense in this game and the point-and-click mechanic, especially when it comes to how you solve most of the puzzles, was so poorly conceived and implemented that you’ll likely be pointing and clicking as quickly as possible to delete all local content while you still have some sanity left.  At that point, alas, no one can give you back the time you spent playing the game….*sigh*….\n\nI got this when it was less than $1 – I now realize in retrospect that that simply wasn’t cheap enough but at least it now has trading cards so you can kinda recoup the anguish and mental scarring this game causes (the cards are truly the only plus side to this game).\n\nConsider yourself forewarned!","March 7, 2015","false","4.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are confusing and pointless the puzzle where you put a newspaper back together the peice detection is awful and if you accidently click to low on the screen you have to start the whole thing over again. If you dont hit tab for the hint box to pop up where to click you will never beat it becuase there is no rhyme or reason to it. the ending which there are 2 of is crap and the only thing affecting which ending you get is at the end which glowing ball you click on. there is no explanation to the story and none of this game is in the least bit true.

It was during dinner time, and while there was little to no flatulence, the smell which was at first indistinguishable from mother's brussel sprout and spinach cassarole, gained flavor and bouquet as my parents and I began gagging. She had brought a few bird carcasses inside after the neighbor's cat was done playing with them the night before, so I can only assume that this was the culprit. My parents were kind enough to ignore this indecorum, as Katie had spent several minutes trying to clean the mess with her tongue before we discovered her, but this didn't change the combination lemonade/brownie cake in the carpet, nor the dribble trail following it from the doggie door. I'd like to say that we all bonded over the thorough cleaning that ensued, but father placed a cinder block in front of Katie's door and she spent the remainder of the week outside. My mother tried her best to make the living room appealing to us all again, but we just moved the television into the dining room doorway and tried not to think about what Febreeze-covered ♥♥♥♥ smelled like.\n\nIs this game Katie, Katie's wretched dump, mother's cassarole, or Febreeze-covered ♥♥♥♥?\n\nWhatever you decide, yes.","December 29, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite the name the game has absolutely no story.\nI can't be even angry at this game because it cost me only 20 cents and it's almost amusingly bad. The scary imagery is overblown so much it's completely ridiculous. The actions are so random that I've solved most puzzles just by clicking on everything without knowing what am I doing. Surprisingly such a simple game has some technical issues: Sometimes when I pressed ESC for the main menu it failed and just flashed from fullscreen to windowed and back. Also if you click too fast the same sound effects start playing over each other.\nI can hardly recommend this trash even for free.

The entire thing makes no sense. There's no real premise to any of your actions. Nothing to indicate that what you're doing is actually making a difference, until you actually give the patience to just click on everything. There are two or three "puzzles" that are practically tests in patience as opposed to actual puzzles. One involves you to literally choose 4 out of 9 candles in a circle in the correct order. There is no indication that you click only 4 of these candles, there's no indication prior to this that hints to this being the solution. Thus, if you put it down to it, you would have to literally sit and test 1,000,000,000 combinations and for anyone to actually go out of their way to test that, I'd say that person is insane.\nSecond is the "Draw this shape with your blood"... there's a single path to take and if you make ONE mistake throughout the route, it's back to the start...\n\nI'm sorry, but this game just wasn't worth my time. Let alone that, the fact that the official webpage doesn't have walkthroughs to accomodate the changes to the game as well (and yes there were changes because I had to come to the Steam forums to find the puzzles that werent there).","October 11, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are hundreds of games exactly like this available for free online.\nThe formula for most of the game is this: find something you can click, click until the next jumpscare.\nI got as far as "level" 9 in this bland, flash-based horror game. At this point, I was presented with a group of candles and a sealed door. I lit all the candles and nothing happened. After clicking around for a while, I quit and checked the included "tips". The tips simply stated that lighting all the candles would provide me with a "hidden tip," to help me light the correct candles. Thinking I may have missed something, I went back in and tried again. After lighting the candles, nothing happened once again. No tip that I could find ever showed. After grasping at straws for a while, I decided that it wasn't worth my time, and was glad that this game was only a small loss.\n\nIf you're considering buying this, just go online and google "horror flash game" instead.

The visual effects are bad. The best way to describe the animations and the like are "Gilliam-esque." They've basically photoshopped a bunch of, I'm presuming, employees, friends and Google search results. It's a point and click, but considering clicking doesn't work a lot of the time, they've failed 50% of their stated goal.\nThe escape key in-game will open the Pause menu, but will not close it.\nThe worst part of this is that for a horror game, it's funny. There's a bit where a little girl is on a swing, giggling in front of an old lady who is weeping into her hands, when the little girl suddenly disappears. Next, her head falls out of a tree, for no reason and rolls in front of the old lady. The old lady stops crying, lifts her face out of her hands and starts to decompose in front of you. Next, in an inspired bit of visual humor, the old lady explodes and blood flies everywhere. I legitimately laughed out loud, I was not expecting something so stupid. Another great moment occurs after the game supposedly saves for the first time. There are some candles inside a tree. Lighting more than one candle causes a ghost to spring across the screen and blow the candles out.  But wait! There's more! After you've lit the candles inside the tree successfully and the dead fat man lying next to it disappears, a skull flies out of the middle of the screen towards the player! Then the fat man jumps out from the bottom of the screen! Truly inspired. Honestly, the fact that this is on Steam is really disappointing.

The whole experience is clicking on random parts of the screen until some animation happens. A lot of the time I wasn't even sure where or even IF something needed to be clicked to progress or I was just waiting on a timer to finish to continue on to the next scene. Naturally, this game is nowhere near scary. Perhaps a small child that was already nervous about something might be disturbed by it, but it was really lame. I highly recommend you avoid this game at all costs. Your money and your time are worth so much more than this awful thing can compensate.","November 10, 2014","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
