It's a darker, more mature take on the classic Cinderella fairy tale, but with some clever twists. The artwork and music are really gorgeous and add a lot to the story. It's also worth noting that this is one of the rare visual novels that uses an art style other than anime.\n\nThe game's a bit short and even going back and playing several endings won't take much longer than a few hours. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of replay value. While there are a lot of different endings in the game, things become a little tedious after you've played through a couple of times. Other than achievement hunting, there's not much payoff for getting all the endings.\n\nEven though it's brief, the story and characters are engaging and it's an enjoyable experience while it lasts. It's also a visual novel that's a bit heavier on the novel part than straight-up dating sims; several different pairings can occur, but the focus isn't entirely on romance.\n\nI personally think that the $20 price tag is a little steep for such a short game though, so look for sales or bundle deals.","May 16, 2015","true","5.0"," 113 of 120 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","113","120","0","7"

It's a retake on the classic fairytale, and I very much enjoy the multiple directions it can go!

I have to say, this is probably the best one I've seen so far.\n\nThe aesthetics of this game are amazing. The art is beautiful, as you can see from the screenshots, but something they don't show is how everything looks in movement. The backgrounds are subtly animated and the text appears on the screen in a magical shine of color. It's mostly small touches, but it makes the game feel very unique from a lot of other indie visual novels that originally came out in English.\n\nAnother thing that makes Cinders really stand out is the way they show you how your choices are affecting the game. Every time a line is changed due to one of your choices, a chime plays and a symbol appears in the corner. Once you reach certain goals (which you gain achievements for on Steam) the starting menu will change to show your awards. And after you reach an ending, there's a screen that shows you all the possible variables in the ending you achieved. I'm impressed to see that it looks like there's a LOT of variables in the ending I got, which makes me really interested in what other possibilities there are! (It should also help the game have lots of value as well--my first playthrough was probably around three hours or so, so I'm expecting to get a good amount of playtime in to complete all the endings and branching paths...10-15 hours is what I'm estimating right now.)\n\nI was also impressed by the number of choices present in the game--they happen frequently, and never feel pointlessly shoved in. I don't know how well the illusion of choice will hold up in further playthroughs but at least in this first one I really felt like my choices had an impact, which makes me very pleased.\n\nAs for the story--I loved it. Nearly all of the characters are interesting and have different layers to uncover from what I've seen in the game so far. I particularly like what's been done with the stepsisters--the game doesn't quite make excuses for them, but does a lot to make it make sense why they'd be so cruel to Cinders. Finding out more about Sophia in particular (who is probably my favorite character) is something I'm looking forward to trying to uncover in later playthroughs.\n\nIf I had one complaint, the only thing I could come up with is that at times the game's dialogue clashes with the tone they seem to be going for. They're trying to make the story feel like it's in a historical place--one where there are elements of fantasy, but that could otherwise reasonably exist at some point in history. But a lot of the dialogue feels oddly modern and even occasionally slang-y. I don't think this is exactly a problem, but it does clash at times with their attempts to make things feel 'historical.'\n\nBut honestly, that's a nitpick, and one I gave partially so this review wouldn't be completely glowing. Otherwise, this is probably the best Visual Novel I've played, hands down. I'm glad it's finally showed up on Steam.","May 3, 2014","true","5.8"," 77 of 81 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","77","81","0","0"

Not sure I'm entirely qualified to write a review since this is the only visual novel I've played - but I love the game so much, I have to gush about it. Let's see:\n\nPros:\n- Incredible soundtrack. It's too bad they don't have that as DLC because if they did, I'd buy it in a second.\n- Lovely graphics. The artwork is gorgeous in a perfect fairytale way.\n- Very interesting story. A good thing too if you're going to play over and over for multiple endings.\n- Rich characters. Their dialog was well written and I cared alot about what happened to them.\n- Choices really make a difference. The way the story flows is very much up to you. Choose wisely.\n\nCons:\n- Some of the dialog between characters can get a bit preachy.\n- As with most "choose your own adventures", they don't always give you the choices you'd like.\n\nAll in all, if you have any interest in the Cinderella story or a well written book-like game with pleasing artwork and music, I highly recommend this. And with all the many ending variations, there's lots of replay value. I've 100%ed the achievements but there are still 2 endings I really want to see so I'm not done playing yet.

Cinders can do things and go places and be mean if need be, and there is need, as we all know.\nAnother great thing about Cinders, we see motivations behind actions, nobody is evil just for the sake of making somebody else look pitiful.\nThis VN is satisfactory on many levels. It looks nice too, dialogue is good and great at times.\nThere are many endings and some heavy choices. Choices are most of the time too obvious, though, but it's hard to expect otherwise when we are talking about so well known tale.\n\nI recommend it for all VN fans out there.","July 30, 2014","true","9.1"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","47","51","0","11"

This game is (very losely) based on the story of Cinderella, but it's up to the player to decide what Cinder's "happy ending" will be. Shall she really just marry the prince? Maybe she should kill her stepmother and take hold of her estate instead? Run away and start a new life elsewhere? Marry the prince but, screw him, rule alone? (Who needs men, anyway?) Of course, if she is not careful, her actions might just blow up in her face.","December 20, 2015","true","2.8"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","47","52","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dianaincognito/recommended/293680/","dianaincognito","Diana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dianaincognito/","603 products in account","As far as visual novels go, I have to say that CINDERS is my favorite, thus far.  The game takes the player down a very mature path within a classic children's fairytale.  The player has complete control over the decision making process of the main character.  Thus, with each choice the player makes for Cinders, her personality changes as the game progresses.  There is a large number of outcomes for this character based on those decisions she is presented with throughout the game.  For instance, with the decisions the player chooses for Cinders, she could become very evil or good, very sexual or timid, and/or anywhere in between.  I honestly couldn't believe the number of outcomes this game presents the player with!  The replayability is enormous.  The artwork is absolutely gorgeous.  The music is beautiful.  I applaud how the devs implemented the 'fast forward scene' ability within the game as even though this is a VN, thus a lot of reading, it allows the player to choose whether to read through a scene over and over if they wish OR fast forward through a scene that they have previously experienced.  Please remember, there are NUMEROUS outcomes to this game and over 300 different possible decisions to be made (at minimum)!  The player can also choose the rate of speed that the dialogue is presented, which gives the player a chance to choose either the slower paced dialogue which visually allows 'emphasis' placed on certain words or phrases 'spoken' by each character OR to speed it up and read at the players pace.  I literally just finished the very last outcome for this game before writing this review.  I sat back and just said "WOW!"  (yes, it's that good!)  I highly recommend this game to any VN lover --- and would really like to see others at least give it a shot.  It truly is a very well thought out game!!!","September 9, 2014","true","52.4"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","39","41","0","8"

Cinder witnesses two characters talking, then one leaves, Cinder asks the remaining character what they were talking about, remaining character then rehashes the conversation you just read.  It's painful and you start pressing enter rapidly to move to the next scene.\nMouth animation that doesn't fit with the otherwise wonderful character art.\nEvery single character in the entire game will lecture you more than once on the evils of making assumptions and stereotyping people.\n\nIt is my suspicion that the developer wants you to play Cinder while subverting all the tropes of the Cinderella fairy tale.  I chose options that were more in line with the original story for the first play through, could be why almost every conversation I experienced contained a lecture on stereotypes, but it felt very heavy handed and preachy.","October 19, 2014","false","10.9"," 74 of 97 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","74","97","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/candleheart/recommended/293680/","candleheart","Candle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/candleheart/","222 products in account","There’s many things that I like about this game so I’ll do a list:\n\n>>>GENERAL STUFF:\n-The art gorgeous. There are even small background animations as well which makes the scenes livelier. I’m so in love with the art is almost hurts!\n\n-If we make a decision and it affects the story differently, a flower appears on the top right of the screen. It’s kind of like the Walking Dead’s “____ will remember that”. Personally, I like the instant feedback on my decisions.\n\n-The dialouge between characters can feel a little stiff and awkward at times. Maybe it's because the characters aren't that close with each other and that's why it gives off that vibe.\n\n-I love how when we get achievements, the title screen updates and things are added as we discover more things. What in the jellybeans, that’s AMAZING!\n\n-The music is gorgeous. There are times when I stop and listen and go “whoa!” one of the conversations got pretty tense and the music followed suit.\n\n-I like the attention to detail when the words roll onto the screen. It is as if each word was cast into existence by a small fairy as little colourful sparks burst behind every appearing word.\n\nWe know when a person is speaking hurriedly, maybe even angrily since the text appears very quickly. When words are spoken by characters with emphasis, the text emerges slowly, and there are pauses at key moments to create tension. I’m usually the type of person who clicks twice to see all the text appear all at once since I’m an impatient reader, but Cinders has made me stop and enjoy watching the text tap happily along the screen.\n\n\n\n>>>STORY:\n-The story has a lot of variations (player choices and endings). One ending may have small, but still significant changes that shows up in the epilogue depending on the choices we made.\n\n-There is a convenient skip option as well so there isn’t a big pain when replaying for different possibilities.\n\n-I personally loved bonding with Cinder’s sisters. I love them and easily got attached to them, problems, flaws and all. If we bond with them a certain way, they react differently to us, differently to others, and maybe even towards themselves.\n\n\n>>>OVERALL:\nIt’s a great game, with a great story, amazing music, stunning art, and the list goes on! It allows us to make choices as we read making us more invested. There are many paths and endings to discover.\n\nYou may not be too into it if you’re not a big reading fan. But if you enjoy reading or visual novels, Cinders is a MUST GET! Even if you aren’t into visual novels, give this one a go, maybe your tastes will change! There is a demo on their main site to try out at MoaCube.","May 4, 2014","true","3.9"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","40","44","0","0"

I'm not teaching anything if you already glanced at the screenshots but it needs to be said because it's actually pretty important. Many visual novels have a cheap look, and I personally feel that it has a really negative impact on my enjoyment of the story. In Cinders you want to move forwards just to see the next picture.\n\nBut it's not just window dressing either. The writing is also great, and I do mean it. All the characters and situations are believable, the premise was enough to hook me in and the world is an interesting place to discover. It's nice for a change to play something that you never did before when many visual novels are pretty iterative.\n\nFinally, the choices. Nothing to write home about, but they are there and they are significant. I actually prefer something that really allows me to put my mark on the story rather than thousands of endings for the sake of it. It's good and having the opportunity to twist such an iconic story is a great pleasure.\n\nTo conclude, this game is amazing. Maybe even one of those niche games good enough to be enjoyed by someone who usually don't play them.\nA little caveat nonetheless: despite all my praises, I think the price is too steep.

Every choice matters.\n\nThe only real fault I had with this game was the atrocious writing. It was painful--unrealistic language, blatant foreshadowing, laughable and sometimes downright confusing conversations. The makers of this game went so far into making sure that the player was aware of the nuances of each character that they beat you over the head with them, and then beat the horse you rode in on too. I like subtle, complex characterization, and character growth should be something developed over time and with a touch more realism. Rather than creating nuanced dialogue the game screams it at you, and then has the main character repeat it to herself in her alone time just to make sure you didn't misunderstand anything.\n\nI paid $4 for this game via Humble Bundle , and spend roughly 3 hours doing two playthroughs (with numerous bouts of getting up for pizza and tea). If I had paid $20 via steam, I suspect my review would be that much more vitriolic...if you go to the effort of making a well-crafted game, you should spend some time crafting the text with the same dexterity shown elsewhere.","February 8, 2015","false","3.4"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","37","46","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/293680/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","It's rather unusual to see a visual novel coming from somewhere other than Japan that doesn't attempt to merely emulate those that do, but instead takes hold of the genre and carves a unique path for itself that shows VNs have a lot more to offer than we've thus seen. In the case of Cinders, it also manages to update a classic fairytail into a far more mature and modern story, turning Cinderella into a newly captivating adventurer that eschews many of the originals childish elements for mystery and intrigue. It stumbles a bit along the way, as if walking in its own pair of undersized glass slippers, but on the whole amounts to something unexpectedly enthralling and maybe just a bit magical.\n\nI can't imagine anyone is unfamiliar with the story of Cinderella, so I'll skip the introductions. The vile mother and sisters, sad girl living as a servant waiting for the world to change, glass slippers and prince charming are all here as you'd expect, but where Cinders differs is in taking a simple fairy tail and turning it into a mature and intriguing story that is wildly different than how you remember it. Character interactions are full of personal dialogue and emotion, turning the original cliches into actual people you can relate and empathize with. Cinders sisters might be cold, but once their reasons are explained it's hard not to feel sorry for them despite their cruelties. The prince may appear to live a life of carefree amusement, but on the inside his constant questioning of his actions is tearing him apart and making him question his own motives. There are certainly moments when it becomes overly self indulgent with some of its writing, and a few endings feel a bit hollow (though that's to be expected with how many there are), but these moments are overshadowed by the majority of the dialog, which is hugely engrossing and when compiled with the element of your own choices becomes even more compelling, as you shape the outcome to any number of different paths.\n\nWhich brings me to one of the few areas Cinders slips up a bit, at least in the view of someone who wishes to see more than the one ending they arrive at. Throughout the story (which should take you around 2-5 hours depending on your reading speed) you encounter a myriad of choices which change the story and eventually decide your characters fate. The issue arises in the sheer number of decisions that can have an impact on the ending, and the very limited number of saves you are given, which means you are required to skip through huge amounts of text again and again as you reload and make minor alterations to your choices in the attempts to see a new ending. It all becomes greatly repetitive and takes far more time than it otherwise might had you been given more freedom in the number of saves you have, as well as making it quicker to skip through dialog you've already read before.\n\nBut ultimately it's a somewhat inconsequential complaint as for those not obsessed with seeing every ending, the first run through the story isn't the least bit affected and just as captivating as ever. Least I forget Cinders is also remarkably pretty to look at, with fantastic art and a ton of minor details bringing the picture to life, from background objects to character expressions. It's a bold new direction for visual novels, a genre that's been stagnant and underrepresented outside of Japan for a long time, and a brilliant first attempt by developer MoaCube which I hope is but the first of many more to come.","August 14, 2014","true","6.3"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","20","24","3","2"

But on the otherhand, if you are then i garuntee you will love it if you play it all the way through.\nPROS:\nThis game has four different main endings each with a couple different epilogues you can get through the choices you make. I've seen some reviews on here that say the choices don't matter, which i have to disagree with. Every visual novel game will have choices that seem meaingless and pointless and may not exactly contribute to the main story, but they are there to give you a sense of control. Other choices will be vitally important like the first choice you make. It can change the whole story depending on what you choose. Some people are bothered by no voices or terrible music or any other thing that falls under that category, these people will be so pleased with the musical choice the creators went with. It is beautiful and one of my favorite soundtracks of any game i have ever played. It makes the game 10x better in my opinion. Like i said before, there are four main endings each with their own epilogues; if you are one of those gamers that like to get all they can in a game but hesitates because it takes too long, you will be pleased to find that you can skip through all the dialogue so it makes the replay value go up. Another thing to add would be the artwork for this game. It is amazingly beautiful. Most visual novels have static(stay still) artwork that changes when you move forward in the conversation, but this game has dynamic artwork that moves. Granted it is not much but fires flicker, and dust particles in the sunlight are visible.\nCONS:\nSaying all this, there are some faults. Not many, but they are there. Some characters seem useless and very unnatural along with some situations. Sometimes the words lag behind if you are running something in the background. There, that's all the cons in my opinion. Time for the assessment.\nASSESSMENT:\nStory: 8\nReplay Value: 10\nMusic: 10\nCharacters: 8\nArtwork: 10\nOVERALL: 9.1\nIf you like visual novels, you will thoroughly enjoy this game.\n","November 6, 2014","true","7.6"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

Cinders is about to embark on a journey—a journey of choices. The story will most certainly bring to memory another classical tale of romance, intrigue, betrayal & the pursuit of happiness.\n\nChoices are the core gameplay element in Cinders. The choices you make really do matter. The world will unfold around you according to the decisions you make—and you will always be aware of how they affect what occurs next. The gameplay mechanic for this is that a budding branch will emerge from the corner of the screen to denote an event playing out that has been mitigated by previous decisions. This conspires to make a living world, where you’re not an observer but a participant.\n\nWhile choices are at the core of Cinders, they dance around the diverse characters. The characters are complex, disturbed, scarred, & much more. None of the characters are simply good or bad. They reach out and play with your emotions as if they were flesh & blood.\n\nThe artwork in Cinders is colorful & vibrant. You’ll oftentimes find yourself looking at the background scenery, to catch a look at the swaying shrubbery, or the flickering fire. The soundtrack is diverse & emotionally fitting to each scene as it unfolds. It’s easy to get lost in the simple background melodies.\n\nCinders has a full screen option, with the option to choose screen ratio. The game looked great on a 30” screen at a 16:10 ratio playing in full screen mode.\n\nIn conclusion, Cinders is loosely based on one of the classics, & most certainly worth a look if you’re interested in the Visual Novel genre.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/palasvuash/recommended/293680/","palasvuash","Palas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/palasvuash/","66 products in account","Although it is a retelling of the classic fairytale Cinderella, the new approach makes it seem like another story altogether.\n\nGenre: Fantasy/Adventure\nDuration: 2 to 3 hours for one ending; 10 to 15 hours for all endings.\nDeveloped by: MoaCube, 2012\n\nBy playing as the namesake protagonist, you are introduced to a fantasy world in which you must deal with your stepmother and stepsisters at first, later meeting nobility, fairies, salesmen and townsfolk. You do so through choices and map movement intermissions in the narrative. So as not to leave you confused, the game flashes a wooden branch icon on the upper right corner of the screen everytime a previous choice is showing its consequence.\n\nCinders is structured so as to give your choices an aspect of freedom: there are not correct choices and you will always reach a satisfying ending that reflects your behaviour throughout the story. This means one single playthrough will last for about two hours, but one ending is just a glimpse of the stories Cinders has to offer.\n\nThe greatest strength this visual novel has is probably its characters: no character is completely redeemed nor degraded. They are complex, round characters with motivations and goals that you can relate yourself to, enhancing the moral aspect of the choices: each and every character has a lot to be explored, making for a consistent world with strong characters - and many strong female characters - and a sense that you are free to make your own judgement.\n\nThis groundedness, however, doesn't stop the game from sporting a most pleasant fairytale atmosphere. The art and the music, through coherent design and stylistic choices, gives Cinders a fine identity and a unique feel down to minute details, such as small animations on the background and on the sprites. As such, it's easy to get used to the art style even if it's not commonly used in visual novels. Such attention to identity helps in the establshment of an emotional link between you and Cinders' world.\n\nIf only fow how bold it is, Cinders is a must for anyone who appreciates story-driven experiences with complex characters and a lot of room for the player to decide what happens next.\n\nPositive:\n\n*Great fairytale impression\n*Many choices and many endings\n*Fleshed out characters\n*Music is comfortable to listen to and the sound design is adequate\n*Consistent art and world\n\nNegative:\n\n*Short playthroughs. You might not feel the need to see other endings/epilogues\n*Though the game shows when a choice is reflected on the progress of the story, some choices are still lost in perspective\n*It's expensive","June 27, 2014","true","4.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","1"

It's a great introduction to visual novels as the re-telling of Cinderella, it's a story that most will be familiar with - and one that breaks away from the more common Japanese based visual novels which can be a bit heavier going.\n\nWorth full price, definitely worth grabbing on sale or in a bundle.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chairmankao/recommended/293680/","chairmankao","chairmankao","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chairmankao/","1195 products in account","I originally had this game on my wishlist based on the art style alone. Turns out, it's a re-imagining of the tale of Cinderella. And it is a visual novel, where your choices have an actual impact on the story.\n\nGraphics / art - 5/10\nLet me get this out of the way since this is what first pulled me in. Mmmm ... not that impressive at the end of the day. Most of the characters look a little weird, and there's just not much animation. I know it's a visual novel, but it feels like they could have done a little more. So it's not bad, just not quite up to its potential in this area.\n\nStory / characters - 8/10\nThe story itself is slightly adapted, and I have to say the developers did a great job. The wicked stepmother and the two evil stepsisters are actual characters with personalities, and through the story you can understand some of the reasons why they behave as they do. Truly a tremendous spin on a stale old tale.\n\nThe developers also get into why there is a ball, which is pretty interesting.\n\nThe most annoying character is probably Cinders herself. In some ways she behaves like any normal person in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation would. However, other times she's a bit whiny and preachy.\n\nMy favorite character was actually the stepmother. She's less of a demon when you get to know her reasoning and motivations. And her drive is impressive.\n\nThe side characters beyond the main ones (Cinders and her step-family being the core characters), are less interesting, and it seems like there are some interesting mysteries into their backgrounds that unfortunately don't get fleshed out. Like what the relationship is between Cinder's mother and some of the other side characters. What happened to Cinder's mother?\n\nGameplay - 10/10\nAs with most visual novels, it's mostly reading. However, at key points you get to make decisions. I wish I had read about the game before playing to better appreciate the impact of decisions. It would have let me know how important it is to use all of your (I think) 10 save slots so that you don't have to restart the story from the beginning to find all the endings.\n\nBasically, you can be good, neutral or evil based on your decisions. And your decisions impact your route to the ball, which suitor you end up with, and whether you're even happy at the end. I overwrote a lot of my old saves as I went along, so I was really limited in my endings. However, I think there are a total of about 12 variations.\n\nPretty incredible, eh? The game itself isn't amazing, but when you realize how the developers freshened up the source material, you can't help but be impressed!\n\n8/10","March 6, 2015","true","4.6"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

The art is gorgeous (especially backgrounds!) and chock full of effects. It also makes me happy that the relationships between the female characters are the crux of the story - the stepmother and Cinder's sisters are complex characters, neither good nor evil; Cinder's behavior towards them brings out other sides to them, and lead to different futures. It also pleased me that the endings aren't entirely depended on whom Cinders falls in love with - they're about her choices for her future and who she wants to be in life. A hot guy can come along if he wants, sure. But Cinders is more than just a vehicle for player romance, she's a young woman looking for her path in life, for better or for worse. It was a pleasurable experience with lovely visuals, and I'm really looking forward to the team's next game, which looks like it will be even better.","September 25, 2014","true","7.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/echv/recommended/293680/","echv","Amelia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/echv/","221 products in account","Despite the idea and the setting, Cinders is NOT a fairytale story about mistreated girl getting her happy love ending  with the help of fairy godmother. Sure, there is a fairy, there is a ball, there is a Prince, there is a lost slipper (altough it's not a glass one, and she didn't really lose it...).\n\nWhat you get here instead, is a story about dealing with your broken family. Both, your Stepmother and your Stepsisters have developed troubled personalities hidden under masks of the roles they trying (or are simply forced) to fullfil, and it's up to you to chose what kind of "happy ending" do you want to get, not only for yourself, but also for your family. Will you try to work things out together and help them develop? Or will you destroy them, to get what you want? Or maybe you'll run away from everything and search for your Happy Ending somewhere else? Or maybe you'll become someone you used to despised yourself? Even though the story is set in stricte fairytale world, it portrays MODERN issues of many dysfunctional families out there. And that I find the biggest attraction of this game, along with very beautiful aesthetics.\n\nOn the downside... The game felt like it lacked some more individual panels to look at (as this is what the gameplay is all about- to look at lovely pictures and read a story you can influence with the choices of your own ). Possible romance options could have been developed much further ( 'cmon! You give us 3 handsome dudes and make us lick the window instead of touching the shinies >.< ! ). And unfortunately,  there is no voice-acting, at all. All this makes me feel that 15,99€ is way to expensive for the content it offers. Even though, I still give Cinders thumbs up \o/.\n","August 18, 2014","true","10.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rixatrix/recommended/293680/","rixatrix","Rixatrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rixatrix/","134 products in account","What initially drew me to Cinders was the combination of the female protagonist, visual novel category, and the lovely artwork. From the looks of it, Cinders seemed like it would be a wonderful game, and it definitely delivered! I just started my second playthrough, and I have been loving every minute of gameplay.\n\nFirst, I absolutely must rave about the gorgeous art by Gracjana Zielinska! The character designs were unique and stunning, and the backgrounds were lavish and interesting. I loved how little details would appear or move in the background - that gave the graphics a "little something" extra to catch the eye! I could not get enough of the beautiful visuals and tried to research if she had done work on other games. I found out about Solstice, a mystery thriller visual novel coming soon, and Phantasmat, a hidden objects game. I am much more into visual novels, but the artwork alone is compelling me to give Phantasmat a chance also!\n\nSecond, the gameplay placed player choice front and center, and especially in a visual novel, I appreciated this greatly. Choices were frequent and truly affected the story; the "Rewards" section from the game's menu lets you see how many of the variants you've explored to the ending, and in my ending, I've only explored 25% so far, so there is still a lot for me to experience! I did do some saving/loading to see what would happen with certain choices and was very pleased with the level of difference I discovered. In addition, certain choices add adornments to the menu page - this made game progress even more exciting because I wanted to see what else would be added where. :) ... and it brought out the completionist in me! I am excited to unlock all the endings and as many variants as I can.\n\nThird, the characters were unpredictably rich. Coming into a fairytale-inspired game, I expected the same character tropes, but while the characters were similarly-situated, they were far deeper than the superficial Cindarella cast I was used to! Cinders, for example, can be played to be quite pragmatic, or pig-headed, or honest, or devious, or a mix of the aforementioned, and based on my ending, I think the choice of these traits truly affects the outcome of the game. Madame Ghede was a favorite character of mine - I wanted to know so much more about her! She was enigmatic and wise, revealing a hint of the effects of what seemed to me a very detailed life. The stepmother (Carmosa) and step-sisters (Sophia and Gloria) were also multi-faceted, and there was more than meets the eye to Captain Perrault, as well.\n\nThe game's soundtrack suited it perfectly -- it was not overbearing, but rather complementary. Chimes indicated decisions, and subtle pieces (like at the Lake) would round out an enchanting experience. I wish the soundtrack had been included in a bundle because it would be a wonderful way to relax. :)\n\nIf you like visual novels, female protagonists, gorgeous artwork, fairytales, lots of choice that affects the ending, and a hint of romance, I highly recommend this game. If you adore Gracjana Zielinska's artwork (like I now do), you should also check out the upcoming visual novel from the same developer (Moacube) Solstice and the hidden objects game from Big Fish, Phantasmat.

As a result there are several endings to be unlocked, and a single playthrough can take anywhere between 3-5 hours I think. The art is done remarkably well, even if the faces lack of bit of character and the whole thing feels very polished. Except for a few typos, that is.\n\nI would recommend it to everyone who knows the story or just likes reading. But please note that it's not so much a game, but more of an interactive book.

How will she/you react to your stepmother's machinations?  Will you tell her off or be meek?  Do you love the prince for himself or do you just want to increase your social stature?  Do you fall in love with a childhood friend instead of the prince?  Do you choose no one at all?\n\nThe graphics are flat-out gorgeous.  The art is lush, vibrant, and full of life.

I have tried it and I have to say that I'm slightly disapointed with the experience. I mean, don't get me wrong, the game itself is quite nice, it has wonderful artwork, the characters and scenario are very well made but, to me, it just lacks a few touches that would make it even more special.\n\nOne of the things that really bothered me right from the start was the awful sound you get when the text is being shown. After awhile it almost feels like needles in your brain! Since I couldn't take it I turned it off and to my surprise there wasn't a single alternative other than pure silence. Like I mentioned before, I have played similar games and most of them have someone reading the lines, which makes it less boring and easy on the eyes. I mean, lets face it, having to read several lines from beginning to end can get extremely boring after awhile. Especially since most people will have to do multiple playthroughs and the game doesn't offer a proper way of skipping the lines you already read. Yes, you have the option to re-read the previous line but you can't skip to the next. You can click several times to make the text appear a bit faster but imagine doing that, pretty much, from beginning to end...\n\nI believe the game should have other small touches such as background noises. For example, when we have the outdoor scenes it would be nice to have the sound of birds, wind, etc; when attending the ball at the palace we could have music playing, people talking or when Cinders is at home, in her room the sound of the fire in the fireplace. Those little details, apart from having different people reading the characters lines would make this game better and interesting than it already is. Plus, I believe it would help justify its price. To be completely honest with you, and even though I recommend it, don't buy it unless you can get it cheap.","February 8, 2015","true","10.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

This game, however, is not even close to being a dating sim (although there are different romance options you can choose to pursue) and the art style is miles away from anime and very beautiful.\n\nThe story is a retelling of the Cinderella fairytale with a lot more depth, featuring well-rounded characters, complicated familial relations and meaningful choices. It emphasizes the extent to which characters' personal choices are limited by/the product of their circumstances and surroundings. The wicked stepmother and stepsisters are not simple archetypal chracters but complex figures with motivations and agendas that arise from their life circumstances. The main character Cinders, the young woman who lives as a servant in her own house, is trying to take destiny in her own hands and break free from her current circumstances, but cannot do so without outside help. The game makes a point: despite her desire to be independent and have agency, her available options are nevertheless to some extent the product of particular conditions that are outside of her influence (of her father marrying as he did, of her mother ensuring Cinders gets help when she needs it, etc).\n\nThe writting is very good and the choices in the game are meaningful; I found replaying the game to explore different results very interesting. The first playthrough takes about 3 hours, while subsequent playthroughs can be made a lot shorter as there's an option to skip through dialogues that you've read in previous playthroughs.\n\nDefinitely recommended for people who love good stories and don't mind reading a bunch.","October 19, 2015","true","11.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

By biggest gripe is that whilst you do make choices that can alter the storyline and the ending, there isn't much variation aside from a few scenes playing out differently and a different set of text showing up for the ending 'cutscene'.\n\nBut other than that it is a well crafted title. The art work is good and unlike similar games the characters have some (albeit limited) animation. Since you will probably play through the game multiple times there is a very useful function that allows you to quickly skip through dialogue you have already seen, stopping at anything that is new and at any choice you have to make.\n\nIf you are a fan of reading and fairy tales you will probably enjoy the game. If a wall of text sends you in to a fit of rage then you should probably avoid this one.

You are given enough choice to influence the game and feel as though you have control over your own fate, but not so many choices as to make each individual choice feel meaningless or to ruin the narrative structure.\n\nAfter finishing it the first time, I loaded a little while back and tried to try out some other choices, and was initially very disappointed — it felt that no matter what I chose, there were very few endings open to me, and they were virtually identical. It wasn't until I started again from the beginning that I realised this wasn't because my choices were meaningless, but because all my previous choices and developed the world in such a way that those outcomes were the only realistic consequences of the character I constructed in the situation I placed her in.\n\nOn the whole, if you don't like Virtual Novels, you won't like this one. If you're looking for something a bit more 'gamey', like Long Live the Queen, this will probably be too simplistic for you. But if you like reading, even if you were never into 'choose your own adventure' stories, this is probably worth picking up.\n\nGame-play aside, the game is ~gorgeous~ and the music lovely.

Cinders also stood out as she was a very likeable protagonist, with a lot of personality.\n\nThe major con of this game is it's length, there are relatively few endings, it would have been nice to see more possible love interests/lifestyle paths for Cinders as a lot more of it is based on who is allied with her at the end and whether she is good, or bad. You can finish most, if not all, endings in one sitting, so it, unfortunately, has little replay value story-wise.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend Cinders as a beautiful and atmospheric experience, utilising it's game qualities to enhance the events taking place.

It's a bit difficult to take a scene seriously sometimes when characters call her "Cinders"\n- The game doesn't tell you what personality you have stacked or what progress your relationships are...so sometimes it's hard to know how to progress and confusing if a certain dialogue option doesn't work\n--> Leads to lots of trial and error\n- Failing to get the variation you want can be a bit frustrating for completionists\n- The music isn't too memorable\n- No homosexual romances, all 3 love interests are male\n- No customization of how Cinders looks\n- No voices\n\nThis is a wonderful, extensive visual novel and possibly one of the best I've ever played. I've always criticized Cinderella as a character for being one of the most passive protagonists in the history of fairy tales, but in this game you can make her to be the woman you always wanted her to be. She also doesn't always have to marry the prince and sometimes the ending isn't going to be happy. You could even die and have no one mourn over you. The possibilities are vast, giving it lots of replay value. All the art is gorgeous to look at as well so oftentimes I just stop reading and take in the scene.\n\nThe developers were right in advertising this game as a "mature" take on the fairy tale, as all the characters are ambiguous. You can never truly figure each of them out and most of the time, they will surprise you. The game does a wonderful job of consistently claiming that no one is so simple as "good" or "evil" and even the kingdom is going through a metamorphosis if you pay attention to the Prince's plot. Speaking of which, the writing is downright brilliant and atmospheric since it is a western visual novel. There are unfortunately no voices, but little nuances in what the characters say give your imagination plenty to give the characters voices of your own.\n\nIf you enjoy visual novels with emphasis on dialogue choices, protagonist identity, relationships, and no stat building, definitely buy this game. I hate tedious stat building myself and much prefer making decisions through dialogue. All relationships are accessible provided you have made the choices to develop them; they don't rely on you being "cute" enough or "intelligent" enough. Despite my glowing recommendation however, Cinders is by no means perfect and I eagerly await anything else the developers have building off of this amazing genre.","January 21, 2015","true","11.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterevilace/recommended/293680/","masterevilace","A Fancy Fridge Magnet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterevilace/","707 products in account","A visual novel based on the story Cinderella.\nThis game really presents itself well; it's probably the most polished visual novel I've played, with the only real issue being a typo I found. Simple things like the effect of text appearing on the screen look really great.\nThe art style is colorful, beautiful, and detailed. There's some animation effects on the backgrounds which adds a lot more to the feel of the game than you'd expect. Just small things like water of a lake shimmering, fire moving, sunrays, and things like that. The only character animations are really facial expressions, and sometimes they'll shift poses, but that's more of a rare thing... though the characters will change outfits or poses for different scenes.\nThe music is really well done and there's a good variety here, but nothing I really focused on much.\n\nThere are 4 endings, but multiple variations of those endings based on how you treated certain characters and things like that. So there's some replayability here, but the story still plays out mostly the same, with just some extra scenes and dialogue peppered in based on some choices you make. A lot of times I felt like the banter back and forth may not add a whole lot to the story, and doesn't create that much extra character depth... ultimately leading to longish periods of time between choice branches. This could also limit replayability, but there is a button to fast-forward through the dialogue that will still pause when there's a choice to be made, or when you reach a new scene you haven't seen before. A really awesome feature. Even though you can skip through quickly using this method, it still takes a LONG time to fast-forward through everything. The story is kind of that long... I think when I started a new story to get a different ending, it still took me an hour to play through even though I fast-forwarded through the majority of the story.\n\nThe choices in this game can affect a lot, I think. Even though the majority of scenes STILL happen no matter what, the differences in the story with how the characters treat you (and even how your character treats them) provides a more personal feel... rather than picking options that feel out-of-place of your character, your character changes with your options. It's pretty nice in this way.\n\nAnother really awesome detail this game provides is when you unlock achievements (which relate to the story and in-game decisions.) With each one you unlock, a change happens to the main menu screen... most of the time an item gets added to the scene. It's really a nice detail and just goes to show how much attention was put into this game. There's also a "reward" menu where you can see all the unique things you've unlocked, which is nice.\n\nOverall, the game is plenty long... I think my first play-through took around 3 hours... which is fairly typical. The long-windedness of some of the dialogue is the only thing that started to fatigue me. There are a lot of choices to be made to keep the interaction up and keep you engaged... the pacing is pretty good overall. When I first started playing the story seemed to throw in your face the fact that the story is Cinderella, which I found a bit annoying and obnoxious, but after that was over with I really enjoyed it. It's Cinderella, so don't expect anything crazy with the main story... you're able to personalize it a bit with your own choices, but all the major plot-points are always hit.\n\nI'm definitely keeping an eye out on what this developer puts out next. I hope it's a new, unique story with the same love and care put into it that this game had.","July 4, 2014","true","5.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The many character trait and action choices that actually impact the story’s end make this visual novel stand out. I’ve played through it several times and still have not found all the paths.\n\nMusic: Most visual novels’ and sims’ soundtracks have me hunting for the mute button, but this one is gorgeous.\n\nVisuals: Gracjana Zielinska’s art has a detailed, ethereal quality without becoming prissy or cutesy.  It’s beautiful.  I’m so pleased she’s returning for Solstice.\n\nProgramming: I appreciate the ability to quickly skip through already viewed scenes with one button press.  All visual novels should implement this.\n\nWriting: *thunk**thunk* *thunk*  That noise, dear friend, is the characters’ dialog and the insights into their behavior being delivered with all the subtlety of a frying pan to the back of the skull. The reader is never left to infer anything. Cinders’ inner monologue or other characters will spell it out. During the first long conversation between Cinders and Sophia, they tell their back-story and motivations to one another without the reservation and self-protection that the back-story would naturally have bred.  It drove me crazy until I remembered Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov. Yes, the two works don’t seem to have much in common but bear with me. Like Karazmov, Cinders uses characters to represent a consistent type of person rather than how you and I would interact on a day-to-day basis. Once you go with it, they both deliver a good story and observations on human nature.  Boom. A 2012 visual novel saved by Dostoevsky.\n\nWriting: The banter between characters usually makes me smirk (Sophia and Gloria should have their own spin-off). The only exception is the romantic dialog. Excuse me for a moment, game, while I fetch some nachos to go with all this cheese. Fortunately, the game has many endings with no romance whatsoever.\n\nWriting: The grammar, spelling, and word choice are nearly perfect. Kudos to the editor.\n\nFemale Characters: The writers clearly spent more of their effort developing the women. Cinders, Carmosa, Gloria, Sophia, and Madame Ghede all have distinct personalities and goals. Sophia’s snark is always welcome: “The only things missing from this picture is holding hands and singing. And dancing. Possibly in circles. In the middle of a flowery meadow. I think I might throw up.” I want an ending in which she and Cinders escape together.\n\nMale Characters: The men aren’t bad, but they lack the depth and care the women received. I won’t dwell on them (particularly since the developer has already addressed this), but here’s a brief run-down.  Tobias is a childhood friend who tends to deliver motivation speaker advice with the aforementioned frying pan; I want to like you, Toby, but you have to stop thwacking me over the head.  Perrault is a guard captain caught between duty and ethics; he is my favorite of the three.  Prince Basile is he least developed of the three, though the conversations between him and Perrault are good. He and Cinders discuss Levia Malich’s work in a scene ripped straight from Ever After, but other than that I enjoy their interactions.\n\nBottom Line: I recommend this to anyone (not just women) who wants a strong, competent protagonist and enjoys tinkering to discover different endings. If you happen to have a snarky sense of humor, even better.","May 8, 2014","true","5.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This visual novel is all about giving us reasons to understand why these characters act the way they do, and obviously I don't want to spoil anything, but contrary to the popular notion that the antagonists (or anti-heroes in this story) are in cahoots, *nobody* likes each other. And despite her cruelty, even said step-mother has her issues, where most of her actions are explained, understandable, and sympathetic. (In my playthrough, I never got a good answer for why she treats Cinders like an old rag, though.)\n\nOf course, what to do with this information is for you to decide. If you feel like disregarding any understanding of these characters' own personal plights and personally attacking them whenever they get in your way, you are allowed this option. Maybe you want to pick a side in this sisterly conflict and get close to Sophia or Gloria; this is something you may do as well. In fact, participating in the subversion of this fairy tale is entirely up to you. You may wish to ask the fairies for help, marry the prince at the expense of your sisters' and step-mother's chances, and live Happily Ever After The End, assuming you can even reach that point. You can also be like me and revell in the story's subversive qualities, actively trying to understand and unite the sisters against their overbearing mother. It's all up to you, and no matter which path you take, the game's story never ever falters, because it's the story *you* want to make. It helps that the game's writing and story are (mostly) beautiful in each path and never fails to at least be interesting.\n\nAlso, if you couldn't tell by the video and screenshots, the visuals and audio are top-notch. While the somewhat sparse and somewhat static character models can be a bit stiff in their animations (Cinders herself seems to be placed in a perpetual slouch, which, when you think about it, is kind of the point), the backgrounds are always stunningly gorgeous, with details that come alive despite through their hand-drawn aesthetic. The BGM makes up for its limited selection by being amazingly well-produced, even while synthetic (nobody would have expected a full orchestra from an indie studio anyway). The design here is elegent in its subtlety, with slightly differing text sounds for different characters' speech and dim auras surrounding the current speaker.\n\nI only take small issue in some of the design choices. For instance, I wish that the game wouldn't notify me whenever a consequence of a certain past decision is being played out. Every time I make a choice, its resulting difference is noted by a small plant symbol that appears in the upper-right corner of the screen. Often these are made up of small speech alterations that have little effect on the main story except for alterations in the character's dispositions and their own personal decisions, and sometimes I couldn't tell how a certain sentence would have differed had I made a different choice, or what choice with which that particular piece of text was even associated. Regardless, I'd much rather the mystery of how my decisions change the story be left to my own intuition.\n\nAlso on the subject of choices, I wish the game wouldn't limit the ability to rewind through decisions made to see all of their immediate effects, especially if the feature's primary marketability involves important and lasting changes that won't necessarily take affect until much later in the story (and at that point, who wants to rewind that far back?). If the game wants me to shape the story the way I see fit, then there's really no need to limit this feature. I understand that certain decisions are meant to be important, lasting, and heavy, and perhaps a rewind feature would take away from this heaviness (there was a moment late in the game where I was confronted with a decision that would essentially determine the ending I'd get and I had to think very hard about my decision), but there are just as many conversational choices that have exactly the opposite effect of their perceived intention. I found myself in a conversation with Gloria on Day 4 during which I said some things I wish I hadn't, and, given the option to take them back, I probably would have. Perhaps this is meant to reflect the weight of real-life decision-making, but this game isn't about that. It's about player choice, and if I'm given a choice that, when chosen, results in the opposite of its intended effect (e.g. Cinders says something rude and condescending when I meant the comment to be compassionate and understanding), then I'd like the option to take it back.\n\nFinally, and least importantly, some of the writing in the game is a bit off. Cinders often goes about psychoanalyzing literally everybody she meets, and while this isn't chiefly wrong, since it supports the game's concept of fairy-tale subversion by revealing very real character traits in the people she encounters, it is a bit heavy-handed and perhaps a bit too obvious. Sometimes I wish I could figure these things out for myself without necessarily having Cinders tell me (and the character) directly, and there are other ways for Cinders to handle the conversations and actions she engages. There are a couple of blatant (but necessary) exposition dumps, but this isn't too horrible. There is also some questionable grammar, like the use of -t instead of -ed (e.g. "spoilt" instead of "spoiled") but this may be era-specific, or the use of a "than" in place of a "then" or a "where" in place of a "were."\n\nThese are minor complaints compared to the quality of the game. If you want to play through it four times to unlock all four endings, it's definitely worth $20. Each playthrough will last you about 5 hours, depending on your reading speed. If you only want to play through it once, it's in the current Humble Bundle (as of writing this), or you can wait for the next big sale.","July 4, 2014","true","4.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","5"

The game is somewhat insistent with its themes, but they're pretty good things to hear and I think anyone can gain something or learn something about themselves from reading this.\n\nIt hits all the high notes. The characters are nuanced and complicated and the decisions you make really do make an impact; the game even has a nice feature that notifies you when changes to the plot and dialogue is happening.

It takes the story of Cinderella and puts more control for Cinderella's character (in this case Cinders) to make her own way. It even allows a bad ending if you play extremely Genre blind. It is a visual novel and reads like some classic literature where there are long dialogues that are more banter than plot advancement, which may not appeal to some.\n\nThat said, the art and music is positively beautiful and it does a good job of making characters attractive without overly sexifying them. Though I do wish that Cinders would ♥♥♥♥ing stand up straight. Which does not really matter except for certain late game events where her posture hurts the effect she's supposed to have. It does suit the early parts of the story and is positively nitpicking on my part.\n\nThere is some discussion on whether the game really promotes independence, as a lot of the independence options are tracked as evil or morally questionable.

The next line is kind of a spoiler, I guess?\nRegardless of the choices you make, it doesn't change because Cinders will still dance with His Lordship, who'll flirt and she'll smirk and coo 'tell me more darling' while I sit here wondering if she's forgotten her dear Captain's poetry already.\nMaybe if I make more drastic choices it'll change, but I doubt it.\n\nThat said, that's honestly an incredibly minor detail (because skip function.

I think most people can agree that more gameplay time is preferable. However, I'd like to say that this is the ONLY flaw of this game (obviously, that's just my opinion though).\n\nIf you like visual novels, I highly recommend this one. Every single choice affects the ending of the story. There are also about a dozen different story ending combinations to be made. As the description of the game states, it is an adult version of the Cinderella story. However, Cinders (her name in this version) doesn't have to be the traditional character she's known to be. She can be villainous, independent, strong-willed, ambitious, etc. She can have whatever type of personality you want her to have. The best part is that she doesn't have to go after the prince. She can plot revenge against her stepmother and stepsisters, unlike the traditional character. She can be absolutely defiant and rebellious, also unlike the traditional character. But let's say you want her to be a nice, good person, but still establish her independence (from the Prince and her stepfamily), you can do that combination as well! Point being, this doesn't have to be the typical Cinderella story unless you want it to be. The story and the character are what you make it and for a visual novel, that's the best a gamer can ask for.\n\nOther good things about the game:\n- The artwork is beautiful (and sort of gothic).\n- The music is well-done and fitting to the atmosphere of the game.\n- There are other suitors Cinders can go for other than the Prince.\n- The gamer can see the point of view/character development of the stepsisters/stepmother if they wish to (making them more human than the original story).\n- The game truly causes the gamer to put thought into the choices they make.\n\nI'll say it again: if you like visual novels, I HIGHLY recommend this game.","July 1, 2014","true","18.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The choices are meaningful, it explores the complexity of family abuse, child raising, sibling rivalry, classism, reputation... it's the most REAL exploration of a "fairy tale" I've ever seen! And there aren't any excuses thrown around to justify having only-white characters- there's actually people of color (well, Madame Ghede, who is amazing) and every. single. character. is made real and given life. After a few play-throughs you really get a feel for WHO Cinders is, who her sisters and stepmother are, even who her dead mother and dead father were, PLUS all the romance options, AND the prince, and even side characters who are just townspeople!\n\nI would scream with joy if this company/group made an entire serious of games just like Cinders, but exploring the other fairy tales... Snow White, Rapunzel, the Snow Queen by HCA, AS MANY AS POSSIBLE. Then they could start bundling them and selling them as packs. Just a suggestion... or more of a heartfelt wish.\n\nNormally $20 is too much to pay for a game, but I ASSURE YOU that this game is WORTH IT!!! I played it for hours and hours and hours and I still never got every single ending!\n\nAnd the game is NOT just a dating sim- who you make Cinders, her values, her beliefs, her choices- these all have long term implications for the nation, the ruling family, HER family, and her life.

The writing is terrible: none of the characters talk like real people; main character not only has no personality, but is bad at assuming the motivations of the player choices available (it sounds like someone is telling her what to do and feel through an earpiece, and she forgot to read the script); weak plot motivations. Also, for a game that seems to be trying to tout strong female characterization, the female characters in here sure are huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Not one of them is likable.\nIssues elsewhere include: only 8 save slots even though you get prompted for a choice every two minutes (filled all my saves in less than 20 minutes), protagonist's dialogue arbitrarily switches from outward conversation to internal narration with absolutely no visual or audio indicators, backgrounds have perspective completely wrong (for it to be right the camera POV would have to be at thigh-height, at least 15 meters away from the characters, which is absurd), no volume adjustment, only 3 text speed settings.\nThe only good things about it are the menu and background animations, which are pretty great, but it's unfortunate that they're wasted on this game.\nps: The wandering eyes and some of the expressions are really disturbing sometimes. http://puu.sh/idvkg.jpg\npss: Typos.

There is no voice acting so if that isn't your thing you should pass.  As the game's title suggests this is a different take on the classic fairy tale Cinderella with several differnt ways to end the story.  The biggest question in this style of game is usually "How much does my decisions throughout the game change the story?"  the answer to this question is the usual amount.  The decisions you make for the vast majority of the game seems to replace one piece of interchangable diologue with another.  It seems that if Cinders acts in a largely uncarictaristic manner the supporting will seem to forget previous conversations and act accordingly which kind of killed the mood for me.  Ultimately only a few decisions actually change the ending but an unexpected surprise is that the decisions you make add some nice flavor to the endings which is a really nice touch.  Often times in Cinders characters make social commentary this may rub some people the wrong way considering the political nature of video games at the moment, so, be prepared for that.\n\nAstetics and music: The game is illustrated by Gracjana Zielinska and the influence is there in spades and this gives the game an amazing look.  The music is nice and enjoyable but knows its place in a background role so if you are a slower reader the music doesn't get annoying which I think is important for this style of game.\n\nIs it worth the money?  The game is currently $19.99 on steam although it was recently a part of the humble eye candy bundle.  I can't reccomend this title at the current price tag.  If the games goes on sale for under $5 or if the bundle returns it will be well worth a play through.","July 16, 2014","true","5.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Flipping that mechanic on its head was kind of interesting. This game had some weak writing at points, but the characters felt real. Like they were written by someone with world experience. Villians don't have to be viillans because they wear a black cape and hate people. Maybe they're not really villians at all.\n\nBut it was a fun story and it has a wide variety of highly different endings, so that your choices during the game actually make a very big difference. You can shoot for the traditional Cinderella route, or you can chart an entirely new course and run off into a different lifestyle, or more. However, in any case, I am content to read about the alternate endings rather than actually redo the entire game.\n\nI wouldn't mind playing another game from these people if they could edit out some of the slow points.","July 17, 2014","true","2.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Having not played or researched many games of the genre, I can't really comment on how innovative this is within the context of its genre. I was thinking of postponing a review of Cinders until after I had played more of the genre, but I doubt I will do this in the near future. So here is a review, to be returned to if I do ever have something to add.\n\nA pretty great interactive take on a classic tale, the large amount of well thought-out endings based on choices made through the game lend well to the feeling of coming of age of the heroine, Cinders. It is also a refreshing take to give Cinderella more agency and control over her life, though she as a character may not realise how much influence she has. The endings closest to the original fairytale really felt well-earned as you really felt like you had to push Cinders to making responsible decisions despite the temptation to let Cinders be snarky and dwell on revenge.\n\nAll-in-all the decisions felt quite organic in how they impacted the story despite the fixed events throughout the story and the number of game-influencing variables which is remarkable in any game. I thoroughly enjoyed replaying to find all the endings and the variants therein, and the eight save slots, fast-forward function and the flower indicator for branching story moments were a great help in this. It would have been nice to have an even faster way of scrolling or even skipping to the next decision, but what was there worked well.\n\nThe music was great and perfectly suited to the mood of the game, and so were the beautiful painted-looking environments.  The touch of movement and change in lighting was also well done, present but subtle. The character design is very solidly well done, such that the few trappings of anime and manga in the style are not off-putting even to those who they do not appeal to.\n\nIt is great to see this smart and well-made interactive retelling of Cinderella come to Steam where sales will hopefully help it reach a much greater audience.","July 26, 2014","true","14.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I got sucked into this game and I've absolutely loved it. I have some critical feedback for it, but that by no means negates the magificance of this interactive story.\n\nPros\n+ The writing is definitely the best I've ever encountered in a Steam visual novel. If you're a story-motivated gamer who appreciates a solid piece of high-quality writing, this game will be a breath of fresh air.\n+ Characterization goes above and beyond. No longer do you see the flat, 2-dimensional characters you've come to know from Disney's Cinderella. All the characters, even the "bad" ones, are more than what meets the eye. You also have a hand in tailoring Cinders's personality to your liking, which is fun. Cinders can be passive, manipulative, friendly, sensual, rebellious, responsible, romantic, family-oriented, or murderous... whatever floats your boat.\n+ The story gives you a feeling of control, which is imperative for me to enjoy VNs. Your choices *do* make a big difference, even if it seems like they're not really doing anything at first. The choices the story presents you with open up different paths and will give you different endings. Some choices create vastly different outcomes, others give more subtle changes.\n+ The artwork is stunning. Not only is it a unique style, but everything from the backgrounds to the characters looks polished and detailed.\n+ The characters are animated beautifully. Their expressions change, their postures change, and even their eyes move! I thought this was a nice touch.\n+ The soundtrack creates the perfect ambiance and it is simply exquisite to listen to.\n\nCons\n- It's not that long (I think my first playthrough was maybe 5 hours? but I read fast), especially when you do replays to get achievements and epilogues. A lot of time is spent skipping over scenes during replays because, depending on your choices, it's possible that only a few lines of text will change.\n- All relationship stats and personality stats are hidden, so you don't see how your stats are changing when you make choices. This makes it harder to see if you're on track with what you're wanting to do.\n- I wish there were more routes that could further deviate from the traditional Cinderella tale. For example, I wish there were options to not go to the ball, to choose no "fairy godmother" to help you, to gang up with your step-sisters to overtake Carmosa, to romance some other unexpected people (the Shady Character maybe? hahaha) or... the possibilities are endless! Basically, even though this game is already amazing, it could have been even cooler if there were some other creative pathways you could take.\n\nOverall, I whole-heartedly recommend this game. It's earned a special place in my heart. Though I can definitely find areas for improvement, this game is too much a great experience to pass up.","January 2, 2015","true","9.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There is no voice acting so if that isn't your thing you should pass.  As the game's title suggests this is a different take on the classic fairy tale Cinderella with several differnt ways to end the story.  The biggest question in this style of game is usually "How much does my decisions throughout the game change the story?"  the answer to this question is the usual amount.  The decisions you make for the vast majority of the game seems to replace one piece of interchangable diologue with another.  It seems that if Cinders acts in a largely uncarictaristic manner the supporting will seem to forget previous conversations and act accordingly which kind of killed the mood for me.  Ultimately only a few decisions actually change the ending but an unexpected surprise is that the decisions you make add some nice flavor to the endings which is a really nice touch.  Often times in Cinders characters make social commentary this may rub some people the wrong way considering the political nature of video games at the moment, so, be prepared for that.\n\nAstetics and music: The game is illustrated by Gracjana Zielinska and the influence is there in spades and this gives the game an amazing look.  The music is nice and enjoyable but knows its place in a background role so if you are a slower reader the music doesn't get annoying which I think is important for this style of game.\n\nIs it worth the money?  The game is currently $19.99 on steam although it was recently a part of the humble eye candy bundle.  I can't reccomend this title at the current price tag.  If the games goes on sale for under $5 or if the bundle returns it will be well worth a play through.","July 16, 2014","true","5.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Flipping that mechanic on its head was kind of interesting. This game had some weak writing at points, but the characters felt real. Like they were written by someone with world experience. Villians don't have to be viillans because they wear a black cape and hate people. Maybe they're not really villians at all.\n\nBut it was a fun story and it has a wide variety of highly different endings, so that your choices during the game actually make a very big difference. You can shoot for the traditional Cinderella route, or you can chart an entirely new course and run off into a different lifestyle, or more. However, in any case, I am content to read about the alternate endings rather than actually redo the entire game.\n\nI wouldn't mind playing another game from these people if they could edit out some of the slow points.","July 17, 2014","true","2.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Having not played or researched many games of the genre, I can't really comment on how innovative this is within the context of its genre. I was thinking of postponing a review of Cinders until after I had played more of the genre, but I doubt I will do this in the near future. So here is a review, to be returned to if I do ever have something to add.\n\nA pretty great interactive take on a classic tale, the large amount of well thought-out endings based on choices made through the game lend well to the feeling of coming of age of the heroine, Cinders. It is also a refreshing take to give Cinderella more agency and control over her life, though she as a character may not realise how much influence she has. The endings closest to the original fairytale really felt well-earned as you really felt like you had to push Cinders to making responsible decisions despite the temptation to let Cinders be snarky and dwell on revenge.\n\nAll-in-all the decisions felt quite organic in how they impacted the story despite the fixed events throughout the story and the number of game-influencing variables which is remarkable in any game. I thoroughly enjoyed replaying to find all the endings and the variants therein, and the eight save slots, fast-forward function and the flower indicator for branching story moments were a great help in this. It would have been nice to have an even faster way of scrolling or even skipping to the next decision, but what was there worked well.\n\nThe music was great and perfectly suited to the mood of the game, and so were the beautiful painted-looking environments.  The touch of movement and change in lighting was also well done, present but subtle. The character design is very solidly well done, such that the few trappings of anime and manga in the style are not off-putting even to those who they do not appeal to.\n\nIt is great to see this smart and well-made interactive retelling of Cinderella come to Steam where sales will hopefully help it reach a much greater audience.","July 26, 2014","true","14.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You /could/ be sweet and marry the prince, or your choices could take you down an entirely different path. The endings all have variables, so who helps you get to the ball, who you decide to pursue as a love interest, or various other factors on Cinders all affect the ending you see. As a personal note one think I love about the game is that the romance isn't necessarily the focus. Instead the focus is how Cinders decides to take control of her life and change it. You could do that via romance, or you could do something else.\n\nNone of the characters are just stock characters. They're all developed and have real personalities and reasons for acting the way they do. Even Cinders has a base personality that you affect and develop through your choices, but she never feels like a blank slate. If ever there was a visual novel where the choices matter, it's this one, a fitting trait given the focus of the game.\n\nOther factors about the game feel obvious. The art's gorgeous, even more so than the screenshots suggest. There are subtle movements in the background to enjoy that give Cinders that magical feel fairytales ought to have. Cinders is well written and well developed. Any fan of visual novels should pick this one up, and if you're interested in the genre this is definitely the game to start with.","September 25, 2014","true","18.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

A stunning and interesting adaptation of Cinderella, Cinders is a visual novel and Choose Your Own Adventure story that captures, in a grown-up way, the spirit you had and the magic you felt reading as a child. The only two things creating this world are artwork and music, as the dialogue – the heart of the game – is all text. Surprisingly, I did not come across many grammatical errors, and being the English major I am, I was certainly looking. Editors have done quite the job. The storytelling was thoughtful and well-crafted; the writing was intelligent and contained more adult humour than I expected. In the short period of time it took to get through the first playthrough (roughly five hours), the writing delved into the pasts of a few characters and built them up to be more than just one-dimensional.\n\nThough most of the art is static, the odd flicker of the fireplace, shimmer of water or subtle eye and lip movements somehow bring it entirely to life. Though more colourful and detailed, the artwork does remind me of that which you would find in old hardcover fairytale books. The ambient music is absolutely beautiful and changes with each scene, though because it was the only auditory element it did have me longing for even more variety at times (as the songs are repeated); I wish the soundtrack contained even more.\n\nThough based on a traditional story with a subdued and passive female protagonist, this modern adaptation takes some unexpected and satisfying departures and shines more light on the complex relationships between the characters and Cinders’ struggle for independence and thirst for freedom. There is a focus on family and the conflicts between taking care of others and taking care of oneself. The heart of the story is finding one’s own path in life and understanding that each choice you make has a consequence, either immediately or in the future, for both yourself and those around you. In this way, the replay value of this game is pretty spectacular: it has four possible endings. And in all honesty, I think I am actually going to play through to see all of them.\n\nIf you enjoy reading and visual novels, Cinders is absolutely with a playthrough (or four!).","January 24, 2015","true","6.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Playing as Cinders, who got this nickname from her deceased father because of her flaming red hair, you finally get to have a hand in your own fate. Develop your own personality, from kind and smart to Machiavellian and downright evil. Will you try to understand your stepmother and stepsisters and repair your relationship with them or are you looking to give them a taste of their own medicine? Will you pursue the handsome prince, flirt with your childhood friend, or even charm the captain of the guard?\n\nOr perhaps romance is not what you're looking for, and you'd rather re-acquire your family's estate... Anything is possible!\n\nPros+ Gorgeous, magical art, especially the backgrounds\n+ Lovely soundtrack\n+ Choices affect your personality values, which creates a branching path to MANY different endings\n+ Goes against fairy tale tropes & provides a new spin on Cinderella\n\nCons- Preachy, lifeless, and unnecessarily long dialogue\n- Very few save points considering the amount of choices\n- Characters' eye animation sometimes heads straight into uncanny valley\n- Some story elements are never fully resolved (i.e., The Fairy and the Shady Character)\n\nI enjoyed Cinders mostly because of the excellent combination of fantastic fairy tale feel (thanks to the gorgeous art) and the fact that Cinders herself had a tremendous amount of agency. Sometimes I felt like the game tried too hard to go against fairy tale tropes, creating preachy dialogue with especially the stepsisters in trying to show their point of view in their difficult household.

Why? Because Cinderella cries and her Fairy Godmother magically fixes everything for her. Seriously? A crybaby princess? I think I’d prefer narcoleptic Sleeping Beauty over that.\n\nThankfully, Cinders is not that story.\n\nInstead, Cinders is a game where you need to decipher the motivations and secrets of the people around you. You want a Fairy Godmother? Of course you can have one! You just have to work for it. You have to use logic to figure out what the best choices are, and, unlike some other VNs, the choices you have to make actually do make sense when you think about it. There are also many choices to make (I counted 47 on my first playthrough), so the game has plenty of re-playability if you want to get every ending. In addition, I found the artwork to be beautiful (or at least charming) and the dialogue was very believable (and funny at times).\n\nThe two critiques I have of this game were easily overlooked by me, but I figured they were worth mentioning. First, the buttons are a little off. Intuitively, you would think that you would hover over the words for each button in order to make your choice. However, you actually have to be about half a centimeter above the buttons in order to click things. It’s not a deal-breaker, but it’s slightly annoying. Second, you’re playing as Cinders. Therefore, the game has an obviously girly theme. Even as a girl, I always thought that fairy tale princesses were too girly, and I never cared for them that much. I can imagine that, as a guy, this game might be a bit much. However, I would like to say that you can definitely still enjoy Cinders if you’re a masculine guy, as long as you’re an avid fan of VNs. If you think it’s still too girly, wait until Moa Cube releases Solstice.\n\nOverall, Cinders is a very good VN and if you’re fan of the genre, you should definitely give this one a go.","July 23, 2014","true","7.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's a story about women, their choices, motives and personalities and how all this lead to very different lives and consequences. But more than that, it's a story about Cinders - smart, brave, kind and ambitious girl, who doesn't want to sit and wait for her happiness and prince who saves her, but rather takes her fate into her own hands.\nThe game is really replaying and roleplaying - all your choices have their consequences that may not appear now, but take place later, when you almost forgot about them, so chose wisely. You have many possibilities to turn story in your favor, every ending has many variants and sometimes it change the tone of an ending completely. Your Cinders can be kind and modest, wise and bold, egoistic and rude - all this change the story that you see. I really recomend you to try and play, especially if you fan of visual novels or choices and consequences games. Cinders really worth a shot.

Well rounded, fleshed out characters (even for the "evil" and minor characters) gives this a vibrant color and tone that is often missing, both from fairy tales or from games. Rather than giving certain endings an official seal of approval, Cinders uses this potential ambiguity to allow players to ask themselves what the "best" ending should look like.\n\nAll in all, this results in a thoughtful and "political" game -- not through design choices or the author's intent to make a specific statement, but merely by reflecting the player's choices back to them in a realistic and candid fashion.","July 11, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Part of what made the game for me was how three dimensional the characters are. In the original tale the step mother and sisters were such evil caricatures that they are as realistic as any pantomime villian (i.e not at all). In Cinders, while still mostly despicable, they are fleshed out and given realistic motivations for their actions and that helps the whole tale resonate much more. There are quite a few paths through based on what descisions you make during conversations so there is some replay value, though you will have to sit through quite a bit of the same text and dialogue if you wish to see them all, as often the variations aren't major until the end.

I was a bit skeptical at first, thinking this would be the typical "Oh, a fifteen minute story. Great." but the first runthrough took me about an hour and I loved it every step of the way. There's a bunch of different endings and choices, and it really doesn't feel like you're being driven to choose a certain path. Each replay will give you around 20 minutes of gametime, and each ending is genuinely different. It's a fun little game that you'll enjoy.\n\nThat being said, I would NEVER spend 20 (!) dollars on this game. I got this game in a Humble Bundle along with a few other games (Antichamber, Kami, 140, and a few others) and paid around 5 dollars total. If you can get Cinders for less than a few bucks like I did, I'd highly recommend it.","July 8, 2014","true","5.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

With a great sense of humor, the writing references numerous fairy tales and pokes fun at their tropes. The eponymous character, Cinders, is interesting, witty, and strong, no matter whether you choose to make her choose a more naive path or one taking a great deal more effort and self reliance. The romance element is nicely worked in such that you can entirely avoid having it be a big part of Cinders' life and future, or you can carry on multiple affairs at once, allowing them to shape that future. Although it was nice to see the "evil" stepsisters represented as a bit less two-dimensional, I can't help but feel an opportunity was lost in not giving them more of a role in the story. It would have been great to see endings in which Cinders assists one or both of the sisters in acheiving their goals. On the whole, though, a solid game with some replay value, especially if you save at key turning points in the story so you don't have to go back to the very beginning each time.","August 14, 2014","true","9.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The music is wonderful, with synchronized changes and leitmotif cues.\n\nI'm new to visual novels, and the concept and writing drew me in. Choices are presented frequently and sensibly enough, with a flower appearing in the top-right corner to note when your choice impacted your playthrough outcome. The nonlinearity of the choices provides multiple interesting paths to four basic outcomes with multiple permutations based on your relationships with other characters, as well as your protagonist's personality. Subsequent playthroughs are easy, as dialogue can be skipped (super fast-forward), automatically stopping at new dialogue or choices.\n\nThe writing is generally solid and engaging, with very few spots that are slightly clunky but easily forgivable. Character development is deep for the four women, and amusingly and probably intentionally, the supporting cast of men are somewhat one-dimensional. The concept of a reimagined Cinderella itself is quite fun and more contemporary with an emphasis on female protagonist agency, with some very helpful friends to retain the fanciful nature of the original story.\n\nIf you're new to visual novels but like things like Joe Dever's Lone Wolf saga, RPGs with deep character development, and Telltale's Walking Dead series, and consider the possibility that games can be art, you would probably enjoy this.","September 6, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has all the elements of Cinderella: A ball, a prince you can pursue, evil stepsisters and stepmother, and a fairy godmother. However, Cinders herself is a strong, optimistic, and self-reliant woman capable of taking her future into her own hands. Her stepsisters and stepmother are well developed characters that you can get to know and maybe even understand. The fairy godmother isn't perfect and neither is the prince. Add to that the Captain, the town witch, and Cinder's old friend the merchant, and you have a variety of extremely interesting characters with their own stories and complicated relations to you and each other. Throughout the game, your interactions with them and your decisions for Cinders helps her decide which path to freedom to take. Each broad ending has a variety of unique and lovely sub-types.\n\nIf this hasn't told you this game is worth playing, then add to that the lovely artwork with small background animations and very realistic and expressive character art, the beautiful music, and the tiny fact that the dialogue speed matches the speed of the character speaking. This last fact really helps you mentally hear how people are speaking. Honestly, it's as close as you can get to voice acting without actually having voice acting in it.\n\ntl;dr Go play Cinders.

You can just read and make some choices here and there.\n- It's very different from "Disney's Cinderella."

I'll be honest, I don't know much about the original story, so I can't say how close it follows that story (all I can say for sure is that there are "evil" stepsisters and stepmother, and the whole "glass slipper" part, everything else I'm not familiar with), but the story presented in Cinders was very well done. During my three and a half hour playthrough, I had to choose between one of four endings, and many other side plots (such as romantic interests, how you interact with with your stepsisters, etc.). While most of your choices don't mean much in the grand scheme of things, I did appreciate the fact that you are presented with a fair amount of choices, and multiple interesting choices for each (for example, do I want to lower the price with the shopkeeper by haggling, being seductive, appealing to friendship, or just pay full price? And then, if you do get to lower the price, do you spend that money (which is your stepmother's) on yourself, or give it to her?).\n\nOne thing that I really enjoyed, that I haven't seen in my limited experience in VNs, is that the game tells you (visually, with a flower that is displayed in the top right of the screen) when you view a conversation that can have different outcomes. This, combined with the fact that you can super fast-forward through text you've already seen, means that it gave me a big enough incentive to replay the game multiple times. With four different endings, and multiple other minor differentiations, I ended up spending about eight hours total.\n\nWhile not important, the graphics are very impressive. Not only this, but characters are animated as are minor background pieces. This game definitely delivers in the "Eye Candy" department in the Humble Bundle I got it in.\n\nI can't think of anything negative about the game...it is a VN, so this game won't be for everyone, but for what it is, it does it well.

Some parts seem a little boring but that usually changes pretty fast. All the characters are quite interesting, especially Sophia, who is probably the most fun to speak to, and also the shady character, who I wish we knew more about. I don't agree with all of the characterization that is done in this game and all its paths, but I can appreciate them nonetheless.\n\n\n\nI do wish there were some other options for Cinder (maybe less of some and more of others) and that it was perhaps a little longer, and I don't like every part of it, but it's a good game, I'd rate it a solid 7/10 or 8/10, depending on what path you choose. The art is brilliant, as well as the music, and the atmosphere the game itself creates is very inspiring! I enjoy reading, so this was pleasant, though I could see some people getting more bored, more often, than I did. It does have its faults (I spotted one or two spelling errors), but it's got quite a few hours of fun in it.\n\n(Sidenote: I bought this when it was on sale, and I'd recommend others do the same if they get the chance.)","November 7, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cinders feels short but it does have a good story/alternate endings.\n\nArtwork - 9.5/10.\n\n* Cinders' facial anatomy is uneven in an unnattractive way and some expressions make her eyes rotate which uh they don't do in real life. Also the prince has a lazy eye.\n\n* Overall graphically the game looks great. It really does, it has a french painting type feel to the entire game, and it has wonderful coloring/shading Though the ballgowns were lazy recolorings with different lace/necklaces. Boring. Where's the creativity!?\n\nStory/Gameplay - 8/10.\n\n* The story does change depending on what choice you make, but without looking up the wikia page of Cinders, there's  no way of knowing what skill you gain or didn't gain by choosing that option. It isn't always obvious what the smart/bad/good choices were.\n\n* Having a meter on the left side of the page would be super helpful as there's a lot of unused space there. (Spoiler following.) (Getting the "fair" queen ending especially, as well as the Machiavellic Queen endings. First playthrough I had the Evil queen four times before figuring out what I was doing wrong. :/ Not fun. It made things extremely frustrating for me.\n\n* Half point loss for me is lacking the ability to go back and see moments such as the (spoiler)Ball gowns and dancing with the prince at the end of the game.. For me collecting the extra scenes/memories is half the fun in VN's. Cinders lacks this.\n\n* Half point loss also goes to the fact that the game controls are NOT the same as -most- other VN's, Having skip be keybound to left CTRL is a major annoyance, as the windows key is right beside it for my computer. :/  plus due to the location of the windows key on a US based keyboard. left control is not optimal.[/spoiler]\n\nMusic - 6/10.\n* The music does not loop seamlessly and it is quite noticeable, not to mention there is NO IN GAME VOLUME ADJUSTMENT OPTION. The game's music by default is -too loud.- This game lacks voice acting, so I did expect more out of the music in the game.\n\nPossible Bugs and updates to think about? -\n\n* When in the options menu, right clicking in attempt to return back to the game. causes the screen resolution of the game in windowed mode to switch resolution, which might be intentional but is very annoying especially to those of us who play many other VN's and right click normally exits menus/enters them no matter which page you're on.\n\n* The steam overlay is missing the ability to resize itself to the size of the window, meaning that it's rendered entirely useless the user is playing in full screen, which some may do, but I personally dislike doing as I often have friends in other chat clients, and as such may need to alt-tab to a different window. There's a fix for this although I'm not sure how, I do know that it does resize in other games however.\n\n* The text speed is uneven at times or lags and suddenly slingshot-text superspeeds across the UI screen, which made me skip several lines while on autoplay in Normal. AND I could not scroll back far enough to re-read/ There's no actual Script page with the full scene. As such - had I not already played Cinders once, I would have been entirely lost on the story. There's a limit to how fast a person can read, even on the Normal speed it would randomly speed up. Also the auto  play option did not last long enough/went past long paragraphy sentences in the same amount of time for a short sentence. Again made me miss some text. This isn't new to the steam release either. It's been there since I purchased the game originally. Pleeaaaase at the very least fix this.\n\n* If you attempt to skip text by pressing control once or twice the dialogue box disappears entirely, which obviously skipping text so whatever. But - when doing so sometimes the UI text box would be -gone- which also made the text-skip for that part of the game super quick. Bug methinks.\n\n---\n\nAs a final note:\n\nI'd like to mention that the Cinders for letting older users get Cinders on Steam instead of having to repurchase. :) That is  awesome.","June 24, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And while there's a number of people you can "date", you have to be very clear on your path with them to get the best endings. There are also paths where you don't end up with anyone at all. All of your actions really do have consequences.\n\nThe game is extremely well made. The graphics are stunning and the background sounds work well. The game runs very smoothly and so far, every storyline I've played has been enjoyable.\n\nThere were a few times in the game where I felt the dialogue got a bit preachy. The writers obviously really wanted to push the idea that Cinders was strong and independent, but at times it was like they were beating you over the head with it. Don't get me wrong, I love this game and I LOVE the fact that it actually has a strong female protagonist and that the goal of the game isn't necessarily to end up with a man.

The music is pretty good too. No problems on the technical side--skipping and transitions always went smoothly.\n-The characters are very fleshed out and put together well. I found the step-sisters to be my favorite. The love interests are rather stereotypical, but not always predictable.\n-The story is fun and intriguing. Definitely a mature telling of the Cinderella story. I feel like you could enjoy it regarless of interests and gender (mentioning as several guys seem to worried this game is too "girly").\n-Decent length. Can't remember my exact time of my first run, but I think it was somewhere around 4 hours or more (my on-record-hours are off by several).\n\nNeutral\n-Many of the game's choices change character personality rather than storyline--which is an interesting decision. The result is different flavoring in the endings.\n-The replay-ablity is decent. I'd say you could get 3 pretty solid play-throughs before too much of it starts to repeat.\n-Writting is better than it is worse. Though some converstation is too drawn out (see below).\n\nCons:\n-Cinder's posture is TERRIBLE. Stand up straight, gurl. I caN'T STAND IT.\n-As mentioned by several, the game does get preachy at times in conversation, making is feel tedious. However, I can appreciate WHY I assume the creators have done this-- its a genuine attempt to created character and relationships. Is it successsful? Not completely, but most VNs I've played just throw you headfirst into relationships with little to no development; so I'm glad they tried, even if it didn't totally work out that way.\n\nAll-in-all: A good visual novel.

I muted the music, but tend to do so in every game. Other sounds were excellent with the exception of the tavern. It is a rather short loop, and becomes repetitive.\nYour first game can take ~3 hours to complete. Subsequent games go quickly as the Ctrl key allows portions of text you've previously read to be skipped.\n\nMy two complaints:\nOne - The writing.\nThe writing is not bad, it just needs improvement. There are quite a few typos; you can easily discern what is meant, but they are a distraction. To the developer's credit, there is a discussion in the community hub where typos can be submitted, but this game was released a few years ago, and more than enough typos remain to make me wonder if a patch was ever applied. Where is the game text stored? I'll edit typos for a reasonable rate.\n\nWith typos removed, I find the readability level directed towards younger readers. You won't find many big words, or stretch your vocabulary. This is not bad, as it makes for an easy read, and likely makes for a larger audience. I would have preferred the text to be geared more towards an adult audience.\n\nTwo – Some of the Choices / Paths\nOne that stands out to me is Cinders relationship with her younger sister Sophia. In one playthrough I felt I made some real progress in rebuilding a normal relationship between the two. But come the next morning when Sophia actively seeks to spend time with me, I have to tell her that I was planning on some alone time in town; maybe next time kid?...

Your stepmother and stepsisters are more than just villians, they are characters/people with lives and motivations that you can choose to understand/learn about or not. The other characters you meet in the story also have histories and distinct personalites. Cinders' relationships with other characters are also affected by choices you make. References to the past/history are very fluidly revealed in conversations with people. The game does not just dump a bunch of backstory on you for seemingly no reason. The game is also filled with some excellent dry humor, and amusing banter.\n\nGameplay:\nIf there is a game where literally every choice has an impact, big or small, this is it. There are multiple personality types for Cinders (I've discovered three) that are shaped by the choices you make. Cinders' personality type will affect certain dialogues, the availability of certain choices, and the consequences of certain choices. Certain scenes or dialogues with other characters will also change depending on previous choices you have made. There are multiple endings with several variants of each, and it does not come down to one or two "big choices" at the end or anything simple like that. Whether or not you succeed in achieving your desired specific ending is dependent upon the cumulative effects of choices you have made throughout the game. That being said, the replay value is very high, in my opinion. I have enjoyed replaying it to find the different endings/variants and get the achievements.\n\nThe only downsides in terms of gameplay are minor, but still exist. There is no good "rewind" function. If you missed a line, or want to return to read an earlier part of the conversation, you are limited. The game is divided into "scenes" probably for program/design sake. However, you cannot scroll further back than the first line of your current "scene." This could be several lines back, or just one. Fast-forward is sub-optimal. It just cycles through dialogue at rapid speed until you come to a scene/line you haven't viewed or a choice. You can't "skip to next scene" or "skip to next choice" which is disappointing on replays.\n\nPresentation:\nThe artwork is pretty, from the character portraits to the backgrounds and facial expressions change over the course of conversations. The music is good, and fits the scenes quite well. My only gripe was that introducing a character meant briefly interrupting a scene to focus on the character on a leafy-flower design background and a change in music that felt a little out of place.\n\nPros:\n+ Story\n+ Characters\n+ Artwork\n+ Choices & Consequences\n+ Replay Value\n\nCons:\n- Limited/sub-optimal fast-forward and rewind functions\n- Awkward character "introductions"","January 27, 2015","true","16.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I do not regret it.\n\nWhile playing Cinders, my view of the characters changed. This isn't easy to do while keeping a plot consistent, but the author did it.

It is not only an amazing visual novel with a dark, mature take on the story of Cinderella, but also contains elements of dating sims and roleplay as well.  I really enjoyed the wide ranges of decisions to make along with the variations of multiple endings.  Not to mention the dialogue is very well written, with very deep philosophical tones and also some comical moments as well - especially with a few fourth wall breakings.  All in all, this is a very good visual novel and certainly won't be disappointing.\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful artwork - every character and background is absolutely gorgeous\n- Nice subtle animation - it really helps bring the novel to life and draws more attention\n- Amazing soundtrack - I would purchase the soundtrack if they offered it\n- Interesting Storyline - has a nice, dark twist to Cinderella while also including elements such as identity, self-empowerment, independence, decisions, and more.  It's not only a story, it's plenty of food for thought as well.\n- Variety of Decisions - there are so many to make and it really helps drive the story in different directions, which makes things all the more interesting.\n- Great Character Development - all of the characters have a distinct appearance and personality and it really shows not only visually, but in their dialogue.  It's fascinating to get to know them and it also helps them feel very real.  This part was truly amazing.\n- Replay Value - you get different achievements from different decisions and different endings, so there's a nice challenge\n\nCons:\n- The dialogue can get a little repetitive at some points.  There's some parts where a character will emphasize something and then it will be emphasized again and again.

I do not regret it.\n\nWhile playing Cinders, my view of the characters changed. This isn't easy to do while keeping a plot consistent, but the author did it. What I liked the most is how Cinders's personality was influenced by my choices. I cannot tell for certain, as I have only gone through 1 path as of now, but in restrospective, the outcome seems quite fitting for the choices I made.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs you can see, this review has been edited.\nAs of now,I have played Cinders long enough to have seen most of the outcomes (and I have every achievment except for one), and my opinion of the game is still the same.

The art is unique and fitting for the darker tone, and the music is beautiful in every sense of the word.  There are different endings you can discover, and each can have different variations depending on your choices throughout the game.  While you can get through one telling in a rather short period of time, the depth, detail, and impact of choices makes replay-ability good for a few play-throughs.  At least enough to see the main fates you can forge for yourself.

A visual novel retelling of Cinderella, with beautiful graphics, the opportunity to come to see the characters in a new light, and a rather rewarding UI innovation that tells you whenever the dialogue snippet you're seeing could have gone differently had you chosen differently at some earlier juncture, making the game feel much more interactive.\n\nAlas, I couldn't, for the game had too many things that broke my immersion. The protagonist, like the classic Cinderella, is supposed to be living in a small medieval village and have been working basically as a servant for her family for the last several years, yet when she speaks to her stepsisters, she sounds as if she had been reading several books worth of modern pop psychology. At one point she even tells one of her stepsisters, "you are the unknown variable in this equation". Just how did she and her stepsister (who seems to understand the expression just fine) have the chance to learn algebra?\n\nFurthermore, although the process of Cinders winning over her stepsisters and allowing us to see them as people who had their reasons for treating Cinders badly could have been an enjoyable subversion of the original story, things seem to happen much too easily. At least with one of the stepsisters, the process starts with a conversation where Cinders basically asks whether the stepsister has considered that it would be nicer for everyone if they could be friends, and the stepsister goes "oh, you're right". (It's been a little while between me playing the game and writing the review, so I might misremember the details slightly, but even if they're a little off, this is still a good characterization of how sensible the conversion came off as.)\n\nI finally stopped playing in a dialogue when a conversation with one of the stepsisters seemed to be going well, but suddenly she started lashing out at me for no reason. That could have been intentional, but it looked more like a bug. Ordinarily that wouldn't have been a game-killer and I could have just gone back to an earlier save to see if I could get around it somehow, but with this game, it was the final straw.","December 24, 2014","false","1.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

That's not to say it's without faults but it's a very good take on the genre.\n\nPros:\n- The artwork. It's gorgeous, it's original, it's great.\n- Player agency. You have choices and they matter (GASP!). You get to see the consequences of some choices soon after making them, other later on but it's so rewarding to have a story that can go in so many different directions.\n- Endings. No 'secret' or 'true' ending, your choices can lead to an ending that fully reflects the kind of character you wanted Cinder to be and that ending can be good or bad depending on your actions.\n- The NPCs. They are more than one-trick ponies whose one-sided personality is the end-all be-all of whom they are.\n- Info. The information you get from certain actions can be used later on, if you choose, leading to a lot of branching in how you play.\n\nCons:\n- The labels. It's NOT an RPG. Labeling it as such is misleading to people who are looking for RPGs in the store. It's a visual novel, do not be fooled. (Yes, you take on the 'role' of Cinder but then EVERY game is an RPG and the label loses its meaning, not helping anyone anymore.)\n- The romance. If you're gonna add romance options, make them good. There could have been more depth to this aspect of the game as a lot of it was not as fleshed out as I could have wished.\n- The variation. With so much variations there's a lot of aspects of the story that are simply introduced and then not really explored, this is a real shame as some of them are really interesting.\n\nIn conclusion: I don't have a lot of gripes with this game as I truly enjoyed it. There's a lot of consideration for player input and choices and if you enjoy visual novels, I definitely think you'll like this.","March 26","true","14.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(Prince's head to body ratio, "Shady Man's" thumbs are tremendously long.\n\n-Clothing is weird on "Shady Man". Looks like it is really tight by his parts.\n\n- Some character's body alignment is off. Cinder's neck and some of chest is facing right, but then her lower torso is facing leftwards and then her lower clothing suggests she is to the right which makes for awkward twisting in the body. Many other characters have that issue.\n\n- Background has no atmospheric perspective. Everything looks sharp when farther away it shouldn't.\n\n-Perspective is off. Things would be way too big if moved to where character is standing.\n\n- Not enough saves for being a game with more then one styled ending. Usually with visual novels they have more saves then necessary but this one lacked!\n\n- Cannot name saves to keep better track of what is what.\n\n-Always have to go to the dang ball. I'm running away who cares!!\n\n- After two playthroughs, story becomes bleh and nothing new or interesting to the plate. All stories still have same structure and path to go on regardless of ending you are choosing to go towards.\n\n- Creepy eye movement from the Prince.\n\n-Carmosa's folding her arms looks very off in perspective, her left arm is not done right.\n\n- Needed more variation in poses. Only arm position or facial expression changed. Body stayed the same.\n\n-NO SKIP BUTTON. This was so annoying when trying to go back to get other endings.\n\n-Regular price is so not worth it. Payed $9.99 during Steam Sale and that was more decent based off the issues this game has.\n\n- Seems to drag in conversations where you don't get much say in.\n\nBased off of more cons thans pros would not recommend. The art may seem pretty at first but after playing it for awhile you start  to see all the mishaps making it less appealing. Story became bland after a couple playthroughs and dialogue rarely changed.

The main focus of this tedious game is the copious amount of bland dialogue between completely boring characters. I hated EVERYONE in this game. Cinderella, her step-sisters, the guard, the merchant... everyone is either obsessively self-involved or completely dim-witted.  Actually the only halfway likeable character is the thief.  The dialogue is never-ending and very poorly written.  The choices are few and far between and I found myself desparately hitting "enter" to get through all the meaningless drivel just to finally click on some stupid decision like "go on a date with the merchant or rush home."  And yes I could have a completely different experience by playing the game again and making different choices, but the dialogue is SOOO bad that I can't imagine another 2-3 hours reading it.\n\nAnd for a supposed mordern retelling of an old fairytale it is remarkable sexist. Cinders is completely obsessed with shoes! I'm just glad I bought this in a humble bundle for cheap. Save your money and go read a real book.\n\n4/10\n\n","July 6, 2014","false","3.2"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","10","24","0","2"

It's like a hidden objects game without any hidden objects or puzzles, and tons of talking with NO VOICE-OVERS. I know, I know, that's what it is: and interactive novel. But the interaction is so minimal that I felt like falling asleep in between each "interaction"... I thought maybe it would be like those books where we're the hero, picking our way at every corner, but no. It's talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, and talk some more... zzzz... Oh! Do I get to make a choice?! Let's see: "Ask to know more about him?" Uh... no, thanks. I've heard enough already... After only 20 minutes I already didn't care one way or another.\n\nIt's not that it's bad (although it's WAY overpriced for what it is). The graphics area beautiful, but there aren't that many scenes -- actually a LOT less than in your average hidden objects games -- but I found the "game" boring, the story boring, and, like I said, there's not even voice-overs to keep you awake. I see we can play it again to get a different ending. I'll pass, thank you very much.","July 5, 2014","false","3.8"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

You will click for hours, and hours, reading with barely any form of interacion beyond a dialogue choice or two...So even if your decisions do matter, how much? since you will just stare at still illustrations regardless...\n\nWhat im trying to say, this barely qualifies as a game, from any angle, yet is with the rest of the games. Nice story, nice art, hardly any game to speak of.\n\nCattered to either a very niche or lost audience, i cannot recommend this to most of the world.

Just youtube some gameplay footage, to experience the excitement...I guess i have to point the sarcasm.\n\n(Don't pay attention to the low agree %, spineless defenders of the "game" can't see objectively, cause someone's being objective about a product they like a little too much).","June 27, 2015","false","6.4"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

The plot of the story is great, holds a lot of mystery and introduces a variety of interesting and distinct characters. With the varied endings, multiple playthroughs can be drastically different depending on the choices you make.\n\nI've only finished the game once and am on my second playthrough at the time of writing this review, but there are at least 3 possible "romantic interests" for Cinders to end up with that I can see, perhaps more that I have not realized yet.\n\nThe dialog choices are interesting because it really feels like you get to shape the kind of personality that Cinders has, whether you choose to make her defiant and rebellious or more meek and complacent, or something in between. There is a lot of variety here and it helps create greater depth and adds to the replayability.\n\nEven if you haven't ever really played visual novel games before, Cinders would be a great choice to break into the genre. It has a lot to offer and does a lot of things well.","December 14, 2014","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
