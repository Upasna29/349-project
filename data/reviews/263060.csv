There's a small, yet loyal following that genuinely wants this game to be the best it can be. Even though it's a voxel-based FPS, it far exceeds your run-of-the-mill CoD or BF in many aspects. It's the simplicity of Blockstorm that makes it beautiful.\n\nWhat's great about this game is amount of customization available through the in-game editor. You can create your own knife skins, guns, mechas, player models, and can even forge your own maps with ease. Because of this, there's a ton of free community-created content via the Workshop. You don't have to sell your house, car, and your left testicle for a knife skin like you would in CS:GO. Just subscribe to an item in the Workshop, and you're good to go.\n\nThere is one main criticism I would give this game: The ping. If I had a lamborghini for everytime I shot someone in the face without them dying, I would be Tai Lopez. It's not uncommon to see pings above 150. It can be frustrating dying to someone you KNOW you should have killed. This is one of the reasons why this game may never be competitively viable. However, you'll learn to shrug it off and keep playing. It's still a blast to play!\n\nFor the price of a burger, you just can't beat it. Skip food for a day.

If I said that Blockstorm was a completely different game to the likes of AoS and Guncraft, I'd be wrong (and highly unoriginal). Instead, Blockstorm takes all the problems from its predecessors and renovates them to create a stunning cubic cosmos for creative wizards and vigorous soldiers to traverse.\n\nEnough of this fancy talk.\n\nLast year, I was browsing Steam for a relatively cheap game that offered something different. Blockstorm came up pretty fast, and I decided to check it out. Chuckling at the possibilities of the in-game character editor, I instantly bought it without hesitation. However, something was missing; the servers were empty, and the game didn't have much replayability. The game seemed quite interesting, so I stuck around for another couple of weeks.\n\nWith the release of the infamous Blockstorm demo version (infamous because of how similar to the full game it was), a crowd of unfamiliar faces popped up from all around the world. The servers became more and more active, and so did the community forums. Official Events started to pop up, welcoming even more players into the blocky realm. Blockstorm updates started to become even more common. Alot of demo players upgraded to premium accounts.\n\nGhostshark Studios, the creators of Blockstorm, are very active throughout the community, regularly popping in for a match or two when they have some free time. They've helped the community grow since the start, making it what it is today. Blockstorm's update speed is very frequent - we usually get an update every month or so. However, the truth is the game is being updated constantly (just not announced), wether its a bunch of bug fixes or small features; last week, we got a few new mapping mechanics allowing players to make some forms of timed circuits to make their maps stand out from the crowd!\n\nWhen you play Blockstorm, there are two routes you can take (both intwine with each other). If you are strong, valiant, and ready to spill some pixel blood, you can join a server and battle it out to reach the top of the official leaderboards each week (prizes available), level up all the way to 100, or even take part in a tournament! However, if you are more of the creative type, you can access the editors, and build your own characters, weapon skins, turrets, maps, and even the brand-new mechas! All your creations can be shared through the workshop with other players (if you decide). If you are skilled enough, you may even hit the front page so everyone can see your new designs!\n\nBlockstorm itself is very finished - future updates are just christmas presents that are opened too early! At this current moment in time, the community is very active and loyal, Ghostshark are continuing on fixing some issues, and official/unofficial events are weekly!\n\nBlockstorm Features:\n- Stunning in-game editors - complete with powerful tools to match any level of skill.\n- Addictive, smooth gameplay - perfect for any FPS veteran or noob alike.\n- Balanced weapons/vehicles - everything feels just the way you want it to.\n- Active, loyal and friendly community - who collaborate together and help each other.\n- Dedicated developers - that do their best to make the game perfect for everyone.\n- Rapid bug fixes - find a bug? Report it to a developer and they'll get right onto it!\n- Cheap, underpriced - would you rather buy that cold, bitter coffee that lasts seconds, or an astonishing game that lasts you years?\n\nThis game is perfect for anyone who loves fast-paced, voxel-FPS games, but also likes to sit back and sketch up a new idea with their friends. It has a replayability scale that is so large, that I may never stop playing the game completely.\n\nWelcome to Blockstorm.\n\n~\n\nJoin our official group, Blockstorm Active Players to hear frequent event updates, ask for game help, collaborate with other players and much more!","September 20, 2015","true","826.5"," 72 of 87 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","72","87","7","8"

This game in short is Ace of Spades revived with a big focus on gameplay along the lines of Counter Strike 1.6 and Half Life 1 Multiplayer. It really is great fun and the graphics kind of give it a charm that makes it feel like it comes straight out of 1998 or something. The block based levels are great, giving you tons of ways to play a match for example literally pumping a 100 bullet mag into a wall just so other people don't have the cover of said wall anymore. Of course you can also place blocks yourself, building small walls to crouch behind when you reload.\n\nBasicly if you like Counter Strike-ish games with a little twist this sure is a game to pick up, especially now when its on sale.\n\nAnd the editor where you can make maps, skins for your weapons and for your characters is amazing. Easy to use for everyone and so many options to be creative with. I bet this is where most people will spend their time.","May 21, 2015","true","7.3"," 50 of 59 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","50","59","6","0"

Here's a list of pros and cons:\n[EDIT: I decided to edit a few points in my review, based on the comments of it. And I also decided to put a few additional points based in my experience so far. ]\n\n( PS: The " Neutral " points are the points that you can either consider positive or negative. )\n\nPros:\n- Smooth Gameplay\n- Easy Controls\n- It's a balanced game\n- Map Editor\n- Character Editor\n- Equipment Editor\n- Just enough gamemodes\n- Friendly Community ( Well, most of it )\n- The Devs hear what the people has to say, and make updates based on it, which is awesome\n- Has cards\n- Up to this day that my review was made ( 05/22/15 ), i wasn't able to find any single cheater in the game\n\nNeutral:\n- Features a destroyable environment\n- Your ping doesn't really influence how much lag you'll have in your current match\n\nCons:\n- As it has a destroyable environment, in most of the rooms you play, you'll certainly find 2 or more griefers, which will definitely screw up the whole match.\n- Your Equipment Editor is limited to only a few blocks more to add. Example: you can't turn an AK-47 into a Bullpup weapon )\n- Short maps ( Nuketown, by example ) doesn't take long to turn into a No Man's Land.\n- As far as I played, i couldn't find a single game that my ping wasn't under 400. ( Not that my game turns into a complete laggy mess, but sometimes it troubles me )\n\nBlockstorm has the features that I thought I would find in ace of Spades ( The new one, not the classic ), and definitely something that Blockade 3D will NEVER have. Do not consider this game another Minecraft crappy clone. Believe me, the only thing similar to Minecraft it's just the digging and the placing blocks feature. As I saw in their website, it will have some really cool updates coming ( including drivable vehicles )\n\nFor giving me a really entertaining experience so far, 9/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/estepes_acreanas/recommended/263060/","estepes_acreanas","Mr. Dawn with Keys hat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/estepes_acreanas/","917 products in account","[Updated May 22th, 2015]\n\nSo this is Blockstorm, a new FPS about blocks and customization. It may look generic, or a shameless rip-off of games like Minecraft or Ace of Spades, perhaps, but seriously, don't be fooled, it is a lot more than you think.\n\nOverall\n\nBlockstorm is a multiplayer only shooter set in a world of blocks, where you build, destroy and customize. As a shooter, it follows the classic rules of an FPS: precision aiming, crouching, jumping, running and noiseless walking, everything you'd find in other shooters out there. However, it relies on player interaction with the map to make matches the more dynamic they can be. This interaction happens in the form of building and destroying.\n\nBy using the provided equipment, players are able to tear entire buildings down, create alternative paths, blow up walls, build stairs, reinforce, connect structures, anything you might imagine. It helps making gameplay distinctive and unique, according to what players come up with in-game.\n\nWeapons are pretty much common to any FPS, being them: assault rifle, light machine gun, sniper rifle, handgun, two shotgun types, sub-machine gun and machine pistol, each of them dealing a given amount of damage to players and blocks. Explosives are also available: C4, grenades, claymores and RPG, which are the most fun weapons you have at your disposal. Finally, you have the shovel and the placeable block, which will be the main tools you'll be using to modify and customize the battlefield during game time.\n\nTo help map makers create a larger array of maps, NPCs are also available. For now, there are two types: zombies and automated turrets. Zombies have simple spot-and-seek behavior, and can be used in any map kind. Turrets work as defensive structures, and can be used in any game mode. Both of them can be configured with a nice array of settings, like health, movement speed, etc.\n\nIt also provides amazing tools for those who like to customize or create their own content. Maps, guns and equipment, NPCs, characters...anything can be created or customized in the blink of an eye and made available in the workshop.\n\nGame Modes\n\nFor now, there are six available game modes:\nDeathmatch\nUniversal game mode: kill anyone to score.\nTeam Deathmatch\nUniversal game mode: kill enemy team to score for your team.\nCTF\nUniversal game mode: get enemy flag and deliver it to your base to score for your team.\nHunt\nOriginal one: obtain blocktanium atoms from zombies or blocktanium pods and bring them to your base to score.\nCastle Battle\nOriginal one: destroy enemy chests and throne to score while defending yours from enemy attacks.\nAssault\nOriginal one: a simplified and asymmetric  version of territory domination, where one team must dominate a target, while the other must defend it.\n\nEach of them work quite well so far, and each of them have a nice set of maps available.\n\nBalancing\n\nWeapons are very well balanced, and they will only get overpowered in the hands of an overpowered/skilled player. Before each spawn, you are able to choose your loadout, each gun adds weight to your loadout, and the general rule is that the most damage and destruction power means the slowest run speed and accuracy, so it is almost impossible to rampage around without being exposed to enemy attacks.\n\nBuilt-in maps are also pretty well balanced, rarely encouraging camping, as it means, most of the time, acting as target practicing, not to mention being quickly dispatched with a C4 from behind a wall.\n\nYou can find the best suitable play style for you as long as you get used to the loadout you decide to use, for real, without relying on overpowered damage or movement speed.\n\nSo, by the way it is for now, game is well balanced.\n\nCustomization\n\nBlockstorm's main and strongest feature. Almost everything can be customized. All editors are based in the same idea, and every content produced with them can be shared (via workshop, or in-game), and locked, if you wish to keep it only to yourself.\n\nMaps\nA powerful editor lets you build maps ranging from all degrees of complexity, being you a master architect or just a newbie in the world of map building. Tools are available to speed up building process, such as brushes, default forms, paint tools, selection tools, etc. Map editor allows you to toy with many different settings, such as environment, weapon slots, weapons available while spawing, boundaries, and other variables that can be applied to your map. Another important feature is the ability of creating prefabs, which are useful tools for reuse of something you might want in more than a map.\n\nThere's also a terrain generator that helps you create the initial settings of your map, with a decent array of options, such as size, height, type, etc.\n\nEvery built-in map is also fully customizable.\n\nCharacters\n\nCharacters are the skins you wear and determine how will your play model look in-game. Character editor lets you build your own character, by using the same tools available in map editor. For now, you are able to edit each body part separately: head, torso, arms, legs, hands and feet. Arms, legs, hands and feet are mirrored. The way it is right now, it is impossible to implement different body parts for each side, but in fact, it won't never ruin the overall quality of it, neither prevent you from creating a good looking character. Character default skeleton can't be removed, but the limits around it are reasonably good, good enough to make any adaptation, and anything but creativity limitators.\n\nGame comes with a good selection of built-in characters, which are fully customizable, and can be used as models for easy implementation of any other character you might think about.\n\nIt uses a different idea from the map editor, using colored blocks instead of textured ones.\n\nGuns\n\nEvery gun and piece of equipment present in the game, except for C4, claymores and grenades (and the placeable block, of course), is customizable.\n\nEach customizable gun or equipment works as the starting template for a custom version, and like characters, they have a default skeleton, which can't be removed, and, unlike character editor, some guns are pretty limited in terms of new possibilities and different approaches: for now, we are unnable to create a bullpup assault rifle out of the AK47, or add extended stocks to the Uzi, or add a red dot sight to all of them. However, these limitations are slowly being removed as we give feedback to the developers, so it's something the player base must be concerned about.\n\nLike the character editor, this editor uses colors instead of textures.\n\nNPCs\n\nTurrets have a similar editor to guns and character editors, being based on colored blocks, with also a default, irremovable skeleton. It will let you build each part of it, with decent space.\n\nZombies can be customized in the same way you would a player character.\n\nCommunity\n\nNow this is where Blockstorm gets the high ground. Here we have a friendly community, with players that like to discuss and give feedback, and developers which actually listen to what we say, and that's a really big thing.\n\nYeah, you will find typical examples of trolls, like griefers, chat spammers, swearers and whatever, but every online game in History will be swarming with those, so don't even bother about them.\n______________________________________________\n\nThat said, my personal verdict: 10/10.","June 16, 2014","true","437.5"," 58 of 78 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","58","78","4","2"

It features a variety of weapons and interesting mechanics. I think one of the big sellers of the game is its custom weapon and playerskin makers, as well as map making system. The combat is fairly good, though it has room for improvement. I found that matches tend to be rather... Quiet. It felt somewhat isolated when playing with other players. Hopefully the community grows to circumvent this issue.\nThe loadout system is very interesting. There's a weight (In KG) system that dictates how fast you move. If it's 6 KG, you move pretty fast. If you weigh 10 KG, you'll be slower.\nThere's weapons like a rifle, a sniper rifle, an assault rifle, an SMG, a shotgun, and a heavy machine gun. They all tend to synergize well with a certain side-arm. Yes, there's more than just your pistol. You're given the choice between choosing a regular pistol, uzi, and a small shotgun with two shells loaded in. Ontop of that, you can also pick your grenade type. It can be a frag grenade, a C4 that can be detonated on command, a claymore that detonates when a player touches its laser, or a freakin' RPG... With only one rocket.\nYou can also use a block placing tool and a shovel to manipulate the terrain.\n\nA few issues I have encountered is that the game does NOT autosave your custom skins, maps, characters, etc. This means if you accidentally quit, it's gone. Yes, it happened to me when I was least expecting it. Another issue that I feel like only I get annoyed by is making weapon skins. Whenever you make a weapon skin, there's certain blocks that cannot be broken. This is so that you don't make an SMG look like a shotgun. I tend to get a little annoyed with it, but I can understand why it's there. I would like if there was some system that lets you delete those blocks, but on the offset that only you can see the skin. The only other issue is that the community is small. Hopefully by the end of the two week free-to-play event, the community would had grown by then.\n\nOther than that, it's pretty good. Get it if you liked the original Ace of Spades.

I have to say. This game is very good\n\nArt it is really good if see what some of the PEOPLE in BLOCKSTORM COMMUNITY HAVE MADE! Spicing it up, add Shadows just like adding the tea leaves in water to make tea just makes it great and nice. Looking being sweet to look at.\n\nThe gameplay, it is not FAST PACED so do not LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS that are by Curators. The maps do effect some of the gameplay, but please PLAY this game if love the likes of A. Counterstrike or B. Ace of spades classic. You will have a great time. Yes this a quick review god darn it!\n\nThe multiplayer? It kicks potato bags. :) It is very fun, a great ammount of people to hang out with. The servers do not mess up mostly, besides the Asian ones, which if your in Asia, your tentacled. Nobody may not understand what I mean by that.\n\nLevel editor, it works what it is supposed to do, be a level editor and not a gimmick. Too bad it can't be a Mr. Gimmick, if was that, I would love that. :) The level editor has prefab support and you can put in customization from turrents, to sandwhich zombies, to well anything that you think of that isn't outside the box, but nether regions.

Spicing it up, add Shadows just like adding the tea leaves in water to make tea just makes it great and nice. Looking being sweet to look at.\n\nThe gameplay, it is not FAST PACED so do not LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS that are by Curators. The maps do effect some of the gameplay, but please PLAY this game if love the likes of A. Counterstrike or B. Ace of spades classic. You will have a great time. Yes this a quick review god darn it!\n\nThe multiplayer? It kicks potato bags. :) It is very fun, a great ammount of people to hang out with. The servers do not mess up mostly, besides the Asian ones, which if your in Asia, your tentacled. Nobody may not understand what I mean by that.\n\nLevel editor, it works what it is supposed to do, be a level editor and not a gimmick. Too bad it can't be a Mr. Gimmick, if was that, I would love that. :) The level editor has prefab support and you can put in customization from turrents, to sandwhich zombies, to well anything that you think of that isn't outside the box, but nether regions.

I just enjoy them ALOT.. :)\n\nLets start with the good stuff:\nCreating maps with the editor is easy and the editor feels powerfull in the right hands. Multiplayer online is super fun. You can create and share / play with your own created characters.\n\nThere is no veichles in this game and i dont really miss them either. Why? The maps created are more like close combat or sniper variations aka old COD UO. The difference is ofcourse the gfx style and that you can destroy almost everything on the maps so never expect to be able to hide for to long. :)\n\nThe game is created with the community in mind so start creating some cool or funny maps to share. Fun fun fun...\n\nI would recommend that you buy a 4 pack and share with your friends for some fun gaming. And lets help this community to grow, the game really deserves it.\n\nAnd sadly a tiny tumbs down:\nThe characters can feel a bit floaty sometimes. Just jump and you will understand. Also a sprint button for quick getaway would be most welcome.  The run speed used in current game can be walk speed and run could be done in bursts with energy bar.\n\n((Please note the game is still in early process so this can change))\n\nAnd yes the score:\nGFx 9-10 (Usefull comparisons Minecraft, Guncraft, Murder Miners, Blockland)\nSfx 7-10 (its okay and fits the game)\nMusic 6-10 (Not much to say, but it fits where it is)\nGameplay 9-10 (SuperEasy creating maps and fun)\n\nI will gladly recommend this game because its super fun online. And who does not like blowing stuff to bits or creating your own maps to play with your friends. (( Get it on 25-50% SALE ))\n\nThe community is not large but this is where we can improve.

However, the graphics do not affect the gaming experience whatsoever. Blockstorm feels like a proper FPS game, and the map destruction, and ability to build structures/barriers using blocks provided to all players, result in often unique gameplay every time.\n\nThe guns, although a small number, have their own feel and characteristics. Unlike other FPS', Blockstorm is successful at delivering a different combat experience with each weapon. The sniping mechanics were a little difficult to master, but the skill necessary to one-shot kill your enemies is cleverly nerfed with the scope sway.\n\nThe maps and game modes seem very appropriate for the price tag, and the map/character editor give you an even bigger bang for your buck.\n\nThe player mobility is affected by gear type and weight. This feature encourages the player to think about the weapons and gadgets to carry to be effective in the current combat situation, or to match their playing style.\n\nBlockstorm does have its issues. One of those is the spawn system; the enemy team can overpower your team and spawn kill quite easily. There is a few seconds of invincibility right after spawning, but a skilled spawn killer can ruin your game regardless of this feature.\n\nOverall the game is worth every penny, and a must have indie FPS.\n\nNEW INFO\n\nAfter giving it some thought I forgot to mention another major issue the game has, and I feel obligated to share this information to avoid encouraging people to make a purchase without this knowledge.\n\nThe game, at its current state, does not have a large player population. It can be difficult to get a full server, but most of the time when I have played I actually found one or two servers running with enough players. I do not believe this is an issue with the game itself, but with the lack of popularity. As previously mentioned, the game deserves a larger population.","April 23, 2015","true","9.9"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","21","27","5","0"

Blockstorm is a game that I feel can rightfully be considered the sequel of the original Build and Shoot.  The workshop integration and editor capabilities allow for some interesting skins and player models to be used, while the ability to manipulate the terrain and map allows for various engagements.  As for the weapons, they're all pretty self-explanatory, each with their own pros and cons.\n\nOverall, this game is great.

Oh boy was I fooled.\nNot much more alive than GC - except during sales (but that happens in any game) or DEMO servers (which like the name says, it has demo players) - and with gameplay similar or worse than GC I've felt completely tricked by those reviews.\nWhile in GC most people still had the patience to make their own gun just for their own sake/fun, I doubt here anyone will waste time making a full scale playermodel since the developers made like 25 of them. And since it doesn't have gun maker did they compensate with more standard weapons? Nope, I believe it has even less standard guns than in GC himself. Sure it has the basic weapon types (assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun), but personally the only gun I find effective is the machine gun.\nWithout mentioning that layout management enforces you to "run" (there's no sprinting) overcombered in a game that you "GOTTA GO FAST". Each gun/tool has a certain weight. The heavier you are, the slower you "run". This means either you like it or not you'll always have to "run" with things you may not use in the match. But even if you did carry a rocket launcher or more combersome weapons, would it make a diference? Nope because you'd be running extremely slow.\nAlso has a map maker that nobody will have enough time to make anything good.\nIt kinda made me depressed waste 12€ on such game. As if that wasn't enough 2 weeks later the game gets a weekend sale for 5€. In times like this you wish steam would make refunds. (At the time of purchase steam didn't had refunds yet).\nIf you bought the game, hope you enjoy selling your cards. If you haven't but still feel inclined to try it out, get the demo and play on the populated demo servers (the non-demo are empty). Unlike the game description says, you can play 2 gamemodes and like 5 maps. Or just do family share with a friend.\nPro tip: If you reload a weapon you can switch to another one while the other finishes reloading (switching weapons doesn't stop reload).","September 12, 2014","false","2.4"," 71 of 124 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","71","124","0","12"

Lets begin.\n\nThe game has a skin editor, no it does not effect the gameplay other than a flashy gun.\nThere are 6 base guns, 3 secondary guns, 4 or 5 explosives, your blocks, and a shovel. I belive thats all.\nEach gun has its ups and downs, so I will be reviewing each gun and what needs to be fixed on it. If you think you can stand all the imperfections, you buy the game.\n\nRifle - The standard semi-auto gun. Though it has amazing accuracy and power, your not gonna hit ANYTHING at long range with the zoom for its aim. It is easy to use, and pretty much perfect.\n\nShotgun - Weighs WAY less then pretty much every other primary. Spread gaurentees that you hit something within a ten block range, and speed garuntees ( scuse the spelling plz ) that knifes are no use unless its a backstab. Ironically, the shotgun would weigh as much as a rifle, and it would be the person running that makes you so fast... Otherwise this is basically a long range knife, and what your going to be pulling your hair out over.\n\nMP5 - Alittle bit of a nerfed version of the AK. Honestly there is little point in using this gun other than an ( ok ) range for an automatic. It takes somewhere around 15 limbshots, 5 body shots, or something like 3 headshots to bring down a man with this. It is as if a rifle had a nerf d*** and had a baby with the AK. In a more ironic view, the devs think people want .5 less weight as a bribe to use a nerf spewing peice of metal. Personally one of my faves, because the ( ok ) ranged shots. Your a pro if you can use it.\n\nAK-47 - Basically the above - some range reduced and weight added in turn for better damage and maybe fire rate.\n\nM240 - For all the nerf in this game, this p**ses me and many others off. 100/300 for pure ammo, weights something around 8 kgs, a whopping firerate, 4 to limbs and body, 1 to the face. THE MOST OP GUN IN THE GAME. YOU NERFED A SNIPER, MP5, PISTOL, AND RPG, BUT NOT A TANK OF DEATH. Basically, your alittle slow shure, but this gun is accurate to a splinter on a wall 5 miles away. Heavy recoil aswell. I don't even want to talk about it.\n\nSNIPER - Ah yes. My pride. My joy. With no noscope capibility at all, a one second wait for the scope to give the gun sweet acuracy, 1/10 ammo, and overall a COMPLETE PEICE OF NERF. I mean like, really. The only way to get ammo is to pick up bags from fallen allies/enemies. Snipers cannot do so. Why? THEY DON'T WANNA DIE. I mean, no noscopes? fine. Hardly any quickscopes? Getting unbearable. 1/10 Ammo, Complete BS. Reminder, this means you have to reload after every shot, even if you missed. The reload takes about 2.5-3 Seconds, about half the M240's, and is a complete nerfbomb. ( devs plz fix ) Using this, like the MP5, means your GOOD. ( With the exception of abandon, there its the most popular. ) Also, there is a delay on fire, If you fire and die directly after, the game acts like you never shot. you need to wait for the audio of the fire to finish and reload to start, otherwise the shot never happened,\n\nPistol - Never used by anybody accept a sniper. Horrible even at close range, 5 headshots, 7 bodyshots, I forget how many limbshots. Horrible accuracy. Never use. ( Devs fix plz )\n\nUzi - Snipers best friend, weighs alot, not worth it, pretty good though.\n\nShorty 12G - Mini shotgun.\n\nRPG - You need to wait 5 seconds after firing for it to actually fire. Sucks even with direct hits. Don't use.\n\nThats about it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxsic/recommended/263060/","toxsic","Uboa Noticed You","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxsic/","405 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBefore you read this review, might I say that the demo is worth trying out to get a sense of the actual gameplay, as the only thing it limits you from is building things in the editors and locks you to only a few weapons.\nAnyway, Blockstorm is a strange FPS to describe. Unlike most other voxel manshooters / "Minecraft with GUNZ" games that I've tried, the customization and building aspect mostly takes a background role to the combat mechanics inside actual matches, making the FULLY destructible maps feel more like Battlefield than Minecraft, while having the scale of neither. While you can dig your way underground to an enemy spawn and build fortifications, the building side is pretty limited to just doing that, which I sorta like. It makes the game feel more focused and more like an FPS with sandbox elements rather than Minecraft with guns and multiplayer, which doesn't really work well.\nThe combat is pretty dull at the current stage. The weapons handle like CoD and shoot like Battlefield, but the movement takes heavy influence from Counter-Strike, in that you have no sprint and movement exploits are incredibly difficult to pull off and end up feeling unimpressive. All in all, it's slow. Not clunky, but slow. Respawning back at your base and making your way all the way back to the battlefield can be frustrating at times in a game where the strategy side is a bit underdeveloped, so most players possess the inclination to just look for guys to shoot.\n---\nWhile that hardly sounds like a recommendation, this game still has a few things going for it; the sheer amount of potential and strong creative tools are huge counterweights to an otherwise average shooter, and given that the game gets updates fairly regularly, Blockstorm could turn into a fantastic large scale FPS to the likes of Star Wars: Battlefront.\nWhen in huge battles, the game really opens up. Fully destructible environments that can be rebuilt as resources permit means that the search for cover is always tense, especially in the thick of battle. A well placed grenade can demolish enemy cover, opening them up to hellfire, and collapsing buildings can be pretty painful. The health regen is slow enough that being shot can have an actual impact on your play instead of hiding behind an indestructible wall for 10 seconds. Building trenches and repairing walls with makeshift patches of blocks is a great experiance when you actually get around to doing it, as the gameplay doesn't really encourage you to at the current stage unless your enemy is smart and whittles away at the map default cover at key points. They need to revamp the gun mechanics to suit this slower style of gameplay, since it feels good when it actually comes together.\nThe two editors, the map editor and character editor, are very strong, and can push the game to even greater levels if a few creative users get their hands on it. I haven't really used the map editor much, but from the levels I played that were designed in them (that being all of them, as the devs use the tool to create their maps) I can tell it's competent. The character editor is really good and quite a bit of fun. It breaks everything into manageable chunks, and you can start from scratch or edit a skin you already have. You can even import and export parts individually and paste them in at any time, as well as select sections and copy them to a clipboard for use later. You want a minotaur head on a small anime girl body? Go for it, nothing is stopping you! Granted, this makes the game look like a bit of a cluster♥♥♥♥ in regards to the player models on the field, but it's nothing gamebreaking (maybe a force player / enemy model option á la CPMA, devs?)\n---\nOverall, I've had a lot of fun with Blockstorm, and I hope you give the demo a try at the very least. If the devs make some adjustments to how the combat feels (and MAYBE up the movement speed)  and put more emphasis on the strategy side of building, and if the player base allows bigger, more open ended battles, this can turn into something great. I hope to see you in battle, hypothetical reader. I'll be the chick in a bad Christmas sweater with a bow and a giant CRT monitor for a head.","October 6, 2014","true","13.1"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","1"

It's like Counter-Strike and Minecraft had a baby (or rather, it's like Ace of Spades when it was still good). You can make your own skin literally block by block (and the skins in this game are VERY detailed because of it), you can even edit the turret and zombie skins (yes, there are zombies in the game!) You can even customize your weapons so they look whatever you want them to look like (though there are some minor restrictions in that field, it's still cool). To top it off, it even has a MAP EDITOR, so you can make whatever kind of map you want, build your own prefabs (structures that you can later use as assets for other maps or share), and pick what modes and weapons you want on the map! You could have snipers only, make it run for Team Deathmatch or CTF, etc.\n\nAll in all, this game will never leave you bored of creativity, and it's a really solid game (aside from some minor bugs, but again, MINOR bugs). I fully recommend this game to anyone who wants a nice Minecraft-style shooter with good weapons balance, and a wide variety of creative tools at your disposal.

I am a 30 year old mother of 5 children, ages ranging 1 yr-12 yrs old, of which 4 of them, and mself, are all pretty active Blockstorm players. Of the 6 of us, my 11 year old and I are both pretty dedicated/serious Blockstormers, playing some varying amount of Blockstorm almost daily.\nThis is my first experience playing an FPS game on a PC, and the first video game I have played since the 90's!\n\nSome of my favorite things about playing Blockstorm...\n-I laugh sooo much when I am in this game. It is competitive if you want it to be, but So.Much.Fun.\n-I love seeing all of the creative skins and occassionally I enjoy checking out the maps and weapons and skins in Workshop for a change. There are some very talented content creators playing and creating in Blockstorm!\n-I was pretty easily able to make my own skin with no experience doing anything like this before. It was frusturating at first but easy to get the hang of the editor. I'm just, unfortunately, not exactly creative...and my priority seems to be mastering the game play.\n-I love the community in this game. The forum is also great if I would remember to use it more. There are some really seemingly great people involved in this game and many friendly, dedicated players. Of course there are TONS of jerks in the mix, but hey, it keeps things interesting and keeps me laughing.\n-Love the weekly Blockstorm incentives\n-Worth the low price they are asking\n-Love the block-world style, like minecraft with pvp, super fun\n\nThings that annoy me about Blockstorm...\n-I think it would be great if there were more default maps rotating on the servers. My boyfriend (40till5) has shared some AMAZING maps to workshop that I witnessed him put hours and hours and hours of work into, but as far as I can tell they are basically going to waste. Obviously other people can host them if they are subscribed, but who really wants to play unranked? I guess I can't speak for others, but ranked servers are where I want to be...my bf doesn't play Blockstorm anymore currently, but when he did, he was definitely more dedicated to the creative aspects of this game than myself. I wish I could see his, and other creators' amazing works of art, rotating on a default server all of the time too.\n-I am surprised at the lack of updates.\n-No voice chat\n-Needs more players, or I'm gaming at awkward times? I mostly play around 6-8 a.m., 3-6 p.m., and 12-2 a.m. EDT.

Sit down and listen to me carry on and allow me bore you to death. :)\n\nBrief Summary\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are many games out there that allow you to build your own maps out of blocks and then allow you and some friends, or some random people to completely lay waste on your map. Although most of them are unfortunately terrible, sometimes due to pay to win with the free to plays, or some just are out there in Early Access floating around trying to grab your money with a game that is only 20% complete. No, this game is not like this. I can easily say that I had fun with this game with the many shenanigans that have happened to both me and my mates. Despite the lack of servers, as the only official servers that aren't empty are demo servers meaning the player will need to host their premium servers to play their maps with other premium members.\n\nNow I'm going to go back for a moment, and trust me I won't take long. This game is fairly limited content wise, there are very little prefabs, however I have noticed that more and more prefab packs are being released in the workshop, which is very good. The weapons are lacking in numbers and the gameplay mechanics can be refined. Again however this game has only been out for a short while, and in my time from when I bought it, I have noticed quite a few interesting changes and additions such as turret editors, new developer made maps (which I really don't care much for as the buzzing workshop community has made.) I really do see much potential for this little, but as this is only gameplay wise, as again the weapons are lacking, some of the animations can be cleaned up and multiple other implementations would be nice.\n\nI actually urge you to buy this then to play the demo as that means the community grows and the developers get more money to kickstart this game from where it is now to a full complete game in no time.\n\nPros\n\n- It's fun editing and creating maps... then completely annihilating them with friends.\n- The workshop community is always at it creating new refreshing and unique maps.\n- This game is fairly good for what it's potential may become.\n- It's got some pretty fun maps, despite them being on the demo servers.\n- Endless creativity, building tunnels, to making massive defense towers it's almost endless with the map maker.\n\nCons\n\n- It does need a bit more content, however it is still in very early access.\n- Unfortunately this game is overrun with demo users... again I urge you to buy this to support the developers.\n- It is fairly basic, some new mechanics would go a long way.","February 11, 2015","true","18.9"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","13","19","2","0"

I bought this game before most of the major updates happened but back then the game was completely playable with only minor bugs, but when we asked for more customizability they delivered firstly with the level editor where great maps and stunning levels were made, then came the skin editor which everyone had used for a level of personalisation that could not be achieved by a map. Then the Npc editor where turrets (only npc availiable at the moment) were mass produced for map makers heaven. My Favourite: the equipment editor wich made this game the must have game for anyone who had a nack for making and testing guns on blocks or players.\n\nI have seen this game evolve through its major cycles but I still don't know what is to come next. I recommend this game to anyone after an awesome casual first person shooter.\n\nIf the devs see this I congratulate your guys for making this game and its community perfect for the hardcore and the casual gamer alike.","March 9, 2015","true","244.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Do you enjoy the idea of a free form kind of multiplayer, with loose rules on how to play, and room for many different styles of play? Do you enjoy FPS with a bit more of a Battlefield Bad Company esque style of "make your own door" kind of gameplay? Do you like the idea of roles being strictly defined by the player, and how they use their kit, instead of hard coding getting in the way?\n\nI can tell you, I like all of those things. I like those things a lot.\n\nAnd this game has them all.\n\nNow in seriousness, this game is pretty simple. Its a simplistic FPS with a total of 12 different types of weapons, only 6 of which are "primary" It covers a wide variety of weapon types and playstyles. The special part is that its also a voxel game, with explosives, and destroyable terrain. Meaning fortification, siege warfare, being a sapper is a legitimate role. Collapse a bunker on top of the people inside, send a rocket through the window of a house and flatten it. You will be using explosives to do just about everything, and when you are not, you will be playing the game like any other FPS, other than the face that even without explosives you can still make doors.\n\nI just love the dynamic of the combat, especially in my personal favorite mode, Castle Battle. Both sides gets a fortress, with obvious weaknesses, then 6min to fortify said fort, before combat starts. The objective is to break the chests at the enemies base, which are scattered about it, making so protecting the entire fortress is desirable, instead of stacking on one spot. Roles are clearly defined in this game mode, while not explicitly chosen, which is amazing game design. The guy with the Rocket takes out the hard positions and bunkers, the guy with the C4 gets you into the base by making a door. Snipers accurately pick off the rocket guys on the enemy assault force, and LMGs protect the exterior, while shotguns the interior. While those are not the end all be all roles, those are the ones I perform. You get a sort of feeling of true siege warfare, you try to climb walls, break hardened positions, playing the sneaky beaky infiltrator doing dirty things to the enemy base, and trying to keep yours from falling a part. Battles always get into the late game where both sides forts looking like a patchwork mess, with the valiant defenders, and ardent assaulters scrambling over the ruble to get that last chest.\n\nWhile not the prettiest game out there, comes with the utilitarian voxel style we all know, and have a love hate relationship with, I can appreciate what is done with it, especially in the character model department. Things can get seriously detailed with the way the voxels are handled on the character model, and even the weapon model. Go take a look at the Workshop and see just how cool some of these things look (save for all the ♥♥♥♥♥ and boobs)\n\nOh yea, you heard that right, there is a workshop for use created content, and a pretty damn good in game editor for making anything your heart desires, if you can learn to use it. I've made some personal stuff with it myself.\n\nAll in all, this game is a gem, and I will continue to play it, but it needs you guys, to make it awesome. We need mappers to make cool maps, People to run servers for those maps, and then players to make them look like crap after a good bout over it. We also need to look really cool while we are doing all of this, so make some models in the mean time.\n\nBuy. It.\n\n","May 28, 2015","true","82.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The editor not only allows you to create a map but you can also create your own prefabs (objects, walls, props etc and add it to your prelab library) but you can download new ones from the community and also share your own creations as well and of course your maps. The map editor is quite powerful, you can easily copy complete objects big or small to duplicate including very large buildings. This makes things like creating roads or wanting to duplicate multiple objects easy.  If you want to cut your teeth on designing good multiplayer maps this is it. There could be some minor tweaks and polish added to the editor to improve its ease of use but its not hard to learn and does the job well.\n\n\nI'm impressed with how there are no frps drops from some of the detailed and large maps some of the community (some good quality maps there) has made for an older computer like mine.\n\nAt the moment there is only 3 game modes but more is to come. For where Blockstorm is now its well worth the money, if you like designing stuff then you probably will spend just as much time in the editor as playing online. The thing this game lacks at the moment is more players. No doubt we will see more weapons and gameplay being added in future updates.\n","September 29, 2014","true","226.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Now do understand that everything i've listed, as said by the devs, is subject to change in the game. You can check the date of this review if you find something off.\nPros:\n-Nice gunplay, and most of the guns are very nicely balanced.\n-Graphics are very good for a voxel-based game.\n-Fun to mess around with the ingame character/map editer (You can literally make Elmo if you wanted).\n-No lag on official servers\n-Good netcode that doesn't cause lag issues\n-Freedom of choice (in term's of loadout,looks, ect).\n-Very nicely made official maps/ characters.\n-Very active and kind devs.\n\nCons:\n-If you lag, it benefits you(I hope for a fix ASAP, or even a ping limit setting whenever you make a match)\n-On some maps, it's very easy to block a spawn and camp. (This can definitly be fixed).\n-Knife is a bit overpowered imo (I can see backstabs as 1 hit kills). (I've decided this was unecessary)\n-Building on the battlefield could use a bit of improving (Have a ghost block, be able to build on a face you can't see, besides this, building is nice).\n-Very small community (It really bugs me)\n-A bit of tank controls (Would LOVE to see it more tight) (it's been adjusted to be more tight)\n\nWhat I think could be added to enhance the game:\n-Sandbox/lounge gamemode: You can just build and hang out with friends or anyone and show off that awesome skin you just got finished making if you wanted.\n-Thirdperson Spectator and/or a Spectator team\n-Server modding or modding: Could be used to allow people to create their own gamemodes (ex. RP)\n-Custom Weapons (and possibly edit the stats)\n-Workshop support (it's been implemented. YAY)\n\nEdit: I've noticed a lot of discussions based around on whether or not this game is different from Ace of Spades, Guncraft, and any other voxel shooter out there. And I, as a reviewer, should set an answer to a potential game loss. This game does stand on it's own in it's own right.\n\nYes, it takes certain elements from AOS, but don't always think it rips off. Blockstorm was likely inspired by AOS, and it adds onto what AOS had done, though doing it in it's own way.\n\nYes, the shooting may be a bit generic, but it can be very tactical if you play with the right people. The game was designed to be a bit slow paced, almost like Battlefield.\n\nAnyone who is against this game, whether by similarities with the other voxel shooters, I do hope you give it a chance as it's own title. It's nowhere near as terrible as some have said, but rather good.\n\nAnd besides, it's in Early Access. It may improve, it may setup or add, it IS changing whether you like it or not, possibly for the better or even worse.\n\nTo conclude...\nThis game is something you could pick up and enjoy on the spot (For me it was). Being able to create your own character in ANY way you wanted to is something that makes this cake shine. I also enjoy making maps, as the editer is very good. And currently with a price tag of $12(It may change), it's cheaper and better than the $15 AOS.","July 27, 2014","true","55.5"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","1"

Blockstorm is a blocks-based FPS. Its about as interesting as it sounds. This game tries to do this thing where they combine typical first-person-shooting gameplay with Minecraft-esque building mechanics; which has already been done a few times, but who's to say that Blockstorm can't unlock that potential that all the previous games in this vain haven't unlocked? The game developers. Instead of the refreshing take on this genre that I was hoping for, Blockstorm turned out to be just another typical FPS. The building aspect is very underdeveloped and does not play nearly as large of a role as it should. Breaking and building feel tedious and unessential. This is something Ace of Spades did much better with its building system. Breaking blocks felt extremely satisfying and fun. Building shelters and defense architectectures to take cover from the enemy was also important. You could shape entire pre-made levels into new environments, making each round unique. But here, the building aspect is very shallow and completely unnecessary.\n\nThe gamemodes, weapons, classes, etc are also all very limited and narrow. The weapons are poorly balanced and the classes are utterly useless. Classes do not change agility, weapon variety, anything besides your character model. The music is annoying and incredibly incessant, and the community is what you would expect.\n\nThere is one thing about Blockstorm that makes it stand out, however. One thing that, if expanded upon, could create a wonderful and bracing first-person-shooter. And that one thing is... the editors. Nearly everything in this game is visually customizable by entering the Editors option in the main menu. You can customize the appearance of weapons, equipment, mechas, turrets, zombies and your character; as well as create your own maps.\n\nUnfortunately, overall, Blockstorm is an easily forgettable experience that wastes lots of potential.\n\n5/10 - Average","November 6, 2015","false","3.0"," 34 of 63 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","34","63","4","4"

I've played this game for 6 hours in 2 days. Usually when the term "block" comes on a game, everyone thinks of Minecraft. But this game is different. Instead of just having 1 big block for your head, you have hundreds of them that actually form a face. Your whole body is made of hundreds and hundreds of cubes. And the best part? You can edit it. You have the ability to make player models, maps, weapon skins and etc. and use them online. Each player can be an artist. I've seen many cool player models while playing. I've seen Dallas (from the PAYDAY games, Bender from Futurama, Master Chief from the Halo series and many other player-made models. I do recommend this game, not because I'm a Minecraft fan, but because I'm not. Because this game is different. It does have a dig and place system, but that still doesn't make it Minecraft.

It's definitely how I wanted and what AoS should have been. Tons of customization available for both player models and guns, with the only limits being the model bases and your imagination. Great *if a tad repetitive after awhile* music that highly invokes old arena shooters. The battlefield is dynamic and ever changing building crumble bunkers are built craters appear after explosions etc. The guns themselves are quiet nice too, They feel like they have actual power behind them with the recoil system though the same cant really be said for melee as more often than not it feels extremely floaty and leaves me oft wondering if I even hit the enemy at all while my corpse topples to the floor from a silent blow. Hope this game gains more of a playerbase and more updates. Definitely worth 7 dollars. 8/10\n\n","May 27, 2015","true","54.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This one has a bit of everything that you'd want in a block based shooter. From its fully destructable environments, customization/Steam Workshop, building, various gamemodes, and fast paced gameplay, it makes for a really fun experience! I'm also looking forward to when this game gets more popular with the steam community, and we get more content, becuase as of now I believe this game isn't getting the full credit it deserves for how good it actually is.\n\nPlus its an added bonus if you like Steam achievements because you'll get a bunch right off the start from just casually playing the game.

Great community/workshop, fun and unique gamemodes (That i always tried to play with friends in Minecraft, like Castle Battle), and I really enjoy how you level up through achievements over normal FPS games with xp. Knew this game was a great purchase and i cannot stop playing it. The editor is great and can be used to edit gun skins, characters, mechas, and maps. Whats unique about this game is the building, in each game mode you have the ability to plan strategies by using blocks to build around you, or destroy other people's blocks with your shovel lol.

It is worth the $$$$ if you enjoy being able to master a simple but awesome set of weapons. The maps are fully destructable and this makes for great and fun tactical gameplay. Plus you are given 100 (team colored) blocks to set up quick offensive or defensive positions, or to seal a doorway or entrance. When it comes to multiplayer, there are always most likeley 2+ severs with people on them. The community is pretty good not to many jerks and some really fun people. There are a good assortment of clans and groups to join once you lvl up a little.

I usually hate all these block related games that seem to spin-off the already dreadful Minecraft, but this game is very fun to play. It allows complete customization of all of your own weapons and character, and the blocks actually make it simple enough for anyone to design something. The in game editor is simple to learn, it only took me about an hour to begin making my own stuff.\nThe gameplay of a shooter is pretty good too. It's a little realistic for a block game. I don't know all the weapons, but they all seem to be based on a real gun. They all work fairly well, even though I was annoyed the sniper rifle shakes while walking. Very realistic.\nThe game modes are rather interesting, but could use more balancing. The zombies mode is even still PvP and PvE at the same time. I hope a simpler co-op mode is added eventually. But really most of the game modes are all known game modes that anyone uses, it's not very unique. It's still nice though.\nI'd recommend it.","May 5, 2015","true","14.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Content is constantly flowing into the game, so there is no repetetive maps or gameplay, but the controls are not as responsive as they could be.\nOverall I do recommend this game, because a larger community will help to improve the game to a point where I have nothing to complain about anymore.\n","May 29","true","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

I have never found a game before that was developed to look pretty simple but was really really fun to play. This game is like a combo of Minecraft, CS:GO, and Call of Duty, Love That. I love the customization that this gamer offers, this is what really keeps the game up and running. This feature gives the ability to let players create whatever they desire and can make TONS of variety skins for the weapons itself. I truly TRULY recomend thi game to everyone out there! Keep up the great work, and hope to see more in the future after Early Access :)\n\nSuggestions:\n1) Zombie Mode for Zombies\n2) Domination Game Mode\n3) Guns Had Interchangable Parts - Gun Attatchments\n4) More Creative space for Weapon Editors Skins\n5) Multiplayer World Map Editor\n6) Enable Reskinning For Claymores, Grenades, and C4\n7) More Players Per game\n8) Gamemode Similar to Search and Destroy from Call of Duty and CS:GO\n9)  More Weapons - Personal Favorites: SMG: PP90M1, Skorpian, AK74U, MP7/ AR's: M4A1, Scar-H/L, M16, FAL, F2000, M-Tar, FAMAS/ Sniper: Dragonav, SVD, Barret 50. Cal, Intervention, EBR/ Shotgun: Spaz, R870 Remington, Double Barrel,  Sawed Off Shotgun, TAC\n10) Tacticals should be added to the game such as Flash, Stun, and Smoke grenades\n11) Killstreaks\n12) Allow Sniper to get Hit-Markers instead of it being one-shot kill no matter where you get shot at\n13) Economy for In-Game Weapons (If Possible)\n14) Medic Packs\n15) Music In-Game Instead of Just Main Menu Music\n\nThats All Of The Suggestions For Now, Hope you take in consideration on some of these :)","May 6, 2015","true","51.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Everyone has differen't skill sets in this game.\n\nBad things about this game\n1) Its a FPS shooter, like CoD and its like CoD and Minecraft slaped to each other.\n2) Building stuff takes along time if you want to make something decent. Voxel by voxel pretty much\n3) Communinty like I said is good, but the new 10 year old kids that buy this game spam the chat insaulting people and being immature. -_-\n4) RPG's you can not fire on depend you have to wait for like 3 seconds before you can fire.\n5) Last but not least, You can fit in 1x1 by 1x2 spaces which is kind of weird considering that my guys is like the scale of a minecraft character and these little voxels are like 1 foot by 1 foot or less hahaha\n\nOther than that this game is pretty fun, hardly any gliches. If you like FPS shooters and don't get mad at them, this game is for you. Building is tedius but is fun, I enjoyed my time creating my characters <---- I make it sound like you need to, but there are deafult characters, and who ever you meet ingame it will put it into a thing to download (in game of course) I hope this helps anyone planing on gettings this, I tryed to give some details about its weak spots and strong points, Enjoy the game :)","October 30, 2014","true","60.4"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

Some weapons are more powerful than others, but can be taken out tactically. More skill is needed to play this game, in my opinion. The enviornment is destructable aswell, creating some interesting scenes and gravity does take role.\n\nCustomizing Most of my time in this game was in trying to make interesting weapon skins, which didn't upload properly to the workshop. Why? I don't know, but most didn't. Still, you can completely customize the weapon, minus the fact you have a limited workspace and can only remove certaint blocks. These blocks are the inner-gun, which, logically, shouldn't be removed. Characters can also be created, aswell as NPCs and tools. Maps can also be created for this game.\n\nWorkshop If you can't seem to get into making your own stuff, or if you just don't feel like your doing well at it, the workshop is always here. Plenty of people upload characters, weapons, tools. NPCs, and more onto the workshop for this game that they have created.\n\nOverall  I would give this game a 85/100 (8.5/10), mainly due to the fact I found the multiplayer to be semi-interesting. The multiplayer was fun here and there, but I kept losing my interest.","November 10, 2015","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game modes are fine, going from the usual Deathmatch to some team camp battle with various objectives.\nSpeaking of specifics game modes, unless if you're planning to do endless deathmatches (even then...), you will need some level designer skills if you want to keep yourself on the winning side. The fact you can build stuff with basic cubes can really change completely any matches, it works as well as defending/reinforcing walls as just distract the enemy. The same goes for piercing the ennemies wall at the right place to make a breaching.\n\nThe workshop in addition of the community that grows bigger, offers a lot of content (which are mostly skins and maps), the game come with an editor so you can basically make anything you want with a little time (always check the workshop first, maybe someone already did it first), it's not the best voxel editor I know but it do its job.\n\nThe only problem with that game is also one of its strong point: the community (which kind of remind me one of a certain Open Lierox game back when it was popular). Between the servers that play the same map over and over again for no reason, the players that sometimes go "full ♥♥♥♥♥♥" (Tropic Thunder reference, sorry for the slur) when all you have are the rushers who throws a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of grenades and hopes to hit top board with nothing but lucky shots (protip: rig the map with as much claymores/tripmines as grenades they're throwing, these guys never watch their steps) and the campers who sits on a high spot and shoots at everything that moves (protip: reply with a good ol' RPG launcher, it will blow them AND their camping spot, if they are in a tower, make it collapse),\nbetween the ugly ♥♥♥ skins (some people use the thiniest player skin in order to have a lighter hitbox, I personnally think it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but anyways, protip: write their ID if you can followed by "WHAT ARE THOOOOOSE???" in the chat) and the user-created maps that didn't involved level design at all.\n\nThe biggest flaw can be countered with a good team, intelligent playing always prevail over cheap tactics. The issue is: there is no team balancing, sometime, one side can completely rage quit as a whole and you'll end up with either no support or even no opponent (...at all), so the player have to switch team by themselves (which in fact never happens).\n\nTL;DR: Really good game if you're not afraid of voxels, has full personnalisation, easy to get hold of, is funny (no background tho), is balanced, play it with your friends.","November 7, 2015","true","45.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike other modern FPS games, which run poorly on my PC, this game runs well when all graphics and resolutions are at absolute lowest.  Which means turning EVERYTHING low and off.\nThe gameplay itself is similar to Counter Strike and Warface and many other vs games that include capture the flag, team deathmatch, and storm-like games.  Despite the graphics not looking real (more like minecraft), the game still looks good and the gameplay is smooth and interesting.\nOne of the things this game may need, in the future, is a single-player campaign.  Like Counter Strike and Warface, which will have a campaign, this game needs one to expand its gameplay.\nLike someone else said in their review, there needs to be a way to allow two or more players to collaborate their ideas into one map or gun to lower time spent and to make the map or gun out of two or more different ideas.\nThe guns in this game need work.  Just because you can customize your weapon, doesn't mean they WORK differently.  There need to be more gun types and accessories added, especially on the sniper rifles.\nThis is one of the few games that I know of where you can literally destroy the entire map.  With a team of about 10 - 12 compliant players, you COULD destroy the entire map and allow for NO room for spawning.\nI recomend this game to anyone who is into regular casual FPS games like minecraft with guns.  The servers can also be reached from different places such as at home, outside in internet providable places, and even at school.  This is important because I used to mainly play this game at school to pass by time.  I give this game 4.5 stars.","November 7, 2015","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike other modern FPS games, which run poorly on my PC, this game runs well when all graphics and resolutions are at absolute lowest.  Which means turning EVERYTHING low and off.\nThe gameplay itself is similar to Counter Strike and Warface and many other vs games that include capture the flag, team deathmatch, and storm-like games.  Despite the graphics not looking real (more like minecraft), the game still looks good and the gameplay is smooth and interesting.\nOne of the things this game may need, in the future, is a single-player campaign.  Like Counter Strike and Warface, which will have a campaign, this game needs one to expand its gameplay.\nLike someone else said in their review, there needs to be a way to allow two or more players to collaborate their ideas into one map or gun to lower time spent and to make the map or gun out of two or more different ideas.\nThe guns in this game need work.  Just because you can customize your weapon, doesn't mean they WORK differently.  There need to be more gun types and accessories added, especially on the sniper rifles.\nThis is one of the few games that I know of where you can literally destroy the entire map.  With a team of about 10 - 12 compliant players, you COULD destroy the entire map and allow for NO room for spawning.\nI recomend this game to anyone who is into regular casual FPS games like minecraft with guns.  The servers can also be reached from different places such as at home, outside in internet providable places, and even at school.  This is important because I used to mainly play this game at school to pass by time.  I give this game 4.5 stars.","November 7, 2015","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A lot.\nParts of the community are decent, and as long as you can find the right people, you can learn how to play pretty quickly.\nAlthough, one of the only complaints I have about it for now is that the Hunt matches could use more maps. Currently it's only the infested map, and it gets a bit boring after a while to be able to play Hunt on only one map. Other than that, it's a pretty great game! Especially when you see the workshop content! All the awesome player and weapon skins, quite a few people have contributed to this game's greatness! And finally, I will get down to it.\nPros:\nDecent Community\nA great amount of workshop content\nThere is at least 1 public server with people in it 24/7\n6 guns that are all special in their own way\nYou can literally just run around and knife people\nKill Deadpool as a duck with a Steam Sale RPG\nYou can literally have a stick thin gun\nBlowing up everything is fun\nThe fact that you don't pay for new skins, and still have CS:GO skins\n\nCons:\nSome parts of community are a bit iffy than the rest\nIf you suck at aim, you will suck at the game (not guarenteed)\nThe spawnkilling techniques of some players, rip\nThe fact that there's only one map for Hunt\n\nSo yeah, that's my review on the game. Still though, the spawnkills.","March 29","true","159.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I saw this game, I thought "It could be a nice idea, I must try it.". I'm not disappointed at all. There are few modes, deathmatch, team deathmatch, assault, capture the flag, castle battle. I played all of them, but I really liked castle battle mode. The point of it is to destroy all the treasures of the opposite team. At the beginning there's a time to secure your base, it means you can enclose your chests (treasures) to impede enemy to destroy them, block all the entrances, build sniper spots or whatever you want :D. After the time, you have to destroy all the opponent's treasures, before they destroy yours. Usually I have guys to play with (random guys on servers). You can create your own character, your map. Sometimes server can have more than 100 latency.\n\nI'm planning to buy this game and highly recommend to buy it. :)","May 9, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Has sort of a Counter-Strike and Ace of Spades/Minecraft feel. Making custom skins is fun, but if you're like me and you're lazy, you can subscribe to some workshop items and immedaitely get decked out.\n\nThe gamemodes are pretty simple and not a pain to play when the map changes, although some maps and gamemodes are pretty onesided (assault/defend). No weapon is really OP, it all depends on the situation and how much ground your team has covered. The shotgun is, in my opinion, the least useful weapon though, as it fires slowly and doesn't kill point-blank. That's what knives are for.\n\nMechs are a great help offensively, but they aren't too tanky, which means a handful of players could focus on it and easily take one out if the pilot isn't paying attention.\n\nPlay this game and poop on some kids = u=b","July 25, 2015","true","15.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even as it stands (in beta as I write this) the game's physics just feel "right": Movevement and aiming are tweaked so the game does not feel like it is getting in the way and the guns feel accurate and powerful. The maps are varied so that some favor sniping and others run and gun.  The community and developers are regularly adding to the list, keeping the game fresh.  On most maps EVERYTHING is destructible which can be hilarious at times. There are not a whole lot of players online but I have never been left wanting for a match - most rounds have more than 8 players.

What can I say?\n\nBrilliant.\n\nThis game, though at this point in time it is in the Early Access stage, is an absolutely amazing game that requires you to fight against others using weapons of all sorts in a multiplayer battle. With 3 different game modes to choose from (Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch & Assault), this game offers players a beautiful gameplay experience. It's like a mix of Minecraft and Battlefield, with all your blocks and whatnot and then your weapons, like AK's, RPG's and grenades that can be used tactically against the enemy, or can cause complete and utter mayhem. Apart from the game's beautiful gameplay, the ability to create your own character (apart from the dozens already provided) is quite unique compared to other games and also the ability to create your own map, if you wish. Can't be bothered to make your own skin? Doesn't matter! You also have the ability to download other people's skins if you wish to.\n\nUnfortunately, with the numerous servers provided, not many people seem to join all the time, but usually there is a game in Team Deathmatch - probably the most joined gametype - with about 10/16 people. Normal Deathmatch and Assault rarely have many players on the servers, but nevertheless, this issue doesn't make the game any worse. Another situation that players seem to face quite quickly is the lack of weaponry and equipment provided. There are 6 primary weapons provided and 3 secondary weapons, but the combination of weapons to choose from is quite small, and I hope, later on, that the developers add more weapons to this game. There will most likely be more to this, but with the slot for your knife and shovel, no other options for equipment are provided, so hopefully the developers are able to add more equipment in to make this game much more polished before it's full release.\n\nI completely trust what the developers are doing in order to make this game even more brilliant than it already is for it's full release. Right now, the game might be worth $11.99 USD, but anybody who wishes to buy this game will be more than happy with their purchase. I completely recommend this game to any others that wish to purchase this game.","August 10, 2014","true","9.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It is a sandbox shooter game, with destructable environments. And when I say sandbox, I mean the game is 80% sandbox and 20% Shooter. The ability to customize your character, piece by piece, dot for dot as if you were sculpting is the greatest idea in history. Sure its time consuming, and it isn't for everyone, but when you play against other people, you find yourself saying "Oh wow, thats a nice custom character" just before they shoot you in the face ebcause they are on the other team.

Blockstorm uses the Unity engine, which is known to be a very well-known engine and many of the games we know and love have been built using the same engine Blockstorm uses. Don't forget that the Unity engine allows the devs to create ports for their games so I expect Blockstorm to expand onto Mac OSX and Linux in the near future.\n\n\nCON'S:\n\n\nLack of people playing. I know this isn't the game's fault for this as you can see throughout my review, but the game has a few number of people playing everyday, peaking at around maybe 20 people online playing the game. Here's the official charts. [steamcharts.com]\n\n\n\n\nOverall, Blockstorm is an simple, yet fun to play game and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good shooter.\nMy advice if you enjoy the game, spread the word across your friends, our community we have here as Steam, tell them that this game is a well-done and a enjoyable game, this amazing game needs to be heard across the whole internet so we have more people playing and enjoying this.\n\nThank you for reading, I hope my efforts will improve upon the game.","June 25, 2014","true","19.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

There was a lot of rudeness and just simply put unfun maps thrown at me in my first hour or two of gameplay. Ping was also an issue but this is understandable with a game with a very small community I often had no choice but to join EU servers.\n\nWhat I think has the most potential is the editing. Utilizing the fact that you are in voxel worlds is important in games like this and the devs did a wonderful job implementing a very user-friendly character and map editor. If I had any artistic bone in my body I would have loved to use this tool to personalize my character to my liking.\n\nI think it's to early to give this game a good or a bad rating but I will say it needs a lot of work and be prepared for some annoyance if you support them in early access.\n\nHere is a video format if you're interested.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IHbhVsLZNA&list=UUf2ocK7dG_WFUgtDtrKR4rw","July 21, 2014","true","2.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

As in, guns can mow down forests. You can collapse a building with a player in it and kill them.\n\nCharacter models can be completely built.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/medievalswagger/recommended/263060/","medievalswagger","MedievalSwagger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/medievalswagger/","139 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSome may look at this game as another childish block based "MineCraft" style shooter.\n\nWhen in reality, it's just an incredibly fun and user friendly multiplayer shooter experience. This game easily gives you a creative outlet, which makes the game so much more personally AND conceptually. Instead of buying $14.99 DLC for a few new maps for your AAA titles, you can find a new server that is hosting brand-new community created and free maps that are incredibly fun. The diversity and variety between the maps creates more memorable and fun moments than you would even hope to experience in games like CounterStrike, or Call of Duty.\n\nThe ability to create your own character from the very pixel, allows anyone who desires it to express themselves in anyway they want. There are no limits, or restrictions to your creativity. You don't just have a few different generic military themed outfits to pick like Call of Duty or a few character models like CS:Source, And if we haven't learned anything, it's that You, the player, loves customization. Why else do you buy camos off the market or aim for the head as much as you do in Call of Duty?\n\nThe game is currently in early access, and is only going to get better. This game needs a lot of support, and needs to be brought out of the dark. The potential is amazing and it is a shame that more people aren't playing this game. I have a few pretty fancy AAA titles in my library, but this Indie game that isn't even finished yet draws my attention more than anything else in my library of games.\n\nIf you are to buy this game, you will enjoy it. It's very fun with friends, and the possibilities are endless with the amount of customization. I bought a 4-pack for my friends and we love to join up in the same server and play.","July 2, 2014","true","20.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Destruction is something that is far underused in video games today. I can safely say that Block Storm does destruction justice. Walls will explode and crumble as you fire upon them. Buildings will fall to the ground if there is no support. The map becomes a wasteland by the end of the match. The gun-play in this game is executed very well. Players are not difficult to see or shoot on the battlefield because the models of the players in-game are the perfect blend of block and realism.

Some games have shovels and blocks. Blockstorm, available in Early Access, is both, in an FPS that looks like it was built with pristine, never-been-stepped-on, never-chewed-on-by-your-kid-sister blocks.\n\nThe worlds designed with these Bigass Pixels are surprisingly gorgeous. Dusty Moroccan scenes and train stations (heyyyy...). Also, mountain passes and buildings with elaborate paths, and about a dozen ways across the mirrored team maps.\n\nFalling trees can kill, with hot shovel-on-tree action. Foxholes can be dug, as can tunnels. Jumping (slightly-lowered gravity, no turning in a jump) can be positively lethal. Headshots are possible from half a map away.\n\nYES, it is possible to machine-gun a hole in a wall from which your teammates can snipe. Or quickly block off an entrance with your Magical Backpack Full Of Concrete.\n\nA Very Long String Of Tastless & Offensive Expletives, this is cool. Get In This New World, And Now.

If you're like me, you've probably played several of these Early Access/Beta games and have been burned a few times by lack of content and general poor quality. Some I like (Prison Architect, Project Zomboid, Space Engineers), others I've quickly forgotten about. This is a game that makes the former list and will continue to recieve my support.\n\nFor some background, you shold familiarize yourself with a couple of other games- Minecraft (everyone knows of); Silent Storm (A tactical 3rd person RTS that has a fully destructable environemnt); The Battlefield games; King Arthur's Gold.\n\nThis game combines elements of each of those previous games and does most of it better than similar titles.\n\nThe resolution: It's a higher quality than Minecraft and in general, the graphics are a better quality than most Voxel games like it. If you blow up a block, for instance, the block explodes into dozens of smaller ones, that each obey the laws of physics. This lends itself nicely to a realistic feel in a gunfight, as the terrain and environment turn to rubble and dust around you!\n\nPhysics: Structures actually obey the laws of physics (mostly); if you blow up the base of a freestanding object, the rest crumbles (In the style of a 3d King Arthur's Gold).\n\nThe Editors: This is where the game really shines! Look at the artwork the community has done in regards to characters. There are so many small details you can edit, you can let your imagination run wild!\n\nThe map editor is also very detailed, allowing you to create huge structures, or vast fields. Were you a kid that liked playing with Legos and then destroying your masterpieces with as much ingenuity as you were legally allowed? That's the map editor in a nutshell :)\n\nYou can then take these creations and share them online with other players in game, or via the forums. Which brings me to....\n\nCommunity: Small but active. Devs and Admins regularly interact on the forums, answering questions and giving feedback. You get the sense that they really are relying on the players to help them shape the game... unlike soooooo many other games on this Steam list.\n\nAnd then we get to the bad...\n\nPopulation: Is depressingly low. I've yet to see more than 10 people on a server. However, when you combine this with all of the above and the Early Access state of the game, there really isn't much you can complain about. IN some cases, playing may even become secondary to creating maps and characters!","June 24, 2014","true","94.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","1"

Needless to say, getting killed by a guy with 600 ping , then having to listen how he "ownzed ya butt." isn't exactly a fun or engaging experience.\n\n- Grenades are stupidly op. You can't escape from them most of the time.\n\n- I'm sorry, but building aspect of the game is simply ♥♥♥♥. It's just a cheap gimmick, because no one builds anything useful. People just dig tunnels to other teams' spawnpoint , then spawncamp until the end of the game. You kill one of them, another one pops out almost immediatly. ♥♥♥♥ing annoying.\n\n- The community isn't that friendly. There are lots of friendly players, of course, but most of the players are 12 year old "meme loverz lelzzz" who camp all the time. I wouldn't really call them friendly. They are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\n- The game really, REALLY needs a "sprint" button.\n\n- Cs players are grenade spamming, crouch spamming, camping... Really, it's not hard to understand who played Cs before and who didn't.\n\n\nI think the game is  fun to play, but it isn't really anything special.\n\n4.5/10\n\nEDIT :\n\n"The community isn't that friendly" was an understatement. Campers and griefers basically ruined the game for me. A guy was just putting mines to spawnpoints in deathmatch. Wtf ? Why is this even possible ?

What other games do wrong, this game does right. The developers are very active and are constantly assessing the state of the game in relation to the players' feedback. At the current state of the game, it is well worth the asking price. One can choose from a multitude of strategies to wreck noobs, such as: Camping with a sniper, becoming a shotgun noob, lobbing grenades every which way, firing rockets at unsuspecting victims, or even destroying 50% of the map due to the destructive capabilities of the game. Amazing Early Access, and will  continue to enthrall all those who play.

Blockstorm is the an epic addition to the voxel shooter genre and is one you MUST PLAY. If you are fan of Ace of Spades, you are familiar with the immense customization that it offers. Blockstorm off even more in the sense of that, allowing you to customize the not just the look of your ENTIRE charater, but the maps as well. You can build, you can destroy, you can wreak havoc on other players. What more could you want from something like this? While, yes, it is still in development, for what it is right now, it is more than worth your money. This game is shaping up to be something INCREDIBLE (that's assuming it can even get more incredible than it already is). While the gameplay may feel slower than you are used to at first, one quickly gets used to it and can fully immerse themselves in something great. The game allows you to fully customize your loadouts as well, something AOS does not offer. Blockstorm even goes so far as to allow the player to create custom characters to go with the loadouts, and save them for later use. The fast paced action and strategy that goes into shaping the match to your advantage easily launches this game into the top 10 voxel shooters ever created. The game runs very quickly, even on older hardware, making this game accessible to everyone, even those without dedicated graphics! You don't need fancy gaming computer to play this, making it extremely accesible to anyone who wants to give it a shot. The movement is smooth, and the gameplay as a whole is even smoother. Not to mention an epic soundtrack!\n\nAll in all, I give this game a 9/10 and would recommend it to anyone who needs something to play. Keep in mind, I give it a 9/10 and it hasn't even finished development. In its current state, it beats out many of the other games of the same genre with ease, and only looks to be getting better. If you only have ten bucks to spare, and were wondering which game to choose, choose Blockstorm. You will not be dissapointed.","July 12, 2014","true","11.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

On all the games i have played on steam, this game is probably one or if not the BEST game i have played on steam yet. Its full of action and fun things to do with friends or even by yourself. The editor section is AMAZING with the amount of detail and things you can do with this game whether it be on the maps u can create and play or whether it be the characters you create. If i had to add one thing to this game it would be in a future update where the creators of the game could add a Search and Destroy type based gamemode and also more of an objective when playing online like Leveling up and presiging would DEFINATLLY bring this game to the fullest it could be because by adding levels would help make this game become even more AMAZING then it already is\n\n9.75/10  GREAT GAME","November 8, 2014","true","14.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I've been wanting a game with such in-depth character customization and this is it, Blockstorm.\nTL:DR; This game is an absolute blast and its worth the money. If you want to read the full pro/con list, read on below.\nHere my list of Pros and Cons;\nPRO'S:\n-Character editor. This game has got an amazing character customizer and you can personalize your character to the max. I've spent a while just perfecting mine and I'm definitely gonna make more and more in the future. The character editor is easy to use but very imposing when you first look at it. It took me about 10 minutes to get used to it but from then on I felt like a professional character designer. If you encounter a player with a skin that you think is awesome, no need to fear, the game automatically downloads it and places it in the category 'Downloads'. This might annoy some people (not me though :D) so an option to turn that off would be nice. It might already be there but I haven't found one. That could just be me though.\n-Map editor. You can go wild with your imagination and create your own map that you can battle it out on against your friends and enemies. There are a few presets that you can choose from and continue building from there or you can start from scratch. I'm defintely going to make a Doom™ themed map in the near future, you can count on that. If you are a keen Minecraft player and you love to build amazing creations, then you will love this.\n-Weapons. The weapons in this game are pretty awesome, my personal favorite is the Sniper Rifle (one shot kill >:D) with the handgun as my secondary. The weapons are pretty balanced from what I gather and weight is a factor in this game which many games can forget about. The heavier the weapon is the slower you will go, but don't let that stop you from taking a rocket launcher seconded by an uzi into a head-on fight. Good fun. I would love to see more variety in the future, or maybe a shop interface where you can buy weapons with money that you earn from kills (similar to Counter Strike) that resets with each new game, as to keep it balanced. But definitely more weapons please :D\n-Map interaction. You can build, destroy and completely obliterate most of the map, which is AWESOME. You get given 100 blocks that you can go wild with. You could build a small defensive fort to defend against attackers, create a small house to stay safe in or you could build some stairs to get up on to high places etc. I wouldn't mind seeing more variety in the blocks you could choose from (although building isn't the primary focus in the battlefield) because the standard block looks a little bland. But, it's early access and the game has yet to evolve, so things might change in the future. You can also dig with your shovel, which is a handy way to ambush people or to hide away (LIKE A COWARD, GET OUT THERE AND FIGHT! >:D) etc. If you had some different blocks it would be a great way to fool someone into a trap/ambush and destroy them. But I digress. Maybe some special blocks e.g. Fake Blocks that crumble when you walk over it as you fall into an abyss of C4 and death or Jumper Blocks that launch people high into the air. You could place fake blocks and then put jumper blocks under them and turn the enemy into swiss cheese as they fall to the ground. I've gotten a little off track. Anyway...\n-Music. The music in this game is so badass and awesome and makes you feel like the ultimate alpha who wrecks noobs left right and centre. That's all I can and need to say about the music.\n-Matchmaking. The quick match matchmaking system is fast and simple. Not much else to say about that.\n\nCON'S:\n-Music. The only problem I have with the music is it doesn't actually play during the match, which I'm disappointed about. That could be my fault, but I'm not entirely sure. It would be a nice small touch of just adding an option to have music in game or not.\n-Players. And by players, I mean IT NEEDS MORE PLAYERS TO BE PLAYING!! Other than that, the player's I've encountered so far have been good natured and fun to play against, which a lot of communities lack; a nice playerbase. Although, with the growth of a playerbase it increases the amount of trolls and unkind players who ruin the experience for others. So far I haven't had the 'pleasure' of meeting one in-game. Yet. Which is a good sign. As soon as I do though, they're getting a bullet in the face. Many times.\n\nAll in all this game is a must-buy (especially since it's in early access and you can have your say in the game's future design!) and I highly recommend it. From what I've seen the interaction between the Devs and the players is quite frequent (unlike SOME voxel based game Devs *cough* Wollay *cough*) which is a good sign. This is my two cents of thought, a bit of a read but if you made it this far then I applaud you.","June 14, 2014","true","17.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

In Blockstorm, you customized virtually every pixel on your body (NOTE: Legs, arms, hands, and feet mirror.) BTW: they give awesome premade costumes which you can customize even further (mainly military, law enforcement, Game Creator skins)\nMaps - Pretty balanced maps, with (Currently) three different game modes\nCustom Maps - You can create your own map with world options such as fog, background, water/lava, etc.\n\n\nCons:\nCommunity - Unfortunently, with free, noncensored character customization, you can get pretty inappropriate costumes at times, which are downloaded from other online players into your personal library of costumes\nGamemodes - Fun, yes, but would be better with more options\nBlock durability - Either I haven't found it, but I'd like certain blocks to be unbreakable in the game. Blocks break after taking a certain ammount of damage, so hiding behind cover won't work for long\n\n\n**Special OP Weapon Hints**\nDon't tell anybody, but here's my statagies to using OP weapons\n\nSniper Rifle - destroys most block with one shot, kills players with one shot. Don't quickscope, but aim right and you can kill them before their automatic weapons can do more than 33% damage on you.\n\nRocket Launcher - Takes time to lock on to a poition and fire, but has a blast radius so large you can practically just aim it near the person to finish them off instantly.

Blockstorm has a winning formula here and if it can get some healthy starter levels made by the community, it could really take off. With customizable maps and characters and with completely destructible environments, Blockstorm almost has it all. If they get a decent size community with maps that illustrate what an user can create and possibly a way to share character skins it would help this ship set sail. This is one of those games that will rely on word of mouth to spread. If you’re a fan of shooters and either don’t care or can get over the Minecraft graphics, you owe it to yourself to try out Blockstorm.\n\nFull Review: TheVideogameBacklog.com","June 20, 2014","true","1.5"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Anyway, Blockstorm is a first-person shooter which allows players to fight in a voxel battlefield where they fight against each other as their own avatars and with their own weapon skins which can all be downloaded freely from the Steam Workshop so you can have sweet-looking guns and be able to play as characters like Finn from Adventure Time, a Star Wars Clone Stormtrooper, Dallas from Payday, Sonic, Bender from Futurama, the possibilities are pretty endless and even better; there's even custom maps to be played and guess what?\n\nNo microtransactions, no boosters, no paying $200 for a knife skin even, you just pay up front and you get to have fun with custom content for free and that's part of what makes it great.\n\nA good part of the game is that there aren't RPG elements that are now commonplace in modern shooters so you have full access to all weapons and can change your loadout anytime. Switch from grenades to RPG? Alright. Want an Uzi instead of a pistol? Go for it. Everyone is on an equal playing field, especially because perks are nonexistent, it's all skill-based.\n\nThere are various kinds of game modes, and they have variety; although I want to see more added in later updates. You got your deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag but there's also an invasion kind of game mode (Assault) and there's even one where you have to steal the team's loot (Castle something), there are others like Hunt and all that stuff but I have hopes that they add more game modes in later updates; because that'd be sweet, maybe add Infection and VIP for example.\n\nAnd if you are looking for vehicles; I'm sorry, no vehicles can be driven but it isn't much of a problem unless you really are a fan of vehicles but considering the map structure, I don't really mind it.\n\nPros:\n-All additional content, community-driven is free.\n-No need to pay for cosmetic skins.\n-No RPG elements commonplace in modern shooters.\n-Almost infinite-customization of weapons and characters.\n-Active player base.\n\nCons:\n-More game modes should be added, maybe Infection kind of game modes and VIP.\n-Lack of vehicles; but the map structure doesn't really need vehicles.\n\nFinal score: 9.0/10 - Buy it","May 24, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I highly enjoy both Minecraft and CS:GO, so it is a natural fit.  I find the actual gun combat to be only so-so; it seems some guns are more usable than others and the motion isn't exactly fluid, but overall it is fun and adequate given the other stellar features of this game.\n\nThe customization options in this game are what truly won me over.  The Steam Workshop already has TONS of custom skins for characters, guns, melee weapons, tools, and NPC skins, along with custom maps and an in-depth map editor somewhat similar to Minecraft.  The character and gun customization tools are wonderfully in-depth and easy to pick up.  I made a few of my own custom guns and had a blast doing so, considering you can change both the shape and colors of the guns to fit your look.\n\nThe built-in maps are solid, and if you enjoy Minecraft resource packs there's a lot of really nice scenery and building inspiration in this game.  Obviously you can make your own maps, and host your own servers with those maps, which I find to be really cool.  Some maps are designed just for singleplayer or co-op with NPC and item placements.  The scenarios that you can create in this game have the potential to be fairly interesting once you get a grasp of the mechanics.\n\nOverall, this is a really solid bang for your buck title.  Even at the regular price it's a great value purchase.  There are a lot of Minecraft wannabe games out there, but this one really deserves a look if you're a First Person Shooter fan.

Practically all the players are experts, and thats very annoying. But ignoring that, these are the good points that I found in this game:\n● It has Workshop in which you can download Characters and Weapon Skins.\n● Very fluent gameplay with low-gamma PCs.\n● A very nice and comfortable gameplay, and Character/Weapon Skin/NPCs Customization is simply perfect and comfortable.\n● Beautiful pixeled graphics. Nice illumination.\n● Not a P2W like other games of this genre.\nIt totally worth its price.

I would be happy with this game even if it were a full release and all for quite the reasonable price tag.\n\nThe class layout is great, and the variety in weapons and tools are evident, however there are those times where you feel quite limited in what you can choose, but hopefully this will be fixed upon full release.\nThere really isn't an OP weapon, and by OP I don't just mean how many shots it takes to kill, I'm talking about how they all compensate themselves in different ways.\nFor example: The sniper (seemingly) Is always a one hit kill, but compensates with only one bullet per reload, which means if you're a bad shot, it will at least take you another 10 seconds to re-align your aim. That is, if you're not already dead or the enemy hasn't gotten away.\n\nUnfortunately there aren't many servers and players within Blockstorm, and most of them are demo players. However you can still play with these people and servers. And it's clear that the amount of players are growing, very gradually, but growing nonetheless. (Plus it's an early release, what the hell do you expect?)\n\nYes I know this review may be a tad biased, but if you play this game, you'll understand why. It's such a fun game and the limits in your strategy are pretty small.\n\nI just hope that the fan base doesn’t turn out to be ravaging 12 year olds or self-loathing Russians like the rest of 'em...\n\nOther than that 10/10.

So I don't know if it deserve to be bought or not in a early access.

A full review will be published once Blockstorm has released. You can also skip down to the ending to see my final score.\n\nBlockstorm is a voxel FPS game set in a world made of destructible blocks. All maps and characters included in the game are made with the same tools that are available to the public. You can build everything in Blockstorm, and you can destroy it. Blockstorm was developed by GhostShark and published by IndieGala.\n\nAfter playing Ace of Spades and Guncraft I've been a little skeptical on any voxel first person shooters. But, I was definitely wrong. In its early access state, Blockstorm provides more to do than Guncraft and Ace of Spades combined. You can build maps with the spectacular map editor, create your own skin, or even download other people's skins! The replyability of Blockstorm is definitely there along with a fantastic FPS design. With being able to customize almost anything, you can practically have a new experience everytime you play a match. Each match is quick enough so you won't lose interest while playing as a character.\n\nBlockstorm does lack in game modes with only providing classic deathmatch, team deathmatch, and another mode named "Assault". The game modes all work well and would definitely suffice if those were the only modes, but the more gamemodes the merrier.\n\nOverall, Blockstorm provides an excellent new addition to the FPS community and is definitely worth a playthough if you're interested in Voxel FPS like Ace of Spades or Guncraft.\n\nFinal Score: 8.5/10","June 29, 2014","true","1.1"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

The graphics, although being similar to block-based games, are very nice and aren't cheap in any way. The gameplay, on the other hand, is less solid. There are not too many hackers in the servers, however the scoring system for the game is pretty rough. You often won't get points for a kill or a flag capture.\n\nMODES - 10/10\nOne feature of this game that I love is the amount of different game modes. Instead of being a typical deathmatch-based game, there are plenty of other ways to play.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION - 10/10\nIn Blockstorm, you can totally customize the look of your soldier, bases, gear, everything. This really gives it a unique aspect that is akin to CS:GO.\n\nGRAPHICS - 9/10\nLet's face it - it's Minecraft. The graphics are nice, but only 9/10 because it's not really my style and there could be more textures/block types.","June 18, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Hacking isn't as serious as something like depression."\n\nNew review: 2/22/2015\n\nThis game is a lot of fun to play.\n\nThere are a few problems though. One is the teamkilling mechanism - you are sure to die to your teammates at least 2 or 3 times a match, thanks to all of the explosions. And if you accidentally kill your teammates 3 times in a game, they can vote to kick you. (which actually happens a lot)\n\nTwo: the moderators and developers use permanent bans. And if you disagree with their policies, they will lock or delete threads. I took snapshots of the relevant posts with Archive.today, in case they delete the threads. Moderators and developers speak down to all players on the forum with a condescending tone. The best you can do is hope the moderators and developers leave you alone. To that effect, I recommend that you do not join the Blockstorm forums.\n\nPage 1: https://archive.today/F7eIT\nPage 2: https://archive.today/Bk8xp\nPage 3: https://archive.today/xUqqY\nPage 4: https://archive.today/A2ps3\nPage 5: https://archive.today/1IoS6\nPage 6: https://archive.today/Fc3vP\n\nModerators threaten to delete another thread regarding ban policy:\n\nhttps://archive.today/HdY8c\n\nUpdate 2/24/2015: When accused by the community of cheating, the moderators assume you are guilty until proven innocent. Note that most modern justice systems assume you are innocent until proven guilty - therefore, Blockstorm has a medieval moderating system.\n\nHere are the statements by Keys of the Eighth Dawn, one of the game's server moderators, in the forum chat box, proving that Blockstorm uses a "guilty until proven innocent" medieval justice system:\n\nkoted: Oh, and btw, Noubexxx received a temp ban.\nkoted: Three days.\nkoted: Yeah, but if he does it again, it will be doubled.\nkoted: But as told him, the community thinks he cheats. So until he proves otherwise, he cheats, period.\n\nAnd here is a forum discussion in which players accuse Noubexxx of cheating, with no concrete evidence:\n\nhttps://archive.today/TVlbW\n\nIn medieval justice systems, the accused were often tortured without a trial, and had to undergo an "ordeal" to prove their innocence to their community. The same system is used in Blockstorm, where the player is presumed guilty, may be banned without a trial, and must similarly prove their innocence.\n\nhttp://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/medieval_law_and_order.htm\n\nSee also: "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WJXHY2OXGE\n\nKeys of the Eighth Dawn, a staff moderator, claims to support free speech, but locks threads in the forums to silence debate:\n\nhttps://archive.today/lqXY7\n\n"Ok, I'm locking it"\n\nhttps://archive.today/V1pMG\n\nUpdate 3/2/2015: Good news! A player who had been previously banned with no evidence, has now been unbanned, pending concrete evidence of cheating.\n\nThe bad news: on page 2, another player requests that a moderator lock a thread, to halt further free speech or debate.\n\nhttps://archive.today/YoGEY\nhttps://archive.today/BTlhH\n\nUpdate 3/2/2015:\n\nThey did lock the thread on page 2.\n\nhttps://archive.today/DOAti\n\nUpdate 3/2/2015:\n\nThe moderators have turned 180 degrees. They have now decided that cheaters are rare, due to the anti cheat system, and changed the policy to require concrete evidence before a player can be banned for cheating. In particular, Noubexxx has been found innocent of cheating, even after he was already punished with a 3 day ban.\n\nhttps://archive.today/90B1a\n\nUpdate 3/5/2015:\n\nA Blockstorm moderator wrote a reply to this review... and unsurprisingly, they immediately locked the thread, so no one can reply! Brilliant. :)\n\nhttps://archive.today/KzZPc\n\nUpdate 3/6/2015:\n\nBlockstorm moderator Exenoxx comments below that Noubexx was banned automatically by players for being rude, rather than banned by a moderator for cheating. If that's true, why did Keys of the Eighth Dawn list Noubexx on this Blockstorm forum page as banned for "Cheating: aimbot, no recoil;" ?\n\nhttps://archive.today/2IeYz#selection-625.2-408.146\n\nUpdate 3/7/2015:\n\nBlockstorm moderator Exenoxx unlocked one of the threads. Exenoxx claims players are "targetting" the moderators. So I guess a review on the way moderators and developers treat players is "targetting" them? I guess free speech must be a lot worse than insulting players, accusing players, banning players without evidence, and locking threads.\n\nhttps://archive.today/EgNWT\n\nUpdate 4/24/2015:\n\nA Blockstorm player wrote a very thoughtful argument against the "report players" forum, and how it could lead to cyberbullying.\n\nhttps://archive.is/Bxr2o\n\nA gem in the post above:\n\n"Players don't need to be publicly criticized and harassed because of their unthoughtful behaviour, no matter how bad it is. Hacking isn't as serious as something like depression."\n\nUpdate to review on 10/20/2015:\n\nI was banned from the community forums for joking that this game is dead. It's funny how touchy the moderators are. But I think it has an element of truth, now that I think about it. Lately, when I log in to play this game, all the servers are empty. (and there are over 20 servers!) There are only about 6 hours a day where a server fills above 5 players. Not only that, but since the game is multiplayer only, you can't really play when no one else is online. If you want to play this game, you need to be willing to schedule your time around when other people are online. Average number of players online at any given time is less than 10 - so the elite players end up just dominating the small match sizes. And, of course, if you dare to mention that the game has very few players online, you can expect a ban. After all, if you tell other people there aren't many players, they might not buy the game, and the creators will make even less money than they are making now, selling so few copies.\n\nUpdate to review on 10/24/2015:\n\nFrom the chatango on the Blockstorm website:\n\n1: I was totally for Pro's temp ban and not perma and got called an alt-account as well\n2: haha\n2: pro soldier must be very entreprenurial\n2: plot twist: we are both actually pro soldier, and he's schizophrenic\n1: :o\n2: :O loominati confirm\n\nUpdate to review on 10/25/2015:\n\nSupposedly I was banned from Blockstorm's Steam discussions for "necroposting." I just looked at the posts in question. The oldest "dead" thread was only 2 weeks old, which is still relatively recent given Blockstorm's community size, and the second oldest was only 3 days old. The real reason they banned me was because they didn't like my opinions on those topics - namely, for criticizing the game's activity, and criticizing the clans (such as the administrator clan UNIT). Also, they could have warned me before banning. This is exactly the overly harsh moderation I was talking about in my review, and I will continue to criticize you, your game, and your moderators, regardless of how many times you ban me or censor me.\n\nI'm surprised they only banned me for 7 days to be honest - in the past, they would lock threads permanently if I expressed unpopular opinions. We will see what happens if I criticize Blockstorm or the moderators again when my ban expires.\n\nOnce again, I'll point out I was banned not for cussing someone out, or for calling someone names, but because I said clans are stupid, and that the game has low activity compared to other FPSes. My ban is censorship, plain and simple.\n\nUpdate to review on 10/26/2015:\n\nExenoxx recently claimed via chat that "we are not like that anymore" and their policies have changed. However, someone recently contacted me over Steam to say they have been banned from the game permanently, starting a few months ago.\n\nI implore the reader to draw his or her own conclusions.","February 21, 2015","false","876.0"," 17 of 34 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","17","34","5","41"

(well, it's not a heavy graphic game released by AAA publishers like u-buysoft and such.)

This should also bring confidence to potential buyers of this game.\n\nPROS:\n\nI have found this game to be outstanding. First off, the game is literally like 150 mb (as of Sept. 9, 2014); I was blown away by this. The game is VERY well optimized and runs extremely smoothly.\n\nThere is an option to select which weapons you would prefer as your primary, secondary, and grenade/bazooka slot. The primary weapons range from a standard semi auto rifle, AK47, sniper, belt-fed machine gun, and shotgun. The secondary weapons range from pistol, shotgun, uzi. Finally, the grenade slot ranges from a standard grenade, RPG, and one more thing (can't remember at the moment).\n\nOne of the things that make this game so unique is the fact that each weapon has a specific weight. With increase in weight, the slower you run (and significantly I might add). This helps mitigate the overuse of some weapons. For example, If you were to equip the belt-fed machine gun, Shotgun, and rpg, your character would run so slow that it would make you an easy target. So balancing your weight is a must.\n\nAnother fantastic feature is that the environment is completely destructible. I have seen building in a map completely collapse when the lower blocks are destroyed. I am serious.. it isn't like minecraft where blocks will still be floating. If you blow-out the lower structure blocks in a building, the building actually collapses.. that is so cool!\n\nCONS:\n\nEverything has a good and a bad. The cons I found for this game was the limited number of weapon choices (however, dev's are likely going to be adding more). There is currently only Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Assult (atk and def); it would be nice if there were more game options. Final con, not at many people playing as I have hoped for.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI am one to cringe at early access games, however, this one has definitely change that. I found this game to be exceptional for what it is worth and have had a great time. Also, developers are ALWAYS talking with players on the community channel so check it out!\n\n9/10\n","September 19, 2014","true","21.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Each players are supplied with 2 grenades every spawn and this makes the match into a grenade dodgeball where players throw their grenade before they shoot when they see an opponent.\n\nKnifes are also one slice kill with zero sound effect where it makes you feel like you're cutting through tofu.\n\nThe only unique part about the game play is that the blocks are destructable, and it is interesting seeing the battlefield constantly change its shape and how players must move differently according to the change.\n\nBut remember, the rest is total sh!t.\n\nThe only hope to enjoy this game is to use most of your time designing and if you are want a good gameplay experience, I recommend you to bring your friends.\n\nOverall:\nGood concept but lack of polishing.\n\nI understand that the game community is not big yet and the devs do not have a large income from this game, but this is my honest impression of this game at its current state.\n","May 7","false","47.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It revolves around this editor, thing, which can be used to create your character, create a level, and you can make ANYTHING. Minecraft revolves around crafting, mining, and some combat. This revolves around combt, creativity, adrenaline, and excitement. In Call of Duty, you could run around and shoot people, but you could not create your character from the skeleton out. in this, you can. you can make a fat man, thin man, short man, tall man, disfigured man, AND you can base your characters off of other characters. While playing earlier, i saw a guy running buy with a Finn the Human model from Adventure Time. And then, i saw a guy who's model was Patrick, from SpongeBob SquarePants.\nThe possibilities are quite endless. I STRONGLY recommend that you purchase Blockstorm. The graphics are AMAZING, if you are pondering that. The graphics, shading, textures, movements, weapons, and editors are not like your typical "Minecraft with guns indie game" they are, in fact, Call of Duty level graphics, in cubic form. But, one of my favorite features of the game, is that the world is destructible. You can shoot blocks to destroy them. Pretty fantastic, if I do say so myself. Anywho, I highly suggest you purchase Blockstorm\n","September 21, 2014","true","64.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's like a nice more advanced version of Ace of Spades in my opinion. Gameplay is simple. Run, shoot, hide, build. It's not very fast paced. It's fairly relaxed and there is no singleplayer with AI etc.\n\nThe amount of weapons you have to choose from is alright. Nothing really fancy. But the weapons do their job. I'd say there is room for more unique weapons though if the developer is interested in adding more "out there" kind of weapons.\n\nI'd say despite this being an early access game. It is looking fairly polished with the content so far. There aren't many gamemodes as of yet. But there are apparently more coming soon.\n\nI do not know the plans for the game once it's finished (this is an early access review) But I do feel this game lacks in content that could increase fun in gameplay. Be it an improvement to the way the world/maps are affected by the player(s), maybe a singleplayer with monsters or something with little singleplayer missions (nothing fancy mind you, or perhaps some more unique weapons/items. But most important, I'd enjoy it more if there was a sprinting ability and being able to prone. Not just crouch.\n\nNow, onto the verdect.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nMy answer is if you love(d) Ace of Spades and similar games. Then I'd say this game may just be something you'll enjoy. So yes. I'd recommend it.\n\nIs it worth it's price of $12 right now?\nI'd say it just meets my requirements for a yes at this point.\n\nAll in all. A nice little game. If you're unsure whether to get it. I would suggest watching some gameplay videos first before purchasing.\n","September 22, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Not too serious, But not too twitch-shootery either. Features and gamemodes are still being added, And game rooms tend to be empty unless you join around your area's Prime times or before school hours.\n\nAs I write this, There's CTF, DeathMatch, Team DeathMatch, Assault modes. Assault plays a bit like some form of land grab where the defending team must prevent the attacking team from occupying a specific zone or more for a certain amount of time.\n\nThe controls and interfaces for the game itself and it's various editors were a little different at first, But with a little learning and some wikis I found htem extremely intuitive for working with Voxels, And the editor for making your own skins is top-notch. Nothing is more satisfying than making your own, Unique skin or map.\n\nWorkshop integration launched recently too, And already is filling up with many quality prefabs, Maps and characters. So far for it's time, And the constant work and communication with the developers, This is promising to be the Well-made voxel shooter of the year if more players support this company.\n\nTry the demo, Albeit you are limited in weapon map and skin it's a good sample of the fun that can be had in this game.\n\nI would rate this 4/5 stars.

Let's start.\nBueno, aquí estoy haciendo otra Review en Español e Inglés. Empecemos.\n\nFirst, when I've watched this game for first time, I was thinking "This is a copy of Minecraft or what" but, when I play it, it's best than I think, you can change your characters, you can paint your weapons ( for example ) You have an Ak, and in the WorkShop, you search SCARL-H, you can find it and you can do weapons and paint them too, but, you download it, subscribing to the Profile of the person what it do it and in the weapons menu you can select it!.\n\nSo, It's a very good game for me and it's very funny.\n\n========\nSPANISH\n========\n\nPrimero, cuándo ví este juego por primera vez estava pensando "Esto es una copia de Minecraft o qué", pero, cuándo lo jugué, fué mejor de lo que pensava, puedes cambiarte de personaje (o skin) y puedes pintar tus armas (por ejemplo) Tienes una Ak, y la buscas en la WorkShop, la puedes encontrar igual que intentar hacerlas tú también, pero, la descargas, subscriviéndote al perfil de esa persona que la ha hecho, la seleccionas en el menú y ya.\n\nAsí qué, És un buen juego para mí y también para mí es bastante divertido.","June 13, 2015","true","68.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

What I'm complaining about is the fact that you can't drop 10 blocks without dying.\n\nAnother question I have, is why does the sniper scope feel like im ICE SKATING WITH MY MOUSE?

I'm so tired of seeing a grenade and not being able to get away in time because my character is carrying lead in their backpack.\n\noverall, this game is fun, but it can get extremely frustrating on populated servers or flat-areas/trench-warfare type situations.

The artistic style is obviously another Minecraft clone. There is nothing new about the FPS gameplay. The soundtrack and sound effects sound like they were taken from a virus-ridden copyright-free sound bank. And I love it.\n\nPut simply, this game is fun. You get to tunnel, build, and deconstruct the map according to your wishes. The ability to destroy and build terrain makes this game interesting. I have logged in a fair amount of hours and I am still enjoying this game. Even despite the very small amount of servers that are open most of the time, I have been having a blast with all the new ways you can play an FPS with destructable terrain. If the idea sounds good to you, get it for sure. It delivers on what it is.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SurzIybpxlc","April 30","true","97.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supersuperfancy/recommended/263060/","supersuperfancy","The Kiesler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supersuperfancy/","24 products in account","BlockStorm, a game with a tiny community that results in about 3-4 servers to chose from. Those who play on those servers are often laggers that just teleport all over the place, quite annoying for someone who likes the sniper. Gun balance is meh and community is a mix of really cool people and depressed CSGO players that come to BlockStorm so they can finially use that knife skin they masterbate to every night. Oh yeah and don't forget the complete noobs that think this game is Minecraft, and those who act this way for some annoying reason. Speaking of skins, the custom skins in this game might be the only reason to play it. If you are a nerd or... depressed CSGO player, you can use cool skins of things you like. The skins creator gives you customization of almost every block in the model consisting of probably thousands of blocks. There is a internal frame you can't change (otherwise you could have invisible skins) and an external limit to how many blocks you can add (otherwise there would be skins that take up the whole map. This allows you to use some of your favorite weapons from TV, other games, Anime, books, and basically whatever you want (some sorry souls make pen15 skins). I don't know about you but I am a nerd and love creating and playing as my favorite characters from other games and Animes. This game was pretty good but the community has been slowy rotting and now all there is are laggers and few servers avalible. I would recommend this game if not for the horrible lack of players. Also know that this game is not the most serious shooter ever, you are not getting CSGO lvls of recoil and the guns are limited.","June 6","false","250.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You will occasionally run into ESP and Aim Bot users as well as cheats with the ability to pop any breakable block in 1 shot.\n\nLAAAAAAG. This is one of those games that lets lag run wild. Players will appear to teleport and have insane speed bursts while still being able to accuarately mow you down. Lets not forget dying a full second after taking cover.\n\nPermitted Abuse. The games customization is nice as stated but players will very commonly abuse it to make stick thin characters the color of the background.\n\nNo tools. The game is missing very common shooter tools such as vote kick... Many youre stuck on a single server with the above and you can't leave(if you want to play) or get rid of them.\n\nIt's almost a good game but it's weighted down by soooo much bullsh*t.\nPass.","November 6, 2015","false","122.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The game features a few gamemodes such as Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and Assault. The gameplay is well put and will be very familiar if you have ever played the original Ace of Spades and not the piece of crap remake.\nThe game also features two editors. A map editor and a character editor. The editors at first seem diffcult but once you find out what does what you should be able to use them just fine. The main thing I like about this game is the fact that you can have your own personalised character skin which you create yourself, which can take some time.\nI'd recommend people buy this game now while it is still in the early stages, so you can see the game evolve into something greater. I'm even sure once more people find out about this game it will top that shotty remake of Ace of Spades. So come on down and join the battle.\n\n10/10","November 4, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I really do.... but I can't and the only reason is:\nThe controlls...\nThey are... how should I say... not newcomer friendly...\n\nI myself preffer to be a sniper. I don't have the best computer, so rushing into the middle of the fight, guns plazing, really isn't for me, not because I don't like it, but because my computer freezes up and I find myself dead after it comes to... So, the first thing I do when I join a match, is I pick the sniper rifle, thinking "I'm just going to go sit up high and pick players off one by one!" Little did I know, that as soon as you bring up your scope, your character looses all controll over himself, and you find that a little movement turns into a giant swing of your gun, causing you to shoot the block next to the guy, giving away your position, and resulting in your death. You either need to counteract the movement the second you make it, or be the God of Quickscoping...\n\nNext, is the bane of my existance... this game automatically assumes you'll be running the whole time, so default movement is running... now you can press a button to make yoruself walk, but... why can't I turn auto-run off? thats the one thing I want...\n\nThe next thing that bugs me, and I have no god damn idea why... but why does like... EVERY first person shooter have "shift" as the "walk/run" key, and the "crtl" key as "crouch". I grew up with "shift" being crouch... I use it quite alot, and I guess some people are used to running... and it would make sence that your "run" key would be out of the way, so you don't accidentally bump it..\n\nI guess, with those things aside, this game is good overall... but i'm going to have to not reccomend this game, purely because the scope glide is unbarable and impossible  4/10","November 3, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Obviously there's a base to all models, to avoid people using invisible items / playermodels as tactical advantage- but the game would've been better off setting a minimum block count instead, so that when you /are/ actually creating something nice, you're not limited by the non-removable base blocks. (which can be recoloured, but that doesn't excuse their existence) The overall controls of the editor are horrid.\n\nNone of the weapons seem to feature any knockback, neither in dropping accuracy nor animation-wise, making the game overall feel, what's the word... bad. And the weapons' sounds don't help much to change that.\n\nThe default (not sure whether it's editable) map gravity is too low, making jumping feel very slow whilst you're still unable to jump very far. The fall damage badly reflects this by applying health subtractions of 2%, 75% and '♥♥♥♥ you you're dead now.'\n\nYour movement speed is affected by the weapons you carry, which also means you can't equip certain combinations. Its not possible to lower it by e.g. not equipping a secondary item, which makes the whole system feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ overall.\n\nThe quickplay feature works decently, if not for the fact that you risk connection to community-made maps, which tend to be even worse than the official ones, as well as them occasionally not featuring an actual objective.\n\nThe iron sights don't actually line up, you just hold the gun slightly more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly and the hud-based crosshair remains in place.\n\nOh and the general mechanics aren't any good either, grenades simply drop out of your hand instead of being thrown, the sniper scope just makes your mouse move really slowly instead of dropping accuracy, etc etc.\n\nAt this time it's been in beta for almost a year, yet it still feels like it was conceptualized a week ago, just thought that was worth mentioning.\n\nWorth playing while it's still in free beta? If you're an 11 y/o who isn't allowed to buy any games, sure, but it's still worse than other available free games.\n\nWorth paying for? Not unless that would mean you'd get to slap the developers until they would make it a playable game.","May 4, 2015","false","3.1"," 22 of 49 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","22","49","2","0"

There are plenty of Customization opitions aka skins for weapons and maps. What makes the game cool and interesting is the destruction of blocks. But ultimately I don't think this game is ready or even worth $6.99. I was lucky enought to win it from a giveaway.

For instance I wanted to make a Bolter Pistol, but since the Bolter Pistol is somewhat bulky, it wouldn't work, it just doesn't give you nearly enough room to expand on your ideas. The customizer needs serious work to allow people much more leeway with their ideas on weapon designs, and if you want to make a drum clip that is proportional to the rest of the gun, prepare to be sorely disappointed.\n\nI was very excited to find out that weapon customization was a thing in this, and I was all hyped and excited, but I had all that crushed and disappointment set in.

Those games are games people play to compete with other plays. Would it add to the immersion? Yes.

A website? A special bundle? A game? Turns out that Blockstorm was project X. Considering the world was already over saturated with Minecraft-eque clones at the time, I wasn't impressed.\n\nIt's simple as it looks - a Call of Duty esque shooter in a Minecraft-esque setting. Play typical FPS matches in a handful of prebuilt levels as well as the option to play in player made block levels. I could never get my aim quite right, and perhaps that will take some time and more sensitivy adjustments, but I wasn't falling in love with the game to feel like bothering further. I got some good kills here and there, but I got trashed while I was wailing my mouse around, or barely dragging it to hit a ducking, strafing target. There are Quick Match, Server Browser, and Editor modes.\n\nI do like that changing your weapon and equipment loadout affects your speed, and the sniper rifle feels like a viable weapon versus something that only pros will use. The neatest thing about Blockstorm is the ability to create custom maps, guns, and characters. You can't buy DLC, so make your own!\n\nI don't like Blockscape, but I feel this game does appear to do well with children and teens. With the few minutes I've played, the community seems friendly and non-toxic, so this is probably a good game to give to a child that you're not comfortable with them playing Call of Duty. The customization will keep them going, but this adult would rather play a more fufilling, competent shooter.","March 23","false","2.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

The voxel system is something I loved since I first played Ace of Spades on one of the free weekends.\n\nHowever, I just can't understand how the game works.\nI understand the premess of the game with it's objective systems yet I have no idea how the gun play works, of which many games at least show you a tutorial of this. Sure, I can look this up from other users yet I do fee the game should have some responsability in that department.\n\nAlso, I found that the choises for arnaments are very restricting. There were your base weapons (ARs, Shotguns, LMGs etc.) but that was it, really. I don't feel like I have as much freedom as some other games, which, as a user, I need to have to stay interested in the game. These also, to me, feel and move very clunky as well as the contraction time on crosshair. I personally think a few tweaks may be needed to make the guns feel like guns and not a lucile bat that sparks out bullets.\n\nThe maps that I play in the quick-join seem to be very small, restricting and quite dull. Now, I don't have enough experince to see how it works propperly, yet, if these are the maps the devs have made, I don't think a tiny 3-room map with a few corridors is enough for a CTF, maybe a DM or a small TDM.\n\nTL;DR: I don't like the game for the gunplay, maps and how hard it is to get into, yet I do find the premess of the voxels and skin customisation very nice. It's a decent game, but, I can't say I like it.","July 2, 2015","false","2.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I'm saying what I see.\n\nPro:\nThis game is very fun. The idea is great and it's VERY enjoyable to be able to make your own skins for yourself and your weapons. That alone makes the money I spent worth it.\n\nThere are plenty of game modes to choose from that all feel different. Every game mode has a different objective or approach to it and it actually is really enjoyable to bounce around to different modes.\n\nCon:\nUnless I'm crazy, the servers are very empty a lot of the time. Only 1 or 2 in any given timezone has players-even though there's like 5 or 6 servers total to choose from, and usually only one of those two is close to being full I've found.\n\nThe sound design is horrible. You don't hear gunshots unless you're RIGHT UP NEXT TO THE PERSON THAT'S SHOOTING. The only time you ever hear a gun being shot at you is a slight "whiff" when bullets are close to you that's very quiet. In fact, a lot of the sounds are very quiet or nonexistent. Footsteps, damage sounds; the sound design in general just doesn't seem very well contrived at all.\n\nVerdict:\n\nAt this point in time I can't in good conscience recommend the game. It's FUN, but rather empty and home to some pretty annoying design choices. Particularly regarding sound. 5/10","June 27, 2015","false","3.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I tried playing for a bit only to find there are way too many things to scroll through while playing to get from one item to another (theres about 6) then after you get past that part or not theres the problem of the sights, WHERE ARE THEY ( you would think that maybe it would be cool to have people make their own sight design too but NOOOOOOO there arent any. then finally you have the problem of the Player pool ( overall i see about 30 people on maximum) Not reccomended","August 18, 2015","false","3.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I played it 100 hour of it. To be honest, it was a waste of my 15 dollars. The game has potential, but it is not anymore in early ascess, yet it still needs alot of work. They lack weapons, and the movement are to rubbery/slow. It is not a bad game, but I just don't perfer it to anyone.","October 9, 2015","false","108.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

It boasts a tf2 like style of gameplay, but movement decreases accuracy. I feel that this game should be more like an arcade shooter more than a csgo type game. It also has spray patterns, which completely mess up the game. Spray patterns are only good in some games, like csgo.","January 31","false","0.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","1"
