Some of the more advanced levels introduce things like movement mirroring (reverses your intended movement) and a time limit.  On the negative side, the time limit levels, while challenging, can pose a roadblock if you are not enthusiastic about learning/recording precise moves in order to complete the timed levels.  It wouldhave been helpful to set difficulties or bypass the countdown aspect of the timed levels.  Over all a very nice game, and very resonable price.","September 30, 2014","true","23.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
