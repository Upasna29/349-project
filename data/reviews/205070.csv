"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/205070/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Void is possibly the oddest and hardest to classify of Gaijin Games Bit.Trip saga. Playing as what more or less amounts to an all consuming black hole, black and white blocks come at you from all sides of the screen in time with the beat of the track, and your job is to grab the former and dodge the latter. Every block you manage to catch increases your size a bit, which gives you more points but makes it harder to dodge obstacles and slower to move around, creating a game of give and take as you attempt to keep yourself as large as possible before having to shrink back down.\n\nAt its core, I think the ideas behind Void are really original and intriguing despite being incredible simple, but my issue with it is that Gaijin doesn't seem to have any idea what its doing with these mechanics. Through the games 3 levels I never felt particularly impressed with any of the patterns or sequences, they simply played out and I went through the motions to complete them, without so much as a small bit of satisfaction or enjoyment coming from it. Although it's a very short game (I finished it in under an hour), it drags its feet so much during levels that I found myself wishing it would end only halfway through a level. It fumbles over the line of acceptable repetition into monotony, and as a result I can't see myself wanting to ever replay it (which is definitely something the developers were hoping for, given its leaderboard centric design).\n\nIt's not that I think Bit.Trip Void is a bad game, it's just an unfocused one that attempts something neat but screws up the execution. The art design and soundtrack are as excellent as the series is known for, but where Gaijin's other games kept me glued to my screen for hours on end, this one made me want to abandon ship after only a handful of minutes with it. For as much as I love the rest of the series, there's no denying that that is a definite problem, and reason enough for me not to be able to recommend it.","June 16, 2014","false","1.1"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","22","33","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/recommended/205070/","frazr_lzer","viad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/","164 products in account","Bit.Trip Void is the third entry in the Bit.Trip series, taking a much different gameplay approach not seen in many games. As with the other Bit.Trip games, it has its pixel based graphics and chiptune style music. However, this game's aesthetic is more chilled out with the backgrounds being mostly solid colors and gradients and the music having a more relaxed beat. The story brings Commander Video with other people who look like him and interacting some kind of aura or ball that makes them bigger or smaller. That brings us to the gameplay, which indeed revolves around a kind of ball.\nOn the screen is a black circle that can be controlled around. The goal is to get black blocks and avoid white ones. There are different patterns to react to with differing amounts of black and white blocks and some powerups that will be useful to finish some sections. The end bosses tend to reference other Arcade games from the 80s and fit in with the gameplay. In a way, this game feels like Katamari as the goal is to collect objects and in doing so, increases your circle's size. There is a button that allows you to reset your circle to the smallest, which is important to avoid white blocks or move faster. Hitting white blocks can make the ball smaller, but you do lose some points that way.\nThis game tends to be easier than the last 2 in the series, which is evident by the more relaxed style rather than the more energetic visual style of previous games. Simply controlling a black circle to collect other things and avoiding white lends some precise player control like in platformers or shoot em ups. The rhythm element is still in this game where collecting black squares make a sound, but the player has more control and can somewhat vary how each set of sounds play. Regardless, the unique gameplay makes this fun yet relaxing to play. That isn't to say this game is very easy, since the game does throw some challenging things that may cause a game over.\nBit.Trip Void is overall less energetic to give some relaxed gameplay with a slightly easier difficulty. The idea of collecting black while avoiding white is simple, yet lends itself to some complex patterns to tackle and has some difficult challenges that can appear. With a simple yet original gameplay idea and more mellow design, Void is both fun to play and not as taxing on reaction time while having some moments of difficulty to mix things up.","July 16, 2014","true","1.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Highly addictive, simple gameplay premise that's played with in increasingly creative and surprising ways as you delve further in. The interface and general aesthetics are like nothing I've seen before it, scores, multipliers etc simply drift along vaguely in the background, barely noticeable, even mode changes are subtle enough that you might not realise when it happens at first.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gravityunown/recommended/205070/","gravityunown","GravityUnown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gravityunown/","52 products in account","Bit.Trip Void is one of the more tolerable entries within the Bit,Trip franchise. I can't say I've been on good terms with the rest of the Bit.Trip games seeing as they utilize fake rhythm based mechanics that don't get you into the groove like actual entries into the rhythm genre, but I found Void to be the most enjoyable out of this series.\n\nVoid can be considered more as a "bullet hell" type genre, as most of the gameplay revolves around avoiding many small white pixels that are flung towards the player while at the same time collecting black pixels. The graphics are rather simple, but compelling as well, however it also serves as the biggest hinderance of the game. You see, while playing the background fades in and out from time to time, and during the those periods of blackness it becomes nearly impossible to see the pixels you are supposed to collect, which results in quite a bit of unfair score drops if you end up missing some. However looking past that the rest of the gameplay is pretty solid, each level is unique from eachother, the gimmicks of the bosses are quite amusing, and the music is by far the best element of the game. I do recommend it, however I can't promise it'll be enjoyable until you actually get a grip on the game's difficulty.","December 18, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They're all decently put together, though I think RUNNER is the best of the ones I've played. I can't really give any of them except maybe CORE anything other than a thumbs-up, though, because of just how well the music and the graphics work together.\n\nMy final recommendation on this? Buy RUNNER, but if you can't beat RUNNER, buy this and actually be capable of beating a BIT.TRIP game. :P","June 27, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I fail miserably at this game due to it not being a game based on "rhythm" where you hit certain chains of beats related to the music. In this game you control a big black ball of void which is able to run freely around the screen. The objective is to collect certain beats and to avoid other ones, by pressing the space bar you "cash" in your points and shrink the void sphere. Sometimes challenges conclude before one is officially over and the controls reset before you even know it, it's a little problem but not a big deal.\n\nThe music of this game does not play if you aren't doing very well, you just hear a repetitive beat over and over, if you do poorly, you go down to this zone where you collect beats which are worth no points and you try not to die. I STRONGLY advise you to play this game with a controller since very frequently you need to move diagonally across the screen faster than you anticipate. The PC version is probably the worst port of the game and can be very frustrating without a controller.\n\nI only recommend this game because it isn't bad, it's the controls and especially the challenges, they are very messed up. Buy it if you have a controller or if the game is less than its current price.\n\n51/100","July 8, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
