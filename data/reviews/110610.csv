AZM plays a bit like the old Spectrum game Jet Pac with waves of enemies spawning to testing your twitch reflexes as you chase a high score.

I'm a gamer since the Atari days and while I still play a lot, the fun I get is obviously not the same of when I was young. Well, this game succeded in re-creating the same pure joy I was experiencing back then. The graphics are frankly unattractive and the user interface is a bit amateurish but the core gameplay...that's distilled fun for you to enjoy.

If you haven't experienced it, be sure to try out AZMD. While not the greatest survival sidescroll shooter, it is definitely one of the most unique. Very straightforward and easy to pickup and put down at any time. The levels get progressively much more difficult, but it's well worth unlocking many of the UFO's and extra spacesuits.\n\nThat being said, I will add that the achievements in this game (particularly 'All the Medals') are insanely hard to get. I am less than proud to say that I endured to earn them after countless hours of gameplay and testing. The reward was definitely not worth the time invested as I feel that they were made unnecessarily difficult. In particular Leves 24-Alpha and 31-Alpha have boss count achievements that are horrendously tested/scaled. I walked away feeling less achieved and more unnerved that I'd lost so much time learning to do something completely pointless.","November 26, 2013","true","69.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Yes, it has a 'retro' feel about its simple gameplay and yes, it has good controls, but it's just too bland to be fun. You shoot things left and right (literally), gather crystals and sometimes carry things to a gathering point. There are platforms, but they are just horizontal lines that stretch through the whole 'level'. You get weapon upgrades and unlock spacesuits over time. That's the game. It's very repetative and while that was fun in Pang over 20 years ago, it just doesn't hold up today (plus Pang at least tried to put some effort into giving you some motivation).\n\nIf you look for a very simple shoot 'em up this might be for you, but in general I think it doesn't offer enough to hold your attention for more than 15-20 minutes.","August 28, 2014","false","0.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjst9/recommended/110610/","jjst9","Doktor Egg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjst9/","1081 products in account","Alien Zombie Megadeath doesn't feel old, it actually strikes me as fairly modern and a product of its time. The only thing it about it that is old is the way it makes me feel. Just the name of the game makes me feel old. It is so desperately trying to be cool by throwing tired tropes in a way that it perhaps hopes is ironic. The claim of being “old school” is just another sort of pretension. It wants to re-create the simple colourful joys of past, when a plot was a one paragraph intro before the shooting started but while it throws the story out the window what is left doesn't measure up to the old classics it is trying to ape.\n\nI'm struggling to place AZM in a genre. It feels half way between a platformer and a twin stick shooter. It plays most like a twin stick but your little spaceman is affected by gravity (which is odd if you think too much about it) and so can only run along the platforms but each level is made up a half dozen or so liner platforms, all of the same length, stacked above each other so it is like jumping about on some sort of shelving unit. You can also only shoot left and right which makes dealing with the enemies that attack from above and below a pain in the neck and ♥♥♥♥ respectively and deaths to them just feel rather cheap. It is a twin stick that robs you of the freedom of movement and attack, the joy of which is the joy of twin stick shooter. It all just feels, well very busy but not very exciting. Very rich and colourful and full of features but not much fun.  It just doesn't feel quite right to me and so I struggled to have fun with it and I don't feel I can recommend it. On the other hand if you enjoy the feel of it then there is certainly a lot of it in terms of content. Utlimately though, If this is old school then I think I am ready to embrace progress.","December 19, 2013","false","2.1"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"

You've got a blaster, things want to kill you, kill them first. Difficulty and strategy enter the picture as platform layouts on each level increase in size and complexity, new obstacles enter the mix, and (of course) more and more waves of aliens get lobbed at you. There's not much in the way of depth here, but Alien Zombie Megadeath doesn't really need it. The game straddles the line between survival drive and score chaser, and is better off for not deviating from it.\n\nThere's a fair amount to do in Alien Zombie Megadeath even with the rather basic concept, with a huge pile of levels to plow through, and some new outfits to unlock as a reward for your efforts. It's also really easy to just pick up and play here and there, be it as stress relief or to knock your friends down a few pegs on the leaderboard.\n\nAlien Zombie Megadeath may not look like much, especially for 2011 (I honestly thought it was older), but it's still pretty fun and worth snagging.","January 13","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
