"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scottalogan/recommended/210870/","scottalogan","Logan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scottalogan/","219 products in account","This game is an Arcade title synonym of cash well spent.\n\nThe platforming of this game is in fact a work of art, not only it's exhilarating to finish a stage and perform multiple jumps in a row dodging fire balls and spikes and moving platforms, but the AI in charge of creating the Infinite Possibilities of the stages is brilliant.\n\nInfinite Stages - AI.\nThe design and work done on the Level Director AI is amazing. You can customize the types and amount of obstacles in a stage on Free Play, and the AI will pick Specific places to add all the flaming wheels and spikes you want that will Guarantee the level to be both challenging and beatable. Even if you max out the sliders to add every single piece of challenge into a stage and the screen is Filled with things you can't begin to pronounce without getting killed, you can activate a computer AI to display the correct path of the level, and sure enough, it's always there. It's also somehow very visible even at the hardest stages, takes time to nail the correct time to jump and run and stop, but just by starting the stage you can see that there is a way out. Also another thing done very well is that most of the "Correct Paths" on stages are in sync with the time you Start the level, meaning there's almost never a time which you need to stop and Wait too long at starting a level, ensuring quick respawns and retries and a fluid gameplay which you can beat a level, and play the next, over and over and over and again.\n\nSoundtrack.\nThe soundtrack is definitely one of the best parts of the game, it hypes up the gamer to complete the objectives while adding a fun ambiance to each stage, so that even if you fail you are still enjoying every bit of it, and when you succeed every jump in sync with every beat of the song feels fairly rewarding.\n\nStory Mode.\nStory Mode features a very good Game Mode for new players, starts up on new and fairly simple stages introducing new objects and traps along the storyline followed by a very cool animation cutscene in each beginning of Chapter. It gets of course increasingly difficulty but the level design is done incredibly well, in the sense that starting at Chapter One and progressing to Chapter 6 you definitely feel skilled enough to take the challenge and well practiced on the mechanics of the game.\n\nGame Mechanics.\nThe main features of the game are the ability to customize your character with all the available items and colors for you to have a more personal experience when you play all the stages, and all the Game Modes, while playing Story Mode you are introduced to most, things like "Double Jump" "Jetman" "Wall Level" and many others, to add to even more replay value and different challenges. Also having a very good Local Multiplayer up to 4 gamers to have a blast and face stages. The jumping at first definitely feels a bit "heavy", but being able to hold the jump button to achieve maximum height fixes that with a bit of practice, and works very well on the entire game. Providing precise jumps with precise controls to avoid precise and massive amounts of traps.\n\nOverall, amazing game, fun and hilarious Arcade Title. Well worth for you to play it by yourself, or with friends.\nIs the kind of game that if you just want to run a cool fun and quick game to play it for a bit while waiting for a pizza or something, since you already beat the entire Story Mode once you played it for the first time. This is definitely it, right along games like Mario, Sonic, and other Arcade titles that ensure fast and good entertainment.","November 25, 2013","true","16.0"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

The gameplay is pretty simple and straight foward, you can jump and move left and right. Ocasionally you'll be playing some levels with a mechanic, it can be double jump, using a jetpack, having your body attached to a sphere thing that makes you roll through the level making you calculate precisely where you're going to land, and these are just some of the possible ones that you can experience. The controls are responsive and intuitive, atleast with the 360 controller, I didn't tried playing with the keyboard.\n\nDespite the fact that Cloudberry Kingdom is really enjoying to play and the fact that it provides a great amount of satisfaction when you finally beat a level you were stuck in for quite some minutes, or even hours, I found myself getting really frustraded when I reached around the level 196 in Story Mode. Not that I don't enjoy the game, but I just don't feel like I should invest time playing these levels over and over again until I get the hang of it.\n\nVisually, Cloudberry Kingdom, is nothing to be amazed by but it kinda gets you into the spirit of this little fairy world it takes place. The sound assets are pretty much non existent but the soundtrack is really really good. In the end, I honestly think that if you enjoy titles like Super Meat Boy or VVVVVVV, that provide alot of challenge you'll certainly have a great time with Cloudberry Kingdom. Not only it has a Story Mode that you can beat, but you can also generate random dungeons for you to play and customize your character, which adds alot of replayability. You certainly cannot go wrong with Cloudberry Kingdom if you're a fan of hardcore platformers.","April 18, 2014","true","6.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

If you are reading this review, this means you may be thinking about buying this game. Before the review starts, I would like to say YES do buy this game, it is so much fun. Anyways, onto the review!\n\nCloudberry Kingdom is a game with infinitely generated levels. Every single level is possible to beat, no matter the challenge. The AI can show you the path through the level, if you're not so sure. There is a story line, but I don't really pay much attention to it. Mostly what matters are the levels themselves. There are quite a few power-ups you can be, which affect the gameplay in big ways. Most notable is the spaceship power-up, which I quite dislike. All the others are pretty fun to play with, such as the double jump, jetpack, hero-in-a-box, and a few more. Most of the powerups are quite enjoyable, but still, that ship power-up? No thanks. The graphics are nothing to write home about, just a cartoony style perfect for a game like this. Overall, I'd rate this game 8/10, mostly for it's replayablility. But, the spaceship, I HATE THE SPACESHIP LEVELS UGG- Anyways, yea, buy this game, it is gr8!","August 5, 2014","true","7.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacepaste/recommended/210870/","spacepaste","Jitters","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacepaste/","410 products in account","This platformer is quickly addicting, thanks to how straightforward it is. Procedurally generated levels (not counting campaign), combined with the various modes and hero types you can unlock keep this game fresh, fun, frustrating and funny all at once. There will be moments where you will die tens or hundreds of times before completing a level, and with that there will undoubtedly be intense frustration.\n\nReaching the end isn't only incredibly satisfying; it also makes you realize after completing numerous levels that they're meant to be finished quickly. Each generated level has a predetermined path the player should follow that allows them to simultaneously collect everything while practically speed running. If, at any moment, you don't think that's possible and are having a hard time, you can have the AI demonstrate for you how to win the level you're on at the expense of a certain number of crystals. It definitely helps you train your eye to find openings in a sea of death traps, provided that you have the patience and are masochistic enough to endure it all.\n\nAs if torturing yourself isn't enough, you can do the same with your friends and that's usually where the comedic value comes in. Bungee mode will either enhance or completely destroy your friendship with others because of the coordination it mandates. If any one player dies, the rest of you get to carry the deadweight and that obviously makes gameplay more difficult, but it can look quite hilarious. You can still play multiplayer without everyone being bound to each other if that's not your style, but I think it's too hard to resist playing that mode once in a while.\n\nLet's not forget level customization. If you ever feel like conjuring up a level of your own, dive into free play. All assets are available to choose from and can be scaled to your taste. As long as you can verify that the AI is able to complete the level, you know you have one that's possible to finish and you can challenge your friends to complete it.\n\nAll of the aforementioned and other content makes this game a great buy for casual and hardcore gamers alike. I cannot emphasize the importance of using a controller, though. Sure, this game works fine with a keyboard, but I believe you'll be better off not using that, especially on the more difficult levels.","June 29, 2014","true","56.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

These levels get harder and harder as you go on. While you're in these levels, you can collect gems that allows you to slow down time, be shown where to go, and see a bot do it.\n\nThe story mode has you go through these levels with different twists like double jumping, being big or small, and being stuck in a wheel. It also has a pretty cool intro animation.\n\nThe Arcade Mode has you go against everyone's score. You can chooses to do it with only double jumps or only being big or having nothing. Score is based on all the gems you get. If you get all the gems in the level, your score multiplier will go up. If you die or don't collect all the gems, this will go down. Currently, I'm addicted to this mode.\n\nMarathon Mode lets you go through a long level after level where you choose the difficulty based on all the monsters in there.\n\nOverall, the idea of improving your skill by upping the difficulty really makes you want to play the game again and again, especially with a high score.

The techno music is catchy while the difficult levels abuse you and there are different modes other than just 'make you very angry'. You can customize your character,  The story mode is fun to see how far you can absolutely make it, there's an arcade mode that's like a marathon, and many different types at that, like trying to speed through the level as a timer constantly goes down. And my favorite of all is the custom mode where you can set the degree of difficulty with different obstacles to the point where your entire screen is moving with some sort of hazard. And to top it all off, different ways you can play as your character, like a mini or giant mode, a space ship, or even bouncing.

It’s fun but eventually wears on you as all you really have to do to pass any level is just run and time your jumps accordingly. There is really no challenge to be had other than memorizing a particular levels jump patterns. As for the randomly generated levels, unlike a game like Rogue Legacy, the randomization hurts the overall experience. If it were designed with a more careful hand the game would have been much better as each level could have presented something unique. As you advance further you will continually see the same type of level over and over again. I would recommend only for the hardcore platformer crowd and even then I would say wait for the inevitable sale price.","March 26, 2014","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/210870/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","A game that is pretty similar to Super Meat Boy. It's uglier and allows you to use power-ups though, so it's also, in a way, easier. Power-ups like slowing down time or letting the computer show you the way to proceed will help you get through the many, many levels.\n\nI think there are about 240 levels in total, but each level can usually be finished within 30 seconds (if you don't die, that is, which doesn't happen all that often).\n\nThe levels get trickier the further you get and you are introduced to new game mechanics along the game. All these things ease you into the game, and by the time you're playing level 160 or so you probably know how to work your way around the levels. No, it doesn't make it any easier, on the contrary, but I salute the developers for not throwing you into the deep right away. It makes the game more accessible for anyone who wants to give it a go. And since the levels are short, it hardly ever becomes frustrating. But if it keeps you interested for that long, that's an entirely different story.\n\nIn all honesty though, I still prefer Super Meat Boy because of the better visuals and tighter controls but Cloudberry Kingdom is a fine runner-up. I like you sadistic platformers add this one to your wishlist.\n\n[Rating: 72/100]","August 4, 2013","true","4.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Actually there is the complete oposite. with the levels being random, there are multiple times per level where you may have to hop on the spot, or completely stop and take a step backwards to get where you need to go.\n\nThis completely takes away the flowing nature of super tight platformers, which i think is THE core mechanic.\n\nIts a shame really.

Arrows to move, A to jump. Tutorial completed, now get out and die. A lot.\n\nWhen the mechanics are so simple, the quality of the game is only determined by the maniability and the level design. Both are gems.\nLevel are so well made, platforms and swinging spiked blocks are are put together with a millimetric precision so you can run through the entire level without pausing, but a millisecond of hesitation will mean your death. While playing this game, it reminded me of Rayman Legends/Origins. That's the biggest compliment a platformer could dream of.\n\nThis game is never unfair, there is always an evident way to maneuver through all the hazards and your character responds well, so stop accusing the game and try again. Then when you manage that perfect run through the 50 blocks, spikes and flamethrowers... that's just so satisfying you can't stop.\n\nLevels are extremely short, and that makes the game really addictive. Wow, already 50 levels ? ok, 10 more levels and I stop. Then 10 more. Then 10 more...\n\nOnly nitpick, on some levels you will get a new gimmick, like a wheel or a pogo.

In a way, it's almost like an infinite runner, since in many cases, the best way forward is to just press right and jump at appropriate times. The level-designing algorithm usually manages to create the levels so that the player's momentum is not lost. This plays a major part in making the levels more fun to play.\n\nI've been playing the beta version in the past year for about 7 hours altogether. Do not come here expecting a great story. Do not come here expecting a platformer whose levels will astound you with their creativity. Come here with the expectation of finding a game attempting to do something very different.\n\nOf all the game modes, I find the best ones to be those without additional tweaks to the player character skills, such as jetpack, double-jump, spaceship, pogos and so on. Of particular annoyance are are the game modes in which the skill changes between every level. With the bite-sized levels, usually lasting less than 15 seconds if you clear them as fast as possible without dying, the necessary context-switch becomes jarring.\n\nCloudberry Kingdom works best in small doses every now and then. You won't be playing it several hours in one go, but is that such a loss? A few gos trying to beat my previous score - and improve my position on the global highscore ranking - are my way of enjoying the game as well as I can.","July 26, 2013","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really enjoyed this game, however I've heard of others who believe the controls were not tight enough for them, but to me, the controls were perfectly fine, if maybe a little too floaty. Due to the nature of the level generation and different playstyles that are offered (such as double-jump, jet pack, big or tiny, etc.) you will never have the same level twice.","September 22, 2014","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
