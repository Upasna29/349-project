It has been years since I was this disappointed in a video game and/or felt this mislead by the title's description and the feedback on the Steam store page. I paid less than $2.00 USD for 'Montague's Mount,' and it took me less than 3 hours to defeat it. Honestly, I'm so shocked and appaulled by this game that I want to ban myself from ever pursuing ANY additional PolyPusher Studios projects, and I am loathe to blacklist any developer.\n\nIf you want "puzzles" that are difficult only due to horrible frame rate issues and intentionally obtuse clue placement, and the added bonus of spending 50% or more of your time back-tracking at a slow pace, by all means purchase this title. I was initially impressed with the music and the stormy seascape atmosphere, but I need a little more than that from a video game to call it worthwhile. The plot was lackluster, and by the "climactic ending" I was totally disinterested; even the creepy kid failed to impress me after the first few encounters.\n\nI also question the term "psychological thriller," because this video game is barely suspenseful at best, and the completely predictable decline in the main character's mental process doesn't feel psychological, it just feels like lazy storytelling.\n\nWhen I made the decision to purchase this game, I ignored the awful 'Metascore' (per usual with Steam, especially with Indie games), and focused on the 100% positive reviews in the "Most Helpful" category. I cannot believe that not a single Negative review is visible on the store page, and that seems questionable in my book.","June 3, 2014","false","5.2"," 389 of 458 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","389","458","0","7"

Unfortunately, the execution is very lacking. By default the game is an ugly dark grainy mess, which can only be slightly improved by turning off the film grain.\nYour character walks so slowly it becomes an annoyance to walk around, even after you find a certain upgrade.\n\nThen there are the puzzles. The good thing is they all make sense within this world, there is no "get the hair from the cat to make a mustache" or other such nonsense... but the puzzles you do get require items that are hardly visible on the terrain. The island is littered with garbage, and there is no indication what is useful and can be picked up and what isn't, so you have to click on each item to see if the mouse cursor changes.\n\nI can only recommend this to people who are a huge fan of both Myst and Dear Esther, and who want the puzzles of the former in the latter game.","February 25, 2014","false","1.6"," 141 of 168 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","141","168","0","0"

The voice acting and music are also spot on. So is it all great?\n\nWell, no. It seems to be a game that's having a bit of trouble deciding what it should be. Is it a puzzle game? Is it a story game? Is it a walking around type affair? At times, I don't think it is really sure. What it is though is absolutely captivating. As the story comes out (told through snippets from a book that are left laying around) a picture is built up of a character that is trouble by many things.\n\nYes, the pacing is slow, the writing fairly 'over the top', but I think these are somewhat intentional. This is a game that demands the players commitment to read between the lines.

If there's anything to be taken away from this review, its that patience above all else, is the most important skill the player will have to possess.\n\nLike many others, I bought and played this game for two simple reasons: I absolutely enjoyed "Dear Esther", and I got given a 80% off coupon, making the game extremely cheap. To be honest, had it not been for the coupon magically landing in my steam account, I would not have heard of this game at all, which reflects rather poorly this game's advertising campaign.\n\nI find that many other reviewers have been quick to slate the game and brush it under the carpet as a failed project, but I can't shake the feeling that they have been overly harsh with their judgment: The game isn't as complete and polished as it ought to be, and to be honest, some of the points I will highlight later have proven to be extremely frustrating indeed, as they were deliberately implemented. However, you should find the patience to stick with it and try and scratch below the surface, you may find yourself to be pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe Story & Setting:\n\nThe story of Montague's Mount could be described as a melancholic journey where the player attempts to piece together the events that have transpired to himself, his family and the inhabitants of the small Irish community scattered across a small, wind and rain battered island in the Atlantic sea. The plot development closely follows the same mechanics of Dear Esther, by making the player interact with notes, objects and monologues from the main character.\n\nThe pacing of the narrative is quite regular at the start, but feels rather rushed by the end, which slightly derails the flow of the story. Unlike Dear Esther, not much information about the island and its inhabitants is provided to the player. The same can be said in regards to the causes of the events which have unfolded prior to the protagonist’s joinery, which was slightly disappointing. I travelled around this island and was constantly under the impression that something ancient and potentially malevolent transpired there in ancient time (many "sacred stone" and pillars can be seen dotted around the island) and maybe a diary entry or two about these, would provide extra depth into the setting of the story.\n\nThe translation of all objects in Gaelic is a very nice touch, and the small cultural references that can be found here and there add to the beautiful atmosphere to the game. Anyone which has lived extensively on the British Isles (particularly in small communities, highlands and moors) such as myself, will be quick to relate to how capricious the weather can get and this is very well depicted, as an unrelenting, atrocious weather system which constantly batters the island and the player. The music score is fantastic (a real credit to Andrea Baroni) and melds perfectly with the environment. The dreariness of the island and constant stress amplified by the incessant rain compounds a feeling of constant desperation. On the other hand, the extreme colour desaturation and "grainy" effect are overkill and more often than not, get in the way of gameplay (luckily, these can be easily disabled). The lighting and visuals are nowhere near as good as Dear Esther’s and many bugs and poor effects in regards to lighting and shadows become quickly apparent. These are also damaging to the player's immersion into the environment. I can only put this down to lack of experience in game design and I am sure it can be easily fixed. My only other complaint is that the story ends rather abruptly, leaving many questions unanswered. Ambiguous endings are acceptable; Dear Esther pulls it off extremely well, but here I felt like I was left hanging. Maybe they plan an expansion? It's unclear...\n\nFinally the horror aspect of the game could have easily been dropped. The atmosphere of the island gives enough of an impact without the "Ghost boy" moments, which I'm sorry to say, where rather appalling and failed completely to fit in to the environment.\n\nThe Gameplay:\n\nThe gameplay is divided into pacing around the island searching for clues, and puzzle solving activities. Pacing is very slow and the reasoning for this I assume, is that your character is injured/sick and can only hobble around (walking stick). This will most likely exasperate the impatient player, as walking around is pretty much all you do in this game, and I myself often grumbled at the idea of having to go backwards, because of the time and effort to get around... However, I can appreciate the reason why this has been put in place; it adds to the feeling of desperation and allowance for gentle pacing around the environment, giving you time (or possibly forcing you) to take in the sights and in this sense, I don't see it as an issue.\n\nThe puzzles add an extra dimension to the game which Dear Esther lacked, but they have been the source of major complaints in many of the reviews - Many citing their difficulty and lack of logic.\nI fully disagree, and it once again boils down to a question of patience. I didn't find these puzzles particularly challenging, if one takes the time to think about them. On several occasions I found myself stuck, not because of the puzzle's logic but because of poor level design an visuals (such as the semaphore diagram being impossible to decipher due to VERY poor lighting and resolution). This does kill the gameplay...\n\nThe Positives:\n\n- Great Atmosphere\n- More interactive than Dear Esther\n- Good Voice acting\n- Beautiful music\n- Constant sense of desperation\n\nThe Negatives:\n\n- The aparenaces of "Ghost Boy"\n- The MANY bugs (fell into the ocean at one point)\n- The abrupt ending\n- Lack of background information about the island\n- Poor visual effects: Lighting and desaturation\n\nSummary:\n\nFor the price I bought this game for, I feel it was definitely worth it. Anyone who enjoyed Dear Eshter will enjoy this, and the story will compel you to get to the end, despite the game's bugs and shortcomings. My recommendation is that developers should correct the bugs, increase the plot, improve upon the ending and sort out the visual.\n\nThen... This game will be a true masterpiece.\n","August 31, 2014","true","6.0"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/258950/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","In the past few years there have been more and more titles released that push the boundaries of what defines a game. Games like Dear Esther, Gone Home and Journey, to name but a few, rest on the edge of the traditional formats with their sparse gameplay elements and continue to divide gamers on their relevance within the medium. Whether or not the arguments these games incite will ever be resolved, Montague’s Mount is certainly another name to add to that list.The first of this two-part psychological horror exploration game begins on the beach of an unnamed Irish isle. You awake to stormy rains beating down from the midnight sky with no recollection of who or where you are.Through old photographs, mementoes and much darker clues, you begin to piece together parts of your identity and the nature of this forsaken place. The narrative is as sparse as the island you explore, but engaging enough to keep you hooked.One of the unique aspects that will immediately strike you is the bilingual presentation; every item you examine is named “as Gaelige” with an English translation underneath.This isn’t the only Irish influence in the game, either: Celtic cross headstones of the seemingly significant Loughlin family dot the game world, as do collectable St. Brigid’s crosses. The landscape of the island is a truly accurate representation of some of more rural areas of Ireland, particularly of places along the west coast, which is by no coincidence as it is these areas that are among the last bastions of the dwindling population of fluent Irish speakers. The other unique element is a theme of mental health, which actually fits quite well with the Irish setting. Mental health issues have long been the subject of heated debate in Ireland, with rural isolation being one of the main focal points.The setting is beautifully accentuated by the weather conditions. Storms come and go at random, bringing torrential rain that obscures your vision and seems to wash the colour right out of the already bleak environment. This adds a very palpable sense of desperation.The actual gameplay elements are minimal, with puzzles and a rudimentary inventory being your only source of direct interaction. Some of these are quite challenging, but thankfully very logical. Movement speed is uncomfortably slow, and though it is due to injury sustained during the implied shipwreck, it can be infuriating at times. The game demands a certain amount of backtracking and the snail’s pace at which you travel makes it border on unbearable.Montague’s Mount isn’t perfect. The amnesia trope is getting tired at this stage and it’s a short journey even if it is only the first part. It falls down is in some technical areas too. But these imperfections can be partially forgiven as this is an indie title developed by one man, and they don’t detract from the experience that has been created here. Unique and emotional in so many ways, while tackling issues rarely before seen in videogames, it can be safely said without any hyperbole that this is one of the most important artistic creations ever to come out of Ireland.","January 15, 2015","true","11.6"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","27","32","2","2"

Now, the game is a good concept, but there were so many problems with it i just couldnt wait to finish the game. I dont like to just stop playing something because of whatever is wrong with it, so i pushed through because i also wanted to know what the whole story was etc. and give it a chance.\n\nPros:\n*decent story\n*atmosphere was ok, it wasn't scary but i still didn't feel "safe"\n*nice art but hard to enjoy with a skitzo framerate\n\nCons:\n*gameplay was slow and laggy, choppy framerate. when i finished the game it seems to freeze at the main menu so it didnt register my progress or anything--had to restart my computer and try again, still freezed.\n*puzzles were extremely fustrating. i like a challenge but these were no fun whatsoever. However when i DID figure them out i felt like a freakin genius lol\n*with the bad framerate, the walking around, limping at the beginning was just as irritating. i tried fiddling with my settings but some of that didnt even work.\n*the music/sound affects were a bit annoying but no big deal. not as annoying as the lightning and rain\n*letters/notes whatever were oft times hard to read\n\nAll in all, my biggest dislike is the puzzles because most of the time i had no idea how to work them, it didn't even seem to register when i did use them but i got through the game nonetheless thanks to the option to turn 1 puzzle in particular off. Anyway, i got this game during the 75% off sale if i remember correctly, so for 2 bucks, i cant complain. though if i got it for the original price -,- yeeeeaaa i'd likely bust my computer with a hammer and cry for the waste of money. So i'm in between recommending and not doing so...give it a try if you'd like but there's no proper guides for this game, and it is very long and complicated if you dont know what to do.\n","June 9, 2014","false","30.9"," 40 of 55 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","40","55","0","0"

But I'm not going to do that for Montague's Mount, because I don't believe that there is a person who would be looking for anything that this game has to offer. I don't believe that there is a person who would enjoy waddling at a turtle's pace through a poorly designed island that might as well be in grayscale because the only colors you'll ever see for most of the game are "gray", "dark", and "darker" in the middle of the night in a storm solving puzzles that are only even remotely difficult because it's impossible to see anything between the darkness, the rain, and the film grain filter. I don't believe that there is a person who would look for a game that only manages to barely scrape 3 hours of play time because of how much time was spent waiting for painfully slow bridges and gates to open and how much time was spent with the game minimized making webms of the bridges and gates to show my friends how comically slow they were (no seriously, look - http://puu.sh/iHXzX/6b2c99289e.webm http://puu.sh/iHZVm/712ce69151.webm I don't know how long these links are going to work for, so if it's 2027 and you're reading this, just take my word for it), with the other 2 and a half hours mostly spent wandering in the darkness looking for a stray candle I might've missed because I need it for a puzzle even though there's a house with at least 10 candles just sitting around that can't be picked up. And I certainly don't believe that there is a person who, after putting up with all of the garbage found within this game, would feel like they got their money's worth when they see that the ending is just a borderline cliffhanger, and this game is only half of a story.

You are likely to figure out what's going on halfway through, but uncovering the manner in which those things occurred still manages to keep the final reveal from feeling anticlimactic.\n\nThe inclusion of puzzles obviously sets it apart from DE, and while some of them stumped me for a little while (the Compass Puzzle comes to mind), they didn't inspire an urge to rage quit. I have to admit, I was a little put off by how slow the character was, especially when certain puzzles required retracing my steps. Still, the game establishes the need for limited movement from the very beginning; as a storyteller myself, I do appreciate that foundation even if the gamer in me occasionally kept pressing left shift in hopes the narrator would move that walking stick just a little bit faster!\n\nBy far, the best part of this entire game is the voice acting. As an American, I'm in no position to comment on the quality of the accent, but he definitely managed to put genuine emotion where it was needed. I felt for him when he began to despair. I felt his frustrations with his marriage. The reading of the last letter also helped the ending from falling too flat. The music in this game was also very lovely and added to the mood of the game.\n\n(That said, I wasn't entirely keen on the occasional popping up of quotes, even if they were relevant to one of the game's main themes. It kind of interrupted the immersive atmosphere that otherwise existed.)\n\nSpeaking of the ending... I was expecting to continue on to the eponymous Mount after that last narration, only to wind up at the title screen! Right now it feels too open-ended. Part of me does think it fits, considering what we learn of the character over the course of the game. Since I've only just finished it, I think I need more time to really turn it over to definitely decide whether or not I liked the ending.\n\nOverall: It's worth playing through for the plot and voice acting. The music is appropriate and helps set the mood, the puzzles are an appropriate level of challenging, and if you liked Dear Esther--or just point-and-click adventures in general--you'll probably like this as well.","December 25, 2014","true","7.2"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Although there were some difficulities which I personally could only leave behind me by looking at one of the good guides which gives away hints rather than the direct solution and which to some extend gave me new motivation to get into the game.\nI did record all of my sessions as a Let's Play, so I wanted to finish this game anyways, otherwise I wouldn't have started it as a project.\nTo start with some pros, I liked the atmosphere in this game very much. The choice of sounds, music and voice actors was excellent considering this is some sort of Indie project.\nOn the negative side, the puzzles in the game were too difficult to grasp, too many times. The description wasn't always as clear as you might think. Even when considering this is still an exploration and adventure game, the puzzles could have been made better. One example might be the navigation puzzle at O'Sullivan's Bay.\n\nNonetheless, I do recommend this game to others, who like to explore a very dark, tragic and partially confusing story. It is very well written and does definitely fulfill it's point as a part of the game.\nSecond downside for me is the relatively bad performance and optimisation (probably only on lower-end). I understand, that a big part of the whole Island is being rendered at the same time but this game could have been made more frame friendly with comparable or better graphics in e.g. the Source Engine (see Dear Esther).\nIf you use an engine, know the details. Get the best out of it and don't just rely on the fact, that hardware is getting better everyday. But that is a debatable point.\n\nConclusively I want to state, that I really enjoyed playing Montague's Mount, especially in the tense moments leading to the end. Getting to know the story one bit at a time, finally completing in the tragic story it tells and getting to know the person and character you are playing.\nFeeling empathy, or disgust?

Don't be put off!\n\nReally liked this game-- solid effort from PolyPusher, IMO.  It looks like some of the criticism it got in some of the reviews was addressed by the patch.  I never played pre-patch, so I can't compare.  Overall I found the game enjoyable, introspective, psychological, and, well, fun.  Love the exploration element with just enough story (and an interesting one) to keep you going.  It's not a long game, but it's not ultra-short, either.  I think the duration is about right.  You might find a puzzle that annoys you for one reason or another, but overall the puzzles are good.  And don't be put off by the clutter of items in the opening area-- the whole game isn't like that.\n\nYou'll like the game if you like exploration, pretty 3D graphics, immersion, and no timed elements (technically the one mini-game is "timed" but if it really bothers you, you can disable it).  It's a pastoral, not an epic.  It rewards taking your time and enjoying the scenery.  Some will find that boring, others will find it just what they want to relax with over a few evenings.\n\nYou won't like the game if you want to be able to run fast from screen to screen, need action or cool cutscenes, bright colors, an amazing, gripping story, or super-easy or super-hard puzzles.\n\nFor achievement-hunters, if you pay attention at all, you should have no problem getting 19/20 achievements with a little patience.  The last one (finding the crosses) I only got 19/22 from normal gameplay and had to go back and hunt for the other three, including consulting a guide.

I enjoy this journey even if its a bit short and sometimes frustation that the game gives nearly no tips only what are on letters written or codes you need to find but thats fine if you stuck you get one of many guides for help or walktroughs. Sometimes its hard because you think you have something but you dont get with it to next checkpoint and must repick it because game saves only on this few checkpoints, a weakpoint but only a little one, the spead of this man is not so fast, but at the end you know why he dont run. Only the game length could be better but 2-4 hours of entertainment are good, if you hunt the achievements like the 22 crux, find all 5 graves or 5 postcards are nice little gimmicks/ extras.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/258950/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","590 products in account","I think that how you feel about this game will largely depend upon what you expect or want from it before going in. The tags on the store page say "Adventure" and "Horror" and "Walking Simulator", but to be honest I really think you should downplay the adventure and horror aspects and temper your expectations instead towards the walking part... and add "Exploration" and "Puzzle" into the mix while you're at it. That's what you'll be doing for the two or three hours it'll take to finish this, slowly walking around a small island, searching for items and using them to complete puzzles whilst also trying to solve the mystery of who you are after a storm has washed you up on a beach and robbed you of your memory.\n\nI can't say I actually cared about the protagonist's story all that much as starting off a game by waking up some place with amnesia has been done so many times it's lost its intrigue and impact. And at this point, instead of proving vital to a unique story, it feels more like a device to drip feed the player the details of the past while still keeping them in the present, as well as not have the character know something that the player who's controlling him doesn't. It's probably something of a Catch 22 situation as it's difficult as a storyteller to walk that line of having the player be someone else whilst also not really knowing who they actually are and finding a way to convey that information. But either way, it just didn't grab me.\n\nWhat I found far more interesting, though, was the story of the island itself and how a fatal infection that spread across it affected the now dead people and drove them ever more to desperate measures. And, sure, while your own character is a part of that story, it didn't feel as interesting as the bigger picture. By the end it appears as though the personal story has mostly been answered, so if the intended second/final part of this game ever sees the light of day I really hope it focuses on that and wrapping up your character's story is much more secondary.\n\nGameplay itself is more about having a keen eye and a sharp mind as you track down items and follow clues to figure out how to complete puzzles. But this is another kind of Catch 22 situation as the atmosphere and presentation of the game clashes with actually operating within the world. So much effort is spent on creating the perfect tone that it makes finding objects and clues awkward at times. The entire game takes place at night and many areas are cast in shadow, add to that a film grain effect and the fluctuating colour that regularly drains to make the world completely grey and sometimes figuring out what you're missing really can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack. But while some of these effects are optional, as much as you're making it harder on yourself to leave them on, without them I think it takes away from the greatest aspect of the game, its atmosphere.\n\nMoody really doesn't begin to describe it. Throw in some more words like "brooding" and "desolate" and "isolated" and you're getting closer. When I started playing this I decided to do it in the wee small hours of the morning, with no lights on and the windows open to let in the cold air and rustling wind. It genuinely helped immerse me in the world even more, but this only built on what was already perfectly crafted to begin with. As I progressed through the game I began mentally drowning out the presentation as I focused on some of the more irritating puzzle features, but just before I finished it I started backtracking across the island for the sake of an achievement to walk ten kilometres (yes, I'm one of those people. Sometimes I hate myself, too), and that's when it really struck me just how much care and attention went into building a truly incredible atmosphere.\n\nWithout any objectives to distract me I was able to better notice the details, like the waves lapping at the shore, insects chirpings and lights buzzing, the random coughs of your weather-beaten character, the fact that the greying of the game seems to coincide with the periodic rainfall and accompanying thunderclaps (the intensity of the grey being proportional to how heavy the rain is), or noticing eerie noises seeming to come from different points all around me. Is it an owl hooting somewhere, or my ears playing tricks on me to make it sound like distant children playing among the death and decay of the island, or possibly hidden somewhere crying? It really brought to life a rare feeling for me in a game where I really was immersed completely in my surroundings and overcome with a genuine sense of almost alien solitude and curious wonder, intrigue to explore but apprehension of the unknown. This really is as fine an example as you're going to see of how to craft an environment to evoke real feelings in a player.\n\nThe game did take a bit of a bashing upon initial release, but it seems to have gotten better with additional updates and tweaks based on user feedback. I really do hope the negativity won't discourage the developer from carrying on with the conclusion, and if anything will use it as constructive criticism to further improve upon what he's already made. And if we're really, lucky Derek Riddell will also return to lend his excellent voice-over talents once more. As flawed as it may be, I really do think this deserves to be experienced by every fan of the genre. Look up a guide if you have to, mess with some settings if need be, but give it a chance and I think you'll be glad you did.","October 19, 2015","true","7.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

We managed to find a walking stick, pick up a few little red glowy wooden tube things, open a gate (in a world record time of: several minutes!), get confused - not creeped out - by a boy sat on a tree stump, because it looked like my computer was struggling so hard to deal with his motion that we only saw him move towards us in three key frames. Maybe this is because this game has Oculus Rift support, so the devs thought you'd blink at the correct moment, to give a creative Dr. Who vibe to the game. We quickly swooped up a gold medal in the world championships for this game by placing a protractor on a sun dial, then quit before we went mad - to play Shovel Knight.\n\nI returned to this game weeks later, and despite having full keyboard control, I cannot for the life of me find out which key I have to press to put that protractor back on that sundial. I think I need to put a valve wheel on something, but I can't figure that out either. Even the controls in the main menu don't give me the glimmer of enlightenment that I so longingly wish for, pray for.\n\nDon't let my play time fool you, I went AFK whilst watching Game of Thrones to get at least some achievements in this game. I initially laughed when I saw an achievement for walking - just walking - but given the unchangable, excrutiatingly slow pace the protaginist has, I can say that walking a few kilometres in this game truly is an achievement.\n\nPerhaps an interesting game to spend a pound on to see what not to do when trying to create an immersive game, but on the whole I strongly suggest you keep that pound, add it to the jar then pick up a game you actually want later on. You probably have enough games to keep you occupied anyway. I know you do. Don't look down in shame, look back at this review. There's a quip or two coming.\n\nDue to the Oculus Rift support, and door lintels being at eye-height, I dub this game "Headbang simulator 2014".\n\nIf you already bought this game, give it a go - and if you don't like it, go afk, get those silly achievements and thankfully, some steam trading cards - perhaps someone's way of saying "I'm...

Yes, yes it does.  This implementation of that idea, however, is... not so great.\n\nDevs will often start their games with something impressive or exciting, which is an effective strategy, because it hooks players in quickly and provides something to show off in demos and trailers.  PolyPusher opted for the alternate, questionable strategy of making the first few minutes of Montague's Mount so unbearably awful that the rest of the game seems excellent by comparison.  You begin the game walking very slowly around a rainy beach, and as you walk, the camera rocks wildly.  Even while standing still, the camera remains unsteady.  The graphics are not too bad for an indie game, but dark and heavily desaturated, and there's a film grain effect enabled by default.  Both of those effects individually make sense to set the mood, but the combined effect is over-the-top and very hard on the eyes.  But wait, it gets worse: under these conditions, you are given a tutorial and your first objective, in the form of a couple pinned notes.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=380963097\nYou can't inspect these notes or pick them up to get a clearer view; you have to get as close as you can to them, and then read them - despite the mediocre graphics with heavy desaturation, and the film grain, and the rain, and the rocking camera.  Within a few minutes, I had decided that if the point of this game was to make me feel queasy and illiterate, well, mission bloody accomplished.  A better plan would be to say "screw that" and look up a guide.  You'll probably do that more than once if you play this game.\n\nIf you have the stomach to continue in the face of such adversity, once you disable the film grain and find a walking stick to steady the camera, you'll find that the rest of the game is playable at the very least.  The desaturated graphics with poor lighting remain a little hard on the eyes, but tolerable.  The walking speed isn't as excruciatingly slow as other reviewers make it out to be (but you'll find yourself wishing you could run occasionally).\n\nFor the most part, the puzzles make sense, but one was fiddly and had a solution that was the opposite of what I thought it would be, and another would have you walking a fairly long distance back and forth between a Morse code message and the barely legible key for deciphering it (again, say "screw that" and look up a guide).  Video game logic and contrived puzzles are pervasive here, which works for some games, but in this one, the knowledge that it's based on a true story and should be realistic creates dissonance.  (Seriously, who builds crazy locking mechanisms like these in real life?  Why do I have to get a specific candle when it's clear that any candle will do and there are a dozen strewn about?  Why would someone write a note that says "I should have written the code here" and not write the code?  Who carefully arranged all these journal pages for me to find, and why?)  The inventory system adds another annoyance: you can only carry five items at a time.  Sure, if we're going for realism, a person can only carry so much, but a limit of five items, regardless of size and weight is just arbitrary, not realistic.  And from a gampelay perspective, limited capacity makes sense in RPG's and such, but not in adventure games like this, where you need to pick up everything you can in order to progress.  Worse, once you pick an item up, you're stuck with it until you can use it - there's no way to set something down.  If you're stuck and find a sixth item you know what to do with, too bad, you'll have to make some progress and then backtrack later.  Devs, please don't do this; there's no excuse for it.  Either let me manage my inventory or just don't limit what I can carry.\n\nThe story is... well, it's not bad, and I like the idea of basing a game on a true story, but it's simplistic, and definitely not the psychological thriller it's described as being.  There's nothing thrilling about it; it's more accurately described as creating an atmosphere of despair.  I can sum it up in one short sentence: there was a plague, and a lot of people died.  I'm not even spoiling anything by saying that - it's clear from the first journal page you find, right after starting the game.  Also, your progress is occasionally interrupted by a quote about mental illness, or the appearance of a ghost boy, accompanied by motion blur and a racing heartbeat.  These are eventually sort of explained in the one real development the plot gets, but it's not especially satisfying, and I agree with certain other reviewers that the ghost was unnecessary.\n\nI appreciate what Montague's Mount was trying to be, but it didn't succeed, and given the poor artistic choices, gameplay annoyances, and shallow plot, I can't recommend it.","January 25, 2015","false","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So after playing the game for awhile, I changed my review to 'Recommend". It was my sort of game. I tend to gravitate toward these type of creepy walking simulator games and sometimes they end up being disappointing or utter trash (like "All Is Dust"). Well, this game was drawing me in, but now that I have finished it, I have to say that the ending was disappointing. I am sick of all these games these days with ambiguous endings.\n\nHere's what I liked about the game:\n\nThe atmosphere and the setup and the voice acting, music, and sound effects do a good job of setting the tone.\n\nHere's what I didn't like. The puzzles were either spelled out for you, or so incredibly obtuse. Sometimes the game would give you a big clue for the puzzle, but then when you try to do that, it's not what is necessary to solve the puzzle; the solution is much easier than what the clue tells you. ( I am thinking about the plinith puzzle).\n\nThe save system is annoying with checkpoints that don't always remember what things you partially accomplished. Sometimes the items you need are in really dark areas amidst lots of debris and trash (Yes, I did turn on the option to make those items glow red when you mouse over them).\n\nThe ending wasn't worth it to me all of the slow-walking around I did with the backtracking and the weird puzzles and odd "rules" like I can only carry 5 items at a time. Even when I got the game to run with my video cards, I still had technical problems that made playing annoying. My mouse cursor kept "going out of the game" to my Windows desktop on my other monitor and that was constantly breaking immersion.\n\nWhen I had switched my review from "Not Recommend" to "Recommend" I said I was gald that I gave the game a second chance and that I hoped the story's ending wouldn't disappoint. Well, it did disappoint, so here I am back at "Not Recommend". I really wanted to like this game a lot more, but it was a grind to get through it, even though it's such a relatively short game.

I wasn't a fan of Dear Esther. I did, however, like Gone Home, so I'm going to assume I'm not just biased and go from there.\nMM is a short horror/exploration game that follows a familiar trope. Your character has amnesia (why? Who knows.) and you must travel the island finding hints and clues about what happened there in hopes of finding out your own identity.\nIt plays relatively well. I've seen a lot of people complain about the walking speed, but I didn't think it was too savagely slow, although the many, many to-ing and fro-ings required to solve some puzzles do make it frustrating. If memory serves, though, Esther and other games like it have been slower in the travelling.\nI can't say much about the graphics. I turned off the grainy quality because it made it impossible to read signs, and so I didn't see what the creator intended. But I found myself frequently wanting to turn the lighting up, and I missed a few puzzle pieces for a LONG time because they vanished in shadows.\nHonestly, the only thing that kept me going was the idea that this was based on a true story; I wanted to know what the disease was, if that was the true part, or if it was the man's family life and his apparent struggle with mental illness and all the things we find out happened with his life on the island. If that's the reason you want to play, I'm gonna say it right now - don't. You'll feel jipped when you find out that the 'based on a true story' really means that the creator moved to Ireland with his wife and had some cultural and language barriers to overcome. That's the parallel to the game. So if you're in this for the story, hoping it'll have more true-to-life and less hackneyed-cliche elements than others, then don't waste your time.\nThe story is ... okay. You, obviously, don't get to know EVERYTHING, because they saved some for a sequel, but it's interesting enough that I kept going. If you've played more than one similar game, however, you'll have guessed the entire plot when you get ten minutes in. It doesn't overcome the difficulties in gameplaya nd visuals that make this game a slog to get through. (Maybe that's something we should guess from the fact that there's an achievement for playing it for three whole hours?)\nBasically, if you're mad into the genre and actually enjoy the plot elements and gameplay, and want some SERIOUSLY over-wrought puzzles, then you might just enjoy this. If you need a little more than that, then this is probably just going to disappoint.","February 4, 2015","false","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblemparade/recommended/258950/","emblemparade","Emblem Parade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblemparade/","3117 products in account","I'm annoyed by the negative reviews for this game. Very annoyed, because I fear they will keep this excellent game from getting the sequel it deserves. :(\n\nBut first, let's start with my review, which is very positive.\n\nThis game is primarily about atmospheric immersion, fostered by excellent graphics, sound, color, and lighting design, especially for weather. The rain beats on you throughout almost the entire game, the world is gray, and you can almost feel the sting of the wind shaking the bushes and trees and ocean. Those precious few moments where there is a break in the clouds and some color fills the world seem especially precious. (A great time to hunt for hidden objects, too!) The world (an island) is thoughtfully designed, and it's quite neat to see all the pieces come together as you explore it. The Irish pride is very apparent, with all names translated from Gaelic, and a few flags to remind you, in case you forgot.\n\nAnd there is a story, a very clear one, with a clear ending in which some of the core questions are resolved, and yet there are still unanswered issues demanding a sequel.\n\nAnd this is no "walking sim": it's a real game with real puzzles, some of them quite challenging indeed. It's not as hard as Myst/Riven for sure, but a few puzzles don't give much indication if you're on the right path. They're not the best puzzles I've seen in adventure games, but are far from the worst, and there is quite some satisfaction in completing them on your own. There are also achievements, which involve finding some hidden items, many of them very difficult to find. I would have been quite lost without a guide! Note that you can finish the game and then easily go back to various checkpoints to find the hidden objects you missed, so there's no need to get anxious about achievements during your first run.\n\nSo, what's with all the negative reviews?\n\nSome of them are from people who just have no interest in atmospheric games: because you can't run here and are forced to move quite slowly, they dismiss it as a "walking sim." Honestly, you don't walk that slowly in Montague's Mount, the island is rather small, and all in all you are rewarded with the gorgeous environment for those few times you do need some patience. I didn't feel like this part of the game was tedious at all. Hell, you need much more patience to get around in Skyrim!\n\nOn the other hand, there are those people who compare Montague's Mount negatively to Dear Esther. There are embarrassingly obvious similarities that do beg a comparison: both games take place on barren, gray, northern islands, and involve uncovering a dead past. But, whereas people complained that Dear Esther didn't have any real "game" to it now they are complaining that Montague's Mount's puzzles are too nonsensical! There's just no pleasing some people.\n\nDear Esther's textures and lights are better designed, but Montague's Mount still has a lot going for it visually, and though it looks less gorgeous and lush, it's still quite beautiful and immersive.\n\nMy only real complaint is that the physics are a bit buggy. In a few cases I was sure I clicked something, only to return later to find that I didn't. Super big hint: make sure to check all the drawers!\n\nIf anything I wrote here appealed to you, please play the game and leave an honest, hopefully positive review. I would really like to see a part 2 in the future!\n\nFinally: I'd like to thank the developer for supporting Linux so well.","February 13, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The tags and description is pretty misleading. I saw "psychological thriller" with the "horror" tag and was expecting some creepy stuff. [spolier]The only creepy thing about this game was that damn little kid that just appears. And really its not even that creepy.[/spoiler]\n\nIn all though, the mild story is pretty interesting. Keeping in mind throught the game that someone went through a similar psychological experience. (I'm still searching for the original story that the game was based on.) Most of the puzzles are easy enough and they're a bit fun to figure out. One or 2 are far more annoying than they should be...you'll know 'em when you see 'em. Though the grey bleakness gives it a good touch, it could be improved upon to be less annoying. The most annoying thing about the game is how slow you walk.

It is possible the game got better as it progressed, but I can only rewiew the first hour or so of gameplay as I quit after this point.\n\nGoing into Montague's Mount, I really, really, desperately wanted to like it. An Indie Horror Adventure game akin to walking simulators such as Dear Esther, this game had every reason for me to like it from the word "go". As I quickly discovered in the first few minutes of gameplay, however, the game became much less enjoyable upon being played. The walking controls were clunky and non-fluid (as if you were walking through a vat of pancake batter with one leg completely shattered), the graphics were nothing to write home about (even on maximum settings), the voice acting was quiet and non-impressive, and ultimately the game was far too repetitive to hold my interest. The game eased into a pattern of simply running back and forth from location to location collecting items to solve further puzzles with no real merit or value behind any of it.

Many of the "puzzles" that do exist are provided with flat out instructions that say "you need to find these things and then do this in order to progress".  There really isn't a whole lot of thought required to complete the game...just a little patience in trying to find the required objects in most cases.  While I have to admit that there were one or two times when I had trouble finding the next piece of the puzzle, most of the time I stumbled across what I needed before I even knew I needed it.  I somehow managed to find every last one of the hidden/secret areas without even trying, while simply exploring the island in a logical manner.\n\nOverall, the game wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great either.  If I had to pay full price, I probably would have been dissapointed in the purchase.  I purchased this game via a discount coupon and would have to say it was worth the couple of dollars I spent.  If you get a chance to get this game at a deeply discounted price, then by all means, go for it.

It is possible the game got better as it progressed, but I can only rewiew the first hour or so of gameplay as I quit after this point.\n\nGoing into Montague's Mount, I really, really, desperately wanted to like it. An Indie Horror Adventure game akin to walking simulators such as Dear Esther, this game had every reason for me to like it from the word "go". As I quickly discovered in the first few minutes of gameplay, however, the game became much less enjoyable upon being played. The walking controls were clunky and non-fluid (as if you were walking through a vat of pancake batter with one leg completely shattered), the graphics were nothing to write home about (even on maximum settings), the voice acting was quiet and non-impressive, and ultimately the game was far too repetitive to hold my interest. The game eased into a pattern of simply running back and forth from location to location collecting items to solve further puzzles with no real merit or value behind any of it. Even the puzzles themselves were often incoherent; not really connected in any particular way and often quite difficult to solve.

I can't recommend buying this game at full price but if you see it on sale pick it up.\n\nThis game has some really well composed environments and the engine has some very nice shading options, but the model and texture artists seem to have been modelling for a bygone era. There is a lot of low detail models and textures that could be so much more detailed. The environments are really well composed. A lot of places look very pretty and screenshottable except for the noticeably low resolution textures andrepetetive models. Maybe you guys only had one artist and he was under the pump the entire time? Usually low detail wouldn't bother me but for a game that so heavily advertises its art, and has a setting for 'superb' on graphics, I was expecting something more... impressive. Considering the game was released in 2013, I saw no baked normal maps and the normal maps I did see were obviously generated in photoshop from images. The environment composition was great but the models and textures themselves left me feeling unfulfilled and alienated.\n\nAs for the timing of the release, I'm sure you guys have had some pressure from comparison to Dear Esther. And I gotta say, you invited it. Guess which game I am summarizing: A quiet, piano fuelled romp along a deserted island with some old pom narrating about a sickness that cleaned the island out. Gameplay focus on exploration in pretty, gritty environment. Some scaryish bits. After playing both I'll attest they are quite different, but those who liked one would like the other. Maybe you could have delayed the release for a little while, focussed on some of the problems and then released to an audience with not such a fresh memory of your direct competition? More time to bake those normal maps too.\n\nThe gameplay itself showed some bad design decisions. For instance, the massive camera shake at the start. I think I played this how it was supposed to be played - late at night, lights off, headphones in - and I think you guys were trying to force the player to feel like a concussion victim. I know I did and I don't usually have motion issues. When I did finally get the walking stick it was a bit too much of a relief. Also the first part with the kid laughing was badly executed. I didn't know if I was still in a cutscene or not because the screen still letterboxes until the player moves. The laughing track was repeated and not creepy and there was no creepy leadup to that scene so it felt really out of place.\n\nWhat this game does show though, is the capability of a team to band together and get some ♥♥♥♥ done. The game seems programmatically sound and, even though there are some bugs and strange occasions, it all works well enough. If this was the entire work of two or three people then I applaud your efforts for getting this thing out the door and shipped on steam. You can only go up from here. If this was a big team then I'm not very impressed with the net product. I'm going to recommend this game though because I like seeing small game studios like you guys get publicity and go on to greater things. Fills me with hope.

Many sites mock/belittle the atmosphere, the voice acting, the puzzles, and just plainly the game itself. In all honesty, it is a bit much for such a short game and like myself would wait untill it goes on sale.\nThe game itself is short, linear and the music is limited yet pleasing to the ears. The scenery/atmosphere is a bit dark and add film grain to the visuals which can be removed in the options. I like this as it is the dead of night on a moonless island and I feel the film grains adds a re-telling or recollection of a tragic past through the eyes of someone alive, desceased, maybe somewhere in between...\nThe puzzles I think are the main downfall. They are easy despite being odd, convoluted, and elaborate considering the storyline and the current situation. Though, some puzzles fit in nicely but all are blended in to that one really has to look carefully, and I do admit it is kind of hard given the dark scenery and film grain (*film grain can be removed in options). But really, it's you're looking for something in real life it doesn't magically give off an glowing aura or flash for you to say "Here I am!." (*...Although it would be great....*) but the game does highlight SOME things for you.\n\n\nAll-in-All, the game was a good lilttle experience and educational as well for those interested in Gaelic and want a game that takes you somewhere else.\n\n\nNOTE: This is my opinions and thoughts of the game and not an overall view if the game for general audience.

There were parts in the flavor text that sent a chill down my spine, and the overall story is superb.\n\nTechnical issues:\n\n[EDIT: I'm told the devs released a patch which updated the Unity3D, fixing the mouse issue among other things, but I haven't verified this.] Linux support is very buggy. It gets one simple thing wrong that hurts the game tremendously: It doesn't grab the mouse. This causes the mouselook controls to be awful, "catching" 10 pixels every 100 pixels, and then only sometimes. It's hard to explain. Next to impossible to turn while moving forward.\n\nGame design issues:\n\nThe graphics could have been improved. It's a cheap trick to put a simple film grain over everything to cover up a lack of graphical design. It also made it too hard to see anything. This is especially annoying when looking for brown crosses in a black-and-gray environment in the pouring rain. I mean seriously.\n\nSometimes the puzzle mechanisms weren't apparent.

If so, Montague's Mount is right for you.\n\nYou start the game hobbling on a beach and lo and behold, you don't remember a thing. There's things strewn about and everything is derelicte, your first task is finding a stick to use as a crutch which will thankfully stop you from limping and move at a nice walking pace. You'll find a couple notes in the beginning of the game about how to do things and interact with everything, which is really nice, but for the most part you're kind of on your own. That's pretty par for the course for these games and it's better that way, though I did find myself checking a Steam guide every now and then when I got stuck.\n\nOverall the game is fun, if you like these slow and atmospheric titles, but the game does have a couple issues. First, you're slow, now you're not terribly slow but the way the game works is that you open up more and more of the island in a somewhat linear fashion so if you're a ways into the game and want to go all the way back to check? Enjoy walking all of the way back at the not-so-brisk pace you're stuck at. Secondly, I know the game is supposed to be dreary but it's a bit excessive. The island is in perpetual overcast and every 5 or 10 minutes a storm will kick in causing high winds and rain. Trees and foliage look good as they blow around along with their shadows that mimic their movement, but when the rain starts nearly all of the color in game turns to a cold grey, almost black and white. It gets a little bit harder to see things, but the game hardly has much color in it in the first place and losing that when it rains doesn't make it too visually enjoyable. Not a deal breaker, but just strange design choice.\n\n","August 21, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For the visual junkies, the graphics are rather lovely, but I had to turn it way down in order to run the game without serious lag...so I couldn't enjoy that aspect. (The raindrop effects were really beautiful, though, and the mood of the plotline is set perfectly within the color palette this game offers). Finally, the voice acting was actually VERY well done, it was a nice break from the bleakness of the landscape.\n\nFavorite parts of the game:\n-Color palette/mood\n-Voice acting\n-Rain effects\n-Easy achievements\n\nLeast favorite parts of the game:\n-Lags unless low quality\n-Constant crackling due to "film grain effect" (?) that won't turn off even if I uncheck the film grain option\n-You don't know if you get an achievement or not until you exit the game completely\n-The ending wasn't too unexpected and was a bit anticlimactic\n\nI came into this expecting this game to be relatively short and quick mystery game, which it was. Therefore, I can't say I was unsatisfied. This is a good deal (if you have a coupon) because the achievements are easy to complete and it also comes with trading cards. I wouldn't buy it at full price, however. Overall I'd give it a 3/5 stars.","September 21, 2014","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

What could have been a gripping, atmospheric, puzzle game instead felt tedious and frustrating.  The player is asked to suffer through invisble walls, obscure puzzles that aren't logically consistent and to have control taken away from them as a character repeatedly, whilst still believing in the world and being emerged and engaged.  It doesn't work.  We are asked to care about a family we have never met.  We are asked to believe in a badly animated child, with real life photos within the game drawing attention to the imperfections.  Above all this, the ending (I assume it was the ending - I didn't bother sitting through the montage of scenes of the island with heavy-handed sad piano music in the background to find out if there was any more) is disappointing and confusing.

And yet, once I had adjusted the settings and got through the Prologue, the game was strangley compelling and playable. Sometimes I think it took itself too seriously--I didn't absoluetely NEED those long shots on Peter's photo--but I wanted to find out what happened to all the villagers, beat all that Irish puzzle ingenuity, and stick around for all those Irish words. I also appreciated the representation for disabled people and older protagonists. It wasn't particularily scary, more of a "the horror!

It's a visually beautiful game that's for sure, the atmosphere is great and the dark tones and ambient music add a lot to it. The game has such a promising setting full of intrigue and mystery, but be aware that the game has a rather snail’s pace of movement and progression. The puzzles are ok, but become somehow repetitive after a while, you basically go from one section of the island to another, collect fuel for power generators, turn it on, solve easy puzzle, proceed to another section and repeat whole thing all over.\n\nMontague's Mount is a decent indie title created by one person, to which a lot of credit is to be given, but it is difficult to find this title trully memorable.

Being unable to find them he staggers around looking for the friendly neighborhood ghost child to request his help since he can only see things in grainy technicolor, not unlike if one took an old Merry Melodies cartoon and ran the disk over with a magnet several times.  Anyway, the protagonist, whom we shall call Sir George Blandington's horrible vision makes it incredibly difficult to read the tutorials.  Once you manage to do that, then you are forced to find objects to solve puzzles.  The problem with this is that Sir George is unable to see anything that he is not standing on top of.  The puzzles in this game are not hard, but rather tedious, as in one which requires a frame rate to solve - something this game lacks.  In short, unless you too, are very drunk, and are at the point where this is the least bad decision you can make after prank calling the NSA and telling them you are a terrorist, then by all means play it.  Otherwise, stick to something safe and entertaining, like emptying the Pacific Ocean with a sieve.","August 18, 2014","false","0.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Indeed, many describe it as plain boring. Now, I'm not saying they're wrong, but I feel many missed the point of this game hugely.\n\nBefore I go onto why I adored this game, I'll address the flaws.\n\n1: Yes, it's way too dark and finding things is a nightmare among those incredibly shadowy graphics. There is also a real lack of structure in the way the various objects are scattered around. Sometimes they're in a logical place, others it's just pot luck if you find them.\n\n2: Yes, it's slow. CoD this is not. The lack of any run feature is annoying, but given how the game starts out it becomes clear WHY you can't run.\n\n3: Yes, the slow pace can get a little boring, with the wandering back and forth to do this and that forcing you into long slow journeys.\n\n4: And yes, some of the puzzles are absolutely dreadful. The spinners puzzle was quite simply too much for a video game, requiring the gamer to understand morse code. It's something you don't need when you want to just play a game.\n\n5: And also the saves were a little glitchy. Sometimes a checkpoint would actually erase a previous section you'd just done, meaning you had bits of your pick ups but not all.\n\nHowever, the flaws are compeltely outweighed by the strengths, or maybe it's my kind of game. And here's why.\n\nMontague's Mount is intense. It is easily the most intense game I've ever played, and draws heavily on psychologically disturbing themes to make its mark. For me they work brilliantly - the island is MEANT to be drab and depressing as we are dealing here with some incredibly heavy themes. They get deeper and more powerful the further the game goes, and as far as video games go in general, there are such emotional and psychological barriers this game goes past that other games simply haven't gone near.\n\nThe plot is also as well-crafted as it can be without spoon-feeding you all the answers. This is a story designed to make you think, to make you put pieces of a fragmented world together - to decide for yourself the greater meaning of it. The game gives you the tools to make you arrive at your own conclusions without those plot devices feeling half-baked.\n\nI admit some of the mechanics of the gameplay were messy, but the game wasn't about them. The puzzles and methods were just a way of putting together a story, and I admit also that they didn't blend as seamlessly with the story as they could have. Indeed, in many ways the game could have done better without the puzzle element as it doesn't seem to match the greater story overall.\n\nBut if you can live with that, and want a dark, intense, psychological thriller with emotionally powerful overtones and disturbing themes, this is unique and hard-hitting.\n\nI can understand why many would hate this, but I felt totally engaged by it throughout and would recommend it on the terms I have done. If you want quality puzzles and amazing graphics, Portal 2 is your man. But if you want plot which cerebrally engages you, this is a fine way to spend your time.\n\nThe current sale also helps hugely.","August 8, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

That is for certain. In truth, it reminded me of Dear Esther more than anything. Its atmosphere was good but that was about it. Like Dear Esther, it felt more like a “here take a walk around our pretty island” than a decent game.\n\nMy thoughts on the story are as follows:\n\nIt claims to be a psychological thriller, but I was never on edge at any point during the game. And the “scary” parts were not at all. The story in general didn’t really lead me down a path to the ending’s conclusion. At no point did I think this man was completely nuts. Only two notes really pointed towards this fact and not much else. I guess what I’m trying to say is that this character’s “decline” was not explored very well or given enough time for it to sink in. We as the player didn’t really have the time or information to start making theories of our own as to what happened on the island and to the protagonist or what he had done. And on top of this, there was an illness on the island, so what? It didn’t seem to play into the story at all, other than making the protagonist the only one on the island. The story is left open ended and felt incomplete to me, especially since there was little build up for the conclusion.\n\nIn all truthfulness I found the game to be rather boring on the story side of things.\n\nMy thoughts on the technical side are as follows:\nAfter reading some of the other reviews, I noticed that several players had issues with frame rate. I’m pleased to say I had no issues at all, but I’ve got a good amount of RAM and a very good and up to date graphics card meant for gaming and working with 3D software.\n\nI found some of the subtle emersion qualities of this game quite fun, like rain splatters on your screen. However, the game was overall very gray and lacking in color which, while lending itself to the isolated atmosphere, made it difficult to see in darker parts of the game like the inside of sheds and buildings. I didn’t turn my gamma up to help this but I figure that would be the solution.\n\nThe puzzles I found to be very easy for the most part, although I did get stuck on a couple, but that was because I didn’t find a clue or the puzzle was not explained very well. Other than that they were all pretty logical, which is an accomplishment in this genre since a lot of similar games lean on taxing and nonsensical puzzles to pad out the amount of time spent playing the game.\n\nThere are a few complaints I would like to point out about some of the menus, cut scenes and puzzles. The cut scenes would often linger too long on pictures, or a new area. I actually found myself looking away from the computer while waiting on these scenes to end. I think I actually got onto YouTube on my laptop for a couple minutes while waiting during one. While these scenes may have seemed emotional to the developer, the player only needed to see the images for 30 seconds or less to get the point.\n\nAlso, during the compass puzzle, the dial turning animation took FOREVER. I was once again checking my watch while waiting on these dials to turn. A faster animation would be much appreciated. This goes for the checkpoint menu as well. When I loaded up the game after I had put it down for a day, I found myself scrolling, and scrolling and scrolling to get to my last checkpoint (which was the 9th one) and the animation for this also took FOREVER. Speeding up the scrolling here would have been very helpful. Speeding up a lot of the game in general would have been a large improvement. Doing so would not have taken away from the atmosphere. It would have made for a more pleasurable experience.\n\nIn the end, I wouldn’t recommend this game to a casual game player, but if you are a hard core point and click, puzzle game player I wouldn’t tell you to not give it a shot. Especially if you got it for $2.00 like I did.\n","September 3, 2014","false","4.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I don't understand why it's so poorly reviewed. It offers some pretty decent puzzles, well constructed scenes and environments, good soundtrack and an overall rewarding experience. You should be warned, though, that this isn't a traditional first person game. It's not a shooter, it's not a AAA adventure, action packed game. This should be played as almost an interactive movie that prompts you to solve challenging puzzles to progress through the story.\n\nAbout the story, even though there's a substantial amount of written material that somehow explains a bit what is happening, in my opinion the plot itself is just accessory to the real experience offered by Montague's Mount: the constant feeling of isolation and desperation while you search for answers about who and where you are.

I struggled to play the short time I did, a dark grey world with muted colors, puzzles that don't make a lot of sense, and a main character that walks incredibly slow. I'll admit I was kind of intrigued to find out how everyone on the island(?) had died. But had to turn this off before I died of boredom. This had a bit of potential, but by the time the painful cliche of echoes of childrens laughter that turns out to be ghosts(?) hallucinations(?), I had to tap out.  Whatever. There's a ton of games out there that do what this game was trying to do a whole lot better.","January 21, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't understand why it's so poorly reviewed. It offers some pretty decent puzzles, well constructed scenes and environments, good soundtrack and an overall rewarding experience. You should be warned, though, that this isn't a traditional first person game. It's not a shooter, it's not a AAA adventure, action packed game. This should be played as almost an interactive movie that prompts you to solve challenging puzzles to progress through the story.\n\nAbout the story, even though there's a substantial amount of written material that somehow explains a bit what is happening, in my opinion the plot itself is just accessory to the real experience offered by Montague's Mount: the constant feeling of isolation and desperation while you search for answers about who and where you are. It's so much more about the atmosphere that the game conveys than the story itself - which is really not so important, in this case.","January 21, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a horror game, it focuses on telling the story instead of jump scares (like Dead Space) or grinding (like Dead Island). The gameplay reminds me of Dear Esther and Anna where the story is given to the player piece by piece as they explore the environment and solve puzzles until they eventually come to the conclusion which strings all of those little pieces together.\n\n2. This has to be the first game I've ever played where English is consistently accompanied by a second language (in this case, Gaelic Irish) without having to change the language settings. Although the narration is performed in English, every scrutable object is described with a subtitle in Gaelic and then a smaller English subtitle underneath.\n\nBesides those two major points, the game has an incredible atmosphere and attention to detail with a well-matched soundtrack. I'm always happy when a game like this is as much fun to play as it appears to be from its trailers and screenshots. *****","January 28, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game's description says "challenging puzzle solving", but the only challenge lies in figuring out how the puzzles relate to the game at all. In a sense, it evokes Myst, where the puzzles are there, but they're so obscure you'll be scratching your head.\n\nIt's also very short, and can be completed in under two hours.\n\nAs of this review (June 14th, 2015), the game is currently 80% off. For its current price, it's worth the purchase. The atmosphere is foreboding, and you'll definitely want to see the conclusion.\n\nThe devs say this is part one of a two part story; let's hope part two is more fleshed out in pretty much every aspect.\n\nSUMMARY\nAt the end, I do recommend the game, if you're a fan of exploration. Do not expect much in the way of a "psychological thriller", but its story is genuinely interesting.","June 14, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get scared by ghost children (of course). Learn Morse Code somehow.\nIn all seriousness, it is an interesting game. Not undeserving of having Mixed reviews, but definitely deserves more Positive ones.\n\nEDIT:\nSaid "Amnesia clone" to get it across that it's a creepy and atmospheric game; it is really nothing like Amnesia - no enemies to avoid, very few puzzles (though good puzzles when there are), no such system like Sanity.\nYou can alter visual settings to make the visuals more crisp. Also: cough constantly. Open up a guide so as to read what the clues and whatnot say (not to find said clues). Ghost children seem to have been a one(or two)-off.\nThe few Negative reviews I've read bash the game hard. I've been intrigued the entire time I've played it.

Like many games in the genre, it has unique mood elements and features like Oculus Rift support. One such clever immersion trick is the way all items in the game are labelled in Irish (with English translations of course.) All of which smooths over the horror and the harshness of isolation.
