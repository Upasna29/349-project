I can't see how the developers put more than 2 days into this current build.

The game is an obstacle course. You climb and move through various candy themed hurdles until you reach the end of the stage. In single player mode, you're competing with yourself in getting the best/fastest time. In multiplayer mode, it's a race to see who can get to the end of the stage first.\n\n--------\n\nGraphics: 5 / 10\n\nI did not expect the game's graphics to look good, however it is very colourful and the way the candy theme is incorporated is nice. Sometimes it felt as though there were too many objects all over the place which was kind of distracting to me, but I feel that might have been intentional. I did feel that there is a lack of texture throughout the game, as everything looked very shiny and rounded. That being said, the game ran smoothly on my system and I'm sure the game would run fine on any basic setup.\n\n--------\n\nSound: 4 / 10\n\nAt first the sound assets were fine, and for anyone that enjoy rock covers of classic children's themes, then you might enjoy this. "Do your ear's hang low?" plays in the background of the stage and it does get repetitive after awhile.  Although I did read somewhere that the devs were making an effort to incorporate other songs into the game eventually, and you do have the option to disable the music.\n\n--------\n\nMechanics: 5 / 10\n\nThe mechanics with the VR system are pretty solid, I didn't run into any issues, and it was pretty responsive to the controls. It may take some getting used to at the beginning to figure out how far you have to stretch to latch onto an object in game, but it doesn't take that long to get a hold of it.\n\n--------\n\nFinal Personal Remarks:\n\nThese types of racing/speed running games are not something I usually enjoy, so I wasn't drawn into this game as much as other titles. I can see how some people would enjoy this title however, and I do think that this game is good for beginners to test out VR capabilities as well as getting a feel for these types of games. As it is in early access, I will revisit this title and re-review it at a later date.\n\nThanks to the Devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.","May 24","true","4.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"Please, only use the red grips if you want a challenge".\nSure thing, I get that. But isn't that more of a achivement, and not so much of a difficulty implementation?\n\n1 level.\nIt took me ~2 minutes to complete. That was the entire game.\nThink of this as level 1 of Super Mario. With only 1 type of enemy. For 20€.","June 1","false","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm putting faith that an even better and more complete title is on its way in the future.\n\nAs it stands, the current game is a single race along rock walls made of HTC branded chocolate bars, gum drops, candy canes and gummy bears.  There's multiplayer connectivity available if you have two Vives or connect via matchmaking features that likely won't turn up many other players until people both have VR headsets and buy the game.  I demoed an earlier build last month at a convention and the competiveness of a two player race is excellent.\n\nThere's a bit of a challenge with multiple paths along the way to the finish line, with the green gumdrops being an easy path and the yellow gumdrops providing more of a challenge, but overall, there's currently not more than 10 minutes or so of single player content if you aren't racing friends or internet strangers.\n\nWhat exists today is an extremely fun concept and it actually feels like I'm stretching to grab the next hold on a rock wall each time I extend my arm and controller.  I think it is a good gamble to take at the highly reduced price for early access for a game very early in development.  Now I just need more people to buy it so that I have an excuse to practice and race you!","April 20","true","0.7"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","37","7","19","2","0"
