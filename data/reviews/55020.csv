I like the presentation and you can have four people play at once. It’s just a shame that there’s so little content. The breadth of what is tested is very limited e.g. maths is just about the twelve times table and there’s no ‘learning’ element e.g. a map to study geography or explanations of what nouns or verbs are.\n\nIt’s clearly a game that was made very quickly, even using sound and music from Atom Zombie Smasher. It's clearly not worth the full asking price as is, but with a bit more time put in, it could have become a fairly good game for young children.\n","December 8, 2013","false","0.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

However, the controls and the stutter in the graphics can make the game very difficult to play.  It's also very short and can be beaten in less than 1 hour.  There are more things to do than the main adventure, but the interest levels are low.  Achievements are broken.\n\nEdit - Go into the game folder in Steam/Steamapps/Common/Airforte/Data and copy the steamwrapper.dll and rename it to steamwrap2.dll.  This will make the achievements work.\n\nEdit - Fixed the stutter in the graphics by installing the new OpenAL to help fix sound issues as well.  For some reason this solved the problem.

The missions are either number missions (e.g. collect tokens showing multiples of 3), word type missions (e.g. collect all the verbs) or flag missions (e.g. collect all the European flags). The main story is framed as a children’s comic-book with crazy jungle characters and a flying ace hippopotamus. Along with the surf-themed music the whole package is quite cute.\n\nAs with all games, Air Forte is not without its own flaws. Probably the most frustrating is the debatable answer to some of the missions. The number missions are quite clear however the choice to lump Central and North American countries under the category of “North America” or European and Scandinavian countries all as “Europe” can be a little confusing. Worse still are the word games. Some clever instances will get you thinking: boot is a verb and a noun. But it is not rare to find that you are one token short and there is no reasonable answer from the leftover possibilities. While I am willing to accept that maybe I’m not smart enough to win, I find issue with the fact that the rationale is never explained.  That is, the game is ‘educational’ in content, not by the fact that it actually educates the user about anything in particular.\n\nThe game itself has a story mode that is quite short and can be finished in a single sitting if you are determined. Play for any longer and you may find that the endearing soundtrack starts to get a bit tired.\n\nTechnically, the software works smoothly on the whole. Unfortunately, driving the software with the controller is not supported. Navigating the menus must all be done with the mouse but once the game is started, it supported my gamepad just fine. Another issue is that (as of v.1.53) Steam integration doesn’t work properly. If you haven’t read the discussion board posts, the steamwraper2.dll needs to be renamed to steamwrap2.dll for achievements to work properly.\n\nDespite the problems with Air Forte the chipper presentation and overall feel-goodedness of the game does help it to rise above its own flaws. While the appeal will certainly be limited for adults, it didn’t stop me from sinking a number of hours in getting the achievements and even convincing my better half to join in a few rounds of co-op.\n","November 23, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a casual game for sure but it was alright. I can't imagine ever playing more of it than the two run throughs I gave it and I'm glad it was just part of a bundle I picked up. I wouldn't suggest someone pay money for this game unless it was incredibly cheap and it somehow appealed to you.","July 17, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, the game isn't terrible. It's simple, short, and easy to understand. Things like naming "play" and "repair" as nouns rather than verbs, repetitive gameplay, a worthless scoring system, and oddly place christmas music hold this game back.\n\nThat being said, it's a decent edutainment game- just not for the full $10. The price is what prevents me from recommending it.\n\nIf you're at all interested, I made a video about this game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1PUoJnzGjs","June 2, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
