Controls are tight and responsive, and you never feel cheated when you die.\nThe visuals have been drastically overhauled from the 3DS version, with hand-drawn animation and high-resolution backgrounds replacing the pixelated sprite art. The jump to HD was handled very well, something Wii U owners are already well-aware of.\nMSF's music was written by skilled composer Jake Kaufman, and the soundtrack to this game may very well be his magnum opus. If you've ever played a Shantae game, Shovel Knight, Double Dragon Neon, or Ducktales Remastered, you know to expect lots of earworms.\nThis port is near-flawless. Expect uninterrupted 60FPS at all times. Controls can be rebound, arbitrary resolutions are supported, and xinput controlers are a plug-and-play affair. There are a few new features exclusive to the Steam release of Hyper Drive Edition as well, such as Steamworks-enabled leaderboards and achievements.\nI'd recommend Mighty Switch Force!

It's a simple mechanic that is all done with the press of a button but as you progress the stages and blocks become more varied and difficult. When switching blocks the others that are already physical will disapear, some blocks are needed to be used as cannons and some can be altered by stepping on them. The puzzles won't leave you stumped but do excpect some challange. The game is more about it's arcade like time attack then it's puzzle solving and nothing illustrates this point more than the superb soundtrack created by Jake Kauffamn (Virt) who creates a highly intense, hyperactive 16 bit score a kin to the Megaman series. (seriously go get his album it's even free on his website but give him something you won't regret it).\n\nThe PC version throws away the pixel art from clean animatied sprites and a much higher resolution that makes the stages pop with colour and vibrance in a techno city. If you miss the sprites you have the option to turn them on.\n\nI'm a big fan of Wayforwards work and if you enjoy your classic platofrming mixed with varied puzzles, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic music and colourful worlds you owe yourself to give Mighty switch Force the attention it so rightfully deserves.\n\nServe and protect by swithcing it up!","June 26, 2015","true","0.4"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skelebun/recommended/366970/","Skelebun","Skelebun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skelebun/","158 products in account","Upon hearing about this game's port to Steam on Wayforward's website, I was ecstatic. Checking the Steam store everyday in hopes to see it. And the day has finally arrived! I'm a fan of Wayforward's Shantae serious so I was eager to jump into their other games.\n\nStory\nIn Mighty Switch force, you play as the aptly named Patricia Wagon after what appears to be a prison transport vehicle crashes and releases all of these blonde female prisoners in short shorts, miniskirts, and low cut dresses. And taken from both the background and the stages itself, the game appears to take place in a dystopian like universe or more like the Chemical Plant zone from Sonic 2\n\nGameplay\nThe game is in short, is a puzzle platformer. As you progress through levels, you use Patricia's ability to alter reality, bringing blocks and other items in existance and taking others out. All the while, capturing the escaped prisoners and taking out the occasional baddie with your laser pistol. You aren't actually given a tutorial and your just thrown right into the game after starting the first level and getting a quick cutscene that stages the story. Patricia can only take three hits, so if those three hearts get depleted, it's back to the stage selection screen for you. Fortunately, you can restore her health by eating...floppy discs? She says yum so she must be eating them for whatever reason.\n\nLevels\nAll the levels are rather unique, introducing a new mtheod to solving puzzles with each stage, along with an amazing soundtrack that are unique to each individual stage. And each stage having a bit of replayability due to their being a par time to see how fast you can complete it. And after playing a few levels, it seems rather difficult to accomplish, at least from my perspective.\n\nArtstyle\nI felt like I needed to mention this. I can't get over Wayforward's artstyle and feeling the need to praise it whenever given the chance. It's phenomenal.\n\nNegatives\nThere are a few bad things to say about this title, as I mentioned before there's no tutorial. Whether you see this as a good thing or a bad thing, it's entirely opinion. But I honestly prefer some sort of introduction to Patricia's ability to bend reality. Granted there are few controls so not much to get upset over. And there really isn't much of a story which I think is rather unfortunate considering that their Shantae series is brimming with life and a story with witty dialogue that's sure to be remembered. While the only dialogue you'll be getting here is "Justice is Served" or "Checkpoint"!\n\nVerdict\nIt's a honestly a rather fun enjoyable game that's easy to jump right into. And for the price of ten dollars, it's not bad especially if your a Wayforward fan","June 25, 2015","true","0.4"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","23","30","0","0"

This is what a platformer should feel like!\n\nThe graphics are awesome, and the controls are super responsive. There's no music, other than the loading screens, but the sound effects in-game are, for the most part, absolutely appropriate. I do feel like the use of the word, "yummy" is overdone and somewhat awkward, but that feels a bit nit-picky at this point.\n\nThere are quick-switch mechanics in this game, just like with Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams, Contrast, and Chronology, and this developer, like those who made the other outstanding games I mentioned, did it right.\n\nThis is a game for anyone looking for a platformer or even a mild puzzle-platformer. There is a little bit of puzzling and thinking to some of the levels, but the mix of pure, unthinking platforming enjoyment along with the challenge related to the quick-switch mechanics just feels right.\n\nThis is a game that can be played in short intervals, as there are checkpoints and brief levels referred to as, "incidents." Gamers looking for a casual experience or one that won't deprive them of daylight for the foreseeable future, should definitely give this one a try.\n\nMighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition also has replaybility, because of the addition of personal best scores for timed levels and a speedrunning option, as well as the normal story mode, and even a harder difficulty level for hardcore gamers.\n\nMost gamers will be able to find something to enjoy here. I definitely recommend it!\n\n\n*This review is featured on the curator page of Review Experts.","April 26","true","6.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MinoruLeonardo/recommended/366970/","MinoruLeonardo","Minoru Leonardo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MinoruLeonardo/","330 products in account","Personal rating: 9/10\n\nWhat to expect from Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive EditionFrom the same people who brought Shantae and DuckTales Remastered among other great platforming titles we have Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition. If you are familiar with any of previous titles that should tell that you are in for a good platforming experience.\n\nMighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition is a puzzle platformer with some action elements. While killing enemies is a big part on the game, it focuses a lot more on finding the five Hooligan Sisters on each level and to do that you'll need to smart up and use a combination of thinking and reflexes to finish most levels, which are called Incidents here.\n\nJump, shoot and switch it up!The controls in this game are fantastic. They are precise, responsive and whenever you get hit or make a mistake you'll hardly feel like it was the game's fault. From jumping to shooting everything is as quick as you can react.\n\nAs the name of the game implies there's a lot of switching here. You do it to activate or deactivate platforms ranging from the common usage to avoid hazard or overcome obstacles to the not so common use of killing enemies by literally throwing them on your screen, but watch out; you can do it to your own self if you are not careful with it.\n\nAs you progress through the game the level becomes harder and more intricate with some of them being really challenging, especially if you are aiming for the Par Time. The difficulty curve is steady but it never feels like it spiked in any level, whenever you are presented with a new obstacle, the game makes sure to give you a chance to test it to understand how it works.\n\nFor both people looking for a casual experience to people looking for challengesJust like Mighty Switch Force! Hose It Down!, Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition gives you a nice and gratifying experience when playing the game as you'll feel great when you overcome that puzzle that was getting you stuck. And if that is not enough for you there are Par Time challenges which requires you to finish the level as fast as you can. Most of the Par Times are not very generous and a single mistake will force you to start all over again in a lot of cases.\n\nThere are several other challenges for achievements in specific levels that can be also very difficult to do. Something perfect for those who may think this game is too easy.\n\nHyper Drive exclusive levelsIf beating the Par time isn't enough challenge for you, how about doing it in even harder versions of the levels you just did?\n\nHyper Drive Edition features bonus levels and once you finish them you'll unlock the Hyper version of all levels (i.e: Hard difficulty). Unlike many lazy developers, WayForward changed considerably most of the levels and you'll notice right away as soon as you pick any level to play.\n\nThe game will non-verbally, non-written say the gloves are off by making the very first level, the one you probably laughed at, a good deal more challenging forcing you to use platofrming techniques and finesse in execution that was only demanded from you in the last levels of the game.\n\nGraphics and musicMighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition has cartoony graphics of the highest caliber. The animations are fluid and extremely pleasant to the eyes and you can also have the option to turn the protagonist into her older pixel-modeled version which is just as well animated. This shows the carefulness of WayForward's craft and for those who don't know: animation, especially from pixel-art, can be VERY difficult and time consuming to do.\n\nThe music is something worth noting. Jake Kaufman (same composer from Shovel Knight and Shantae series) did an extraordinary job with it, sometimes you may just pause for a moment and forget about that clock ticking just to hear it. Now, how many games does that to you?\n\nAll in allThis game is amazing. I've longed to play it since 2013 and had very high expectations from it. Unlike other titles it wasn't a letdown and so far it's been a great experience with its charming graphics and great soundtrack and the good dosage of challenge from level to level.\n\nMighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition is considered one of the finest games of its genre (even though it's quite underrated) and for the right reasons. It's a game that can be difficult but enough to make you go for it even more, not shoo you away.\n\nIf you enjoy platformer with puzzle elements or are looking for the first game of its genre, Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition is definitely worth trying, especially since it's rather cheap.","June 26, 2015","true","22.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

The solid gameplay and fantastic level design and progression is the star here, as the reuse of elements and mix of them up makes every level feel new and interesting. The HD upgrade is definitely appreciated for this 3DS port, and the game runs fantastically on pretty much all levels, and I love the animation quality and the characters designs. Honestly, when it comes down to it, there's not a lot I can really say that really doesn't work for the game as a whole: everything works together to make a solid experience. It's not a GOTY candidate by any means, but it's definitely a game that puts enjoyment as one of its core experiences, and I can't argue against a game for less then 10 dollars that delivered on almost every level. Definitely worth a pickup for the puzzle-platform lover, and even for those who may not like the genre regardless.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video First Impressions: http://youtu.be/fy22p7S-Fh4\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nGameplay is fantastic all around. Great implementation of controls on top of simple yet solid gameplay makes for an enjoyable experience.\nLevel design and progression is done fabulously. Even with using the same mechanics, it changes things up and mixes them around so well that you don't even notice, and the progression curve on that is exactly what you want: not to steep, but not to shallow. The strength off the game.\nThe upgraded visuals and animations make the game come to life. I love the designs of characters, and in particular the animations stand out in just me having the character sit there and just enjoy watching them.\nThe music is a highlight, complimenting the levels in high energy, and it's clear that the composer knew the game inside and out.\nGame runs rather well overall with no hiccups in performance, and at a high frame rate. What little options that are there is what you need for a game like this.\nReplayability is high with ways to improve your runs time wise.\nLove the inclusion of the old pixel sprite as a playable character.\nAll of the above is combined well together, and nothing distracts from any other element. Not only was the design done well, it was executed well.\n-:\nIn the end, there is only so much you can get out of the simple gameplay, and won't be for people who prefer in depth mechanics.\nDo have concerns about the depth of content, given the number of levels that are seemingly there. Can't confirm that however, and so that's a possibility.\nWish the game didn't take me back to the level select menu every time I complete a level. Let me just go to the next one in succession or give me a menu like that before taking me back.","June 26, 2015","true","1.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

MSF has 16 regular and 5 bonus stages, plus unlockable remixed versions of levels after you clear all the regular and bonus stages.  Game handles well and the controls are simple.  You can jump, shoot, switch and that's it.  You're always at max speed so there's no need to hold a button to run, which is always a plus.  Art is nice and clean and the soundtrack by Jake Kaufman is up-tempo and catchy.\n\nGameplay-wise, there's no fat.  No cut-scenes, no dialogue, no tutorials.  It feels very acadey in this sense, as most levels are designed to be beaten in a couple of minutes and are fairly compact.  There are a few variations to block-switching, but nothing too hard to grasp outside of initially figuring out how red/blue lock blocks work.  I hate red/blue lock blocks.\n\nEach level's goal is to solve puzzles to find the five hooligan sisters scattered about.  You're not likely to find yourself annoyed at finding a missing sister since the game has a handy "pointer" system that directs you in the location of the nearest sister.  It's a simple thing but it helps keep the pace up.\n\nThe only two negatives I can see for this game are length and the last level.  Clearing the 16 normal and 5 bonus stages probably won't take more than 3-4 hours for most people.  The replayability comes from trying to "low-score"/speedrun the levels in the fastest amount of time.  If you're into that, you just added a lot of extra gameplay.  You also unlock a sort of easy mode gun by beating the game that lets you play through a number of levels in a different manner.\n\nI'm much more about quality of gameplay over quantity, so I'd definitely rather play a 3-5 hour game that's really fun like MSF than a 12-25 hour game that's kind of okay.  If you have a "I need x amount of gameplay for every dollar spent" mentality, you'll probably find yourself cringing at the idea of paying 10 bucks for a short game like MSF, but if you don't think like that, you'll probably be happy with a full price purchase if you like puzzle/platformers.\n\nOnto to the second negative, the last level of both the regular stages and bonus stages are pretty bad and do the terrible video game thing of taking the primary gameplay mechanic of a game and flipping it out its head.  Throughout the game, you have complete control of block switching and playing mostly compact, short stages.  For whatever reason, WayForward thought it was good idea to make the finales really long and with an automated switch mechanic.  There's also much more a focus on fast-twitch platforming and I could see people who are more interested in the puzzle part of puzzle/platformer giving up in frustration.  It also doesn't help that MSF has an archaic life system that really rears its head during the finales.  It's very annoying to get near the end of the level only to suffer a cheap death, and there are truly cheap deaths near the end of the finales, and have to start over from the beginning.  Then again, WayForward had a dumb life system in DuckTales, too.\n\nIn short,\n+ a fun, nice-looking puzzle/platformer with a good soundtrack and replayability if you're into speedrunning levels.\n- the last levels of both the regular and bonus modes are difficult in way the rest of the game isn't, and a short overall play time if you just one-and-done each level.","July 13, 2015","true","5.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

I got MSF! and MSF!2 for less than 5€\nI had the best 20 hours of my life 100%ing both games.\nHere's why:\n\nPlagued with references to NES classics:\nMega Man movestyle (how do i crouch?)\nSonic's "falling on spikes" animation\nMetroid styled "death"\nAndroid/Robot girl with that silly hat that has antennae,\nseriously what the f*ck its like an identifier for the robotic club or some sh*t\nVERY SIMPLE STORYLINE AND "LORE" JUST LIKE 80'S-90'S GAMES\nBECAUSE GUESS WHAT,  IT DOESNT REALLY MATTER OH WOW\nAmazing soundtrack, i seriously can't believe how good it is and it's been like 1.5 years i've been listening to this. I'll probably never get tired. Good work music too, lmao.\nIncredibly good playability and rewarding effort, good old plain fun.\nGood difficulty scaling. And extra stages. gr8.\nWhy is Patricia so cheesy and sassy LMFAO\n\nI instantly became a fan of the game, and by extension of the company.\nBut that was then. I've played more of their games and they're all awesome. Good to see they took this one "Mighty Series" (Because there are others) game as one of their main franchises, just behind Shantae's.\n\nNow, about the HD and about the port\ndam son those som smooth a$$ graphix u got der i r8 8/8\n-minecraft hater\n\nthe Hyper Drive edition added a huge graphic overhaul to the game, from 16bit to FULL HD\nThe artstyle is kept the same but it now has amazing shading and great details. Smooth AF.\nThe faces and animations are really great and took a few kek's from me. Great art-rework.\nThe Hyper versions of the stages look like they were some mid-game boss and they came back after training hard just for revenge. Harder trickery on the puzzles, less forgiving par times (if they ever were).\nThe port looks fine, works smooth and without any delay.\n\nA side note to the "remixers" for the Hyper stages:\nDon't. Dubstep is already old.\nNah jk some are good but sincerely i just love the OST.\n\n"buh bruh so much writingsn and i didn undrestand anytheng!?"\nFinal rating: 9.75/10 great you should buy it if you like the genre.\nIf not, go look for something else. Money's expensive. Use it well.\nThe game might be simple and/or just straightforward but that doesn't even matter.\nLook at what you're buying please. It's a retro styled. Get out if you're a fallout4 fanboy\nThis game brought me mental health and a reason to believe in humanity. Thank you again, WayForward staff.","January 2","true","7.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","9","11","5","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/recommended/366970/","ErickaUnlimited","💝💝ErickaUnlimited💝💝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/","777 products in account","Overview\nMighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition is an HD remake of the original version, developed by WayForward Technologies, that was released for the 3DS on Nintendo's eShop back in December of 2011, Originally, the Hyper Drive Edition was released on the Wii U 2012 before finally being released on Steam in June of 2015. The game is a puzzle platformer that is centered around a female cyborg police officer named Patricia Wagon and her  goal of tracking down female convicts, avoiding enemies/traps and making it back to safety in a variety of levels. Each level has a set number of female convicts and a time to beat (but not required) if you're looking to earn the various achievements the game has to offer.\n\nTo complete your task, Patricia can run, jump, shoot and alternate the level terrain with her helmet, changing platforms and opening up new paths to get her where she needs to go as quickly as you can. Along side her trusty sidearm, you can use the helmet for clearing out enemies and defeating them by trapping them inside the disappearing blocks. Each level is scattered with enemies, bombs, landmines, spikes and other traps. Patricia has limited health, which is displayed as hearts on the screen, though you can re-fill the meter by collecting floppy drives, which apparently she says are "delicious". Go figure.  Each hit reduces your health meter by one and restarts you at the nearest checkpoint, while each tasty floppy disk increases it by the same. Losing all your health will cause Patricia to restart the level.\n\nAside from the main levels, there are also bonus stages and "hyper drive" levels, which essentially are the original ones, but more difficult to complete.\n\nThere is little else to this game, as it doesn't stray far from the standard puzzle platform elements. I loved it and was glad to have took a chance with it. The game can be a tad frustrating at times with some of the more difficult levels and sometimes your character seems to die from blocks that she isn't touching (when you change their planes of view with her helmet), but other than that I didn't find any issues with the game. It's a solid platformer with limited, but cute voice work and lovely animation. I have a special place in my heart for that "ugly dog" as they called it that served as the game's checkpoint system.\n\n\nPros\nAnimation - I fell in love with the art style and character design.\nMusic - I loved the music. It's pleasant, but not distracting.\nController support. I always played with one and it always worked fine. I used an XBOX controller.\nAchievements - Most of the achievements aren't terribly difficult with practice and patience except for a couple hard ones.\nCons\nSome complaints have been mentioned for how short the game is, though I felt the length wasn't an issue.\nReplayability - There is some for those looking to 100% the game, though once you do, there won't be much reason to go back to it.\n\nOverall, Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition is a fun puzzle platformer with an adorable art style and a moderate learning curve. I loved most everything about it and would recommend it to anyone seeking a new puzzle game to play, It can be tough, but I never felt it dipped into being unfair or frustrating. I'd very much recommend it to fans of the genre!","April 7","true","6.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

You play a  futuristic cop out to arrest some... strangly cute convict ladies, though to be honest the game is very light on story and you pretty much have to look it up online for more details, a bit like an old skool game. This platformer's levels are short and sweet, with light puzzle game elements and a mechanic to make platforms in set postions appear and disappear, to jump on, launch or crush enemies with (or yourself!). The latter half of the game requires quick decisions and reactions, but the overwhelming majority of the game is fair, with deaths being more down to your mistakes than any cheapness.\n\nThere's plenty of adjustment settings to choose from in terms of sound levels and game resolution. The menus level select you use is almost like phone games such as angry birds, but dont worry! That's a good thing and a deliberate design choice, as once you play the levels through the first time your next goal will be trying to finish each as fast as you possibly can. The replay value is a bit like Super Meat boy only less brutal.... mostly...\n\nThe dance music used on this game adds a hell of a lot, often making you want to go faster than is safe to do so if you really get into it. I'm kinda curious how the experience would be with all music turned off.\n\nThe only thing that might mess with some people is Virt's music in this game. If you like platformers, my advice here is check the soundtrack online to see if you like the style of that too, if it sounds like your kind of thing go for it! If not then... turn the music off I guess?\n\nMighty Switch Force all in all is an either love it or hate it kind of game. You don't have to worry about the quality because the game is great, so much that I predict someone will probably try and make a level editor mod in the future. All you have to decide is if this is YOUR style of game.","June 25, 2015","true","10.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game contains 21 different stages, along with “hyper” versions of those stages that add a more difficult twist.\n\nAPPROXIMATE LENGTH\n5 hours to clear all stages.

I would have loved a game with the same kind of mechanics that would go deeper with it.\n\n- Storytelling :\n\nunexistent. Not necessary for this kind of game.\n\n- Length :\n\nNope.

Basically you're a cop named Patricia Wagon and your objective through 95% of the game is to capture 5 different sexy prisoners scattered across the stage. To do that you have a pellet gun (That is mostly used to break some blocks or detonate bombs) and the ability to switch "dimensions" which causes transparent blocks to become tangible and viceversa. The switching is what helps you move through most of the stages and solve puzzles.\n\nControls are quite simple, one button to jump, one to shoot, one to switch dimensions and one extra button you can hold to move the camera and scout the nearby area before moving on. Physics are great and the game is pretty fair when it comes to level design so whenever you lose is mostly your fault although be prepared for the latter stages as you'll need quick reflexes to get through many of the puzzles. Note that unlike most platformers holding or pressing the jump button has no difference, you'll still jump the same height.\n\nThe game has a total of 16 initial stages and upon finishing them you'll then have to go through 5 more bonus stages. If you finish those then another whole batch of 16 stages + 5 bonus stages will become available. Thers are FAR harder versions of the previous batch with remixed music, colors.\n\nThe game looks quite short at first but if you're willing to go towards 100% completion then you can sink 10 hours into it with ease as each stage has a PAR time to beat and beating them all requires you to master the mechanics of the game. In fact, playing the game just to beat it and not caring about the PAR times greatly reduces the overall experience.\n\nWorth mentioning again: The soundtrack is AMAZING.","July 10, 2015","true","26.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Hyper Drive Edition.  I've only played just over an hour so far, and if the level count is any indication I'm about half way through the incidents (incidents being levels).  I don't know if there is more, but the level count seems a little bit light.\n\nIf I were to summarize the rest of this review I would say this game is very well done, and I think it is a good game, but because of the nature of the game play I don't much care for it.  If I had known what it would be like to play before hand, I wouldn't have bought it.\n\nAt its core, this is a puzzle platformer, which I think is the genre it's tagged as.  It's a very well done game, but I do wish there was a way to distinguish between timing puzzle platformers and other styles.  This one is a timing platformer, with many bits reminiscent of the barrel cannon sequences in the old Donkey Kong Country games.  However, while I enjoyed those back in the day, I'm not a big fan of these ones.\n\nThe basic controls are that you run, jump and shoot much like you would in something like a megaman game.  However, shooting the bad guys isn't the focus.  The focus comes from a button that switches the state of things on the screen, which you can do whenever you want.  When a thing is switched off it is effectively not there.  If it is switched on it is a platform you can stand on and will block anything from walking past.  If you switch them on while something (including yourself) is standing in front of it, that creature will be killed with an amusing animation of them smashing into the screen of your monitor.\n\nThe first puzzles you'll come across feature you needing to switch the platforms so that they are physical when you land on them.  This will often need to be done while you're in the air, having jumped from the last platform you switched on.\n\nAnother thing you'll find are launcher blocks.  If anything is standing in front of them when they get turned on that creature (or yourself if it's you) will be launched in the direction of the arrow.  These are the sequences that reminded me of the DK Country barrel cannons and they have come to feature quite prominently.  You need to time your switch changes so that when you're flying through the air you get caught in another launch block that will launch you in the right direction.  Often times your target block is not visible from where you're launching from and you'll either need lightning reflexes, or to try again and again until you get it right.\n\nThere is a system of checkpoints and lives.  You have three "lives" when you start, and you can never have more then three.  Each time you get hit you lose a life.  If you land on spikes or activate a block while you're standing in front of it you lose a life and respawn at the last checkpoint.  There are pickups you can find to restore one life heart at a time.  Checkpoints come in the form of little dogs that you walk past, and you can activate then as many times as you wish, but you'll only ever have one checkpoint active at a time.  If you exhaust your "lives" you are booted back to the main menu to begin the level again.\n\nAll in all, it is a solid and well made game.  I just don't care for the gameplay, and that is more about me then it is about this game.  If anything I've described sounds like fun to you, you should buy this.","June 30, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like all of the fast-paced Metroid elements but without the grand story and it's more episodic. It's a game built for speedrunning. If you enjoy constantly trying to be faster and faster at a game and trying to find better paths for better time and such, this game is for you. Also if you like a fun side-scrolling shooter platformer that's easy to get into with beautiful art that doesn't take itself too seriously, you'll love this.\n\nAlso, don't even get me started on the soundtrack. It's all wonderful electro-housey stuff that is candy for the ears. Jake Kaufman's official Mighty Switch Force soundtrack can be bought at a price you name (literally as low as $.01 if you want) on his Band Camp profile. I have the soundtrack actually on my phone and play some of the tracks now and then on the way to and from work. If you're a fan of electronic music, I definitely recommend picking the soundtrack up because all of the tracks in the game's stages are actually full-length songs that are beautifully produced.","June 26, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mighty Switch Force is a unique platformer/puzzle game , pretty challenging with gorgeous graphics and an outstanding soundtrack. This game actually seems pretty short (4-5 hours to finish the game completely) but got an amazing replayability since the game encourages you to speedrun the levels to beat the par time and unlock outfits for Patty wagon (the protagonist). A must buy for everyone who love to speedrun games or just playing a good platformer.","June 28, 2015","true","29.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wait until it's 5-7$ and that'd be a fairer price.\n\nBeating all the par times is really the goal rather than beating the game, because the game's puzzles aren't especially challenging. Think of it as the Megaman of puzzle games. It's a platformer where you shoot, yes, but the game is more about trial and error and getting as efficient as possible in order to beat the pretty challenging par times.","June 28, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/b-rom/recommended/366970/","b-rom","b-rom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/b-rom/","477 products in account","I might be a bit premature on the review for Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition.  I've only played just over an hour so far, and if the level count is any indication I'm about half way through the incidents (incidents being levels).  I don't know if there is more, but the level count seems a little bit light.\n\nIf I were to summarize the rest of this review I would say this game is very well done, and I think it is a good game, but because of the nature of the game play I don't much care for it.  If I had known what it would be like to play before hand, I wouldn't have bought it.\n\nAt its core, this is a puzzle platformer, which I think is the genre it's tagged as.  It's a very well done game, but I do wish there was a way to distinguish between timing puzzle platformers and other styles.  This one is a timing platformer, with many bits reminiscent of the barrel cannon sequences in the old Donkey Kong Country games.  However, while I enjoyed those back in the day, I'm not a big fan of these ones.\n\nThe basic controls are that you run, jump and shoot much like you would in something like a megaman game.  However, shooting the bad guys isn't the focus.  The focus comes from a button that switches the state of things on the screen, which you can do whenever you want.  When a thing is switched off it is effectively not there.  If it is switched on it is a platform you can stand on and will block anything from walking past.  If you switch them on while something (including yourself) is standing in front of it, that creature will be killed with an amusing animation of them smashing into the screen of your monitor.\n\nThe first puzzles you'll come across feature you needing to switch the platforms so that they are physical when you land on them.  This will often need to be done while you're in the air, having jumped from the last platform you switched on.\n\nAnother thing you'll find are launcher blocks.  If anything is standing in front of them when they get turned on that creature (or yourself if it's you) will be launched in the direction of the arrow.  These are the sequences that reminded me of the DK Country barrel cannons and they have come to feature quite prominently.  You need to time your switch changes so that when you're flying through the air you get caught in another launch block that will launch you in the right direction.  Often times your target block is not visible from where you're launching from and you'll either need lightning reflexes, or to try again and again until you get it right.\n\nThere is a system of checkpoints and lives.  You have three "lives" when you start, and you can never have more then three.  Each time you get hit you lose a life.  If you land on spikes or activate a block while you're standing in front of it you lose a life and respawn at the last checkpoint.  There are pickups you can find to restore one life heart at a time.  Checkpoints come in the form of little dogs that you walk past, and you can activate then as many times as you wish, but you'll only ever have one checkpoint active at a time.  If you exhaust your "lives" you are booted back to the main menu to begin the level again.\n\nAll in all, it is a solid and well made game.  I just don't care for the gameplay, and that is more about me then it is about this game.  If anything I've described sounds like fun to you, you should buy this.","June 30, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To me, it's just that good.)\n\nI remember getting MSF! and MSF! 2 for the 3DS, not having a clue of what it would be like. I enjoyed it a lot! Patricia Wagon easily became one of my favorite video game protagonists. Seeing this version on here, I didn't know what to think of it at first. It looked about the same, just with different graphics. I decided to buy it in hopes that I'd be just as satisfied. Thankfully, I was. This version still has the same charm as it's always had.\n\nI'd recommend this game for those who like a challenge. It combines strategy (puzzles) with speed and action. I haven't fully completed the game, so I don't know how long it takes to complete (and even par) all of the levels. The music is astounding and fun to listen to as you're completing the levels.\n\nNow—if you've been convinced, of course: go and serve some justice!","December 19, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The next issue is only having three health (chances) to spawn back from a checkpoint, if I used them up I would have to repeat the entire level all over again which sounds fair but really is frustrating.\n\nJumping, timing, switching is the sum of the game, not much shooting but at times needed.
