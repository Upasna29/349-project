It's  a turn-and-burn game that has realistic looking planes, but they don't feel that different when flown, and weapons are completely unrealistic. There are also no friendlies in the game: you are ALONE in the game, making 20-80 kills PER MISSION. Yes, your weapons regenerate. The game also relies on throwing a lot of enemies at you. Missions are lame as you seem to be the only person in this country's air force... and you're a Western mercenary! Graphics are good (1680x1050 is supported) but not spectacular accurate like HAWX. All in all, I should be playing HAWX or Ace Combat.","November 26, 2013","false","9.9"," 330 of 352 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","330","352","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/recommended/207790/","slycooperfan1","SlyCooperFan1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/","307 products in account","In the 90s, Jane's Combat Simulations was a whole series of flight simulation games published by EA (you read that right, it was EA before they became the stupid EA we all know today) with the branding of Jane's Information Group, a publishing company specializing in warfare. I have limited experience with flight simulation, and didn't discover it until way after Jane's games stopped being made, but I haven't heard anything but good things about the series.\n\nNow ignore everything I just said because it doesn't apply here at all. That's right, just like all the other reviews said, the "Jane's" name has nothing to do with this game. It's an arcade game; think HAWX or Ace Combat, but Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters is way more like HAWX 1 (I haven't played HAWX 2 so I can't say). Which I'm okay with - HAWX 1 was actually enjoyable for what it was, especially in multiplayer co-op... but where HAWX failed to capture the essence of Ace Combat, Jane's fails to even capture the essence of HAWX. And that's just sad.\n\nFirst things first, no camera control and limited controller support. You have to go into the controls menu and rebind the keys for your controller before you can do anything, and even then you still can't control the camera nor can you use the controller for the menus - you gotta have your keyboard handy. Plus, I don't know if this was just me, but some of the graphics seemed really weird - I had some werid light flickering every now and then, and explosions didn't look like explosions at all.\n\nOn that last note, the graphics are passable. The aircraft models aren't very-well detailed, but they're not mishapen blocks that don't look like the Super Hornet or A-10 - they're passable, at the very least. Music and sound design are... poor, really. Nothing stuck with me at all, and I'm not trying to look for the soundtrack online or anything. Adding on to that, voice quality is really horrible. I mean, the writing can be okay at times, but the main character doesn't seem to give a damn about anything. He always sounds so upbeat, even when someone you're escorting is about to die. The guy voicing Control sounded like he was reused for some of the ground forces, which really confused me during one of the early missions.\n\nThe gameplay of JASF is the worst part, unfortunately. Nothing seems to be obvious enough, especially concerning incoming missiles, which you can't dodge normally unless you use countermeasures. Seriously, those things stay glued to your butt like hell, and it's not like you have an infinite amount of flares when the enemies gang up on you. You'll find yourself dying just because the missiles are magically homing on you. Not like your missiles have the same capabilities. Additionally, when using bombs, your aircraft can be destroyed by those very bombs. Of course, you have no way of knowing this (and no other arcade flight game has this feature AFAIK) until you do it yourself, and even then you'd be hard-pressed to figure it out.\n\nMission variety is also extremely broken. First mission is a patrol, followed by an escort. Second mission is a low-altitude attack, followed by an escort. Third mission is a low-altitude attack, followed by an escort. Am I the only one seeing a pattern here? Escort missions are the bane of some players' existence in Ace Combat games, so if you hate escort missions, stay the hell away.\n\nFor what it's worth, I spent exactly $1.00 of my Steam wallet (so, technically, free since it was from trading cards), so I don't think it was wasted - I did enjoy what I was doing until I got shot down by a swarm of MiGs in... the third mission? Hard to remember since they're so easy to forget.\n\nIn all honesty, HAWX 1 is better than this, and most Ace Combat games are better than that. Go look there. Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters isn't worth anyone's time or money.","March 25, 2015","false","1.2"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","31","32","0","0"

Sure, it is a H.A.W.X. clone, but it really doesn't deserve all the hate it got!\n\nThe good:\n-Nice graphics- The graphics aren't spectacular, but they get the job done (especially considering the fact that this is a 2011 game)! The plane models are detailed and belivable, the terrain looks really good too!\n-Large map- The map in this game is pretty big, and it's really nice to fly around. Sadly there is no free-flight feature, so you can't explore it outside of the campaign.\n-Fun gameplay- The gameplay is fun and addicting. I would say the general feel of the game is even better than H.A.W.X.\n\nThe bad:\n-Obviously a H.A.W.X. clone- It is a negative point, merely because the game doesn't introduce antything new.\n-No cockpits for the airplanes- While it is not game-braking, the lack of cockpit view in the planes, hurts the immersion a bit. There was cockpit view in H.A.W.X., and it was a nice feature.\n-The story- The story is the generic, one-super-human-pilot-wins-the-war in a fake-arabic-island-nation devided into the "good" south, and the "bad" north. No surprises here. I have to say though, that the story is not too bad, certainly not worse than H.A.W.X.\n\nAll in all, a solid ARCADE, flying GAME. That's right. NOT a flight SIMULATOR. I think most people have a problem with this game, because it is called Jane's. I personally don't. The game is fun and enjoyable. Don't buy it expecting a simulator, but rather a fun flying action game, and you will be fine. I am a veteran of many a flight sim (Falcon BMS, FSX, LockOn Flaming Cliffs...), and it doesn't make me enjoy this game any less.","September 13, 2015","true","8.2"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","16","23","2","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadwoodsukhoi/recommended/207790/","deadwoodsukhoi","Sukhoi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadwoodsukhoi/","782 products in account","This should not have the Jane's Name attached to it.  "Advanced Strike Fighters" would be a better name as it is an arcade like flight simulator, nothing like the in-depth realism of the other Jane's titles.  I am going to reccomend this game, but for a very specific reason, skip to the last paragraph if you want that break down.  The rest of this review will be focusing on all the problems with the game.\n\nThe game has some serious flaws.  The most jarring is the voice acting.  It's horrible.  The voice actors don't know what accent they are trying to replicate, and the end result is that 'control' (the guy giving you missions) sounds like a caricature of a middle eastern terrorist, your allies all sound either Russian (maybe) French (sometimes) or just stupid (almost always).  And then there is the main character you play, 'Razor', who has less personality then a cardboard box.  There is also the stupid decision to reveal major plot points while you are dogfighting multiple enemies.  I've screamed 'Shut up control! KIND OF BUSY!" while the middle eastern terrorist is rambling about president Karzei or Dimitriev.  Shutting the radio off is probably a good idea in this game, because it will be less frustrating.  And the plot is generic and bad anyway, make up your own story as you shoot down enemies.\n\nMoving on, the gameplay.  It's not great.  Enemy fighter planes spawn and then go after you like a cruise missile.  The force balance is blatantly unfair as well, enemy fighters swarm you very quickly, and 10 on 1 furballs are never very fun.  Enemy missiles track rather well, and your countermeasures are basically only good for one missile.  If you have three flares, and you pop them, the game stops the tracking on three missiles (not all 12 headed at you) so again, not really realistic.  AAA fire can't shoot at you until you are within 2 miles, but can then track and hit you constantly (even through mountains) until you are 10 miles away.  Enemy SAMs always outrange ground munitions, so wild weasel can be interesting.  Now one by one, all of these enemy elements can be dealt with, but usually the game spawns 10 fighters, 4 sams, and an AAA site all at once and tells you 'GOOD LUCK!'.  This can be extremely frustrating at times.  I played one game where I died five times, but at the end, I had 94 ground kills and 138 air kills, achieveing a kill ratio that would be envied by any air force.  But to beat the level, there was no way you could do it on a single life, and this is a gameplay decision that bothers me.  Skill should be a factor here.\n\nSo that's enemies, what about your plane?  Well there is a good selection of aircraft, and they are all sort of rendered nicely.  I mean, the graphics in this game are not that great, but they get the job done.  One jarring thing for people who like planes, is that when maneuvering the planes surfaces do not move properly.  The ailerons and elevators and rudders all work, like on a Cessna, but these are Fly by wire aircraft.  Elevators work in tandem to roll planes along with elevators, flaps and ailerons should deploy to aid elevators in pitch maneuvers, rudders function as pitch and yaw assist on most aircraft as well.  This is not modeled, unlike say Ace Combat, where the planes are basically pornography.  Your weapon selection could best be described as generic.  There are no real munitions in this game, all the munitions are made up names with different capabilities.  You only really need three to win at this game, the Shrike, Eagle, and Basilisk.  The Shrike is a AA-11/sidewinder equivalent, the Eagle lets you pop enemy planes at long range (20 k in this game...) and the Basilisk is a cruise missile with submuntions.  You can't loadout your aircraft with anything other then pre-set loadouts, so I'll just tell you that the SU-35BM has this loadout in a 4/4/4 config.  Use it the moment you unlock it for every mission.  So your weapons are pretty generic and the explosions/missile traces are boring.\n\nOk, so why am I listing this game as recommended.  Well I am saying it is worth buying if it is on sale for only one reason.  It is fun to play Co-op.  Single player this game is dissapointing, but every mission in the game can be played on co-op mode, and you can have a lot of friends in a single session.  The enemy count doesn't change, so the game actually becomes more fair when you fly with wingman, about the only concession to reality the game makes.  If you have some friends to fly with, this game is pretty fun to play and the aircraft selection means you can all be flying your favourite modern jet.  If you don't intend to play co-op, stay away from it.","January 26, 2014","true","6.6"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

First thing I did, as I do in all games, was check the key layout and controls for flying with a keyboard. It was doable in writing, unfortunately, it's poorly executed in-game. The throttle up key (arrow key up) does exactly that it throttles up, however it also turns the camera  in-cockpit 90 degrees left. Slowing down (arrow key down) does the same thing, it throttles down with the expense of turning your camera 90 degrees right.\n\nAlso, before purchasing JASF, I read in multiple places that the game can be used with a joystick/gamepad/Xbox 360 controller. Nope. I restarted the game (with Xbox 360 controller connected) and was prompted with the "Enter" key as well as the arrow keys for navigating the menu. Fair enough, the menu is keyboard exclusive, I can understand that. As I went in-game I soon noticed that there were new icons. For instance, instead of an arrow key, it was the "A" button. I pick up my Xbox 360 controller and press "A" for a solid 10 seconds... Nothing. The voiceover is still going, droning about my important task at hand. I keep pressing "A", then "B" then every other button on my controller. Nothing. For a game that is ALSO on Xbox 360, there was a transition error or flawed coding to not have a smooth transition to PC.\n\nGraphics: Not much concern. Although, I did experience some screen tears and occasional stuttering throughout my loop-de-loop camera turning spiral into the end of the runway. Nothing gamebreaking however. Planes look good, environment is minimal but effective. Cockpit perspective looks alright. Not much criticism here.\n\nI'm a huge fan of the Ace Combat series, I've played hours upon hours of IL-2 Sturmovik for PS3, even more on Heroes of the Pacific and Secret Weapons over Normandy for PS2 and many more airplane specific games (I'm not going to include Battlefield games because that's somewhat taboo to flight simulator enthusiasts). So, it's safe to say that this is no user error, this is a game with potential, but failed to properly execute the most basic of video game tasks, the controls.","March 31, 2014","false","0.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

The funds in my steam wallet dropped the price further to a total of $0.55. Probably still too much for this bad HAWX/Ace Combat knock off.\n\nIf you are like me and played the older Jane's flight simulators long ago, this is nothing like them at all. Gameplay is at times incredibly boring and at other times can be frustrating due to the terrible UI. If you're interested in aviation at all, this game will probably confuse you with some of the things they decided to do, like the F-22 having external hardpoints, or the A-10 having afterburners.\n\nThe planes all handle roughly the same with the biggest difference being their weapon loadouts, which is still pretty same-y across the board. Excited to fly the A-10 because of the GAU? Too bad, it is the same as every other plane in the game. Excited to fly the F-22 to be super stealthy? Too bad, stealth doesn't seem to actually do anything in the game.\n\nTo end - This is nothing more than a console port of an already bad knock off. There is nothing to enjoy (besides maybe the hilariously bad dialogue) in this dark spot on the Jane's legacy.","January 29, 2014","false","6.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

First of all: The Tutorial didn't get redone for PC. It shows the X-Box Gamepad icons, while it doesn't even Support a Gamepad Control. Secondly, the Control of the jet is way to hard to get into. You're gonna crash a ton of times, and as you might guess after 50 explosions, crashing isn't funny or entertaining anymore. I can't tell you about the Story because i quit the game after not much time at all. All i can say is that the Voice Syncs suck badly and the accent of the speaker isn't too easy to understand (No Racist).\n\nIf They'd put some more effort into the game it might be worth it money but right now its not even worth 1$.\n\nGG Devs  >:/","January 28, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The basic play experience is competent, if uninspired. (To be fair, though, these guys did "full freedom" flying better than "Air Conflicts," and it's all forgiving enough to work with the not-very-good PC controls.)\n\n"Ace Combat" this isn't. There's very little variety, and challenge is mostly provided by swarms of opponents firing nigh-unshakeable missiles. Outmaneuvering an enemy pilot isn't a problem at all. Having only a few countermeasures to throw at things you can't really dodge is where things get tricky.\n\nThat can all be forgiveable under the right circumstances. The game's real weakness is its presentation.\n\nTo be blunt, "Jane's" feels blatantly like a cash-in title. I got the strong impression that someone figured, "If we license some fighter aircraft, and slap the name of Jane's Information Group on the thing, we can sell a few units." It's not that the game is buggy, it's just that it's so...cheap. You fly over the same terrain and landmarks all the time, and there are basically only five mission types: Air-to-air, air-to-ground, recon, a mix of the previous, and a mix of the previous with flying under radar detection altitude.\n\nAnd there wasn't a single opponent that I felt was truly interesting to get into a fight with.\n\nAlongside the above, the depiction of the fictional "Afghan-Iraq-Iranistan" is caricatured and insulting. There was a point where I couldn't be sure that the developers weren't intentionally trying to take the ♥♥♥♥ out of the whole thing. The voice acting is thoroughly unconvincing, and the characters are parodies of themselves. I can't imagine the voice-talent taking the script seriously in any real way.\n\nLike I said, though, if you like arcade-style jet combat enough you might be able to stomach this offering. I got sufficient enjoyment out of the game to play through it twice.\n\nBut this really is a cheap knockoff of far better things.","December 28, 2014","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its insane, you're just bombared with endless warnings and demands to launch counter-measures. Taking into account the missiels that hit and the time spent flying to and between combat areas I probably had missiles being fired at me every 2-3s during combat.\n\nThis game is not a simulation, its an arcade game pure and simple. Mission 4 was the last straw for me where you get unlimitted F-10s spawning from an airfield right next to your ground targets which launch and before reaching you fire off about 3-4 missiles each ... you can't even clear them from the sky and then focus on the main targets as they relaunch and are on you within about 30s. I finished the mission by forgetting all tactics and proper target priority and simply taking the defenders fire while I hit the main targets, praying my armour would hold out.\n\nAnother problem with this game are the guns. Its almost impossible to hit anything with them. Its good that all your missiles/bombs get re-stocked every 5s or so because you're entirely dependent on them, even the thunderbolt is there solely as a platform to launch ordnance.\n\nTrying to think of some positives to keep this review vaguely balanced all I can think is that once I started using my controller (rather than keyboard/mouse) the flight controls were quite easy to master with low level flying quite easy to get to grips with (although I was a bit disappointed when I accidently flew through a tree and it just ghosted through me). Yeah I know, even my positive section isn't hugely positive. I guess the best part of this game was that with a 90% off coupon I bought it for about 80p... I'm not really sure it was worth it.\n\nI have Lethal Skies II for my PS2 in a cupboard somewhere, its over 10 years old and better than JASF in every single way imaginable...","September 13, 2014","false","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a cheap console port that doesn't even work with a standard Xbox Controller.\nThe Yaw is completely ♥♥♥♥ed up, it is stuck in a single direction. There are several workarounds that mostly don't work; none work for me thus far. The only thing that works is disabling the Yaw completely.\nIf you can't even play the game there can be no decent review.

You can customise your way to a slightly better interface, but the problems still remain - clunky and awkward.\n\nWar Thunder (which is free to play, btw) has simplistic arcade controls in Arcade Mode which blow this one out of the water - so compared to other games in the same arena, Jane's just doesn't stack up.","May 6","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
