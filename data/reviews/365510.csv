NOTE:  You cant rotate the centre piece's, they need to be on either edges to rotate them. You must complete each puzzle in a set amount of moves to get 100% for each puzzle. Once you complete each puzzle you will earn stars, these are acumulated and added to the leaderboard ( Yes there will be a leaderboard ). So the less moves you make to solve each puzzle the more stars you will earn, its as simple as that ! OR is it ?\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=610937520\n\nThere are 100's of puzzles to solve, that come under  differant categorie's, so just choose a categorie at the start of the game and there you will see lots more differant puzzles to try solve.\n\nFlip also has a simple easy to follow tutorial at the start of the game, and plenty of achievements to earn. I also quite like the colour palette, these developers have chosen for this game. But I would like to see much more colour variety and more picture puzzles  as well.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=597614059\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=597699763\n\nThis game is best played in short bursts as its alot of the same repetitive puzzles, but with differant lay outs to solve\n\nI find this game perfect for when you want something quick and simple to play when you only have a few minutes to spare, the game is easy enough to drop after 1 to 100 puzzles, depending on how you feel.\n\nFLIP is highly recommended for any puzzle enthusiast, or anyone that enjoys a challenge and a change from other game's. Game is suitable for most age groups.\n\nNOTE  This game was proved to me mainly for beta testing, and so I have chosen to write a review as well, but  this was not a part of the requirement.\n\nI have really enjoyed my time playing " Flip " greatly, and so I will continue to play this game at my own discretion. I'd also like to thank  Perro Electrico for giving me this opportunity to Beta test thier game, and I wish them every success with any future projects they may have planned Thank you  :)","February 16","true","23.6"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","27","29","0","5"

I like to play for up to 20 minutes at a time rather than sit through hundreds of levels in one sitting.\n\nThe store video and screenshots do a good job of introducing the gameplay. Of the four game modes, 'Sided' and 'Image' offer a similar challenge which is more difficult then the 'Simple' puzzles, but my favourite ones are the 'Wired' puzzles.\n\nI'd definitely recommend Flip, and it's certainly worth the money given the vast number of puzzles it offers. I've barely scratched the surface in my 6 hours of playtime at the time of writing this review!","February 16","true","6.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

There's a variety of unique  orientations and combinations to keep you busy.  There's no timer, but a minimum move requirement to acheive a high score. A good mobile port for the PC that also works on Windows XP.","February 16","true","4.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"
