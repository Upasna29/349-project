Well... I’ve probably put in over 1000 hours of play into this glorious gem over the years. Incredibly detailed slider control over just about every relevant aspect of a country. You can micro-manage just about everything.  Such as, determining exactly which natural resources to exploit, how much money goes into building infrastructure, and which religion you want to convert your population too. Not a big fan of micromanagement? No problem! let the AI handle the areas you don’t want to bother with. Every decision matters and can have huge consequences. Take control over military research, including nuclear arsenals, naval, and land. Battles on land and sea have neat little animation scenes.\n\nNuclear conflicts are VERY satisfying. Reminds me fondly of the War Games movie in the 90s.\n\nThe game is a bit dated now, but still looks and feels nice on a new PC. Unfortunately does not support high resolutions but, once you get past this, it’s worth every penny and every minute in playtime.\n\nThere is really something quite satisfying about turning Gaza Strip and the West Bank into a global superpower! Or perhaps you would like to nuke Canada? Then this is for you.","April 18, 2014","true","0.6"," 142 of 173 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","142","173","0","10"

The epitome of being simple yet complex featuring economic control, politics and a lot of military options.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082417675/recommended/282400/","76561198082417675","Mr Monday","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082417675/","43 products in account","This game is unique to the genre because it has an Evolutionary Human Emulator (EHE). This is the name given to the game's AI. Each country in the game has it's own unique AI system, which evolves the more you play the game. Each country has certain priorities and takes actions according to the perceived outcome of its actions. As you play, the EHE "learns" new behaviors, drawing connections between actions it didn't know existed and updates previous connections. This EHE makes for very thrilling and unique situations the more you play.\n\nThere is a dedicated community that has been keeping the game up to date for the last 12 years. Taking into account the community mods available: the game is set in 2015, practically every nation in the world has updated GDP, population, military values, treaties and diplomatic relations. Also with mods, you can now fight Hezbollah, Taliban, Daesh/Islamic State, etc. There's also mods that set the world in WW2 or the Cold War, all these are also turned into multiplayer sessions.\n\nPlay in multiplayer matches with your friends and conquer the world together. Or play peacefully and manipulate the world through proxy-wars, espionage, subterfuge, black market funding, economic exploitation and diplomatic cunning.\n\nPlay in multiplayer matches with 20+ other world leaders and roleplay an international community as you wage cold wars, forge alliances and strive to develop into superpowers. In multiplayer matches, it is common for the host to set "rules" for the lobby to abide by, which keeps order and stability to the game world. When you have a good server with a good host, this game rivals that of any strategy multiplayer experience. If you're into geography, history, politics or current events, you'll love this game.\n\nPlay in singleplayer sandbox mode: design your own military units, transform the economy of Malawi to have the largest share of fruits and vegetables in the world, become a monarchy and ally with the royal families of the Arab world, start a pan-African/Middle-East Alliance to counter the global North, create covert ops cells to steal military secrets from China, research nuclear weapons, deploy and launch your ballistic missile subs off the coast of India, declare war and conquer your neighbors, then trade conquered territory to your allies, give money to the poorest nations of the world and watch them develop into regional powers, build attack helicopters and put them up for sale, force Israel to annex the West Bank and then watch WW3 unfold.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, you can set your own game speed. The pace really depends on you. The game technically never ends. So you can choose to get to year 2100 in two hours, or you can play for hours and only get to year 2030.\n\nThe learning curve is not as hard as you might think. It's way easier to learn than Europa Universalis or Dominions, if you ask me. It's not nearly as buggy as it is made out to be. Judging by its low-scores on IGN and Gamespot, you'd think this game would be unplayable; it's a complete exaggeration. The game is very much alive through its Steam and Gog communities. It also has fantastic modular support that allows many new features, such as changing your country's name in-game.\n\nThis game is actually one of the most powerful pieces of educational software available. If you're an educator, I highly recommend this game to you. Supposedly, this game has been used by governmental agencies worldwide. If you're a parent, buy this game for your children. I know of countless people who grew up with Civilization I & II or approached the game later in life and learned so much about history from it. This game has a very similar effect on people. Don't know the population of Bangladesh? Not for long. When you play this game, you'll learn quickly where all of the most populous countries are, who produces all of the world's tobacco, as well as the difference between Bahrain and Brunei. It's worth more than its price on Steam for just the reference/educational value alone. It's like a digital encyclopedia.\n\nThe depth of this game is a bit difficult to explain:\nThere's 193 default countries,\neach with up to ~30 territories/provinces,\neach territory/province has a production value for 24 different resources,\neach territory/province has a population that is divided into under 15, 15-65 and 65+,\neach of these population categories contributes to the territories consumption of resources,\neach of the resources is listed in the world market and traded with all of the other territories from all of the other countries in the world,\neach of the resources have a tax rate that is adjusted by the player,\neach of the countries have a dynamic economic ranking that id based upon them meeting their production/consumption ratio, political stability, human development level, etc. that determines their priority in the world trading list,\neach territory/province also has its own infrastructure and telecommunications level that is influencable by the player, each country in the world has it's own budget sliders for ~12 different spending options (health care, military research, education, tourism, etc.)\neach country has its own expenses based on debt, political corruption, imports, budget sliders, etc.\neach country has its own inflation rating, interest level, GDP/per capita, personal income tax\n....that's just economic\n\nWhen it comes to politics:\nEach of the 193 countries has its own approval, stability and corruption rating\nInternal laws (illegal/legal freedom of speech, child labour, polygamy, abortion, etc.)\nGovernment type (democracy, communist, theocracy, dictatorship, monarchy, etc.)\nCapitol city (can be relocated)\nLanguages\nReligions\nImmigration and Emigration\nPolitical parties\nTreaties which are divided into ~15 types\nDiplomatic relations with every other nation in the game (from -99 =biggest enemy, 99=best ally)\nThese diplomatic relations are influenced by the similarity between their religions, languages, government type and treaties.\nThese diplomatic relations determine everything from who the AI chooses to trade with, goes to war with, builds military units from, etc.\n\nThe military side of things are equally compelling...\n~12 unit designs (infantry, bombers, tanks, fighter jets, artillery, etc.)\n~12 stats for each unit (speed, stealth, missile damage, gun precision, armor, etc.)\n~10 levels of military technology (i.e. stealth 1, stealth 2, stealth 3, stealth 4, etc.)\nEach country has an infrastructure level that determines how many units it can build concurrently (infrastructure is determined on a territory/province basis and influencable by player decisions)\nEach country is automatically ranked for its worldwide competitive compared to every other country in the world\nEach type of unit can be named by the player\nEach unit can be sold to the world market\nEach unit can be trained up to three times\nEach unit can be build domestically or outsourced (built by an ally)\nEach unit can be merged into army stacks and moved anywhere on earth that you have military access to (regions you control or that of military allies)\nEach army stack can be sent into a battle\n\nI disagree that this game has a bad community, as other reviewers have said. I also disagree that the political, military and economic spheres lack depth.","November 25, 2015","true","552.4"," 70 of 73 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","70","73","4","4"

I love RTS strategy games and this one is quite interesting. I like the game for It's economic system and how the AI Doesn't completely fail in the economic side, unlike Supreme Ruler where the AI builds nothing but Tanks, jets, naval stuff, ect ect, this is quite fun. I have already put 44 hours into the game and in that amount of time, i managed to turn county's like the Congo and Israel into superpowers. It's not all about agression in this game, it's about getting on everyones good side. You can't just simply take a random country and just build tons of units and destroy the world. It takes time and i love the way it does it. You have to sometimes depend on other country's for aid and you have to work your way up bit by bit untill you can actually annex something.\n\n\nI love how the resources work, I mean, you don't have to manage resources all the time. You can get that all privitised and let your people expand it. That doesn't work all the time, you need to put some money into it so you can help your resources grow and the people will carry that duty on. Let's say Canada was the leader in Dairy production and you take that place, Canada will start to hate you and I love how it works.\n\nNukes, oh how I love them. They are not too over-powered, but yes they do pack a punch in this game. Nukes are quite cheap, depending on what nation you play as,but they take a long time to build and are quite expensive to maintain them. In packs, nukes can destroy populations and damage your enemy's resources heavily and turn military's to dust. Think before you use nukes, because using nukes will devistate your relations with other country's and if you use nukes in very small packs... Well, you will be better off throwing toothpicks at your enemy.\n\nHere's where it gets bad. This game wasn't really made for Windows 7 or 8 and so it tends to crash a little bit. There are bugs in the game where some country's are nothing but luck to try and set up for becoming a superpower. Like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rebels and some others. There's also a bug where you can't take certain land and so on. The game really does have some downfalls, sometimes relations tend to mess up. I got nuked by Russia and instead of people hating Russia, they started to hate me more. I don't understand this much, but it doesn't matter as long as you have a much more powerful military then your enemy's.\n\n\nIs it worth the price considering the bugs? YES! You might get annoyed from the bugs, but indeed it's a fun game. Very easy to get used to and you will always find new ways to beoming powers. If it's from economic domination to just pure agression.","November 9, 2014","true","225.9"," 60 of 65 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","60","65","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zevrow/recommended/282400/","zevrow","Zevrow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zevrow/","69 products in account","I have played this game for longer than I can remember, so much that I bought it as soon as I saw it on Steam without even considering where the money is coming from, a new type of Multiplayer has been added from the previous title with the help of Steam, this game was also Greenlit by the community, the game itself can be improved with much needed setting changes and most issues with startup can be prevented by allowing of the joshua.exe which may may see as a virus, of which of course it is not.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who plays games such as Europa Universalis IV, as its a Modern Day Simulation built on the basis of real information in the time it was set, on release before Steam it had bugs and so on, but doesn't every game? Which have been on a constant fix since the games release and reviews by gamers such as myself have decided to help bring this game forward with the hope of SuperPower 3.\n\nThe game itself focuses on the year 2001 start date, where you take a country in the world and forge an empire, either through your politics, economy or military, just remember that when you take over the world, there is nothing left to take over! The game itself is the sort of game that puts you into a Multiplayer experience unlike any other, where you can RolePlay (RP) country politics, such as terrorists in Iraq or Russia invades Ukraine like the real world, the game itself is a brilliant Modern Day Simulator and I have played literly every game in this time period and will say, this is the best I have ever seen, I just dream of the day of the release of SuperPower 3.\n\nHow can you go wrong for £7.19 - £8.99 or less, depending on what it is for this review? Usually they charge huge prices for games like this, its a bargain in my personal opinion.\n\nI hope to see you online!

First of all, the way battles are done in this game is crap. When you invade a country, what happens is all of your and the enemy country's troops move into the same spot and have one really large battle, after which your enemy's armies are completely obliterated (or yours if you screwed up), leaving you to capture all their points with little resistance. The interface for this game is also pretty bad; they tried to go for a minimalist approach, which would be good for a regular strategy game, but in a grand strategy game such as this you'd want as much information as reasonably possible on screen at the same time, which this game fails to do in a way that's not stupid (you get to open a bunch of windows that can get cluterred very easily, and it can sometimes take a lot of fighting with the interface to get to the information you want). There's very little flavor to the game as well; if you're coming from Paradox games like I did, or even from Creative Assembly games, both of which have a lot of historical flavor in their games, you might be a bit disappointed with what you see here. I guess there's a bit of flavor in the tutorial missions and in early game when the game has some startlingly plausible events take place based on the data within the game that was "taken from U.S. military and C.I.A. databases" as the box proudly proclaims (I've had a Pakistan vs. India war in my game, and have heard of stories of the Arab Spring happen in some people's games despite this game being released years before the Arab Spring took place), but other than that the game can get very boring very quick if you're in it for the flavor, unless you aren't looking for historical flavor in a history simulator.\n\nAlso, you're playing Russian Roulette if you buy this game to play it on a newer computer. Despite all the fixes, this game still refuses to work on newer computers, and getting any support is next to impossible from what I've seen. You'll also need to be connected to the internet just to start the thing.","March 29, 2015","false","12.4"," 40 of 57 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","40","57","3","1"

I thought it would be one of those games you get, play once, and then never touch it again, and I though; well I’d play that for two and a half hours so I guess it was worth it. I then went in and did the tutorial and then got into the game. Automatically I chose America, like most people who choose their home country, and at an instant I realized I was dead wrong, this game is absolutely amazing.\n\nIn this game you control one of over 150 countries; you manage their politics, economy, and military while dealing with debt, invasion, terrorism, natural disasters, and nuclear annihilation. Politics allow you to create treaties, change laws, and change your government (for instance democracy to communism). In your economy you will first have to get your country out of debt, then you have to manage your budget, inflation, interest, income tax, resource production, financial aid and agreements, and trade. Finally, military; your military can be either your life saver or your demise depending on your economy and diplomatic relations. In your military you can build, buy, sell, and deploy troops and vehicles. Besides that you can design your own units and research more technology for better stats on your designed units. If you are have a problem with another country why not strike them with your entire nuclear arsenal or send covert ops into their country and wreak havoc on their product and economy.\n\nBut this game isn't perfect. The games multiplayer doesn't run unless you open unsecure ports on your router. Your military can't invade a country unless your navy is 750 km away from your enemy’s shore, but if they have even a single boat within 1500 km of your navy you can't invade and occasionally the enemies ships don’t appear and you can't make a land invasion, which is beyond frustrating. But besides that I haven't run into to many other problems.\nSo is this game worth your $10? Yes. Would I recommend you wait until a sale? Not necessarily, it would be better if you did but this game is worth the full price. I've played this game for roughly 14 hours and t has become one of my favorites.","August 13, 2014","true","33.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","2"

This game is almost a genre of its own. My first game I thought I would start off playing as the Congo (Not to be confused with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, our big neighbor to the east) to give myself a bit of an extra challenge. It turns out that I accidentally picked the easiest country to play as in Sub-Saharan Africa. Compared to the DRotK's whopping GDP per Capita of 52$/year, the Congo seemed cozy at ~14k/capita/year. You don't need to know all of the terminology and the geography involved with Geo-Politics (although it does help) because the game has a tooltip function that is both concise and descriptive enough to be a very useful tool. One of my favorite aspects of the game has to be designing my own military units. Although the number of parts of designing the look of your unit is limited, modifying the stats is where the fun comes in. You can make your unit a cheap, low quality overall or high quality specific, or an expensive, all-around excellent machine. The detailed political system in the game models International organizations like the EU, NATO, WHO, and many, many, MANY others. And if that isn't enough, you can start your own! Finished developing your nation in Africa yet? Go ahead and start the African Union and limit membership to African nations only, and help your struggling brethren climb out of the hole that you yourself just emerged from. Then, form an alliance with your fellow African nations to form a strong military coalition that can threaten even NATO. Or, you can take advantage of the struggling nature of your fellow African nations and use your advantageous position and conquer them all and have all of Africa for yourself, you evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ;). Don't worry about the age of the game, the game, unlike others its age, has stayed compatible through the ages, and will work up to Windows 8 x64 (what I have), so do not fret. This game will run at maximum performance on your common everyday laptop (also what I have XD), so there is really no reason to not get it unless you are simply uninterested in the topic of the game. And hey! If you are a heathen 'Merican pig like me, this game will help you learn about foreign politics and also the good it could do for the US and the rest of the world if we trimmed our military budget down to a reasonable size, and began investing in healthcare and more foreign aid. :D 10/10 would play Turkey and get annexed by Iran, then launch my ICBM's from my last province and kill 90% of their population in a last-minute "♥♥♥♥ you too, buddy!" again.","June 4, 2014","true","126.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/282400/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","Bwee. This be similar to the grand strategy titles made by Paradox, except it is set in the present day and has no real time limit. Like those Paradox games, you can pick any country you choose and you more or less choose your own objectives. Unlike the Paradox games however, SP2 is chiefly a multiplayer game since the AI isn't very good and either brings countries to ruin or become completely outclassed by player-controlled countries to such a degree that there is little real challenge in solo games. Therefore if you are no fan of multiplayer, I would probably avoid this game.\n\nBut... the multiplayer can be pretty good in this game when you get a good group of players together, and there are enough people still playing this that you can get good games fairly often. However, if you are looking to play this game online, extensive knowledge of the nations you play and the modern world in general is pretty much required. Hosts for this game tend to be elitist and have few qualms about kicking and banning people who play 'unrealistically' in their games. While this may sound obnoxious (and it sorta is), this also helps keep games interesting rather than just devolving into world war nukefests that, while fun the first time, rapidly loses its appeal after that. In other words, the multiplayer for this game is ideal for people with in-depth knowledge about the modern geopolitical scene and are able to apply that knowledge to their gameplay.\n\nThe game itself is pretty solid and does not take too long to learn, but there are numerous issues. Aside from the AI being generally bad, runtime errors can ruin your fun and crash your game with virtually no warning. The world economy tends to destroy itself after a few decades, though mods try to fix this and are almost always used in multiplayer games. The game does send "mails" about high-priority events like economic problems or the use of nuclear weapons, but other events, such as when other nations start a nuclear program or even when wars break out, can slip by almost totally unnoticed.\n\nLastly, the game is lacking some critical elements that are major parts of the modern world, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that keeps almost every country in the world from building nuclear weapons. This is something that would be particularly useful for multiplayer games, where too many people build secret nuke stockpiles that can end up ruining games because the lack of information the game gives about them. This can result in a small nation building a giant nuke stockpile, and then using it, without anyone else having the faintest idea this was going on until it was too late. From my observations, secret nuclear stockpiles and their usage are a major cause for multiplayer games ending early, with few people wanting to play after a nuclear apocalypse.\n\nOverall, SP2 is a competent and deep multiplayer strategy game that, nevertheless, has enough glaring issues to lead me to suggest that anyone looking to buy this game should think carefully about it (and probably wait for a sale). When played right, it is an excellent game with endless amounts of replay value. But since these good games rely on every other player in the game not acting like a complete ♥♥♥♥, patience and a willingless to put up with some annoyances is also necessary to enjoy this game. But if you are able to endure all the irritants that this game and its players can throw your way, then you will find an often very fun experience awaiting you. :)","November 21, 2014","true","328.3"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

That said, there are some easy-mode almost cheaty things the game lets you do that can ruin the experience a bit. Civilian espionage is probably top of that list. It's far too easy right now to build a super-power from nothing by spying on the civilian sectors of larger countries that do not employ large spy networks. India and Taiwan are great examples. Spy a few times on each sector and suddenly you've got a trade surplus in those areas without having to make massive capital investments. That said, turning a tiny Pacific Island nation into a massive nuclear superpower is part of this game's attraction, so a little unrealism can be forgiven.","April 27, 2014","true","42.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

There is really no way to fail other than\nUnexpectedly get invaded by every other nation on earth because you are growing too powerful\nGet nuked by every other country that has nukes, without warning, because once again you have grown too powerful.\nIn Superpower 2, you could say that the difficulty has been ramped up exponentially.\nNATO, controlling over 1/3 of the countries, is extremely powerful and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ them off will have you bombarded with assassination and espianage attempts every fifteen seconds. If you try to invade a NATO country, this is exactly what will happen to you. It is very annoying.\nAdditionally, you have to really, really work hard to manage your resources as they will be the determining factor of economic growth. And thusly, how much stuff you can research and churn out of your factories.\n\nIf you are ethnically anything other than American or Chinese, and you want to see your ethnicity rule the world (or at least part of it) this game will be excruciatingly hard for you. You will definitely want to save after every invaded country. I have yet to make it past invading Slovenia as Hungary, simply because I'm getting roughly 50 messages every minute because of either the US, Germany, England or France throwing as many covert ops units as they can at me simply because I decided to redraw some borders.\n\nLike I said, it's very, very hard.","November 22, 2014","true","130.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/282400/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","When I first bought this game I was expecting something along the lines of DEFCON. I guess I got that, with a touch of civilization (minus the turn base), and ultimate control over diplomacy/markets.\n\nThis game is interesting to say the least, and was worth the buy ON SALE. This game as stated previous, gives you a world map (or the Earth in 3D) and you are allowed to choose a nation. With this nation you can build up your military, work your political magic, and look after your monetary situation. The military tab you are allowed to build anything that walks to anything that treads water to anything that may fly in the air. You can also customize vehicles which is a brilliant perk. In this tab is also covert military actions which allow you to manipulate political structures around the planet, and there is also a nuclear launch missile control available as well. Onto the 2nd tab which is the political station, one can choose whether they want to be fascist, communist, socialist or whatever. You also get to decide internal laws such as same-sex marriage and can limit how many kids a family can have. The diverse control the game lets you take into your hands is amazing. Some would say it's better left to the computer (which you can have) and some say it's better to micro manage (which you can choose to have as well)! I like the fact you are given the chance to choose what you want. Within the third tab which is the monetary settings, you can literally choose what you want to fund down to the level. Want to enhance education? Go ahead? Want to fund the military, screw it and do it! You can build more nukes if you'd like, or heck start getting covert warfare going by hiring some spies and sending them to other countries. And yes, nuking is oddly satisfying but really can screw up your political reputation. What is another cool feature is that you can watch your units fight the opposing side in real time (double left click on the battle to see).\n\nAnother interesting feature is that anywhere in the world you can right click and do quick treaties, such as alliances, common markets, weapon trade (or even embargo), research partners (and a lot more choices - you can even annex countries).\n\nBUT.... (DEVS PAY ATTENTION HERE)!\n\nThe only few complaints I have is that you are not able to use the keyboard to quickly select which countries are in for what treaties, and can get extremely annoying using the mouse to select EVERYTHING (especially on the menus). Another complaint is that some countries are literally impossible to select. Even if you right click and attempt to do a quick treaty, sometimes if you try clicking on Israel you'll get Palestine. Same thing with Chile and Argentina.\n\n\nOverall good game. Would be even more intense if they let you control the units when you can watch them fight. I would give this game an 8 if it was something that was truly unique to it's genre. Even though it didn't hit an 8, I would recommend buying on sale and playing!\n\n7.65/10\n\n\nEDIT : Just had the game crash...

Many unit types are customizable for better battle performance and outcomes for the selected state. However in battle the player can not perform direct actions in the battle screen and is mearly the observer to the battle.\n\nPolitics: 9/10 - Limited in political details compared to games like Ruler of Nations and Masters of the Universe. But the game provides very indepth fields around the countries language and religious demographics, laws and government types. Although little is made in the changing of demographics, laws and governments except from saying Yes, No or Maybe. It does allow for a detailed and easy way for you to create your nation.\n\nEconomics: 9/10 - Amazing, indepth field of economics which allows the player to experience how the economics of any nation works. Through trading, diplomacy and domestic taxes, you can influence how your economy sways. Managing the budget can be tricky and challenging in various states, it is exciting and sometimes thrilling to compare various strategies and tactics which can improve the states economy.\n\nAudio: 9/10 - Dynamic music to the situation, losing, winning and nuclear war are the main music types.\n\nUI: 5/10 - Beautiful UI for the game type, however can be a bit quirky in situations. Where the movement of troops can be difficult and unpredictable where the units move several miles from the intended location.\n\nTechnical Side: 7/10 - Editor fails in stability and many stability and technical issues arise in the main game. Sometimes with many players experiencing game crashing on high-spec scenarios like nuclear war, dramatic economic changes or huge wars.\n\nModdability: 6/10 - Various mod types are available from historical scenarios to gameplay changes/additions to some fantasy and hypothetical scenarios, you can experience a game where Hitler wins or Communism is supreme. However the poor score is detailed because of its poor modding methods and editor, with its poor technical stability on modern computers and the extent of the moddability to scenarios only, it can limit potential and the lifespan of the game.\n\nCommunity: 5/10 - Although this is not directly affected by the game, there is a large community atlarge in this game. However do expect a lot of bitter members which vary.\n\nServers & multiplayer: 2/10 - I honestly enjoy Roleplaying servers and messing around with servers. But it is so difficult and awkward to start a server, it is not worth the trouble. And starting a public server risks potential hackers, trolls and generally unwanted visitors. Although you can enforce passwords and friends only, those threats can exist still.\n\nMain Points:\n\nThis game was made back in 2004, making the technology behind the game pretty old compared to modern standards, but with the games potential it proves superior among many other titles. But before considering buying the game, make sure to get into contact with other players to compare specs and computer technology to make sure the game will work on your machine.\n\nGreat Gameplay for a Political Simulation game which extends to Combat, Politics and Economy which can diversify depending on the nation you play as.\n\nAmazing dynamic audio which changes depending on the current situation of your state or the global situation.\n\nStability can be poor on modern computers and the modding editor will not work on Windows 8.\n\nServers can be hard to set up and not advisable for quick games with friends.\n\nImprovements:\n\nImprove upon the modding capabilities to allow for modern computers to be accepting to the capability. Meaning modern computers can use the editor or an alternative means to mod the game. And making sure the player can mod anything in the game, from scenario to UI to menus.\n\nImprove the servers by making sure a anti-cheat/hack system is installed and allowing for every player to create their own servers with players capable of joining.","July 22, 2014","true","461.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You can choose to be in charge of over 150 countries which are officially recognised by the United Nations before and on 2001. You can choose to be to control a small third world country on the verge of economic collapse, or you could be a well built and supreme booming first world country. There is no difficulty level on this game, it all depends on what country you choose to control. There is also multiplayer for the game, although not many people choose this option most likely due to the lack of players who play this game. You need to know before you do this, you can't just play it, understand it quickly and finish it quickly, this game requires a lot of concentration and understanding. You need to do the tutorials a few times to understand the game and how to perform will at the game. I recommend that if you don't like concentrating at a game for a few hours, you shouldn't really play this game. I really like this game and have enjoyed every single hour of it. I was skeptical of buying this game at first purely due to how old it was, but I was hooked within a few hours and absolutely love how you can conquer countries, research nuclear weapons, research weapons, become a superpower, build a massive economy, become a communist, military or even a monarchy state and much, much, much more can be done with this game. Here are my pros and cons quickly narrowed down.\n\nPROS:\n- Over 150+ countries to choose from.\n- Multiplayer.\n- Nuke other countries.\n- Research tanks, APC's, mobile launchers, air defences, bombers, fighter aircraft, attack aircraft, patrol boats, submarines etc. and then build them.\n- Watch how you crush other countries.\n- Annexing option to conquer countries is available.\n- LAN option.\n- Very cheap on some Steam sales.\n\nCONS:\n- Old graphics.\n- Some countries names and flags are outdated.\n- Sometimes some countries won't attack you or even bothering defending if you have an extremely strong military.\n- Infantry units are effectively useless.\n- Requires a lot of concentration and effort.\n- Multiplayer has very few players.\n\nOverall, very good game but requires a lot of concentration. 9/10.","April 10, 2015","true","358.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

I suggest getting into the Rp servers in this game as they tend to be more enjoyable(depending on how you want to play the game) while other superpower 2 games that are full conquest can be fun if you form a team to take over the world and form massive empires to later betray eachother if another player becomes more threatening.

It is riddled with an insane amount of bugs, often which make the game unplayable.\n\nThe user interface is shocking, unintuitive and incredbly basic. You are incredibly limited in what you do.\n\nThere is absolutely no realism, you set your taxes to 80% and you take a popularity hit - ride the wave out for a few months (with no negative effects) and then your back with high support and rolling in cash.\n\nThere is also no realism with "treaties" either. Want to enter the EU, but defy every requirement? No worries, just request to join and they will most likely accept.\n\nWarfare? Absolutely ridiculous. Disband your army, hire a new one with max stats and train them to be "elite". You can steamroll over the entirity of Europe (as Denmark) and the AI will constantly send small amounts of troops against your troops and destroy themselves with no need to even use and strategy. Occupy countries in seconds, force an annexation of all of europe and the whole world won't bat an eyelid.\n\nWant to get America out of debt quickly?

The game itself is pretty much that game you'd play if you want a political simulation roleplay. Pretty much, this game is more of a simplified Summer 2001 version of eRepublik. The modding in the game can be pretty hard if you don't know how to use the GL Editor right (since its full of errors) and the game can be quite laggy even on single player. However, if you want a good roleplay Poltiical simulator, this is the game for you, and honestly, I can't wait for more patches, and wait for the upcoming Superpower 3.

It styles itself as a geopolitical simulator, and that is exactly what it is, although it plays more like a grand strategy game akin to Europa Universalis IV or Hearts of Iron III or a mixture of every Paradox Interactive grand strategy game ever made (although it should be noted that one cannot simply assume the role of a dynasty or a character like in Crusader Kings II). It has a very fleshed out diplomacy, military, economic and politics system, and one can even create organisations like NATO or the UN through a treaty system. It is also possible for said treaties to collapse (In one game played hours before this review was written as Britain, NATO collapsed after America withdrew). The AI is very interesting and games are random (in the aforementioned game Pakistan ended up nuking India and invading, for example).\n\nThe one problem I have with this game is that there is a constant runtime error crash as of a recent update (I believe), and I am hoping that said crash will be fixed or a workaround found. I also want to congratulate Nordic Games on getting this great game on Steam.\n\nAll-in-all, I would recommend this game to anyone who has the money - it's an excellent purchase.","August 19, 2014","true","16.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

(No **** sherlock.)\n\nSuperpower 2 is unique. It has deep geographical technology which makes you zoom into the planet Earth to the point of seeing pixelated highways. While that may not be as cool as it sounds, look at the geography around it. Cool huh? But I am going to focus on the more 'economic' side of this game.\n\nSP2 goes in deep with the economic system of the country you picked, and the free will to change your country's market from state controlled, to mixed, to free market, which is pretty awesome considering you can almost take control of 6 sectors and either import or export the amount of the resource you have. Most games don't have such in-depth-ness-ness. You can adjust the spending of specific areas such as health care, education, infrastracture, environment, propaganda (If you plan to be a very, very evil country with a brainwashed populace.), and et cetera. You can adjust your interest levels and see how inflation is going in your country, and adjust the personal tax income to whatever you wish to get the most dough out of it, but it will always result in the cold shoulder of your populace, so be careful when you want to go over 60%.\n\nIf you like to focus on the political aspects of this game, there isn't really much for you other than either legalizing/illegalizing a few dilemmas such as freedom of demonstration, freedom of speech, same-sex marriage, woman suffrage, polygamy, etc. But there are also the religions and languages, which you can either allow (Meh reaction from the populace in this religion/language), outlaw (I DON'T WANT THIS LEADER ANYMORE! reaction), or officialize (LEADER 4 LIFE! reaction). You can also participate and make various treaties, where it is also possible for you to play as Turkey and join the European Union with the approval of the countries inside the treaty.\n\nYou don't like economic or political but the more military aspects of this game? Well then. NUKES! Yes. Who does not like nukes? I do like nukes. And so do you, probably. You can research military technology to make more military designs such as fighter aircraft, attack aircraft, tanks, bombers, infantry vehicles, artillery guns, and so on and so forth. There is also a ranking system that determines how strong you are compared to other nations, which is influenced by your technological prowess, which ranges from 1 to 10. If you plan to dominate the world with the US, best to start with a lvl. 10 technological level.\n\nAnd the most important thing?: There is multiplayer. FRIKKIN MULTIPLAYER!\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to anyone with a taste for taking control of a country and changing it around completely. The sky and the autarky bug are the limits! Maybe.\n\n10/10","December 25, 2014","true","148.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I really enjoy this game, I got addicted to it to the point of having to cool down from it. I played 21 hours straight as soon as I got the game. I found this game from /pol/, and I thought I'd give it a try. The generalization of the game is that you can pick any country recongnized by the UN from 2001, and then build up its economy and military power. You really have to be careful with the national budget as every country starts off in debt, meaning you have to instantly pull your country out of it and fast. Failure to do so in under 10 minutes and you're ♥♥♥♥ed. Aside from economy I mentioned military. You can custom build your own vehicles, how many of them you want, build you own nuclear missle defenses, the whole nine yards. You can also make and breattreaties, but be very cautious in doing so.

Players control countries in 3 major areas: political, economic and military, but this time, in a beautiful real-time 3D environment.\n\nPlayers build up their own countries and increase their influence in the broader world while competing against sophisticated A.I. Along the way, gamers make use of economic sanctions, political alliances, and military actions to wage their battles. SuperPower 2 offers the ability to fine-tune each country's performance, from creating or breaking treaties, to making tactical decisions in particular military conflicts.\n\nCreating a superpower from Haiti isn’t an easy task but it sure was a fun run, I recommend SuperPower2 to people that like world simulations or to people that wish they could run any country on earth in anyway they see fit.The number of options, the good graphics for the globe and almost limitless gameplay adds up a game that is worthy of United Nations attention.The world is beautifully rendered and is capable of giving a wide variety of thematic maps and the capability to drill down into any region.\n\nRULE YOUR COUNTRY, CONQUER YOUR ENEMIES, DOMINATE THE WORLD!","November 28, 2015","true","907.8"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","14","25","5","4"

My friend says that he'd play it over DEFCON, and with good reason. It's an RTS that has a great combination of economic, political, and military control for any nation of your choosing (The game takes place in the year 2001 though, so some nations may not have up-to-date flags, territory control, etc.).\n\nPros:\n\n-Play as ANY nation. Some nations are harder to develop than others, but if you'd like to make Nepal or Sierra Leone a world superpower, then you can do it.\n-Game makes you feel like you're actually running a country. Multiple layers of depth are found under economy, politics, and military tabs. You can control things as intricate as raising taxes of vegetables and fruit for your nation.\n-The battle system is pretty well designed, with multiple types of vehicles with different uses and statistics. You can even design your own mechanical weapons.\n-If you manage to find a multiplayer roleplay server, the experience is great\n\nCons:\n\n-The game doesn't come in full screen. It's not a huge issue to me, but devs said they're working on it for those who do mind.\n-The AI can act a little funky sometimes. Nations will sometimes declare war on nations 2 continents away for no reason.\n-I didn't find the game to be easily moddable, such as when I tried to install a "modern-day setting" mod that crashed the game upon startup. Maybe I did it wrong.\n-The multiplayer server lobby is glitched, with servers not being taken off the list despite them being shut down. I recommend going to the game's discussion site to find multiplayer servers.\n\nThe game is well worth the $10, and devs are currently working on fixing some bugs it has, so I'm looking forward to playing more.\n\n9/10","May 2, 2014","true","36.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I waited a few months for it, and when I got it, it wouldn’t work on my computer. I tried everything from patches to seeking advice from people who knew their way around a computer a lot better than me, but to no avail.\n\n4 years later though, in 2014, Superpower 2 is on steam, updated for windows 7 and 8.

This game is tough to get around with so many different options to change your country but once you've played a few hours it all sinks in. This game is well worth the money and I highly reccommend getting it. Just be warned, if you start nuking other countries, chances are, they will nuke you back...a long with every other country with nuclear missiles.

The  game seems to offer endless possibilities (especially when you're playing on a server with others), and each country you play as results in a different scenario each time.\n\nThis game gives you everything you would want in a geopolitical simulator, and more. Choose a country, build alliances (among other treaties), start wars, conquer land, control your economy, military, goverment, and of course, build nukes. While it can be slow to start off, you can even turn countries like Kenya into economical powerhouses with a stacked military. Many reviews make it seem like this is easy to do, and this can be offputting to those looking for a realistic simulator. In reality, it is only easy if you are willing to put your country in billions of dollars of debt and anger every country on Earth, and this will eventually backfire.\n\nDespite all this, the game does have a tricky interface. It's not exactly welcoming to new users, as there is a lot of menus and options to choose from, but this is expected in such a complex game. Of course, as many people complain, this game has its share of bugs, and your screen resolution can cut out most of the battle screen, but this is abosolutely not a reason to overlook this game.\n\nOverall, if you are going to buy this game, I reccomend that you do it with friends, because it makes things much more interesting, but singleplayer is fun as well. For the price of $10, you are easily getting a good deal.","August 16, 2014","true","36.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDarkWriter/recommended/282400/","TheDarkWriter","Alpha Inu Sakuya~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDarkWriter/","136 products in account","This is a fun game for the time in which it was created. The game finds its most charm in multiplayer where you can freely send nukes over the globe and bomb the hell out of your friends. However, there are a lot of problems that plague having full enjoyment of it otherwise. A lot of things need to be addressed for when SuperPower 3 comes out and I will address some of them here in my review.\n\nFirst and foremost, there needs to be a much better interface. There are a terms the game wants you to handle in this game that go on unexplained in the National Budget. Things such as inflation, global tax mod, telecommunications, education. Inflation in particular you're told is very bad and you want to keep it around 2%, but you're never told why and there is no visible effects of anything going bad in your economy even if you keep it around 10% for 50 years. Additionally the only way you're given to control it is the interest rate for your economy, which has a negative effect on it. So why would you ever mess with a good thing? The entire interface just needs an improvement altogether. I'd like to know how each bar directly effects the economy.\n\nSecondly, there needs to be popups for important events and a system that allows you to make certain events in the game popups and ignore the rest altogether. For example...I was hanging out as Israel and doing my thing. I had just reannexed the Gaza Strip and everything was going well. And then suddenly, the United States and China had declared war and nukes were flying over the globe. I would have loved to have a popup that would have paused the game in this instance so I could switch to slow-mode and watch the nukes fly and decide for myself after the damage whom to support and who to try to take land from. But as the game sits right now someone can declare war on you and invade your entire nation and you have no notification whatsoever. That's a thing that needs to be improved.\n\nTreaties need to be improved upon. There's not really a way for you to improve the relationships you have with other nations. Eventually if you wait long enough and no great wars are started, the positive effects of the EU and other treaties already in place at the start of the game will bring you to positive relations and will result in world peace. But I should be able to give money to any nation I want to bring relations up. And currently, there's no way to do that. Nations you have bad relations with will always have bad relations with you because they'll carry out hostile actions against you. The only way to fix it is to take em over and annex them, which pisses off the world and makes them do the same thing.\n\nFourthly, there needs to be a great wikipedia and a company web forum for this game to help with misunderstandings. This has the capacity to be a pretty complex game and people love them and would love to enjoy them. But even now there are things I don't understand like how to do naval bombardments and marine invasions. The game doesn't explain it to me in any way. I'd love to ask on web forums, except none exist. I'd love to check a wikipedia, but the one existing is sorely lacking on almost all subjects. So that needs to be improved.\n\nAll in all, SuperPower 2 is not a great Geopolitical Simulator. It's a game that finds its most charm in nuking your friends online as a Wargame. So if you're into that, you'll find a lot of fun in this tame. Go for it!","April 26, 2014","true","11.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Been playing it a long time, before there was a steam edition. It's totally worth the money, even though there are a few issues with it.\n\nPros:\n\n* Tons of gameplay hours, and it never gets boring. There are always challenges and other ways to do things.\n* Good AI that makes the game very realistic\n* Uses real life data in politics, forces and financial data. (Although the numbers are from 2001)\n* Many mods avaible. Best one in my opinion is from Mr.Monday. He has made a mod that updates the game to our current world time.\n* One of a kind game. Great value for money\n\nCons:\n\n* Game could use a update, as it still starts in 2001 and therefor has outdated financial, politics, and forces situations.\n* Game WILL crash! from time to time... Remember to set autosave interval low (5 or 10 minutes)\n* To actually take over the world without cheating is next to impossible!\n* Moving troops over sea areas is... tricky and full of bugs.\n\nI hope that with this steam edition, the game will be brought back to life, and that we will see new updates, mods and maybe even a Super Power 3 game. I absolutely love this game, but it does need some work before it's perfect.","May 23, 2015","true","12.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This could of been it but it feels like a half finished game. I think the crashing mentioned in most reviews has been mostly fixed in patches but you do need a very good PC which seems strange since its basically a 2D game.\n\nThe reason I think it seems half finished is because there are some glaring interface flaws which should not be there in a modern game. These will really put off new players that may of enjoyed the game but will leave it feeling frustrated.\n\nOne of the most obvious things that could of been improved and would of made a bit difference for the time invested is moving across oceans. It doesnt say it anywhere I saw but you need a destroyer or cruiser to do so. If you dont have one you will just be trying and trying to move them and they wont move across the water. To make it worse the game has two beeps. One for succesful movement and one for an error. Sometimes it will play both noises!\n\nOn the whole I enjoyed this game simply because it inspired me to make my own version. It was a great concept excetud Ok but it could of been so much better with some proper playtesting and refining.","March 11","true","24.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Nuking Israel is always fun, though. The game gives you a bit of options regarding laws and systems of government to choose from, these are always nice. Though, I've noticed that there are virtually no real 'right-wing' parties to choose from, I feel as though the political side of this game is heavily biased towards the left. For some reason the official language of Iraq is Kurdish? There may be some other things the developers are biased towards that I have not encountered.\n\nI can live with the things mentioned above especially since I get to ban certain languages, parties, and laws, however, the game is unplayable, it crashes if you nuke a country and it crashes constantly for no particular reason (please note that this may not be experienced by some people). The game has some game-breaking bugs such as not being able to take the capital of some countries because the unit has not been fully deployed and it never will be, you can always get over that by playing LAN and removing the unit from the capital then switching back to your original nation to capture the capital; but the point is that this game should have been released when the bugs/crashes have been looked through and fixed. Evidentally, the developers can't be bothered releasing fixes and as such, do not currently deserve the $10 they're asking for.\n\nI will happily change this review to 'recommend' once the game is playable.","February 5","false","31.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

My review mostly compares the game to it's state prior to the steam "special" version.\n\nUtterly horrible. I bet most of the thumbs up reviews come from the fanboys that helped this trainwreck greenlighted in the first place.\n\nRight of the bat before I even beginn playing (or try to play...), I find out that the game only runs in windowed mode. After reading some threads on the game's steam forums, I find out that this is intentional because the game is so broken that it's devs can't even get this "new and improved" steam version of the game to run properly in fullscreen mode. Afterward, I got to play the game for like 5 min before it crashed.\n\nI also hear that the editor which is suppose to be a new feature is broken and doesn't work, though I haven't tested that myself. Really the whole idea that this is suppose to be a "new and an improved version" is just laughable.\n\nAs for the actual game, it is still the same pile of ♥♥♥♥ that it was before it came on steam. The AI is bad, the economy makes no sense (you can have insane income taxes without any real long-term penalties, basically removing lots of the challange out of the game), war is dull and not fun. This is really just a very bad game, and how this series even has fans is beyond me.\n\nDon't listen to the thumbs up reviews, they probably just come from the same small minority that got this pile of garbage greenlight in the first place.\n\nI am not even kidding, this is one of the first games in a long while that actually gave me buyer's remorse  in-spite of costing only 10 bucks.\n\nAvoid this disaster of a game at all costs.","May 21, 2014","false","0.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","2"

Every 5-20 minutes, SuperPower 2 crashes out with a C++ runtime error; and diagnosing the problem appears to be isolated into a medium of witchcraft across the internet. Some people can fix it with mundane solutions; re-install the VC redists, or simply restart Steam - others however, unfortunately including myself, have had no such luck.\n\nTested on two machines; PC (i7 5820K, 16GB DDR4, 3x GTX980), and a Laptop (i7 3770K, 12GB DDR3, GTX675M). The only similarity between the two being that both machines are used for development; and have fully up-to-date redists / libraries.\n\nThe game seems to boast a lot of depth - and albeit it's a little aged at this point (and it's a little sad to play as Ireland before the economy with ♥♥♥♥ up), its level of complexity would be fitting for anyone looking to sink days/weeks/months into developing a third world Country into a superpower.. or turning France into a monarch which has banned cereal. If their machine is in the lucky configuration set that won't non-stop crash out.","April 29, 2015","false","3.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Having lost both games over time for one reason or another, I decided to purchase Superpower 2 for Steam for nostalgic purposes. What I encountered was a little underwhelming.\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, realism pretty much flies out the door with this one. One time I played as Croatia and, after an hour of play, had China randomly invade and annex me. In another game I watched online, Italy invaded and annexed China, then started eating up African countries, with no one in the world seemingly caring. I know there are realism mods out there, but as is, the game leaves much to be desired in this regard.\n\nRelated to this is how the game's mechanics react to your decisions. Example: I started with a multi-party democracy nation with basic political freedoms, and then - practically overnight - outlawed every religion and language except one, removed freedom of contraception, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, then transformed the government into a military dictatorship. You know what the drop in popular support was? MAYBE like 5%. I'm not kidding. It went back to normal after a while. Government stability didn't take a hit either. I had done this to see just how insane my nation would go, but discovered that it didn't do anything even negative in the short-term. For a supposed geopolitical simulator, that's a bit lacking.\n\nOne of the most aggravating aspects of this game is the economic model. At first glance, it can seem like a wonderful simulation of the world trade, but after trying to figure the thing out...I just can't make a surplus. Well, to be fair, I did once, but I don't even remember how I did it. I've tried various methods, and I've read tutorials online on how to set up your economy, but nothing seems to work. I've dealt with the economic models in other games from a variety of developers, and even if they were at first difficult, I managed to figure them out after a while. SP2, however, has a model that will aggravate the casual gamer and give them headaches, trying to figure out how to keep those numbers from getting red again.\n\nOne of the few things I appreciate about this game is the way wars and armies are done. Unlike SP1, which were a bit more clustered and limited to various cities, you can move armies around the map like you could in real life, and let them engage across a wider front. It's fun to see the symbols flying around on the spec-ops-style map, and watch the battles between two sides unfold.\n\nIs SP2 worth purchasing? I honestly don't think it's worth even $10. It can be that one game you take out every year and play for a while, before you remember why you uninstalled it in the first place, but it probably won't be something you play on a regular basis.","September 24, 2014","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love RTS strategy games and this one is quite interesting. I like the game for It's economic system and how the AI Doesn't completely fail in the economic side, unlike Supreme Ruler where the AI builds nothing but Tanks, jets, naval stuff, ect ect, this is quite fun. I have already put 44 hours into the game and in that amount of time, i managed to turn county's like the Congo and Israel into superpowers. It's not all about agression in this game, it's about getting on everyones good side. You can't just simply take a random country and just build tons of units and destroy the world. It takes time and i love the way it does it. You have to sometimes depend on other country's for aid and you have to work your way up bit by bit untill you can actually annex something.\n\n\nI love how the resources work, I mean, you don't have to manage resources all the time. You can get that all privitised and let your people expand it. That doesn't work all the time, you need to put some money into it so you can help your resources grow and the people will carry that duty on. Let's say Canada was the leader in Dairy production and you take that place, Canada will start to hate you and I love how it works.\n\nNukes, oh how I love them. They are not too over-powered, but yes they do pack a punch in this game. Nukes are quite cheap, depending on what nation you play as,but they take a long time to build and are quite exspensive to maintain them. In packs, nukes can destroy populations and dammage your enemy's resources heavily and turn military's to dust. Think before you use nukes, cause using nukes will devistate your relations with other country's and if you use nukes in very small packs... Well, you will be better off throwing toothpicks at your enemy.\n\nHere's where it gets bad. This game wasn't really made for Windows 7 or 8 and so it tends to crash a little bit. There are bugs in the game where some country's are nothing but luck to try and set up for becoming a superpower. Like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rebles and some others. There's also a bug where you can't take certain land and so on. The game really does have some downfalls, sometimes to relations tend to mess up. I got nuked by Russia and instead of people hating Russia, they started to hate me more. I don't understand this much, but it doesn't matter aslong as you have a much more powerful military then your enemy's.\n\n\nIs it worth the price considering the bugs? YES! You might get annoyed from the bugs, but indeed it's a fun game. Very easy to get used to and you will always find new ways to beoming powers. If it's from economic domination to just pure agression.","January 26, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a supposed geopolitical simulator, that's a bit lacking.\n\nOne of the most aggravating aspects of this game is the economic model. At first glance, it can seem like a wonderful simulation of the world trade, but after trying to figure the thing out...I just can't make a surplus. Well, to be fair, I did once, but I don't even remember how I did it. I've tried various methods, and I've read tutorials online on how to set up your economy, but nothing seems to work. I've dealt with the economic models in other games from a variety of developers, and even if they were at first difficult, I managed to figure them out after a while. SP2, however, has a model that will aggravate the casual gamer and give them headaches, trying to figure out how to keep those numbers from getting red again.\n\nOne of the few things I appreciate about this game is the way wars and armies are done. Unlike SP1, which were a bit more clustered and limited to various cities, you can move armies around the map like you could in real life, and let them engage across a wider front. It's fun to see the symbols flying around on the spec-ops-style map, and watch the battles between two sides unfold.\n\nIs SP2 worth purchasing? I honestly don't think it's worth even $10. It can be that one game you take out every year and play for a while, before you remember why you uninstalled it in the first place, but it probably won't be something you play on a regular basis.","September 24, 2014","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For people who said I didn't play the game enough for a fair review, I purchased the game back in 2001, I have seen plenty of this game.\n\nWhat changed my mind about the playability of this game was not the developer, who re-released this game for a quick cash grab on steam without fixing major issues, and it wasn't fan boys coming to leave little angry comments about my subjective opinion of their favowite game.\n\nNo, it was the 2015 Realism mod. This excellent mod not only updates the game to 2015, but adds the balance, depth and ai common sense I would expect from a game that purports to be an Information-Age global simulation. As such there are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. The game allows you to delegate decisions about economic, political, or military matters to the AI. This means the game allows you to get as general or focused as you want without having those other areas fall apart. For those confused by the game I would recommend utilizing and observing the AI behavior and slowly getting more involved.\n2. The game (for me at least) has some delay in when it reports feedbackback, particularly involving money. This means that you have to sometimes be a bit patient and wait for changes to register.\n3. Single player is merely a primer for what is actually a gigantic united nations simulator community on the multiplayer servers. The real reward for learning this game is to play against more challenging human opponents, but be warned that they take roleplay kind of seriously on most servers.\n\nSo in conclusion, the 2015 Realism mod makes this game playable. The game runs stable for me, and seems well optomized. If you like grand strategy titles you should enjoy yourself. Multiplayer is where the real challenge is. If you can't see yourself enjoying geeking out with foreign policy nerds on rp servers, or dealing with some of the learning curve issues, steer clear.","November 8, 2014","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

Nevertheless, playing this ideally structured game has improved my social study grades and entertainment as well. I remember when I first purchased Superpower 2 when it was released in 2004 while I was entering my years in High School and learned quickly how well the game has improved. The issues, however, my computer previously at the time couldn't operate the game well due to a lack in SD RAM (at the time). Other than my unforunate hardware issues, the game also had a slight crash issue with Joshua (which has improved) and allowed the game to run more effeciently.\n\nThe Multiplayer Community is creative, fun to roleplay with, and retrospective depending on the person. I have learned a wider array of global awareness while learning the essential's to SP2 RP'ing games. The game by far became at its' peak of entertainment when people fabricated real world like scenarios such as economic embargo's to foreign invasion. Don't mind me forgetting the radioactive fireworks (nukes). The game has so much potential in even increasing more and possible being recreated into a new geo-political getaway.\n\n","April 30, 2014","true","353.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am going to say they are pretty damn good. The Globe is amazing looking, in my opinion. There are not really any graphics like you would see in a FPS, or any other RTS games. They just arent needed for this game.\nBut, with the graphics that are there, 8/10.\n\nGameplay\n_______\nThis is one of the most advanced Grand Strategies games I have ever played. The ammount of work you need to put into this to learn, is pretty damn high. You have to learn where to put your: Interest Rate to counter deflation, your personal income tax, your global tax mod, your task mod for resources, and much more. This is hard to learn at first, I am still learning of course... But, after 2 hours of playing around with Economics, I pretty much found the sweet spots for China. The military aspect has you: Commanding troops, building troops, building a design out of templates(not that advanced, but still pretty cool) and picking your upgrades. This includes Strategic weapons!. Also, politics are controlled by you. You must: Keep high diplomatic relations with other nations(keeps from being invaded), refrain from using nukes as it causes everyone to hate you(but whats the fun of that :P) and a little more. I like setting AI agressiveness to max...\nOverall I think the gameplay aspect gets a 9/10 for me.\n\nBugs\n_____\nI couldn't find any bugs, but I only played 2 1/2 hours. I have not played enough to give my humbe opinion on bug status.\n?/10\n\nAnyway.\nOverall for me is 9/10. Sounds are pretty good to me in this game also.\nI would recommend the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game to anyone who loves Grand Strategy Games( Also recommend Victoria II, EU IV, Hearts of Iron series, although these games are not as advanced.)

If you go to your conventional forces you see it listed - "ready", but it's nowhere on the map and you cannot drag it onto the map.  The only thing you can do is disband or sell it.  What is the point of training a unit that you cannot use?  The listed location is always something like "password xxxx".  WTH does that mean???  It looks like a bug to me.\n\nAdditionally, units will not merge properly.  As much as you try to put together large fleets and combined forces, once you merge the units together, you discover they really do not merge.  They just stack on top of each other.  You click the icon to see the unit list and only some of the units are listed.  It's soooo annoying!\n\nThere is no counterintelligence ability to stop other counries from sabatoging you and assasinating your people.\n\nThe trade agreements seem to fail 99% of the time, even if you offer the other country favorable terms.\n\nThis game is just a mess.

I have yet to get around it.\n\nThis is a time consuming game....one of those that you leave running while you sleep if things are looking good.

I just wish the developers would fix as it could be a great game otherwise. Would only suggest it is purchased when heavily discounted.

There isn't anything like having revolutions force government changes, seperatists breaking away from the nation and forming their own or joining another nation, and combat is really just putting all of your forces into one giant glob and fighting the enemies forces which is just one giant glob then occupying their whole territory and just freeing their regions until everybody loves you then annexing the territory. But even though there are these two bigish issues the game still has a lot of good content in it, and I would recommend looking up videos of it before buying or not buying it.\n\nEdit: In the game's current state on steam I cannot recommend this anymore. The battles can't be exited out of, forcing you to watch until the end before you can exit, and sometimes the entire world will get extremely angry at you for no reason at all (i.e attacking a country everyone hates then everyone declares war on you for attacking said country)","November 7, 2015","false","100.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
