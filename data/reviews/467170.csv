I've only played the hand-made puzzles so far, but enjoyed them thoroughly. Movement is what I would describe as a turn-based platformer, where gravity still affects you, but timing is unimportant. Levels are brief but challenging, and starting over never feels too frusterating.\n\nDon't expect too much content, I believe there were 8 hand-made levels. However if you are into the procedural portion as well, that's endless;) on top of that I wouldn't be surprized if several more levels get added with time, we'll see.\n\nAs it is, an hours worth of puzzling is definitely worth the cup of coffee you're buying the dev, so definitely give it a try if you like casual puzzlers.","May 30","true","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
