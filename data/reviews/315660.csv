If you like to download mods, you will have to PAY[www.auran.com] for a 1st class ticket to remove the download caps from their proprietary Download Station[www.auran.com] (subscription is $10 for 1 month, $15 for 3 month, or $35 for 1 year).  Bloody Blokes!  And I'm pretty certain the modders are not receiving any of those funds.  If you do not have a 1st class ticket, your number of downloads are limited each month and the download speed is HEAVILY capped (my speed is around 4.80 KB/sec; that's slower than dial-up speed folks; you'll have babies, watch them graduate from college, and have children of their own before anything downloads via the Trainz content manager).  Also, as long as the Trainz content manager is downloading something, Steam says you are in-game.  As a result, you will not be able to play any other game in your Steam library while Trainz is taking 3 hours to download a tiny file.  Both the Trainz Download Station and Content Manager are absolutely horrible in comparison to the Steam Workshop.  I will change my review to a thumbs up if they remove the capped download speeds without paying for a subscription.  Aside from that, this simulator is great and a must have for anyone who loves trains and doesn't care about mods.","December 27, 2015","false","21.1"," 163 of 180 people (91%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","91","163","180","13","11"

I am not going to repeat the hundreds of bad comments people made about the game, but I will say that I agree with almost all of them.

This must be developer speak for 'most feature we wanted to put in at this time and mostly working'. Don't be fooled, you are not buying a complete game with content. It's more like a game engine + some demo levels in various states of completion.\n\nAlso, do not buy unless you have a good internet connection.. every new iteration comes in at 8Gb or so and I am expecting a few to come. There's no smart updating.\n\nFurther, be aware that the Trainz developers are seemingly not interested in any element of normal convention in games. Easy to learn, hard to master... proper feedback (you'll get points added or deducted without explanation).. gentle on mistakes: you will find non of that.\n\nPass a red signal by a hair and after having played for 3 hours... the session will end - a subtle fade to black and that's it. Sorry you should have saved... which deducts points from your session, so you can't get to that 5 star rating. But don't worry there's a DLC coming with proper sessions!!!\n\nI found the same attitude in buying a first class ticket. You pay and you will not get an email to say we will activate this in 5 minutes or 10 hours... just give the money and they'll do their best... presumably.\n\nFor those that know Trainz like myself off and on since TRS2004.. This is no new era... it's same old, same old. You'll know what you're in for, except I think community development has slowed down.On the positive, it looks a bit better and I like the new guidance for sessions and what to do, where to stop, .. but it needs refining. I got completely stuck a couple of times, with no chance of recovery.\n\nThe best bit I found is the enormously impressive 400 or something miles London - Edinburgh line... which wasn't really done by the dev team anyway. It lacks a bit in sessions and rolling stock through it.. but if the game was finished, had a bit more gentle gameplay and more play-tested content .. it could be a massive showcase. It also basks England in an almost Queensland (Australia) like spring-summer hot weather haze that is just beautiful. It runs very decent on my GTX970 at 2560x1024.\n\nThe trains also seem to break and accelerate very realistically and it's pretty cool to moderate your speed so you loose the least amount of time being behind a slower train in front. However issues with such as the AWS not always switching off and many niggles throw dirt on this feast. Zoom in map does not work when coming from cabin view, floating repeating houses in scenarios. the cabin and HUD disappearing / restarting... and lots of irritating ALPHA-BETA kind of stuff. A letdown and a really I think just unwise communication of the team to declare the game release ready. The engine may now be getting there, the game is certainly far from being a game.\n\nIn the end, I think this team is mostly let down by poor setting of expectations (Look at Dirt Rally to see what BETA means!!), lack of content, and a lack of focus on gameplay... with as a result that I think it misses the mark for many. This is disappointing for all of us wanting a great realistic train sim that we can actually ENJOY. The reactions surely will also be a disappointing lack of love for all the effort put in by the devs. Features just don't make a great game. Let's hope we'll see lot's of improvement in polish, gameplay and a dose of realism in the team's communication.\n","May 17, 2015","false","34.7"," 104 of 121 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","104","121","4","8"

Despite the much hyped new graphics engine it's necessary to turn off virtually all shadows and water effects to get even a half decent performance (and then it's still sluggish). Without the extra effects it looks no better than its prececessor (TS12) but manages to run worse.\n\nUnder the hood it's still just the same old Trainz with a few enhancements, such as track which draws points with proper switches and frogs (MSTS had those in 2001) plus superelevation (Railworks-TS20xx had that some years ago). Buy the standard version and you get a route which is virtually unplayable (Hinton) due to lag, a reasonable Aussie route, the behemoth Kings Cross to Edinburgh which despite the scope of the venture came ten years too late and looks state of the art for 2004 (but still runs like a slug on the N3V graphics engine). That leaves Kickstarter County, effectively a small demo layout but compared to the plethora of routes from previous versions is very paltry selection. Word is, N3V didn't want to pay content builders to supply routes or assets and it shows.\n\nAlthough there is supposed to be advance despatcher functions in the pipeline, operations are pretty much as in all previous versions. Except for pre-scripted scenarios which seem to be in the purview of a select few who now how to script them, you just plonk your train down and do glorified free roam. Nothing approximating the MSTS activity editor or RW-TS scenario tools.\n\nDon't even think about trying to run this on a laptop. I just had mine perform a thermal shut down while working on a small test route. Okay it's only an I3 but it can run the RW-TS editor (or MSTS) for an extended period and nothing like that has ever happened - heck even TS12 didn't nearly set it on fire.\n\nA disappointing end to what promised to be a genuine breath of fresh air on the train sim scene. The Dovetail TS20xx has nothing to worry about from this competition unless N3V can set to over the next few months, get some new coding talent in and turn this poorly optimised mess into something resembling what they promised and for which many KS backers (not me, I was a bit more savvy and saw this coming) many AUS$1000's. If the Dovies can push on and release their UE4 sim in a couple of years, Trainz will be dead and buried.","May 16, 2015","false","258.0"," 65 of 79 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","65","79","4","1"

Talk about lipstick on a pig. This "New era" they're talking about is identical to the old era, with a tiny improvement in graphics and a huge decrease in performance.

This isn't it.\n\nP.S - For full disclosure I will state that I did not play the game for 17 hous, like steam says.

This review is based on the latest version as of 14-06-2015, and my list of gripes are:\n\n* It looks nothing like the Kickstarter 'teaser' video we were shown.\n* Performance is terrible, I have to turn down all the settings and run at a resolution smaller than my default 1920x1080 desktop just to get 30FPS. I have a GeForce 760 and at max settings your lucky to get out of single digit frame rates and this is with basically nothing on screen. See my screenshot gallery for images.\n* Stuttering as the camera moves around the world due to resource loading. Which has got better with the latest version.\n* Culling of objects is bad, just rotating your view and things will pop in and out.\n* Varied object quality. Most objects seem as if they are pulled straight from previous versions of Trainz, and even the new ones are inconsistent with some rail cars allowing running numbers and some not. Texture resolutions are mixed ruining the look.\n* The supposed main improvment, that of 'real' switches, doesn't even work most of the time.\n* I dislike the UI they use, a lot of thumbnail images they use aren't even at the correct aspect ratio and are blurred, making it look unprofessional.\n\nI could go on, but it's depressing to do so.

On forums I saw some suggestion as to how one could switch from one train to another - it was cumbersome and didn't work. I asked directly on the TS2015 forum and no-one could give me an answer.\nWIth TS2015 - I could only swap "free roam" locos if they were close to each other - and if I did select a second loco, the the first one simply stopped moving.\n\nWent on a TANE forum and asked the same question. Had a same-day answer - that the functionality I wanted was available and easy to use.\n\nWas a little doubtful if it really would work.\n\nHave also seen concerns about frame rate etc with TANE, but decided to give it a go.\n\nHave run through the tutorials - and I'm fine with frame rate and general presentation. I have an NVIDIA 570GTX graphics card - which was deemed good 4 years ago - but if I upgrade, I'm sure I could get better performance now.\n\nThe critical issue for me is the ability to develop the equivalent of a large train set,  that I create,  and where I can drive different locos  at the same time, where I want to, and at the speed I choose for each loco.\n\nAs indicated it's early days for me - there are numerous tools to learn (as indeed with TS2015 ) but that can come in the weeks ahead.\n\nThe key test was yesterday. Without any study of the manual or on-line help etc, I went into surveyor mode - and created 3 separate tracks - one roughly oval with one set of points leading to a side track and the other two were just single curved lines of track.\nI put locos and on each track.\n\nI started one loco - at slow speed, selected another from a simple menu - and started that at a quicker speed.\nI started a 3rd loco at another speed and moved it in and out of the siding from the oval track.\n\nIt all worked - 3 locos running at different speeds that I can control.\n\nFrom a simple menu I can jump to different parts of my layout - to wherever my locos are present- and I can get control of any one of them without impacting on the other locos which continue to move around at whatever speed I've set for them. Effectively 3 locos in "free roam" that I can control easily and independently.\n\nAs indicated above, there is an incredible amount to learn - both TANE and TS2015 are impressive, but the "free roam" functionality is what I wanted. Rather than simply drive up and down long albeit impressive routes created by others, the magic for me comes from creating my own railway.\n\nTANE offers this to me.\n\nI was fortunate to purchase this game on cyber-Monday for £15.\n\nIt's worth a lot more.\n\nOver the years I've pondered whether to invest in a model train set. Locos here might be around £100 each. A spend of around £1000 or more might give  me a good layout with a few locos, track, buildings and scenery etc but would seem very restricted to what I can get with a computer program. There is infinite potential if I want to explore it.\n\nThe base cost for TANE and TS2015 (now TS2016) is very small - I'd encourage anyone to buy both and see what aspects appeal.\n\nAs I said above - for me, the "free roam"  capability is critical. As I understand it, TS2015/6 claim that most users don't want "free roam". That surprises me - but the bottom line is that I do.\n\nHENCE I will be staying with TANE and spending a lot of time on it in the months (and years?) ahead.\n\nI'm happy that TANE can offer what I want - and I'll now invest the time with manual and any other source of learning that I can find.\n\nSubject to anyone checking their computer spec and their graphics card in particular, I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in trains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","December 4, 2015","true","222.5"," 40 of 54 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","40","54","4","2"

After more than a year in development and after a full refurbishment of the game's core engine, disappointment couldn't be anywhere as high as it is at the moment.\n\nWhat went wrong? Wasn't supposed for this to be a New Era? Yes. There are tests that show how much potential has been inserted into T:ANE, but, unfortunately, it came out with one huge flaw: A huge quantity over quality content.\n\nThere are some few assets that really uses A BIT of what the new engine is capable of in terms of visual perks. Also, there's very few content that uses the new technologies implemented into this game. If you haven't read the 4 basic kickstarter goals and understand what features each one has, you'll probably miss out the point of T:ANE.\n\nRemove those "new" assets and all you get is the classic Trainz we've got used to since... 2004. Old trains, old buildings, old splines... pretty much old everything, or at least how the assets were designed and modeled couldn't be anywhere more close to how things were done in the past. The quantity of assets doesn't complement the very lack of quality.\n\nThink of it like this. Would you buy Dovetail Games Train Simulator 2015 with nothing more than the routes from the old Microsoft Train Simulator, all with the old assets as well? No? Then that's what T:ANE is right now: An high tech refrigerator full of rotten food. So much that the door finds it hard to even close.\n\nAnd when we get to routes, the story seems to be the same. They are, really, BIG and LONG, but get into the cab and, besides the old assets they still rely on, you'll probably find it hard to find much detail anywhere near the track. Routes feel empty and deserted, and even with full cities with street signs and public lights, it still feels like riding trains on a small desert populated by cubes of very low resolution textures and a sea of SpeedTrees a few dozens of meters away from the track.\n\nComparing, for example, Ipswich from T:ANE to Ipswich on DTG TS2015, you'll find a complete lack of attention to detail and of original assets. Everything seems to be recycled of anything already available, or are very original assets... which also look rubbish.\n\nTechnologies like new shadders, new effects and superelevated track are not explored in any of the routes available. Only a few number of track do have the new technology of procedural junctions. Only two locomotives have been fine tuned, and one had a cab overhaul, while everything else still work and feels like toy trains on a scale model railway.\n\nAnd, to finish, the UI... HUD... in a era of Metro Language and Minimal Design, the graphical menus from T:ANE couldn't look anywhere more terrible than this. And it is amazing how the same low-res fonts are still in use after more than 10 years on the market! Has N3V forgot to hire a graphics designer!? Because, as a designer, everything since Trainz 2009, in what concerns the UI, looks like a grenade explosion right in front of my eyes!\n\nThe amount of scripts... urgh...\n\nMultiplayer is also available on T:ANE so... if you fancy that, here's something that only OpenRails features at the moment.\n\nTo make it short, T:ANE has a lot of potential. Now, does it explore that potential? The answer is: No.\nUntil N3V picks up a version of T:ANE with zero assets installed and starts doing a route and trains from scratch, it will never be able to convince the skeptics, and make the fans happy.\nThe menus are still the same horrible mess. If they are trying to compete with A-Train 9 for UI complexity and quality, they're winning!\n\nTo sum up, a question: Are you a 3D modeller and content developer?\n\nIf yes: Buy T:ANE. The N3V wiki has everything needed to explore the new technology and the community has lots of tutorials to do high quality content for Trainz. You'll be delighted with the results you'll get once you start to export content to T:ANE.\n\nIf not: Maybe you'll should keep the money from when there's something worth the attention. People will probably be adding new free and payable DLC which will change the face of T:ANE. Once there's enough content with quality that brightens your eyes, it might be a good time to get T:ANE. Until then, let things settle down.","May 26, 2015","true","8.1"," 37 of 52 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","37","52","5","0"

I don't know where to start with how cr*p this is, it feels like you're playing with a train set with an onboard camera rather than driving a real train, the train control is just wrong.  They seem to be very proud of their graphics but imho Train Simulator is way better & at least in that title the cab interiors are reasonably HD & realistic, these are just pants. I have a new system with 32GB ram & a GTX980 card & I still need to dial down the quality to well below that of Train Simulator to get a reasonable frame rate. Maybe I've missed something (the menus are weird & take you into multiple windows, they seem proud of this too for some reason??) but playing scenarios seems like an afterthought as well, I couldn't find anymore than 4 & after getting a UK passenger one started it just felt so wrong as a driving experience I gave up. Hopefully work will continue & in a year or so they will have something to be rightfully proud of, at the moment though it is just a Toy Trainz-Set simulator so I'll go back to their competition.","July 10, 2015","false","1.4"," 34 of 49 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","34","49","0","1"

Have seen a lot of changes (for the better) during the beta time to retail release. Some of these are the  amount of bugs and other quirkiness that have been fixed. eg. the database hanging and not finishing the repair, numerous random crashes, graphic glitches etc.\n\nSettings should be set realisticly for the pc that is used.  As with any game, each one is different and what one game will run on low/normal/high/ultra does not mean the other  will as well as no game is identical. The sim will make the pc work, but a lot depends how much content is in a map, the pc's hardware, good air flow and how well maintained the computer is and of course the users expectations.\n\nThe surveyor is where Trainz really shines if you are an established  route builder or just starting out.  This is where I spend most of my time.  My work in progress route that has been moved from Trainz12 to T:ANE now blows me away as to how good it looks (in my eyes anyway).  Even just by altering the time of day and then watching the shadows move as time goes by is wonderful.  The reflections of trees on the loco and carriages as it passes by is very eye catching. Oh and there is sway with carriages and loco - very cool.\n\nPros:  Excellent surveyor (editor) tools which make creating your route vey easy.\nCan be manually optimised for using hdr, bloom, depth of field and other goodies which\ncan make a route look very realistic.\nCompatible with majority of content from previous trainz versions.\nThousands of free content on the download station,  A First class ticket will enable faster downloading and no\nrestriction on amount of downloads.\nShadows are great.  Can see object shapes on the ground, reflections of clouds/vegetation in the water, etc.\nHas backward compatibility with previous trainz content.\nDevs are working on patches and seem to be very passionate about the sim and sorting things out.\nMore goodies to come in the future - weather elements (thunder lightning) is just one of them.\n\nCons.  Still the odd ctd, but seems to happen mosttly (for me) in quickdrive when changing graphic settings while in this     mode - has  been bug reported.\nRestrictions on altering  fog, ambience or water colour with inbuilt routes.  Would be nice if this feature was available\nSome custom textures look overbright  (using the replacement tool will fix this easily).\n\nI will not say whether you should buy or not buy, but it does pay to look further a field than just focus on the negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","July 6, 2015","true","297.2"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","24","34","2","0"

Since that time, N3V have been promising a decent patch in Hotfix 2 and from my perspective they have delivered-- the sim plays without stuttering, slideshow, or CTD'ing on my curently mid-range machine (geforce 760, 16G ram, I7).  Graphics look somewhat better since lighting and shadows don't seem to cause the same problems they did before although they are  still far from what was shown on kickstarter (again more likely because my machine is not top-end).\n\nI'm not all about graphics as I run a railway simulator called Run 8 and love it-- the graphics are okay but not the main feature of that simulation-- I am more of an operations simmer so if ops/activities function without causing distress and I can lose myself in that for a few hours then the sim is worthwhile.  In Hotfixed 2 T:ANE I can run activities, such as loading and unloading coal without a slideshow happening which is pleasing and bodes well for more ingame hours.\n\nI will recommend this because N3V is still fixing it and it is running way better than at launch.  I will add though that YMMV (your mileage may vary) with results better or worse than mine.","September 29, 2015","true","18.9"," 26 of 39 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","26","39","4","2"

Having thrown your money away when you were actually expecting something tangible in return is the height of aggravation. If this is a new era, I'm glad I wasn't around for the old one.\n\nConsidering what is on screen at any given moment, the game is poorly optimized. Even after the service pack, which boasts big improvements, it plays at 30 FPS with a 980Ti. The track and ballast doesn't even sit down on the terrain in many places creating a shadow under the track that makes it look really phoney. There was only 1 route included that interested me, and zero locomotives that interested me. I also found out that the areas that were as beautiful and nicely detailed as the promo shots were few and far between. Most of the map I eventually played looked like an unfinished layout at a model train show in rural Kansas. The interface is subpar, the camera controls are horrible, the physics are unrealistic, and both versions of the train controls gave no sense of actually driving a real train. If I had been introduced to this game with no prior knowledge and was told it was aimed at small children, I would have advised the developers to step it up a notch. (No pun intended)\n\nMy visit to the Trainz Portal and the acquisition of some of the highly touted "free" community content was also as pleasurable as a trip to the dentist. Navigation from the game to the portal is clumsy and the portal itself is even clumsier. After the fairly laborious process of actually finding something I wanted to download, I began to wait for the data transfer at a whopping 5K. Yes, 5K. 1/3 of the speed of a dial-up modem from 20 years ago. I waited an hour and a half for a locomotive to download, only to find that key files were outdated, corrupt, incompatible, or removed by the user who uploaded them, and the locomotive would not work in-game. This happened several times in an attempt to assemble a small train to play around with. All told, I had blown 11 hours before really getting into the game. Those 11 hours were also logged as playtime because the game was open, so when I asked for a refund, Steam refused. Seriously, if you're going to offer me a handy from Evangeline Lilly, but in order to get it I have to get pounded in the tush by three ex-cons...I guess I'll have to pass.\n\nThis industry has really gotten out of hand. When you buy a kitchen gadget that sucks, you go get your money back. When you buy a power tool that's crap, you go get your money back. Why must we be forced to accept software that is crap? I'm pretty much done buying software I can't demo first. Tired of being a beta tester on post-released software. Do yourself a favor and get Train Simulator 2016 if you like trains.

It was my first Train Simulator. I played "trainz" even before I discovered (MSTS) Micorsoft Train Simulator. I had such a great time with it up until around Trainz 2009/2010. They were good games but not optimized, glitchy and overall just a pain from just running it to 3rd party content installation. Ts12 had amazing content (thanks to Jointed Rail) but a very old engine so it was even more of a mess. Now with T:ANE I thought my dreams would come true and the engine would be reworked so it would look and play like a modern gen game. Wrong. T:ANE is just as bad as 12, dosent even look that great and its just a huge let down. I though id be taken back to the glory days of 2006 with all that amazing content and pretty decent preformace but now its just too much. I think Trainz is going to die soon, its sad but true, its on its way out. Dovetails games ( previosuly RSC ) Railworks - Train Simulator 20 (whatever one there on now) runs better than this, and even that game has it fair share of issues. Enoughs enough. I used to love MSTS and Trainz and despise Railworks due to its lack of 3rd party content and poor preformace but now Trainz has fallen a rung under, and Railworks had risen above by slowly improving the game engine and providing decent products (albiet high prices). As far as the best sims now?\n\nOpen Rails. A reboot of MSTS/Micorsoft Train Simulator that has everything that T ANE promises with the silkly smooth frame rate (I can average around 200 FPS) and taking advantage of the biggest library of virtual train content that was created for MSTS. FREE with a pre installed MSTS. Yes thats right, free. What are you waiting for?  http://openrails.org/\n\nTrain Simulator/Railworks. Graphicly the Most stunning train sim on the market with pretty decent realism and decent (depending on the route) preformance. Addons are expensive but most are very impressive and are worth it. However it still has bugs and no 3rd party content support. http://www.railsimulator.com/\n\nThe entire Trainz series from the 1st tilte to Trainz Railroad Simulator 2010. Can't go wrong with these versions of Trainz. Might not have the graphics and realism that some sims have but has the best route editor of any Train Sim, pretty large content selection and its certianly a unique experince.\n\nLiked the Trainz Jointed Rail content but hated how it preformed bc of Trainz? Jointed Rail is producing a new sim that runs on the Unreal 4 engine.

Still here? Ok.\n\nIf you want to dig deeper into a more hardcore railroad sim, are a model railroad enthusiast, want much more free content than what you can get in TS 2016, or want to do more than just drive trains I suggest this simulator. TANE, IMO has the best route editor and content creation tools of any other railroad simulation software. There is no debate or contest, it is the best in that respect. Period.\n\nThe community is more involved with the actual development and design direction of Trainz than any other railroad simulator. The developers are much more engaged with and respond to the community much more than say Dovetail (the makers of TS). The Download Station has a vast amount of content that is free of charge and can be downloaded by anyone who owns the sim and has a free account from their (Auran's) website.\n\nIf all this sounds like your cup of tea, then I highly recommend TANE to you, especially after the service pack 1 update. The sim has come a long way since it's release last year, and it is much more optimized than it was then. If you have been sitting on the fence since release, I can with confidence say that it's a great time to jump into Trainz. So come on! What are ya waiting for?

With my previous version of Train I had the default content, plus about 20 custome routes and about 10,000 extra DLC items I had downloaded using a first class ticket a while back.  I enjoy making my own routes, and so I had a lot of scenery items from which to play with.  Yeah, back then all that extra content sure loaded down the start up of the game.  But I understood it, as there was a lot of content.  Loading up this new version, I thought for sure there would be a lot of content to play with.  Sadly, however, the pickings seemed very slim once I did get in and see what I had available to me.  So imagine if I imported all my old content, it would probably take 3 hours to load :)\n\nSo I load up the sessions, and notice that now you have to pay to access some sessions.   $39.99?   Really are they fooling anyone by deducting that one cent?   $40 for a single play session?  WTF.   I would say about half of the sessions that come with the stock routes, you now have to pay extra for.  Here is a question...   If I published a route, could I set a price for sessions too?  And will I get that money as the route publisher?  I somehow doubt it, but damn...  That would be nice.\n\nAnyhow, I loaded up the editor.  I have spent most of my time in the editor, so I can usually throw together something fairly quick.  And alas, nothing has really changed that I noticed throwing together a quick route to test some trains on, in the editor.  I saw that they has a FEC GP9 locomotive.  Oh sweet....   I love GP9's   I have been waiting for an official highly detailed GP9 model.   So I plopped that down on the track.   The outside skin was indeed very sweet.  So I ran the session, and went to drive the GP9 around...\n\nI get into the cab view of the GP9 and...  I can't believe what I am seeing.   No detail at all.  This looks like the stock SD40 interior from 2004.  Nothing has changed!   Seriously?    Very unhappy about this.\n\nLuckily I have been working on a physical real world model railroad, in order to get my train fix as of late.  If I had to rely on Trainz much longer, I imagine I would develop a real bad taste for train simulations.","January 31","false","3.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

However, Version 1.2 is a huge improvement, so it is only fair that I update this review to reflect that. Whereas I could not recommend Version 1.1, I can recommend Version 1.2. The maddening bug where your train got "hijacked" has been resolved, or at least I never encountered it playing several different sessions, including the ones where I encountered the problem before.\n\nOne issue that you do have to look out for is very slow and choppy performance when shadows are turned on. However, when you disable shadows, the game performs extremely well, although sometimes the cab view cuts in and out, which is rather disconcerting. Still, the overall performance of the game and general gameplay have improved massively on the previous version.\n\nOverall, I still don't like this game as much as Train Simulator 2015, which for me has better graphics and performance, and also more user-friendly controls. But whereas the problems with Version 1.1 made it unplayable, the improvements made to Version 1.2 mean that it is definitely worth trying out.\n\nBear in mind that the game is still in beta mode, but with the full version due to be released in about the middle of this month, that's another good reason to buy it now and then get the update to the full game.","April 14, 2015","true","20.4"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","15","27","5","0"

Ok - phew -loading not fast - but not worth complaining about. Ok... hmm major chugging.. ut oh - the reviews were right?!? Darn - I was hoping not... wait - hmm.. a little tinkering - AH - ok - cranked up graphics to full, lowered the rendering distance to its lowest I'm happy! AND I NOW KNOW that this game will still look awesome with my current PC and perhaps the next two game machines I buy! Yeah I think they gave us more than we are usually even expected to be able to use. So let's quickly complain that we have more software than our hardware can handle... with the safe guard that you can tweak it and make it run just fine.\n\nHave I seen any sluggish bits? Yup. The menu System seems to chug the game - yeah - a little - but - I don't mind - it's usually pretty smooth... depends on the views - definitely is directly proportionate to your current view's number of polygons (models, trees, trains etc) ... but yeah the menu seems to do that regardless of view - but its not all the time and not bad ... really - for what I'm seeing so far - I couldn't care less.\n\nPeople say the lighting system isn't all that, it was professed to be awesome and it's not different than TrainZ 2012 or whatever - um - I think it looks great. I'm a developer and 3D guy too - and I think people want the darn holodeck for crying out loud...so do I but I don't expect that for forty bucks :D So....\n\nLighting? Looks great to me.\nGraphics? look great to me!\nGame Play: So far so good\n\nAbility to do simulator or treat this as a model railroad? Yup! Does that. (But I don't think it does electricity circuits and remote control engines...like really simulating making an actual model train layout but then I haven't played this long enough to say that but I haven't seen any hints that might lead in that direction yet either. Rule The Rail - Old - DirectX9 thing does that and is awesome! 3600+ free user addons too haha - Side note! ) But yeah this looks awesome! My Rule the Rail game doesn't nor is it intended to compete with these graphics.\n\nI think this game has an open platofrm, you can complain about DLC or just give them a message: Buy if you think its worth it, don't if you do not...simple!) There will be tons of community stuff coming, and there is probably tons already.\n\nI think this game looks great! I have Train Sim 2015, its great - but I like the brighter colors and the basic direct x 9'eske brighter look - (I even love the marvel comic look of Rule the Rail but - fact is - if you like it then yay! I love it! I think it looks great.)\n\nNow so far I did find one thing in this program that is 100% stupid that my (still!) favorite railroad game to date "Rule The Rail" does perfectly - even over a decade ago! When the Turn Table turns... THE RAILS FREAKING DISCONNECT from the railroad ties and the turntable mechanism UNTIL the turn table turns enough to be say the amount for a rachet (wrench) click - then the rails snap into correct position... as the turntable keeps turning those rails stay stuck...until that same amount of turn ( a notch?) is reached then the rails snap into position there... I found that laughable HOWEVER....\n\nWhile I was laughing at the screwy turntable.... I sat under a tree that was hovering about 12 feet over the tracks in a certain bend on a hillside... whie contemplating these few things that seem out of place I figured:\n\nThey don't know what the heck they are talking about! This game looks freaking great! I mean really - making this stuff run is harder than standing in front of a camera with makeup acting like you someone your not - yeah - making code like this purr is hard than making a movie! [in my subjective opinion... your results may vary] haha  - As a developer I know what goes into this and see this much work as the symphony it does - whatever quirks remain - darn - how about picking out the worst ones and see about getting them fixed in the next patch.\n\n\nI admit at first before I started tinkering with the graphics settings and stuff - I thought I had a lemon. When I saw how well the graphics looked with the stuff turned up and the viewdistance turned way down - looks awesome - and I kbnow if I want to go even smoother I can turn other things down.\n\nAlready just using this game for a few hours I've seen more cool viewpoints, vistas, more working hardware on a train (swining chains, the hardware on the steam engine wheels looks awesome) the trucks on the rolling stock, the engine trucks on diesals - I really don't think you are getting ripped off getting this program.  I am convinved it will run for years perfect if Microsoft doesn't continually make their operating systems slower and continually drop support for stuff we all bought into just for them to take it away.... but again I digress.\n\nIf you get this and hate it...and you read this review - sorry - I really think its awesome and for heaven's sake - some high-five the dam developers and the money handler who managed to get this thing out the door! Woo Hoo! New TOYS! I must go play now!\n\nWhere is that stupid...um...ICON...Got IT!\n\n!!!

The bad reviews are mostly because of the recycled content and sounds in the game, and that the author\'s computer can\'t really handle the game well.

I want to layout my own tracks and engines which this game gives you the ability to do.\n\nThe thing that bothers me about the train SIMS in general is the pricy add ons. I mean just give us everything. This game isn't nearly as bad as TS2016 is with the add on and price but still they just can't seem to make a great train sim that has everything.\n\nThe problem with this game for me is the Frame Rate, tried at 1080p 60fps...shutters and tearing. Try again at 4k 30fps looks betteer but still shutters and tearing. I don't know what it is with these train games but when GTA 5's freaking trains look better than yours maybe head back to the drawing board and I'm not kidding with this.\n\nI just wouldn't really recommend this game, I wouldn't not recommended it, I just wouldn't have any input knowing what I know about trains and graphics....","March 1","true","1.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I probably have had more enjoyment with this version of Trainz than I have had with previous versions, partly because I am semi-retired now and have had  more time with it. I have seen steady improvement in the sim from the early betas through HotFix 1 and 2 (beta) and expect it will continue to get better.\nThat's not to say that the game has been without its problems. Along the way I have upgraded my video card to an NVidia 750. which made a big difference in frame rates and the level of detail I can use. Shadows remain problematic. On some routes, I can use them; on others shadows really bog down performance.\nFinding T:ANE compatible content can be a problem. I spent a lot of time floundering about on the Download Station until I discovered the freeware routes uploaded by Bob, msgsapper. His routes and sessions all work well in T:ANE and are all available on the Download Station.\nSince I don't have the ability to create my own routes or rolling stock, I'm looking forward to more T:ANE payware and freeware that take advantage of T:ANE's advanced graphics.\nOverall, if you love trains and have the time and patience to work through T:ANE's quirk, I think the average user can have a lot of fun.","September 23, 2015","true","838.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

Cab sway exists but it no where near the level of realism of that found in TS 20XX.\nOne must also remember that trainz appears to be more of a model train simulator, rather than TS 20XX's lifelike sim feel.\nThe DLS (speed limited to a horrendous 8 ish-kb/s, but with First Class Ticket, the speeds are unlimited)Has over 300,000 assets in total.\n\nSummary: This game is not as perfect and polished as TS 20XX, but will still appeal to some audiences.

The main video that plays when you reach the page, I'd wager 75% of that isnt in the basic game.  Those are add ons, each being half the main game price A PIECE.\n\nWhen I purchased the game, I got it on sale, like most Steam users would do, and I noticed that if I paid the "Full Price" during the sale, I would get a couple of the DLC items included!  So I did.  Game Loads.  On the bare bones, you get 4-5 routes, thats it.  I play the Healsville, Australia level first, because I personally like 1920s era stuff.  I don't care if it may have been a "Community Addition" to include the route and equipment, but to put it bluntly, its broken.  The engine they assign you to drive doesn't work half the time, the signals don't change untill you are within 20 feet, and the air compressors run at such a pitch, volume, and consistancy they drive you mad!!  To have something like this ship with the "Default" Game, the game that isnt even represented proplerly in its own videos, is wrong.  To top it all off, it is still the same PC hogging tank that it was before, so unless you have a live in your parents basement super computer, good luck having it look any better than previous versions.\n\nI had Trainz 2009 in Highschool.  Loved it to death, mustve put 100s of hours into it, untill I moved away and lost the disc.  To see it become this...\n\nSO TL:DR.  Looking for a train sim? Run.  Run Away.  Becuase unless all you want to do is build routes (Which was nailed down before with previous versions so that at least works), its not worth it.\n\nPS: TBH, the shaking of the cars and engines while moving is a nice touch.

However, this game is not what it promises to be. The title "a new era" is misleading, as the dovetail simulator has better graphics and gameplay. The price is also misleading. Now, I understand that this is a small company, and needs to generate enough money to survive, but this game is worth a lot less (in my mind) than I paid. To list an overview:\n\n. UI is user freindly\n. MOST of promised content is available\n. physics is as promised\n. gameplay is as expected\n\nSpecific Pros:\n. Large sound library\n. Coustom and realistic physics engin\n. Interesting routes and content\n. powerful route builder\nSpecific cons\n. Bugs\n. session UI sometimes fails to fully load\n. spawning of incomplete consists\n. missing textures/assets\n. Crashes\n. Not all of promised content is included\n. test tracks not included\n. Relatively low amount of content\n. Graphics quality is okay, but could be better\n. Interiors on most trains are very poorly made\n\nAlthough this game is not what one would call the company's greatest acheivment, they have done better. Including more content, the same to higher graphics, and fewer bugs, Trainz Simulator 12 is the better alternative. I highly suggest that game over this one. (you will not see ie in my library, as I got it befor I had steam)\n\nPlease keep in mind that I am not trying to offend the developers in any way. If any of you dissagree with me or think I could do better, please let me know for future reviews.\n\nEDIT: It is because of these factors that I have decided to refund the game.","May 24","false","4.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

You can populate your world with interactive industries and task your rail creation to meet their needs.  As engineer, you can yourself perform these tasks, or you may build and set AI Trains to handle the job, or—with multiple trains running simultaneously—you can schedule both AI’s and personal tasking.  And, of course, with AI’s you can sit back and watch all the fun you’ve created in the world you’ve created. You can even become your own director and set cameras along the routes to capture the action from all angles.\n\nThe more I experience Trainz, the more I see it’s incredible range and potential.  Driving detailed locomotives and rolling stock on working and lovingly created routes in simulation, learning all about railroad life and tasks is only the start. But it’s a great start that has obviously benefitted from it’s 15 years of evolution. When you watch the You Tube fan-based videos and tutorials of previous offerings and compare them with today’s T:ANE (“Trainz: A New Era”—the latest offering in that evolution), you can clearly see the continuous dedication involved.  As the graphics and computer capabilities have improved, Trainz has taken advantage of that by improving the game’s qualities of realism. I find that growth exciting and something to continue looking forward to.\n\nBut Trainz is about more than a software developer’s product, their ongoing refinements, and your individual creativeness.  Indeed, it’s about a worldwide community of enthusiastic players and knowledgeable hobbyists who are online and only a button-click away. Whether you’re ruling the single-player rails or playing in multiplayer, push that chat-button and you can interact with others from all over who have discovered and are enjoying Trainz.  Also, from the help button, you have immediate access to n3v’s Internet Wiki.  From there you’ll find all kinds of developer-information and can ask questions from other hobby/game enthusiasts who can and do respond with valuable information to help you.  I have personally found the response to be really helpful, timely, and truly there from other train enthusiasts!\n\nThere is so much to talk about.  If you think you’d like to rule the rails, become a Trainzer and watch a whole new world open up to you.\n\nBest Wishes,\nFroglegs\n","September 30, 2015","true","895.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

The graphics are quite decent as well as the player control. The sounds of all the locos are authentic. This franchise has constantly made improvements since the very beginning. There are millions of users of this program from all over the world. You can create your own content and then upload it to share with others in the trainz community.

This game just lacks new content with barley any newer rolling stock, sure I'm ok with some trains from trainz 12 is on this game, but the fact is they barely added newer content and sure they added train swaying which is cool, but in my honest opion, its just trainz 12 again, I was hyped for this game, but after playing for 44 minutes I quit. Sure 44 minutes isnt a long time but I've been a trainz fan since I got the trainz complete collection that included paint shed, ultra collection?, trainz 04 and 06. I had so much fun with those, 2 years later i found out about the download station, that extended the games life time for me for many more years. Finally years later I got Trainz 12, and I had more fun with that due to the fact so much more content was on it(note I didn't know about steam about that time so I didn't buy the steam version) After downloading more content for Trainz 12 I was set for a good years of play time. Hearing about this game I was hyped, now I regret buying this game.

When I had gotten T:ANE, it was in the later state of the Beta builds, when I had gotten it, I find it was pretty well set up, but could use more, or minor tweaks here and there.\nI forget exactly how I had the money at the point, but at that time I was looking for a good train sim to get for myself, it was a toss up between TS2016 at $30 and T:ANE Deluxe Edition at $70. I'm glad I chose to get T:ANE.\n\nI have recently gotten a copy of TS2016, and I honestly feel a touch confused with it, to me it doesn't seem to be as user friendly as T:ANE. Maybe I need to do a bit more digging around on TS2016 to find out how it all works, it's editor is weird to me anyways, it doesn't have the nice tabs along the side of the screen for exactly what you want like T:ANE does, it won't let you place custom consists or make custom consists while in editor like T:ANE does.\nIn my mind the only things TS2016 has going for it is graphics, steam workshop, and the amount of centralized DLC, which costs a fortune. T:ANE may not have a lot of routes, or locomotives, or content in general, but it has one of the biggest things any game can have, user friendliness.\n\nI have seen this game rise and fall with the updates to it, I honestly don't understand the hate towards T:ANE. Granted yes, there are a few things they could do to improve the game. I have seen them starting to centralize the DLC a bit more, give to the public what they want, and doing what they can to keep the game series alive.\n\nTo sum it up in quick points of what I feel T:ANE is:\nPros:\n- User Friendliness\n- Easy to understand route surveyor\n- Flexability in what you can do in the game\n- "most" models are pretty outstanding in detail and fleshed out (e.g. the SP SD45)\n- Staff are helpful\n- Tons of free stuff (300,000+) on Download Station\n- A test track to test the limitations of your locomotives and see a readout of performance\n\nCons:\n- Some models need to be fleshed out a bit more (e.g Payware DLC TUME BN SD40-2)\n- Not a ton of base content\n- Needs more centralized DLC, easy to access.\n\nSuggestions:\n- Keep centralizing the DLC for ease of access.\n- A separate DLC tab on the main screen, rather than going into a route to check it out.\n- Put a Visit Test Track button on the launch window.\n- Remove 'Connot Edit' lock on DLC routes, We bought the route, I think we should be able to edit it.\n\nDLC Suggestions:\n- We need a Union Pacific Dash 9 44CW\n- We need Union Pacific's Moffat Tunnel Subdivision.\n*hint hint* ;)\n\nOverall review 8/10.\nThank you for the work and keeping this series alive.\n-BT","April 24","true","736.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However, it isn't what was promised at all, and aside from one or two things, it looks exactly like T12 before it. Aswell as the fact that theyre seems to be less and less content with each new version. Which wouldn't be that much of an issue if it wasnt such a pain to download custom content through the content manager. I do reccomend it, if you like Trainz in general. But if you already have 2012 then dont bother.","September 29, 2015","true","64.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a fun train simulator so far. It seems slightly less complex a simulation model than TS2016, though on the other hand the interface is less intuitive than its competitor. It is easier, however, to find working 3rd party content for Trainz, which the developers have centralized in the download station website. Tentatively, I give this game a thumbs up. I'll probably edit this early review once I have more game time.","December 2, 2015","true","55.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My rig is based on an i7 4790k, Gigabyte SOC Force Z97 mobo, 8gb RAM, GIgabyte G1 970 graphics @ 1080p on a 27 in LPS monitor and the game is installed on a SSD.\n\nMy graphics settings are Draw Distance 3000m, Shadow Quality: Off, Main SHadow Resolution: 2048, with the remaining settings at Ultra, High, High, High, Low. I would say that TS 2016 graphics are superior to TANE's.\n\nI'm enjoying what I'm seeing so far, hopefully we will get more UK locos and routes as time goes by but to be honest if I want plenty of UK routes and locos right now I can switch to Train Simulator 2016 or go back to Trainz 12 or 2009 for a bit.","December 5, 2015","true","16.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've needed a train sim multiplayer fix for some years! You can setup private games or leave them open to the public.\n\nMy only complaint is the First Class Ticket. You need one of these to download stuff at normal speeds. If not then you're looking at 4 Kbps. Which if you don't plan on checking out the mod scene you'd think you'd be fine. BUT these speeds also apply to ingame updates (not steam updates) like playing the multiplayer on each map. So I wasted my 2 hour trial period (refund period) downloading the multiplayer updates.\n\nSo I give it a 6/10.

The fact that Trainz is now on Steam makes things go much easier when it comes to communication and Service packs or updates. The main advantage to Trainz is in Surveyor and building qualities, which are much more user friendly than other simulators. Trainz large displays on the right side are much easier to notice from a visual perspective. All simulators have both positive and negative ratings, but because Trainz has been completly upgraded with new features; I think that Trainz is headed in the right direction, which makes for a much more enjoyable experience. I have only used the New Era version for one day before writing this review, but I am really impressed with how easy it is to find where your going in the program.

Just shifted over to STEAM since I had some DLC from TS12 which I wanted to use in T:ANE.  I would highly recommend this program for any Railroad Simulation fan who wants to create their own routes or sessions and has new higher-end hardware (particularly the graphics card).  The locomotive cabs for the most part are quite primitive compared to those in TS2016 so driving from within the cab isn't as enjoyable, but if you want to edit any route or session (except the built-in ones) it is quite easy.\n\nThe team at N3V are working hard to make the program smoother to run with lower-end hardware but realistically the "recommended" hardware should be listed as "minimum".  They are also adding new features and chasing down bugs, so new versions have been released quite frequently lately.","November 10, 2015","true","104.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have seen complaints about stuff like that the game does not create the junctions that the trailer showed, but it is actullully possible to create them if you use the track that starts with TANE and it should make them.  The lighting is more impressive then in the trailer when you look on the DLS on My Trainz (Planet Auran) there is not a lot of content but when you look at it in Trainz A New Era Content Manager there are tons of downloadeble content From Trainz 12 but the auther has updated it for Trainz A New Era and the fact that there is pre installed enough content for lite users and there are a lot of good payware content on Simulator Central. All in all I'm saying that this game is better then TS 2016 (2015). Well for those who want to drive a train and nothing more Ts 2016 (2015) is the game for you, but... if you want more then that, like a full Railroad Simulator then Trainz: A New Era is for you and this game is worth the money including the delux version.\nFinal Words:  great good game, buy it.","December 29, 2015","true","30.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a fun train simulator so far. It seems slightly less complex a simulation model than TS2016, though on the other hand the interface is less intuitive than its competitor. It is easier, however, to find working 3rd party content for Trainz, which the developers have centralized in the download station website. Tentatively, I give this game a thumbs up.

My rig is based on an i7 4790k, Gigabyte SOC Force Z97 mobo, 8gb RAM, GIgabyte G1 970 graphics @ 1080p on a 27 in LPS monitor and the game is installed on a SSD.\n\nMy graphics settings are Draw Distance 3000m, Shadow Quality: Off, Main SHadow Resolution: 2048, with the remaining settings at Ultra, High, High, High, Low. I would say that TS 2016 graphics are superior to TANE's.\n\nI'm enjoying what I'm seeing so far, hopefully we will get more UK locos and routes as time goes by but to be honest if I want plenty of UK routes and locos right now I can switch to Train Simulator 2016 or go back to Trainz 12 or 2009 for a bit.","December 5, 2015","true","16.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Since I was already tired of TS and the reviews of this one were pretty good, I decied to give it a shot and got the deluxe pack.\n\nThis was my biggest mistake.\n\nFirst of all, I have a decent computer. Core i5 with a nVidia GTX 760. I usually play games at ultra without much struggle, so I decided to do the same. After I launched the game (which took almost 5 minutes), I got inside the tutorials and the game was lagging like hell, the grafics seemd something from a PS2 game. I googled what was going on and some people recommended turning off shadows (?!) so it would run better. I did it and helped a lot, although the look and feel were still terrible.\n\nAfter the tutorials, got on some tracks and man... the sound ain't nice, the tracks are somewhat confusing... the only thing I liked were the controllers, which I found more interesting than the ones from TS, but the latter beats this game in several aspects. I really didn't think it was anjoyable at all.\n\nIt's a pitty Steam doesn't have a refund policy, otherwise I'd have asked for one right away. If you want something with good looks and an enjoyable experience, get away from this game.","December 3, 2015","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm disappointed vastly because it isn't what they claimed it was going to be a year or 2 ago with the videos showing it looking unrealistic in it's quality, it's not bad though but needs optimising still very badly, if I could rate neutral I would for that reason but don't think it deserves a thumbs down, not quite.\n\nMy system is top end and runs this at 60fps at 1440p but with distance set at 3000, nowhere near the top, shadows are on low, the game looks really nice though and makes TS 2016 look terrible, the only problem at the moment is the workshop makes TS the much better choice as well as the sheer selection available on DTG's offering, a lot of catching up to do, but like many railfans I think both are needed as both have their qualities. The length of the routes is certainly a forte for TANE though, being able to go from London to Scotland in one run has always been great and now even more epic.\n\nA lot of work to do here though, i'm not convinced TANE will ever run great like it should, hopefully one day they'll get on top of it.\n\nI have changed my mind and edited to suit, the limited supplied scenarios are unforgivable and means that even DTG would offer more as standard for your money, that says it all. Without making a lot of effort this game is very limited, frustratingly so.","October 25, 2015","false","24.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Well it's simple. After about 10 minutes ingame while you're still in the tutorial it will ask you to leave feed back for free DLC. So you leave feed back and get your stuff. Well reality sets in when you get out of the tutorial and you realize there's no content and you slowly realize that it's just a "slightly" polished version of Trainz 12. Almost everything is the same as 12, even down to the menus. Do yourself a favor and skip this at all cost and stick to 12 or don't even buy that one. I'd take a refund if I could, in fact if they see this review and don't like it, I'll take it down if they refund my money I wasted on this garbage.\n\nPros: The only Pro is that you can play a game of Where's Waldo by looking for improvements in the game.\n\nCons: Doesn't look much better then 12\nLess content then 12\nScams you into leaving feedback for DLC\nForced feedback leads you to buy this garbage","October 31, 2015","false","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I hope the developers will optimize it more and more in the future service packs.\nI've got TS2009 and TS12 also and I bought this version becouse I tought the graphics was improved as mentioned everywhere. But when I first played it, I tried the british line at first, I thought it is the same as TS2009 or TS12!\nI think, the older contents looks the same as before and there are some newer content in it whats looks better now.\nOverall, I do not think, it is worth the money. I bought a steam key somewhere else where it was way cheaper than on steam now. I think the developers will improve the quality of this product over time, so I suggest to wait when SP1 will come out and after that buy this game or look for a cheaper steam key somewhere else.\nIt is positive, that I've got a 6 month FCT too along with the purchase, so I can install a lot of content from the download station in no time...

I would be happy with 25fps as that's the british video standard. I will be honest.......I havent played Trainz for quite a long time because of all the problems i was getting. However, with Trainz the new era, they definately seem to have made some really good improvements. My one big dissapointment was lack of built in routes and scenarios. You only get 4 routes, only one which is British (ECML). The first Trainz I purchased back in 1875 had loads of built in routes to keep you happy for hours. No doubt as TANE goes along it will gain some really nice British routes.\n\nAll in all, I have to give TANE a thumbs up.

If we go in postprocessing settings there we will see more advanced graphic options. With a proper combination of them the game will look much better than on trailer and screenshots. Just realistic.\n\nNow let's cry about bad things...\n\nPerformace - I understand its a beta yet so I hope in final release it will be better optimized. For now, with my i5-4670K, GTX 760, 8GB ram and SSD I have something like slideshow instead of fluent game on higher settings. Hope that additional 8GB RAM will help a bit.\n\nMaps quality - landscapes - they are really beautiful, but if we look on details on map, then it isn't so sweet. Tracks are flying in air, turnouts are too sharp, sometimes distance between parallel tracks is too low, no grass around a track (it would make a bit more realism).\n\nAnimated junctions - they are okay, but I hope this feature will be supported also in double switches.\n\nTrains - there are many vehicles, higher and lower quality, but there isn't command to turn off/turn on an engine (or maybe I'm wrong?).\n\nSo I can recommend this game, because it already looks better than any Trainz series. It's got realy many advantages, that i didn't talk about. I hope some things that I listed above will be improved in the final release or updates.","April 20, 2015","true","476.1"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","46","11","24","6","1"

I'm pretty much satisfied with the results SP1 has, and i'm ready to transfer my TS12 content onto T:ANE.\nExcept for the fact once I start transferring, I might crash this computer due to the ginormous data files for TS12 (Hehe)\nI'd reccommend that if you enjoy this game alot, but it feels bare and boring to be stuck with the same content over and over, try out some DLC content that people create online and import into your T:ANE Content Manager.\nWho knows, you could re-create some amazing routes that exist today, or just play it nice and simple and create a roller coaster that eventually derails the train :P\n\n-OLD REVIEW-\nOverall, T:ANE is a huge step for me since I enjoy TS12 a lot. Here's the things I was unsatisfied when I played the game: Same boring hornsounds! Ok, some sounds good for certain locomotives but it's just the same exact ones from TS12 and below. I had a somewhat higher standards for better horn sounds and whistles. Content being removed every new game! The ATSF GP60B, and C-44 in 12 certainly surprised and awed me. Hoping to find the same in-game content, I could create a good route in T:ANE with these locomotives.. Sadly, not. Here are the Satisfactions: Texture, graphics and better performance. Better routes and certain updated specs. Lastly, we can transfer TS12 content to here since it supports it! I would say the overall review is a +50/-50 but it leans more to the good side about the graphics, routes, textures and so on.\nNow I'm waiting for those guys who make high quality locomotives, objects, and rolling stocks to start creating some for T:ANE >:3","May 15, 2015","true","3.2"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","44","7","16","4","0"

I had Trainz 2012 and really liked it.   Was looking forward to TANE, but so many neg comments made me hold off.  Finally I just said, 'f***it, and bought TANE anyway.\n\nMaybe they fixed a lot of the performance issues in the May update, because I had pretty decent frame rates even with shadows turned on and tree/texture detail at high.  It gets a little stuttery in heavy rain, but that's the only time.  I do have a high-end gfx card (GTX Titan) so I'm sure that makes a diff.\n\nFor those (like me) who saw the renders back at the Kickstarter campaign and went, 'wow', yes, you're going to be disappointed.   That was false advertising on Auran's fault and  Auran deserves all the crap that's been thrown their way because of that.  But TANE IS a much richer environment than Trainz 2012.  Lighting is much more realistic, textures better, real-world reflections inside the cab.  And performance, on my machine, is better in TANE than it is with 2012 with the same settings.  also to me the sounds are better, more realistic.  It's a lot of subtle small stuff, but I think it adds up.   The PhysX stuff they keep crowing about is completly lost on me, not seeing it other than it doesn't rain in tunnels?  (Really Auran, that's something you're proud of?)\n\nThe routes of TANE are pretty amazing.  Much better, more detail than 2012.  Though they're not finished.  Lots of them have missing tracks, buildings laying across the tracks.  It's amazing Auran didn't hire game testers to actually drive the freakin routes before they released it.  Having built games myself, one of the easiest and quickest fixes you can make is to move an asset.  I agree with a lot of posters, that this feels more like a beta.  Still, the driveability of the locos is much better than 2012.  They start and stop more realistically than 2012.\n\nI think it's worth the upgrade.  Not at all sorry I jumped in.   I've got 17 hrs in 3 days, and there's still so much more to explore.","June 21, 2015","true","61.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

Nice overall rendering style, water quality is above average, but seems no real-time environment reflections, quality of trees and other objects is below average, texture is good but you can notice its annoying loading lag during your play.

I have used trainz since the 2004 version and what I have always enjoyed the most is the ability to so easily create your own routes from nothing, and that makes up for some of its shortcomings in my opinion. It is such a versatile game, with so much to offer anyone who loves trains and loves to create in so many different ways, build a route, build content, drive , operate your routes, control environments, weather, industry and so on...\n\nTrainz a new era maintains all of this and does look a little better than previous versions, so if you like train simulators, this one is the best, may not look as good as certain other titles in the train sim genre, but more than makes up for it in versatality, glad I bought it","October 4, 2015","true","43.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

Would enjoy some new in-game Canadian to-scale routes, especially for areas like Vancouver or Prince Rupert, two very important ports where trains are alway required.  I am thankful for the turn-out frogs, because placing frogs in a yard manually was a true pain-in-the-keester.  However, I have not seen any frogs for X-rail crossings, which can make for a visual distraction.  Would like to see better searchlight signals as well, as in-game signals look a little amateurist.  There are signals available to download (with Trainz12, have not looked for content with T:ANE yet), but would like to see them included with game.  Great experience, however, and I would definitely recommend this game to any railroad enthusiast.","December 28, 2015","true","19.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The controls are locked in and I couldn’t customize them to the throttle lever of my Thrustmaster Hotas, which would be PERFECT for a train simulation.  The DLC library is huge, and most prices are outrageous ($35 for a single bloody route!)\n\nNo, no… I’m sorry.  I’ll continue to wait for a train simulator that’s more than just an arcade game.

The graphics on it are nice, the detail is in the landscape, vintage cars,trucks,etc attention to detail, the lineside in rail works can look quite boxy and basic even on the newest routs. the hay day of railways was the edwardian period, i lke the austailan line that comes with it, not a mk1 carrige in sight .good vintage line. like the DLC, wont mind the settle to carlise rout up dated.","May 27, 2015","true","57.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","20","1","5","3","0"

I think this game is a positive step in the right direction with the new "built in switches" used on the new track. However, I dislike the amount of content thie game lacks. I van assume that the game needs more work, and that the old content will eventually find its way into the game. The other interesting feature is when you zoom out all the way, and the camera mode changes to "map" mode. If people want to think of this game as a load of garbage, then let them, but I am not going to give up hope just yet. I'm waiting on YOU, Developers, to fix what's wrong and add all the content that was in previous versions of the game! The only reason I gave this a thumbs up is so tha we can back a game that can improve instead of ditching a title that might actually have a chance at improvement.","June 9, 2015","true","78.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","0","0","5","3","0"

They dont give up on the game if it had a small bad start it later become good. So let talk about the pro and con.\nPro:\nIt has 250.000 freeware on dls and on some website.\nit has multplayer.\nit not rubbish.\nit made to be fun to see train on the chair or if you have a projector watch on the on a relaxing seat.\nand the service of the company treat the customer really kind and not treat the customer badly.\nCon:\nit may be a slow start on the game it will take a little bit 10 or 15 min so if you are not in a rush then at ok if not then do some else.\nthe game has some bug and issue\nit a little bit pricely but it in decent price\n\nso that it I may had more pro and con but I think that all can think of about this game and last on I think of it has is it company legecy and was the game was a great game even the old game from Auran to N6V.","January 19","true","247.4"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

Tons of reviews and videos out there. Check out the latest ones, and not the beta ones or the ones where someone completely oblivious to the series is doing the review.\nI really hope that the artists out there that have created some really great realistic content continue to update their stuff to work on TANE.

It offers minimal improvement over TS12, and it has actually managed to become more resource intensive, slower to start and less stable than the previous versions. When it was released it wasn't a finished game and I am not sure even after the patches it counts as finished for the amount of money that was poured into this thing. I want to like it, but really its just not the game that was promised and thats disappointing, so save your money and just buy a previous iteration of the Trainz series and download some higher resolution textures with better engines and rolling stock and with that you will have 95% of this game at a fraction of the cost.","December 4, 2015","false","596.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When it works, the game is great fun. But this company has a history of producing buggy products, and I spent as much time fixing the game as playing it.\n\nSo when I saw the advertisments for Trains A New Era, I took a chance that the devs had finally gotten their act together, and bought this in January 2015 when it was in pre-release.\n\nIt was terrible. Every route was broken, it crashed constantly, and it was almost impossible to install updates to broken assets. I waited several months and tried again. It worked slightly better, but was still almost uplayable. i waited till fall of 2015 and tried again. I was able to build several small routes in surveyor, and some of the original routes were useable (but not all). So now I come back in May 2016, the game crashes. Eighteen months after purchase it is still a total mess. And now they are releasing pay DLC, when the main game still doesn't work? Steam shows I have 31 hours on this game. I bet no more than 5 of those were spent actually playing the game. the rest were spent installing, patching, crashing, uninstalling, reinstalling, patching,crashing.
