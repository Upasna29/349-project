While conversations are far too numerous and often serve no more than cyberpunk cliche fluff (Drugs! Genetic engineering! Megacorps!), the main storyline and missions make great use of the underwater setting and world that's been created. The gameplay, however, felt slow, clunky, with little or no strategy involved. A lot of strafing and leading shots, and outfitting your ship often feels like just buying the most expensive equipment and unleashing hell. The menus tease at a Freelancer style roaming world where you can jump between stations and find side-missions and do trading and the like, but for the most part you're railroaded onto a series of missions to complete, and odd visits to the shop. It clearly has an emphasis on action style shooting than swift maneuvarability, smart outfitting, and working with wingmen. I found it far too slow and boring to venture beyond the third chapter, and escort missions are a nightmare. Which is a shame, I cared for the story, characters and progression I could have made, but doing missions was just very, very boring, even with a thumping techno soundtrack that's right at home in the late 90s.","July 13, 2013","false","2.9"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","25","34","0","0"

The length of this description is appropriate given the ceaseless exposition and shoe-horning of story and game world terms into the script.\n\nThe game is not without charm though.\n\nI would suggest it is a good reference for the would be game writer. The problem presented is that the player's interaction with the world is almost entirely made up of flying a combat mini-submarine and shooting at things. The experience itself tells little story without all the radio chatter and docking bay dialog around it.\n\nAs a result, many of the characters between missions will have highly convoluted political opinions or possess absurdly esoteric knowledge. Your point of view in the story is the role of Flint, who himself seems to have some very developed opinions. This makes it quite challenging to relate to the character effectively.\n\nAn attempt to make the game relatable seems to have been made in the form of a stylistic choice in the script. The game is strewn with metaphors and similes and delivered in a film-noire-esque monotone meter. Ultimately, the game asks  too much of that stylistic choice to fix its over-riding problems.\n\nIt's a shame, since if you dig into the script, you can tell a lot of effort has been made to flesh the game world out, but it's just too esoteric. Players can handle detail, but they have to have been along for the ride that tangentially cobbles together that detail.\n\nAs for the game mechanics themselves - well your first problem on a modern system will be attempting to get the controls to work. If your optical mouse has a high polling rate which you cannot lower, you're going to have a bad time and I would suggest trying to use a pad.\n\nThere are some attempts at underwater physics in the form of currents and water resistance seems to effect the motion of the turret control (although, this could just be the modern peripheral issues). There is a ballistics system which is nice as you have to lead your target and you would expect water to have some effect on projectile velocity. The lack of speed boosting (at least up to the point I have played) is disappointing - speed as a limited resource makes for an exciting mechanic in this type of game.\n\nOn all fronts, Aquanox is a reference game that has a lot to teach the would be game-maker about the mis-use of talent. It is rough around the edges and perhaps ruined somewhat by modern computer equipment. But if you pick it up for cheap or in a bundle, I think it's worth a look.\n\nMy highlight of the game, has to be the drum & bass music with a 1950s bbc radio announcer accent layered over the top.","May 19, 2015","true","2.6"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

Underwater action, and even now, you can't call this graphic "outdated" - after 13 years, it's still not that bad on maximal settings.\nGame is really addictive, I've played it for the first time in 2003, in my childhood times.

Nuclear war and radiation fallout have rendered the surface uninhabitable, though there isn’t really much of a surface left after the polar ice caps melted and flooded the planet. Humans still survive and even thrive in underwater stations and cities, but no one has seen the surface in centuries.\n\n- Gameplay -\nAquaNox plays like a flight simulator combined with a shooter in an underwater setting. Gameplay is comprised of several linear missions with set objectives that give Credits to you, the mercenary protagonist Emerald “Deadeye” Flint. These credits can be used to purchase torpedoes, guns, shielding units and repair units for your ship. You can even buy new, improved ships.\n\n- Visuals -\nThe game was published in 2001 and shows it, although it was praised for its cutting-edge look back when it was released. The water’s light refraction patterns are fascinating to watch on the sea floor. The HUD is rather confusing, with many unlabeled progress or health bars (I’m not sure even after playing the game). The enemies are rather stiff for living beings (those that are alive, anyway).\n\n- Sound/Music -\nSound effect quality is better than contemporaries such as Half-Life, but the music is completely comprised of early 2000s electronic/industrial (probably not the exact genre, but gives you an idea). Deadeye Flint’s voice acting is normal; the rest, not so much. This game probably has the worst voice acting in any game I’ve ever experienced. From perpetually drunk/high-sounding actors to “women” who are obviously painfully high falsetto male voices, be thankful the dialogue is skippable.\n\n- My Thoughts -\nI really liked this game after I got used to thinking in three dimensions. Unlike flight simulators, this game has swim up and down buttons, which got a lot of use from me. I also really liked the game physics and attention to detail, like if you press back twice your engine shuts off. The missions were varied enough to provide a challenge and keep things interesting. Enemy variety wasn’t fabulous, but not boring either. There are no checkpoints in the missions, so each time you fail you have to play the whole thing over again. It’s a short game, less than eight hours for me – it will take longer if you up the difficulty.\n\n- Conclusion -\nBuy this game. It’s a short, good oldie from the turn of the millennium that’s only $5 regular price. If it goes on sale for $0.49, there’s no reason not to pick it up. Just don’t expect flawless voice acting. Despite how terrible they are, it’s actually quite funny at times. Light! (standard Aquarian greeting/goodbye)\n\nNot Recommended\nRecommended With Caution\n- Recommended\nHighly Recommended\nRecommended as Essential","January 17","true","7.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","9","9","3","4"

Its graphics are very colourful and atmospheric (and some may argue better than the graphics of its darker successor because of this), sound effects are satisfying and fitting.\n\nThe voice acting is mostly done pretty well, and the story is being told by well written conversations between lots of intriguing characters that are presented through well-drawn images in a fitting art style.\n\nThe combat itself is good, firing weapons feels satisfying, torpedos find their targets somewhat too rarely and the difficulty and length can vary greatly between missions, but overall the game manages to capture the vibe of submarine combat very well.\n\nThe plot can be confusing at times and the cutscenes between chapters of the game are of lackluster quality for some reason, but nonetheless I enjoyed my playthrough a lot.\n\nI you liked games like Freelancer, and generally prefer action over realism and rpg-elements, this is for you.\n\nConsidering the very low price you can get it for these days, I recommend picking this game up for a few hours of submarine action, and if you do happen to like it, you may also take a look at the great sequel.","December 20, 2013","true","12.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

The graphics are decent, for the time period, but that's about it. You'd exepct a game that's essentially a six degrees of freedom shooter to have appropriate controls, but the controls are more like a FPS, which does not mesh well with what's going on.\n\nThe story is... Confusing to say the least. I was able to determine that, after a terrible nuclear war, humanity began living underwater. Beyond that, I'm not sure what's going on. The audio balancing on the cutscenes is so bad I could barely make out the voices past the music. The conversations are so seemingly random, with the plot simple jumping in several points without warning.\n\nPerhaps the game's worst offense, and it's one that's seen a lot in games of this era, is the terrible escort/protect the objective missions. The game throws so many enemies/turrets at you at once and your allies will blindly follow their programmed path that protecting them, or an objective, is so incredibly difficult that it's hard not to just skip levels. Even playing on Easy, which was proving overall unchallenging, I failed each and every protect/escort mission several times.\n\nThe idea is great, the world is interesting, but the game itself is more of an excerise in patience.","May 6, 2014","false","7.4"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

But after I installed the game I discovered a lot of technical issues.  First of all, there is no crossfire profile for this game, so if u got crossfire setup, you need to turn it off or you will get a nice flickering. Second problem comes if you choose the controllers of the game. Can be controlled by keyboard+joystick or keyboard+mouse combo. If you choose the later one and you have a modern laser mouse, you'll experince  slow response time, which is kinda annoying. One solution for this problem, if you can get an older optical mouse. And finally let’s talk about the a game bit. If you want an undersea simulation or oceanic real-time strategy, then forget it, but if you're a fan of arcade action and great dialogues, then don't hesitate and grab it, even with those technical issues.","June 27, 2015","true","11.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It's one of those games I always wanted to play back in time, but never really had the chance to do so. Cyberpunkish submarine dogfights with crazy characters at 5000m under the sea, with sea monsters and ♥♥♥♥? What could possibly go wrong?\n\nMany years later, recently, I finally put my hands on it. Contrary to my expectations I find that the game aged pretty well. The colorful graphics, although from 2001, are still nice to look at with all those light and plankton FX. Characters and voice actors are indeed cheesy, but really do entertain. So does the soundtrack, that could have been composed by The Prodigy in the flesh... Gameplay is fast and uncomplicated, there's even some nice cutscenes - what more could one want?\n\nThere are still some remaining issues like the default sensitivy with modern mice or the really unvaried mission design. In most levels you just dive from point A to B and shoot the ♥♥♥♥ out of Bionts, Crawlers or later Sea Monsters. The conversation sequences between the missions are also not everyone's cup of tea, although I was actually fine with it.\n\nAfter about 10 hours you'll see the ending flickering over your screen and you may be dissapointed by the rather open ending. But it's definitely an entertaining experience after all, and that's what counts.\n\nThe Good:\n+ Colorful and detailed graphics (for its time)\n+ Interesting concept\n+ Entertaining singleplayer campaign\n+ Fine gameplay\n+ Memorable music\n+ Multiplayer\n+ Cutscenes\n+ Cheesy but solid voice acting\n\nThe Bad:\n- No real variety in mission design\n- Not a too wide selection of submarines and weapons\n- Story and characters not everyone's taste\n\nThe Ugly:\n-- Control issues with modern mice\n\n8/10","July 15, 2015","true","10.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

While 1-hit KO'ing most enemies, their targeting is terrible. One often has to resort to firing even high-end torpedoes at point-blank range; despite this, they will often veer off at the last moment. It is a small mercy that enemy rockets are almost as bad at hitting you.\n\n.Auto-lose conditions. Aquanox has DOZENS of missions to the tune of 'protect the transport' or 'kill the target before time runs out'. Dealing with veritable sh*t storms of enemy craft over and over again because you couldn't blow them up fast enough to protect your mark is the pinnacle of frustration.\n\n.Incomprehensible story. The story of Aquanox is vague, at best. Add to this the frankly atrocious voice acting and sound balance so bad one often can't hear characters over background music, and you'll find yourself skipping most dialogue.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nAquanox is one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. I saw it through to the end on the promise of giant sea monsters, though not without suffering puke-inducing rage brought on by endless escort missions. While it's great blowing up easier-to-hit craft, the sheer annoyance of most of the story campaign kills the fun factor.","October 20, 2014","false","31.1"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

In a post-apocalyptic Earth where humanity now survives in the barely-restored ecosystems of the ocean floor, you play as "Deadeye" Flint, a Biont Wars veteran who's trying to make due as a mercenary since your personal submarine got stolen, just as a new menace comes forth from the depths.\n\nPros: The setting is unusual for the genre, as you are in an underwater sub rather than space. You're given some freedom to evolve, acquire new subs and weapons as the story progress, travel to different underwater stations, meet new people as you make money completing objectives. The game is open-ended and does its best to make the world feel like a complex society of relationship webs.\n\nCons: The game aged horribly. If you're not wearing nostalgia goggles, you'll quickly see how graphics, sound and voice acting are terrible by today's standard. The ocean floor looks like early 90s 3D model landscapes, with a few algae plants here or there. I get that it's supposed to be barren, but that doesn't make the ocean any less bland-looking. The ocean floor isn't deep at all, removing the usual "full 3D" illusion space-based games of the genre have, and there's invisible walls everywhere a sub your's size should normally easily fit. The game refers to a whole bunch of places, names, locations and things to do, but it's just flavortext meant to tell a story that won't make sense even to those that played its prequel Archimedean Dynasty and only serves to make the few actually important reference hard to spot. Controls are ruined by badly balanced mouse sensibility: both too high AND too low, it's so high that targeting is a pixel-twitchy ordeal, yet it's so low it takes forever to turn 180° (and adjusting the sensibility makes one a lot worst before the other gets better).\n\nVerdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget it\n\nI can understand this game is appreciated by those that played it back when it was considered a premium game. And I know some new comers might enjoy it (heck, I've seen a lot worst get fan support!), but my recent attempts left me thinking "I didn't remember it being that bad!", so there is no one I know I'll actually recommend AquaNox to.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","March 13, 2015","false","10.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

That being said, the graphics aren’t “too” bad when you keep in mind how old it is. The game’s settings allow some manipulation of Level of Detail, and at max settings it looks better than the old Half Life 1 game, but still worse than Half Life 2. The cutscenes however, are of horrible quality and honestly I’m not sure if it was done that way on purpose. (Super cloudy and low res visuals accompanied by a voice over).\n\nThe game’s story is extremely complicated, and even an hour or so into the game I had the itching feeling that I had accidently started Aquanox 2 before playing the first game. Both games were part of a semi recent bundle, so it was a legitimate concern. You get dropped right into the story as the character Emerald, a sort of freelance fighter pilot who goes from city to city kicking ♥♥♥ and making money. There’s a whole backstory about global warming covering the Earth in water and various factions fighting for domination. The game’s opening cinematic talked a bunch about genetically engineered dinosaurs and stuff, but I haven’t seen any, just enemy subs.\n\nAquanox is a first person underwater fighter simulator, but something to note is that you don’t control “thrust.” You press forward and it goes forward, press back and it goes back. It’s not like a lot of other simulators where you use +/- thrust and momentum, in fact movement is kind of like a 3 dimensional first person shooter (no momentum, and you can circle strafe). Combat is quite simple, where you use your gun (you can only use one gun at a time) and missiles to destroy enemy subs in dogfights. Missiles are much more powerful than guns, but you buy them individually so if you want to save money, just rely on guns with their infinite ammo. There’s also an EMP type weapon if you don’t want to actually destroy your enemies. This is really only a story based feature and most of the time it’s easier to just blow people up. It’s not like you get to salvage their ships.\n\nSpeaking of salvage, your compensation in the game doesn’t seem to take into account how many enemies you blow up. And you don’t get experience either (this isn’t an RPG) which means that sometimes you can just complete objectives and run from the enemy and not be penalized. Between missions you spend your time in “cities” which are basically just hubs where you can buy upgrades for your ship and talk to people to get your next mission. One thing I noticed about ship upgrades is that you seem to be able to sell weapons for the same price you bought them for. This means you can experiment with the different weapons and see which ones you like without losing money, except for the missiles of course, which are bought 1 at a time and you should probably just save those for blowing up big enemies.\n\nAnother thing to note about city hubs is that there is only one exit called “dock” where you start the next mission. When you’re talking to people in the city you can start optional missions by going to the dock immediately after talking to the person. If you keep talking to different people the game will override the side mission with the next story mission, and you’ll lose it forever. I didn’t realize this until about half way through the game and I have no idea how many side missions I missed out on. When you go to the dock it doesn’t give you options of which mission you want to play, it just sends you out into the water.\n\nPros:\n+I really enjoy games where you get to earn money to upgrade your vehicle (especially weapons) and customize your ride according to the levels’ requirements. There’s not too much customization in Aquanox, but I still liked it.\n+In fighter simulators, it always nice to go up against larger ships, not just enemy fighters. The big bombers and frigates in Aquanox can be a challenge unless you unleash the missiles.\n\nCons:\n-It’s an old game, with all that entails: Dated graphics (still acceptable), not as much online information (how do I use the heal kit?!?), bad voice acting.\n-I can’t help but compare this game to Freespace 2, which I played exclusively for months. Freespace 2 is in my opinion superior in every way.\n\nDon’t play this game for the story since it won’t really make sense with everything they’re throwing at you. It’s like they tried to make up their own world and dropped you into in halfway through. They certainly gave it a lot of thought though, as if they based the game on a novel that I haven’t read. If you enjoy space fighter simulators such as Descent, Freespace, Wing Commander, you may enjoy Aquanox.\n","March 6, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are a mercenary in a futuristic dystopia where the entire Earth is underwater and under attack by an alien race called the Bionts. The plot is admittedly cliched, but the game is presented as a series of locations presented as menu driven mission hubs. Each mission takes place underwater in what can best be described as a sort of slowed down space game. The graphics actually look pretty good because, although an older game, high resolution modes are supported. However the game is really marred by constant and overlong cutscenes and narrations with extremely poor voice acting. Common English words are horribly mispronounced and the voice actor for the protagonist is wooden and dull. If that was not bad enough, the shooter action is hurt by the use of boring explosion sprites and uninspired weapon animations and sounds. Unfortunately, this game is for collectors only.","May 30, 2012","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Curunauth/recommended/39630/","Curunauth","Curunauth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Curunauth/","701 products in account","*Note: this review is based on the GOG version.*\n\nFlawed but Fun: 3/5\n\nFor starters, a piece of important advice: CHANGE YOUR MOUSE REPORT RATE.\nMany modern gaming mice report 500 to 1000 times per second, and this is too fast - motion will be jerky to nonexistent as information is dropped. I've heard reports of values as high as 250 working, but I set mine to 200 and minimum DPI, and that worked very nicely.\n\n\nVisuals:\nThe game looks good - decent geometry and detailed textures prevent it from showing its age too much, and it's perfectly happy to do 1920x1200. Weapon effects look nice and are varied enough to distinguish at a glance. In a heavy firefight, you can lose sight of a distant target in all the flash, especially if you're throwing a torrent of glowing bolts from a Plasma Gatling - for me, this was a bonus, emphasizing the hectic nature of a crowded 3D battle. Enemies and allies are visually distinct, with each faction employing ships sharing their own unique style - and some of the ships look pretty cool!\n\n\nControls:\nGameplay is a mixed bag. The concept of free 3D motion in an environment that has a definite floor and ceiling (unlike open space) is rather neat (and provides an opportunity for interesting visuals), but the execution could have been better.\n\nYou have 5 degrees of freedom in movement, but unlike most space-based 5DOF games (such as DarkStar One), the dropped element is roll. You can yaw (you actually bank left and right, but automatically come back to upright when you stop turning), pitch, strafe horizontally or vertically, and accelerate/reverse. This arrangement guarantees that the seafloor stays on the floor, and the vertical strafe is tremendously useful in some situations . . . but it also creates one of the most irritiating limitations of the system -- there is a fixed vertical axis through which you cannot pitch. If a target passes above or below you and you've been pitching up or down to track it, once you reach vertical you have to spin around to continue to track.\n\nThe other unpleasant limitation is that many missions have a very low (and invisible) ceiling. Thousands of meters of vertical space from which to launch surprise 3D flanking attacks, and you can't use it. It was a real joy to have that vertical freedom in the one mission that involves escorting a rising buoy, but normally the low ceiling limits your firing angles (really irritating when trying to hit small targets on top of several nasty enemies), traps you behind just-barely-too-high mountains (usually not a huge issue unless exploring outside the main mission area), and turns what could have been a game of true-3D tactics into something  where battles and defenses are dominated by 2D positioning, more constrained than even a terrestrial flight sim.\n\n\nStory/Acting:\nThe story is fairly typical fare, predictable but sufficient (if you can ignore the ridiculously bad science driving several plot elements). The writing is merely mediocre, although the monologues for the movies are over-long, overwrought, and underestimate the player's intelligence. The protagonist mostly re-hashes recent events in a slow near-monotone, offers some stultifyingly obvious "insights", then delivers a faux-philosophical wannabe-warrior-poet musing. Over time, this becomes less irritating, although I'm not sure whether it's due to getting used to it, or the writers running out of time and padding the speeches less heavily.\n\nThe voice acting, however, ranges from bad to terrible, with a healthy sprinkling of rage-inducingly painful. The most grating element is Lt. Bonham, with her whiny voice, strangely off-tempo delivery, obsession with grade-school fun science facts (not all of them correct), and tendency to ramble. It's bad enough in the "talk" sections in port, but those are skippable / can be read with headphones off; the worst bit is that she talks during missions. It's a bad sign when my reaction to failing a mission is not "dangit, all that wasted effort!" but "Oh NO, I have to listen to my wingman again!!" instead.\n\n\nDifficulty:\nInitially, the unusual controls may be an issue, but they're fine once you get used to them - the only real problems I had were the slow ascent, low ceiling, and occasionally the vertical pitch limit mentioned above. Those used to flight sims will lament the lack of a lead indicator. Long missions with distinct, cutscene-separated sections can be frustrating to re-do from the start when you fail, but I mostly found it to be a nice challenge that enhanced the tension of later stages. Where an unexpected Scalar Howitzer to the face might just prompt you to return to a save from two minutes ago in some games, here it creates an adrenaline rush as you struggle to stay alive and complete the suddenly-desperate mission. The final mission did become frustrating, but finally beating it at high difficulty gave a nice feeling of accomplishment. At higher difficulties, strategy matters, and you need to think about tactics in the harder missions (hint: you *can* consistently hit Headshax with guided missiles if you do it right; look at what allows them to go into that failing orbit). Fortunately, you can change the difficulty level any time in port.\n\nAs with many games, some missions make certain ships invincible so that you can't derail the story. Fortunately, you'll realize rather quickly and can avoid them. More frustratingly, there are a couple occasions when a ship you know you want to destroy is marked non-hostile; if you're not paying attention, killing it fails the mission. Just watch the color!\n\n\nLevels, Strategy, and Other Elements:\nA customizable Single-Player instant fight would be nice, but the 4 included arena fights are at least interesting, particularly the you-vs-an-army "Asylum" (hint: you can retreat and recover as much as you like, it's neither timed nor an escort mission). The game does get points for crowded, hectic battles, including the final level and the 3-area defense against the crawler assault late in the game. I found the latter unfortunately easy even on max difficulty, but it was still fun. It also earns points for genuinely varied weapons: the EMP gun is a bit forced (useful only in missions requiring non-lethal assault), but all the weapons have a useful tactical role at some point. You can trade in your guns, hardware, and ships at purchase price, so you can change load-out every mission, to anything you can afford. In addition to providing some fun variety, that choice can matter a lot, particularly your missile mix.\n\n\nThe Verdict:\nOverall, the game has a neat concept, looks good, has decent controls with a few limitations, gives you freedom to try and switch between all affordable load-outs, and provides weapons varied enough to suit a variety of tactics; this would earn it 4 stars, but numerous irritating flaws drag it down to a three - the voice acting, the tactics-limiting low ceilings, a couple situations in which missiles should not fail but do, and the frustration with multi-part missions, although I'm of two minds on the last one because I usually liked the challenge.\n\nI feel a bit bad giving it a 3, but it just hasn't earned that 4. Still, it convinced me to buy Aquanox 2, which addresses most of the flaws and is definitely worth trying.","May 30, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The same cast of character is back from that submarine combat game, but there have been some major changes in game play which will not sit well with anyone, let alone fans of the first game.  Let me ask you this question:  did you ever think your submarine would control better as a first person shooter?  Not a flight simulator, more like a bozo in a diving suit.  No?  Well the makes of this game did!  All of the placed turrets to shot all angles in the last game are gone, the only weapons are in the front of the sub.  Marvel in horror as your sub PUT A WEAPON AWAY to fire the next!  That’s right, you can’t even fire torpedoes at the same time as your guns.  Sadly many features which worked well with the directional guns and turrets of the game like quadrant armor, it doesn’t quite work as an FPS.  As you need to be facing the enemy to fire at them now you can only watch as your front armor disappears slowly, with barely a bit to any other side, and with no way to heal or repair during a mission until much later in the game.  Unfortunately the AI isn't very good, and it’s easy to miss mission critical check points, forcing you to go back to find those spots wile your AI companions leave for whatever the next mark instead of supporting you.  There is also no saving during a mission, and no save points.\n\nIf you can stomach playing this game, enjoy.  Your protagonist is a heroic soldier who was a hero in the last game.  His name is Emerald, and he doesn't know what the Sun is.\n\nAvoid","February 4, 2014","false","4.8"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

The story is pretty weak, the voice-acting is horrible (german version), but gameplay-wise I had a lot of fun playing this game. Despite it´s age, you can choose high resolutions and the graphics are not too ugly and colourful. You can buy different ships, weapons and upgrades, which is a lot of fun. The missions vary quite a bit and you need to talk to different people on every underwater-station for the story-progress. This part can be annoying due to the terrible voice-acting and the slow story progression, but somehow it´s a charming trash story. The AI on the lowest difficulty level can be pretty challenging. The dark atmosphere and the upgrade mechanic of of the game kept me playing, even if it just plays underwater, the devs put effort in designing interesting landscapes, ships and enemies. So if you prefer games like X-Wing/Tie Fighter or Wing Commander you should give Aquanox a try!\n\n\n\nTechnical details\n\nThe game is pretty old, but it runs fine on windows 10. Higher resolutions can be chosen in the graphic-settings. You will need to adjust the sensitivity of your mouse, otherwise your movement will be too fast during your play. It is possible to do this in the game in the setup menu or outside the game in the "ini-file". It also might help to lower the resolution of your monitor a bit to get a better experience while moving.\n\nThere is a bug in mission 29 where enemies keep on respawning until the mission fails, so just restart the mission and play again.","April 9","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
