The last thing a creative person needs is for the world to say "I liked that last thing you did better", and that's all that the big review sites are doing right now.  For someone to really push themselves and find new aspects of their art and their creation process, they have to stretch their legs and try new things - in my case I try drawing different art styles, I try different media, just to see what I can learn about it and whether I like the way I do it.\n\nThis is a pretty bold step in game creation for these guys, Mr. Gao in particular, and it might not seem like such a big deal but to try and tell a story through just actions and visuals (and fantastic music) is a lot more challenging than you might think.  I think they did a great job, considering the length, and considering how little we got to know the characters within the frame of the story.\n\nI understand if you have your preferences between games from Freebird, and that's fine, I have preferences with my own work as well, but at the end of the day you can't vilify people for trying new things.

This is a much shorter title, that tells a less emotional story about a elementary student, his paper airplanes and a pet pigeon.\n\nThe Pros:Beautifully Pixelated - The pixel art is amazing and everything looks incredible (from an artistic point of view, obviously). The world is interestingly build, and the level design is amazing. It also features a bit of "Antichamber"-like environment changes, where the map's layout changes to better suit the storytelling.\n\nGreat Ambient - The background music is superb. A beautiful series of piano compositions that wonderfully suit the mood of the story. If you like listening to music while studying or doing light work, consider getting the OST for this song as well.\n\nTouching Story - The story is very emotional, sad, happy, worrying, it will take you through an emotional roller-coaster (though NOT comparable with To the Moon. So if you came here for an even sadder story, then don't be too exited). However, I will give it bonus points for making the entire story dialogue free, and still sending such a powerful message. It is shown as if remembered years later (background characters are shadowed, and only relevant places are explorable) and has just the right pace to let you sink in what you see. I won't say anything further, because I want you to enjoy the unknown as much as I did.The Cons:Short - This is just an hour long game, and even though I list this as a con, it's more like of an observation. This was never meant to be a game. This is, as the description perfectly puts it, "a light interactive animation". You come here for a story. And if a story is amazing, it doesn't matter how long it takes to listen to it.\nMETA / Worth MentioningAchievement - In order to 100% this game all you need to do is play it to the end. Great story and a perfect game to add to your collection to boot!\nConclusionI recommend this game to anyone who likes light stories, has an hour of free time and is ready to watch and interact with a beautiful story. As far as I am concerned, given the game's scope, I can't find anything wrong with this game.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

For my full review, please visit  RealGamerReviews[realgamerreviews.com]\n\nBackground\n2011’s To The Moon was regarded by many as having one of the best narratives in video game history. It was a gripping, heartfelt and original story that captured the attention and hearts of myself and many other gamers. Despite the sub-par gameplay, To The Moon remains one of my favourite games of all time. Needless to say, I was expecting a lot from A Bird Story, the spiritual successor to one of the most emotion-driven games of this era. Did it deliver? I'd say partially.\n\nGameplay\nLike its predecessor, A Bird Story is very much an emotion-driven game. So much so, that it carefully flirts with the definition of what a “game” is. The developer Kan “Reives” Gao himself referred to this title as a “light interact animation”, and he’s certainly not being modest here. To put it lightly, the gameplay for A Bird Story is garbage. On first glance, it may look like the long-lost cousin of a SNES-era Squaresoft RPG, but instead plays far more similarly to a point-and-click title. You’ll find no battles here. You’ll also struggle to find any puzzles to solve. The game is a very on-rails endeavour that takes you by the hand and leads you through the experience. It’s impossible to get lost or stuck, and there’s no way to fail during any segment in the game. It's a very bare-bones shell of a game, but It allows you to soak in everything that’s going on, sparing you from unnecessary or tedious gameplay elements.\n\nThis begs the question though – Why have any gameplay to begin with? There are other games such as Gone Home which are similarly narrative or emotion-driven titles that also, for the most part, lack meaningful gameplay elements, but allowing a player to control the central character in Gone Home added plenty to the atmosphere of the game, something that was paramount to the experience. In contrast to this, the gameplay elements in A Bird Story add absolutely nothing to the experience and serve as a somewhat tedious guise for a game that really shouldn’t have had any gameplay elements to begin with. I spent the majority of the game sitting back on my chair, drink in hand, happily enjoying myself and watching the story elements unfold. Every time that the game gave me control of the character again, I groaned.\n\nYou might say that To The Moon had similarly awful gameplay, which was arguably more tedious and unnecessary (in particular, the meaningless puzzle segment in between the “stages”). However, what that title lacked in gameplay was more than made up for by its incredible storyline and the emotional journey the player underwent throughout the experience. So how does the story in A Bird Story compare?\n\nStory\nA Bird Story places you in the shoes of a young, lonely school boy, who befriends a wild bird that he rescues. Sadly, the narrative isn’t nearly as fleshed out or original as its predecessor – A lonely child befriending an animal is hardly anything to write home about. It’s been done before, and undoubtedly will be done again. In its defence however, the game lacks any dialogue at all. There’s no voice acting or text that appears anywhere on the screen to help illustrate what’s happening. Whilst this is adequate for the relatively simple story it’s trying to tell, constructing an overly-complicated and imaginative storyline in this manner would be understandably difficult.\n\nWhat this game does do just as well as its predecessor relates to its ability to convey the emotions and thoughts of the young boy, as well as his connection to his wild avian friend – a feat made all the more impressive by the lack of dialogue. You know the character is lonely because throughout the game, no other human being in the game has anything more than a blacked-out face. It’s the developer’s way of telling you that the silent protagonist is socially isolated, and whilst other people exist in the world that he lives in, he and these other members of society have a mutual disinterest in each other. One segment of the game has you walking around a park full of other people, with a speech bubble occurring when you run your mouse over them. When you walk towards the people however, they disappear. It’s a powerful image that I’ve butchered with my limited vocabulary and inability to write English with any real flair, but hopefully you’ll experience it and understand it for yourself.\n\nPresentation\nVisually, the game maintains the 16-bit SNES-era aesthetic found in its predecessor. Whilst there’s nothing particularly breath-taking about a graphics engine that we left 20 years ago, it’s an aesthetic that’s held up well and is pleasant to the eyes. On the other hand, the piano-heavy soundtrack for the game is phenomenal and adds a lot to the mood set by the game. It’s appropriately relaxing and serene when it should be, but becomes more high-tempo when the action picks up, and eerily silent when something ominous is afoot. My only complaint is that the music is often disproportionately loud compared to the sound effects of the game, with no option to balance the sound output.\n\nOverall impression\nWhilst overall not quite as impressive as its predecessor, A Bird Story does tell a decent, emotion-driven story about a young boy and his new pet that’s easy understand and relate to. With that said, the gameplay itself is both uninspired and, in my opinion, completely unnecessary. As much as I enjoyed myself “playing” this game, I’m more inclined to tell you to watch a Youtube video of the game being played rather than paying money to play through yourself. Regardless of whether you buy it or watch it, it’s definitely worth at least a run through. More importantly, I’m excited to see what Kan Gao has in store for us with future releases.","December 29, 2014","true","2.0"," 56 of 66 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","56","66","0","0"

It is more of an experience.  If you enjoy experiencing the “alternative” games that pop up from time to time (for example: The Plan, Goat Simulator, and To the Moon) then you will may want to experience A Bird Story as well.  Just understand what it is before you get into it: not a game, but more an abstract piece of art in the industry of gaming.\n\nIt tells an entertaining tale and there are some funny little moments.  The main story arc is touching and emotional.  It isn’t quite as in depth and emotional as To the Moon was, but it certainly is a game in the same vein and will likely strike similar chords when you play it.\n\nThere isn’t really much to elaborate on.  It is pixel-graphics and the story is told through music and a few emoticons rather than text or speech.  The interesting medium through which the story is told is what gives the game its unique feel and charm.\n\nSo if you enjoy the fad games that are more a piece of art than they are truly a “game,” you may want to check out A Bird Story.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","March 1, 2015","true","2.2"," 57 of 68 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","57","68","0","0"

"A boy finds an injured bird" might not sound like a great story, but it's so well animated that you can't help but chuckle or outright burst into laughter.  It does get a bit sad towards the end, especially thanks to the amazing music, but it's not quite as dramatic as To The Moon was.\n\nDoes it have any flaws? Well, if you're bothered by the protagonist knocking on the floor instead of the door he's standing at. Sure. But if you know what you're getting into, it's satisfying from start to finish. And since fantasy and reality merge once in a while, the game uses some interesting effects.\n\nSo if you liked To The Moon, give A Bird Story a chance. Who knows when the next installment in the series will be released? By the way, if you stick with it all the way to the end, you will actually find out the name of the sequel.

'A Bird Story' completely satisfied me from a storytelling standpoint and gave me plenty of feeling even with its short length.\n\nThe story focuses on following a young boy who is an only child. While we aren't introduced to his parents, or even learn much, if anything about them, we do get enough information to show that this young boy is left to fend for himself as a latchkey kid. (a child with working parents who aren't home to send a child off to school, or home when they return) We see how he wakes in the morning to find himself home alone, with a need to feed himself, and his only interaction from his family being a possible note by the apartment door as he leaves for school reminding him to take an umbrella on rainy days. Anyone growing up as an only child,  or as a latchkey kid, should be able to relate to him quite easily and find sympathy for him. We see what it is like for a young child trying not only to entertain themselves while being left alone, but how much they search for any sort of friendship, companionship, and love.\n\nWhile there is no voice acting, or even text dialogue between characters in the story, the storytelling combined with the superb music and animations make it easy to feel the emotions that the boy faces going through his daily life. You can easily understand what characters are communicating without words. All of this makes his special adventure that sets up 'A Bird Story' all that more powerful knowing how much it means to him to find a friend, even if it is only a bird.\n\nThe criticism most levied against 'A Bird Story' is that it is too short. While arguments can be made for its length vs. price, I don't feel like the story would have been better served by extending the length. A retail price of just $4.99 is low enough that I cannot in good conscience say that the game is overpriced for how much I enjoyed the story. The game can be completed in about 90 minutes, but I still felt that I wasn't ripped off when I completed the game. Cheaper than a movie for the same length.\n\n'A Bird Story' was more relatable to me as an only child until I was well into my teens than To the Moon was (The masterpiece we all played from the developer already). I thought the story structure was better here, but can't really say it is a better story even if I personally enjoyed it more. Spending a lot of time alone as a kid trying to entertain oneself you learn to use your imagination quite well. The game has many elements of this inside the story in which you will be doing things that aren't natural to real world mechanics. Flying on a paper airplane you make for instance. This gives the game a mix of reality and fantasy while telling the story, and will make you wonder if this world just has different rules, or it might just be imagination come to life.\n\nWhile To the Moon was an RPG with some gameplay elements that would pop up in which you had to solve puzzles and do things, 'A Bird Story' has no in depth gameplay mechanics. Puzzles are simple and only used for story pushing ahead. Perfect casual experience without need for excessive problem solving thinking.\n\nI highly recommend 'A Bird Story' for anyone in the mood for a short, but touching story. The way the story is told almost completely visually without the help of text dialogue, or voice acting is excellent.  The story may be short, but the emotions are high, and well worth the time played. I enjoyed it immensely, and it is a perfect little game to play instead of watching a movie some evening. Music is also fantastic.\n\nRATING 9/10 Forever Alones\n\n'A Bird Story' includes a 5 trading card badge (3 drops) and 1 Achievement for story completion. Easy 100% in under 2 hours.","March 29, 2015","true","1.4"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","48","54","0","6"

I bought it on release, but interestingly found myself not playing it for a couple of months after. I cannot say why this is, other than I knew I wanted to wait for a completely free day so I could sit down, relax and immerse myself in what I expected would be a game as beautiful and fun as To The Moon.\n\nHow wrong I was. A Bird Story is, simply put, tedious. I found myself looking around the room or to my tablet every few minutes about fifteen minutes into the game. There is simply not enough going on. It plays as though it should be a short film; any interaction the game lets you have is short, repetitive and wrested away from you at a moment's notice. It hardly even feels like interaction at all, because the game is so linear and I feel actually punishes exploration. The protagonist will have a little picture of what he needs to do before letting you continue the story, meaning that he refuses to leave an area before you 'accomplish' his goal, which usually equates to going to an item and pressing enter. This means that the world created feels incredibly small and confined; it consists of the protagonist's house, one classroom, a vet's, a forest path and some skyline.\n\nI could have let the tedious gameplay go, if only the story was interesting. However, sadly it was not. It was predictable, cliché and vague, to the point where when what I suppose is the story's climax happened, I found myself not caring. To The Moon was an extremely emotional, complex story that had many layers of hurt and tragedy hidden beneath artificial happiness. A Bird Story felt pretentious, trying so desperately to be packed full of meaning and substance that it simply became meaningless and empty.\n\nIt is unfair, of course, to compare the two games, but I left To The Moon feeling as though I had just played a masterpiece, one that I went to bed with the night after playing it without playing a different game or reading a book as I needed to sort out its meaning and beauty in my head. I left A Bird Story feeling as though I was ready to play a different game straight afterwards.","December 23, 2014","false","1.5"," 165 of 259 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","165","259","3","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/327410/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","A Bird Story, more than anything, feels like a story someone wanted to tell as opposed the one people are expecting.\n\nIt's a simple, entirely narrative driven experience about a young lonely boy finding a friend in an injured bird, which in many ways hits every note you would expect and never tries to do much outside of its familiar framework. But to look at it simply from that perspective would be missing what makes it so special.\n\nThere's a meticulous, firm vision guiding every scene of the game, instilling within a great amount of heart and humanity which is evident in even the smallest of details. There are no "big" reveals in A Bird Story; no end twist, character revelation, or plot point that suddenly opens the narrative up into anything more than its trying to be. And that's OK, because like To The Moon before it it's the tiny, ordinary moments which stand out as the most poignant. Sharing an ice cream cone or building a paper airplane become something memorable and emotional, causing me to smile and appreciate them for their simple existence.\n\nTelling a story without and dialogue, regardless of complexity is no easy task, but A Bird Story is so perfectly designed around this (arguable) limitation that it never feels as if something is being left out for the sake of some forced design decision or challenge. It causes small character actions to have that much more weight behind them, every visual and audio cue serving a purpose and every tiny sprite showing an immense amount of emotion and character that brings the world to life, and makes the lack of dialogue a strength as opposed a hindrance.\n\nThe experience crosses between fantasy and reality on a regular basis, but within the context of the game it never feels out of place or something that somehow couldn't happen. There's something magical about A Bird Story that allows these moments to exist without having to be grounded in logic or reason, and it makes for an experience that's easy to lose yourself in as you stop caring about the "why" as everything simply fits.\n\nIt's probably fair to say that A Bird Story won't have the same effect on people or leave as long lasting an impression as To The Moon, but it was never supposed to. It's an uncomplicated story told in a way that makes it enchanting, occasionally stumbling with its pacing but ultimately delivering a story that, more than anything, left me smiling and wanting to share it with the people around me.","November 7, 2014","true","1.2"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","36","45","0","0"

The experience is tightly controlled, and the player interacts at key points such as rescuing the bird, giving it food, and playing with it. The sweeping sequence where they go on a paper airplane flight to help the bird find its family is magical and literally a flight of fancy.

I dont think it is fair to compare it to To The Moon, since it is its own entity, so looking at this game on its own, I think it's easy to recommend it. It isnt fast paced, and takes about half the game to develop, which may be a turn off for some people, as that first half was kind of boring. However, once everything really starts to come together, the set up was revealed as pretty necessary for developing the conneciton between the boy and the bird. The second half...well...I think it is pretty gripping. Not as an adult ♥♥♥♥♥, but as seen through the eyes of a child, or simply through the act of remembering your own childhood, this game scores in spades for waht it was trying to accomplish.\n\nthe controls themselves are as basic as can be. Directional moving and clicking on the occasional item. You will run into things and get stuck occcasionally, which can be a minor annoyance, but really, the gamepolay is secondary, and just the avenue towards the telling of the tale.\n\nThe music was pretty spot on for the game. Very nice piano work.\n\nThere was a moment of humor and many moments of levity, and the game will carry you through many emotions...sadness, happiness, pride, etc...\n\n\nIn the end, I think this game deserves your attention. It doesnt leave you in as introspective a state as TTM, but that isnt its goal really. I think if you see it through to the end, you will find it to have been a satisfying experience, and this development team has the potential for even more greatness in the future  (in fact, at the very end, they let you know what their next project is/will be). A perfect use for the RPG Maker programs as well.\n\n8/10\n\nbtw...my total play time was around an hour and fifteen minutes. When I get done farming the rest of the cards, it will be more, but that was the actual length of the game.","December 29, 2014","true","7.5"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

We all know how popular and touching To The Moon was, so I was definitely up for trying out a new game by the same people. It definitely shows, you can tell straight away by the style of the game that it’s cut from the same cloth.\n\nI’ll go ahead and just straight up say that it’s no To The Moon. But it’s great and it’s different in its own respect. I won’t go as far as saying To The Moon is better. They are both charming little stories of which I enjoyed both very much.\n\nThe attention to detail is great, I love the quirky little humour and the small things that really do make this something special. It’s a little more personal and you get a little more into it because of it. I think that is something these developers are really good at.\n\nThe music is nice. It’s relaxing and in ways emotional. It really helps add to the experience of the story. This is something else these developers are good at! I would honestly say there is very few games I would actually listen to the music casually. But this and To The Moon are definitely exceptions. Very casual, calm and relaxing music.\n\nAs far as story goes, it’s very well told and very surreal. It has an almost movie sequence and dream-like charm to it. I’m not sure if it is actually a dream or if that is just the world in general. Either way, I like it!\n\nNow I am the biggest of pansies when it comes to emotional games and reading some of the reviews I honestly expected this to be a lot more emotional than it was for me. That just may well be because I hyped it up to much for myself so was expecting absolutely disaster, but I can still see why it’s considered emotional.\n\nAll in all this is a sweet little story. It’s a nice short (around an hour) experience and an easy 100% game! So what are ya waiting for?!\n\n\nTL;DR : Good humour, good attention to detail, nice music, a well told and cute story with a surreal feel.

A daydreaming, and somewhat set apart boy finds a wounded bird and tries to nurse him back to health. The wordless adventure will leave some players feeling a bit lost or disconnected from the characters: none of the pantomiming seems to be confusing, but it certainly does have as many shades as language does. It is also a fairly simple story with no twist, and in that sense it is markedly different from To The Moon.  It is story that is told in a few hours, but it is simple and sweet in a way not often seen, especially in this medium.\n\n\nThe gameplay aspect is on the minimal side, so you are playing to watch a wordless story. The interjections of gameplay (mostly button prompts) is a slight experimentation on the developer's part that adds a bit more to the experience. The minimalism of the game, in story or gameplay, did not detract from the experience.

Suffice it to say, if you have an hour to kill, enough spending cash to buy lunch, and at least a single empathetic cell in your body, you should give A Bird Story a shot.\n\nSpoilers below:\nOverall, I feel the story works. In To The Moon, Ken Gao stripped almost all 'gamey' elements in order to tell a relatively uninterrupted story. A Bird Story feels like the logical extension of that trend by stripping away all dialogue, opting to tell the story through pantomime and the distortion of reality. What I mean by this is the main character, an estranged little boy, is somewhat of an unreliable narrator. We perceive the game world through the filter of his imagination. Environments blend, objects shift, and minor characters are faceless almost as if we're experiencing his dream.\n\nThis works... mostly. It's certainly a unique way to present the story but sometimes confuses what is actually happening in the real world. Perhaps that was the point. Another issue I have is the comedy bit. It just didn't work for me. To The Moon had some wonderful moments of levity because they were based around characters we got to know. Here, it felt like an overly long homage to the Benny Hills/Scooby Doo chase scene that came out of nowhere and broke the mood Ken spent 40 minutes building.\n\nAnything I say about the ending will become immediately irrelevant once the full sequel puts it into full context. Taken on its own, I thought it was alright. I got misty eyed but by no means did I go full tears like THAT SCENE from To The Moon.\n\nJust play it. It's $4.25 right now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/recommended/327410/","linibot","Lin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/","556 products in account","A short, whimsical, bittersweet interactive story with surreal elements, lovingly detailed and narrated without any dialogues.\n_____\n\nA bird story is one of those games where much of your enjoyment will depend in your pre-existing expectations of games, and in what you will read into the themes and the story. It is only mildly interactive and quite linear, and much of the time you are simply watching scenes unfold, yet I personally found some of the interactive moments all the more impactful because of that. It is simultaneously visually impressive for what it manages to create out of its tools, and pretty simplistic. The sometimes funny, sometimes sad visual story will be very evocative for some and almost saccharine for others, and I can easily understand both points of view. And yet I could vividly remember every detail of the 1 hour experience, a week after first playing the game. Emotionally, it hit all the marks for me. The way it manages to utilize the pixels, the colour palette, the music, the sound, the subtlest of animations to create its unspoken narrative is masterful. A second playthrough made me smile when I realised how much it uses little gaming conventions (taken out of their usual contexts) to help tell the story. There are just so many clever design details jam-packed into this tiny story, that a second playthrough actually felt worth the time, despite the fact that there is no new content to experience.\n\nSimilarly, its narrative can be as complex or simple as you are willing to let it be: It's a simple story about a boy and a bird, but it could also be about how memories are altered by time, about childhood, imagination and dreams, about loneliness and companionship, about belonging, about breaking and healing. You could just enjoy it as a lovingly animated collection of small moments and dreams in the life of a lonely kid, whimsical or heartbreaking but always delivered with an inimitable attention to detail. But it is also a story within the "To The Moon" universe, with characters and details foreshadowing the next game of the series "Finding Paradise". Of course you don't need to have played "To the Moon"  to enjoy this standalone game (though why haven't you already?). Nonetheless, according to the developer, Kan Gao, they are all related, in ways he occasionally likes to hint about in social media. If you're curious about this aspect of the story, the Freebird Games forums are worth a visit: you can find theories and conversations like this one[freebirdgames.com] about what it may or may not all mean.\n\nOr if you're like me and have ever enjoyed the pleasure of a feathered friend, you could just sit, smile and awe at the beautiful attention to detail that brings the minimalistic bird animations to life. Clearly I'm reading my own experiences into this, and those are some very rose tinted glasses, but a lot of love and understanding for birds and their behaviour seems to have been poured into the game, and some may just fly above the head of anyone who hasn't spent time with a pet bird up close. (Btw, if you're hesitating to play this because you're worried the birdie will die for dramatic effect that doesn't exactly happen, at least not overtly - though again, depends how you read everything.)\n\nThere's just so much about this game that genuinely moved me, made me think, smile, laugh and be sad, and it's all wrapped in such a tiny, lovingly wrapped package, that I am obliged to wholeheartedly recommend it. I realise that it will mean different things to different people and that not everyone will love it as much as I do, but maybe this is exactly what makes it great.\n\n______\n\nMy heartfelt thanks to the kind soul who gifted me the game on Steam and made this review possible!","December 12, 2015","true","2.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","2"

The gameplay is near minimalist as games can be, the graphics are simplistic and unassuming, and the short, one-to-two-hour story is told entirely without dialogue. Yet, in spite of its (debatable) shortcomings, this is an experience that I wholeheartedly recommend, thanks to the genuine nature of the game's narrative, which successfully blends elements of comedy and drama so effortlessly that it will have you laughing one minute, and (possibly) tearing-up the next.\n\nAiding the game's overall emotional impact is a musical score so achingly beautiful that it alone might move you to tears. Kan Gao (the creator of a Bird Story and founder of Freebird Games) illustrated his skill in creating moving musical scores with To the Moon (and before that, if you want to count his freeware titles) and the score he's crafted for a Bird Story, while differing in many ways from To the Moon's, plays just as important a role to the overall experience, arguably more so, considering that without dialogue, extra care had to be taken in order for the music to accurately reflect the emotion of each scene, based entirely on visual cues, and Gao pulls it off without a hitch.\n\nI cannot stress enough that this is a game that won't appeal to everyone, despite how much I loved it. Much of the narrative's strength comes from how relatable (to you or someone you know) its various elements are, and considering that this game is essentially nothing but story, if these elements don't click with the player, I can't say they wouldn't be justified in wondering why they paid $5 for this. That being said, if there's any part of you that can relate to being the awkward kid in class, or someone that loved playing in the rain while everyone else just stared at you like you were nuts, or ever brought a lost or weak animal home to try and care for it, then you should, at the very least, give this one a look.\n\nAdd. For my money, the music alone is worth the price of admission, so if you're curious, pick up the soundtrack bundle for the game.","November 7, 2014","true","2.5"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

It is not as tear jerking as TTM but it is still able to tell a simple yet heartwarming story in quite the best way. The art in A Bird Story is good as an RMXP game but the game is still running on a 640x480 resolution which really got under my skin. The music is up to par with TTM, boasting a handful of beautiful piano arrangements.\n\nIf you are considering getting A Bird Story, do not look for value or dollars paid per hour of gameplay, instead expect experiencing a simple, heartfelt and honest story. It is not as thought provoking and sad as To The Moon (which I would actually recommend getting even more than this) but if you are looking for a similar, more simplistic and shorter experience, look no further. My only gripe with this game is it running in 640x480 and that it took FreeBird a really damned long time to push an hour long game. Here's to hoping that Finding Paradise would come out sooner.

I currently have a cat, I had rabbits on two different occasions, and also a budgie. I did not play this game for 4 hours, it was more like ~1 - I left the game running while I went out because of its horrible checkpointing system; I refused to play through any scene again.\n\nI got this game gifted to me by a generous friend, and was interested to see what the text/voiceless gameplay would be like.\n\nIf you like text/voiceless narratives that play as more of an interactive story, birds, and have a few dollars to spare, then you may enjoy this game. I personally found it boring, but more on that later.\n\nThe aesthetics are decent - the pixel graphics over varying backgrounds are nice. The music is very good (probably the best element of the game), especially if you enjoy piano pieces. There are not that many sound assets, but they are decent enough. The story is purely subjective - many have found it to be quite emotional and sad, however, I personally found it bland and boring (definitely nothing special).\n\nThe controls are simple, and instructions are always given whenever you need to do something new. There is no tutorial because it is unnecessary (learning curve is thus non-existent) - again, the game plays as an interactive short "film." There are a few mini-games you will have to do, but each can be finished very quickly. You will mostly be moving your nameless character around the story world, with minor things to do in between.\n\nThe story involves your lock-and-key character (lack of parental interaction is implied by no parents ever in the house, only notes that you don't actually read left on the door and refrigerator) finding an injured bird and working to nurse it back to health, befriending it in the process. The character does not appear to have any friends, and gets in trouble at school because of a classmate.  Of course, this will predictably lead to it eventually healing and leaving him for the wild - cue emotions and tears. My cynical self was kind of hoping and expecting it to die.\n\nThe story is presented in a way that combines the boy's reality with his vivid imagination - indicated by constant shifts in environments and odd things occurring (like shifting trees). Seriously, the game's pacing felt a bit drawn out, even if it was only 1 hour long. There is a part  where you go to the park and sit on a see-saw, waiting for someone to join in. Later, the bird accompanies you on it, and someone jumps on the other side and launches you into space. Or maybe it's just the acid hitting hard.\n\nI'm pretty patient with stories - I read a lot of fiction (varying genres), watch a lot of movies and shows, and play an extensive amount of games (varying genres). I did not particularly enjoy this game, and found it very boring. Although the presentation was different from the norm - lack of text or dialogue - it did not really make up for the dry, formulaic, and predictable story. I've seen a number of reviews comparing this to To the Moon, criticizing it's weakness, but I can't do that since I haven't played To the Moon yet. I did, however, still find it to be a mediocre (if even) experience. The story isn't anything special.\n\nI always try to avoid mentioning the price of a game if I find it unnecessary, but for $5.49 CAD, I can easily find better narratives in my local thrift store (where most of my Star Wars Expanded Universe collection has come from).\n\nIf you are interested in storytelling in video games, however, I do recommend checking this out to see the different ways you can present a narrative. The Stanley Parable is a game that breaks the fourth wall, delivering a novel, lasting experience. Antichamber encourages players to explore the game world at their own pace. A Bird Story attempts to tell a story with no dialogue or text - only minimal movement and actions. I would recommend making the key command instructions less obstructive - perhaps make them more translucent, or reduce the size and place it in a corner. As a reviewer, I was very interested to see the mechanic of a dialogue-free interactive narrative - it would definitely be nice to see other developers attempt to use this style of presentation. As a player, however, I found the story to merely be a "meh" (or mediocre) experience.\n\nOverall, if you want a quick, dialogue-free interactive story of mediocre quality, then this experience might be a good fit for you. I personally suggest you just watch a playthrough on YouTube, and spend your money on an actual book.\n\nRecommend, only if you are genuinely interested in birds.\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","April 14, 2015","true","4.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

This is a story, and is judged here based on the quality of that story and its presentation.\n\nI am a big fan of this creator's art style, reminsicent of the 16-bit RPGs of my youth. Instead of using them for fantasy settings, collection elemental orbs to defeat some sort of wizard trying to destroy the world, a story is told in more relatable and modern human terms, with subtle artistic choices having great effect. Accompanying the whimsical visuals is fantastic music that captures and inspires the direction of the story.\n\nA selling point and the fascinating point of this story, is not a single word is used in telling the story. This game is a silent display, relying on its art and music to tell the tale. We are familiar with mute characters, who can display incredible emotion, and the restriction across the entire story really does a great service to the concept that communication is perhaps negligibly a result of language.\n\nAt 5$ this game is a short, but impactful experience. If you need a shot of feels, and  have a few hours, then this game delivers. This game, along with To The Moon are a testament to what an RPGmaker style game can allow, telling a story without sophisticated assets or any game mechanics, but allowing a different medium for storytelling.\n\nThis review flies to you on the wings of an eagle from Original Curator Group, with whom this review is affiliated.","March 26","true","1.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/recommended/327410/","PeteOzzy","PeteOzzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/","4901 products in account","I have a confused relationship with emotionally-driven adventure games. For something of this medium to grab you by the heart and make you endure such a roller coaster of cathartic feelings is a powerful and addictive experience. They leave you exhausted, spent of all your stresses and tend to be the most memorable stories of all. But why? How can something that makes you rage at the screen or leave you in complete despair ever be considered an enjoyable way to spend your time. Maybe it’s like the aforementioned fairground ride or horror movies where a rush of exhilaration triggers those wonderful endorphins or maybe we just like to feel something.\n\nWhatever it may be, the undisputed king of “there’s something in my eye” is Freebird Games. Their last title, To The Moon, was a renowned tearjerker and A Bird Story follows quite closely in its steps, thematically at least. Aside from that, there are quite a few stark differences between the two games which takes To The Moon’s divisive gameplay and spreads Marmite over it to make it even more hit or miss.\n\nYou guide a young boy through his days at school, having to get himself prepared as his parents are always absent, presumably busy with work away from home. One day, walking back alone, he finds an injured bird and decides to nurse it back to strength. From there, you have a story of bonding, loneliness, loss and coming of age most of which I’d find distasteful to give in-depth scrutiny as (much like its predecessor) the beauty comes in experiencing it for oneself. It might border on maudlin for some and certain elements are predictable from the very beginning but speaking as someone that guessed the twist for To The Moon before the reveal yet still “had a moment” regardless, it didn’t lessen the impact for me.\n\nAs an animal lover, the topic of a wounded animal immediately finds a chink in my armour. It’s well-written enough to be appreciated by people less enthused but those of us that grew up sobbing whilst watching Homeward Bound and All Dogs Go To Heaven will feel instantly engaged. It’s a much lighter topic than To The Moon’s generation spanning tale of utter sadness but it will still sting you if you get emotionally involved.\n\nI’ve said before that I’m not particularly attracted to RPG Maker games, they can look bland and repetitive and the gameplay much of a cookie cutter sameness. It’s a bit more apparent that the program was used this time round with a drops in quality and repeated scenery noticeable throughout the short lifetime. It’s not unpleasant to look at by any means but it could easily be improved. The sound work, however, is top notch with soothing piano tracks that elevated during the more stressful moments. It’s subtle work but its inclusion is vital considering there’s no speech at all; even written.\n\nIt’s a linear experience and interactive moments are few and far between. Some might find it a little light in actual gameplay but then there’s also a huge market for visual novels on Steam and A Bird Story has much more in the way of “traditional” gaming than most VNs. Additionally, the game lasts roughly an hour which is unusually short by most standards. Whilst it uses the time very well; not needing a single second more to tell the story, its brevity combined with a complete lack of replayability makes it a hard sell. For those, like me, that appreciate a guarantee you’ll see the ending of a game when you have minimal free time then it can be a welcome boon. Even then, the memorable story means you’re unlikely to need to refresh your memory later down the years so it will likely collect virtual dust once complete.\n\nI’d love to say that if you enjoyed Freebird’s other titles then this will be a surefire hit, but my experience hasn’t always proven the statement true. It’s as close to 50/50 as I have ever witnessed which makes it all the more impressive to see the developer offer a no questions asked refund for those that feel disappointed. It removes the minor gamble attached to the low entry cost and shows an impressively mature side that many developers could learn from. Hopefully, this isn’t abused as it’s a generous endeavour that goes some way to balancing Steam’s archaic refund policy. Either way, it makes it difficult to fault the game whether it leaves you cold or not.\n\nThere’s a unique experience on offer within ABS. It may be hard to preempt its success in winning you over but those that fall in love will find a beautiful short story of friendship woven with a child’s unbound imagination. I, for one, will never forget A Bird Story.","April 22, 2015","true","2.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","2"

All the memories of my childhood spent in such total lonliness and isolation. The unconditional love I found from animals (to this day.) The getting older, causing so much purity and innocence to be left behind. The slow, then sudden understanding of the pain of living.\n\nNot exactly a game, since it pretty much takes over the controls.

Just my two cents. You explore the life of a boy and an injured bird and their relationship. It follows the typical tropes of any animal, child coming of age relationship. It's not really that original, however, there are some funny moments.\n\nThe soundtrack is alright, but if you get stuck somewhere it can start to grate on your nerves, like only a music box left on forever might.\n\nGraphically it reminds me of an RPG Maker game, with original assets, and some very nice backgrounds.\n\nThe game has no dialogues and they aren't really needed, which is okay, the interactions are mostly interpretable only in one way. However, due to the lack of dialogues, you do find yourself taking a backseat more often than not.\n\nThere are no menus to control sound levels. You cannot pause the game. The only time you can take a break, without missing something is when you have direct control of the character... then you can chose to do nothing and take care of what you must. Apparently there is a pause... F12... I don't know if that means you can't take screenshots or not.... but there you go. Thanks, Top Deer.\n\nDesign overall is alright - There are issues with how the blocking of solid objects interacts with your walking space: i.e. it looks like you should be able to walk there, but there are 2 pixels of bookshelf on the right of that square and so you can't. My biggest complaint about the game, is the excessive panning. It's like the developer learned how to move the focus off the main character and decided it was needed _ALL_ the time. Instead of adding to the experience or helping me to focus on what the story teller was trying to point me at, I was rather annoyed instead. Pans to show things are great, but when they happen 4 times in the space of 20 secs and NOTHING has happened really... it's excessive. If you're not showing me something I can't already see, then no real reason to do it. You can just turn the characters head and make him look and guess what, I'll look too.\n\n/end rant\n\nOverall: 4/10 - It's okay, Nothing amazing. Time can be better spent elsehwere. Story is just like any other coming of age with pets story.

With a chance meeting between a bird and a young boy, a beautiful friendship is born.\n\nOur story begins when our protagonist happens upon an injured bird who is left flightless after a stormy accident. There are no words to help narrate the story - you are left to your own imagination.\n\nBasically, what I got from the story was this: a young boy, who was ignored in school happens upon a small bird. They quickly become good friends and, through this new friendship, he is able to forge many more. While his family is not present - I suspect they're always working or travelling - the bird is ultimately what he is able to call home.\n\nWhile he is quite comfortable with this new friendship, the bird is never fully satisfied and wishes to find its own way and family. In a nut shell, the call of the wild. Realising what is expected of him, the young boy sacrifices this new bond and goes on a journey to help assist Bird. Thus begins a wonderful journey full of love, heartbreak, sadness, and, of course, friendship.\n\nPlay the game several times to come up with various narrations, but leave feeling satisified knowing that love always prevails. This is A Bird Story.\n\nPros+ Cute pixelated graphics\n+ Music is very lovely and fits the scenes.\n+ Controls are responsive and simple. No issues here.\n+ Wonderful story that can be told through imagination.\n+ For the achievement hunters, the sole achievement is very easy to get.\n\nNeutral± Keep in mind that this game is coined as a "simple & surreal 1-hour short". Therefore I can't really say much about this...\n\nCons- Can be boring sometimes; not as engaging as I'd like it to be.\n- ... like previously stated, this a short game.

Especially creative was the transitions from one area to another. It was effective, seamless, and unique. Also the painted backgrounds during the paper-airplane flights were a very pleasant change of pace from the usual pixelated fare.\n\nMusic-As always, excellent. Kan Gao is able to say a lot without words because he lets his music speak for him. Not only does the music serve the mood of the game, it's wonderful to listen to standing on its own as well.\n\nCons:\nGameplay-You have very little interactivity (really that's to be expected) and the little pieces it gives you just aren't very interesting. Too often you are just being sent back and forth to perform very menial chores. Perhaps that was meant to make you bond with your character's daily life, but I found that it just made things sloggish. Too often I felt that I was being told to do something just because it was something to do, not because it really mattered.\n\nStory-A very basic story and one that could have been poignant in its simplicity, but awkward pacing is a major culprit in making this less than it should have been. At first things seemed to follow a logical progression but soon it starts thrusting you from one scene to another with no sense of congruity between them. It's much too jarring when the sequential moments in the game are not tied to the previous or following ones, thematically or chronologically.\nAt times the story seems to be hinting that it may be more than the sum of its parts. I'm all for symbolism and imagery, but if the message is too obscured, then it simply comes across as pretentious, not profound. I feel this game fell firmly into that category.\n\nSummary:\nThe game certainly wasn't all bad, there were things I definitely enjoyed. But I feel the cons significantly outweigh the pros.

Those who have a soul (and heart!) and those who don't. The first are going to love this game for what it is and appreciate what it has to offer; the others - don't.\n\nWhile I loved 'To the Moon' which left me weeping at the end like no video game has ever done before, playing through 'A Bird's Story' proved to be quite a challenge for my limited attention span.\n\nWhile the soundtrack leaves nothing to be desired the story really doesn't cut it for me. It wasn't even remotely as special as 'To the Moon'. It's not even the lack of dialogue but more the fact that there isn't that much story to begin with; keeping that in mind the 1 hour length of this piece even seems stretched and too long.\n\nNo recommendation this time.","December 27, 2014","false","1.1"," 39 of 71 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","39","71","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notnsane/recommended/327410/","notnsane","NSANE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notnsane/","1436 products in account","A masterpiece on both story and resources usage\nI won't comment too much on the story. It's awesome. It's light. It's heartfelt. It does what it has to do and is executed in a (albeit slighty predictable in a couple spots - not that it's a bad thing) very concise and rounded form.\n\nBut what I specifically wanted to talk about, is on how the available resources were used in such a way, it probably set up new standards of use for this tool (RPG Maker, that is) on storytelling.\n\nWhile I was playing the game, I tried to analyze how Kan Gao (A Bird Story director, main writer and developer) thought of every scene. He used and abused every single way known (within the confines of the tool) to make the scenes more enticing, both in visuals and audio. The usage of color palettes striked me down as a very particular way, since it's more used on cinema. On the other end, games like Warframe abuse palettes without any kind of artistic direction at all - just randomized.\n\nOne of the main things to analyze also (as a resource) are animations and lack of any kind of verbal communication. Animations probably were the most expensive resource to create, and they are indeed really detailed. I loved how those expressed several kinds of emotions. Though I also have to mention that some of them, due to the lack of detail (you can't express emotions that well with an extreme long shot or panorama) are sometimes hard to "read". This is a limitation of the tool, but not the medium.\n\nAlso, I'm going to comment a bit on the use of reality/imagination structure on the narrative: this is one of the main points where videogames shine! Doing all this on a real set, with real people, would involve some camera trickery and probably cost a lot of money. Also, due to lightning composition issues, it isn't just easy to go from a closed space to an open space. In videogames, we can treat this with a single source of light. That's yet another good usage of the tool.\n\nAnd probably most people will agree that the worst thing this videogame has, is the usage of interactions. It's pretty hard to notice when we're just seeing a cinematic, and when we can interact, the interactions are meaningful, except when walking from one place to another (walking makes the scene "flourish"). I see that Kan Gao used some specific commands for some interactions that shed a bit of light, still, they were very limited.\nPersonally, I think that keyboards and these kind of games simply do not get along. They force you to binary interactions (yes/no), while with a joystick we have full spectrums, "analog" sticks with 360 degrees of motions, and also a couple triggers with also several levels of pressure. Would they have been used for some interactions, they would have aid tons more to the story.\n\n---\n\nSo! This is a great VG. While it lacks in interaction, it compensates it with amazing storytelling and music, incredible direction, and overall a great way to experience what the medium can do. Buy it and play it ASAP.","March 1, 2015","true","3.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

While this takes about an hour it manages to use music and visuals in a way that many films could any dream of. The game has no dialogue and explores a novel way of telling a personal story, a very good one at that.\n\nWhat this game does is involve you in a story that is hard to review simply because I have a sense that each person who plays this will pull something different away from it. The lack of exposition or black and white story telling really allows you to fill the gaps like a good book would, yet while allowing you to understand the point of view of the character you play as.\n\nShould you play this?

The sound is really good as well and again, glad to see that their was a custom soundtrack and everything. As for the story, there is no dialogue whatsoever in this game, so you just have to assume what's going on from the implications that are present.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zulmetefza/recommended/327410/","zulmetefza","zulmetefza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zulmetefza/","1232 products in account","This is a recommendation with some caveats.\n\nBuy and play this if you only bought and played (and liked) To The Moon before. Since its art style is not for everyone, and uniqueness of it is actually the weakest point of it.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? This game is so unique that it is actually not a game. Its interaction level is actually below than most of the visual novels. Most things happen without your interaction, or happen with your "moderation". For example, the bird will fly no matter what, you can choose which part of the screen you want to be in with no gameplay results. You can choose how long you want to wander around the house, but at the end you dont have any choice which room you will go.\n\nSo the gameplay is actually a complete illusion. Ilusion of being a game. Like in Sid Meier's quote, "A game is collection of meaningful decisions." There is no decision here. So some disadvantages of the game are, not being able to kill the bird, to destroy the house during the absence of the parents of the child,to punch some highschool bully in the mouth, to not choose to help a bird to fly.\n\nWhat are the advantages? Being dictated to help the bird fly, not destroying the house, not seeing any other characters during the story etc. Basically being dictated to story. Since the story is good. And as a different side to the Moon, the story is told without the help of words, and you can see this would fail as a visual novel with this approach. It would also fail as a usual game with decision trees etc, since a meaningful story is often build as a compact, uniform experience. So this story is A Bird Story, it features a bird, a child, and clouds. It is a good story, not a good game, not a semi finished visual novel etc.\n\nAnother thing which worths the mention is cute graphics and superb music. But again, this is also a shortcoming since game does not have fullscreen support, any sprite scaling whatsoever. Sprites are generally heavily modified RPG Maker assets afaik, so there is nothing to praise that much. It does its job, you dont think the bird is a dragon, or boy is actually a ruthless mercenary, so it is ok. But the music... The music is again (like in to the Moon) great. Laura Shigihara did a great job again. Not only it enhances the mood, but also it defines the experience to make it worthwhile to remember.\n\nAny other thing. Yes. The "gameplay" time is fairly short. If you wander around too much, so delaying the inevitable in every stage, the longest gameplay time might be around 2 hours. But there is no any additional content or hidden clues etc to justify this silliness.\n\nCalling this story as a game, and criticizing it about its not being a game by definition is a bit harsh. But being sold in steam is an acclamation of being a game I think, so I must warn fellow gamers: This is not a game.\n\nThis is a good story which uses your input as decoration, and visuals as scene. Music also enhances the mood, and maybe being able to move, minimally interact but not being able to change the outcome is also a good representation of being a lonely child.\n\nBut I still think that this would be better as a story. Like Jonathan Livingston etc.\n\nTLDR: There is no Headshot, Multikill, Occulus Rift Support in this game.

It was beautiful, moving, heartwarming, and nostalgic (and don't even get me started on the soundtrack--major regrets for not buying the bundle and saving a dollar).  As a new Steam user, I was uncertain about how to make my first purchase rewarding and memorable.  I ended up choosing this game and couldn't have been more pleased with my selection.  This game is about as unique a game as I can ever remember playing.  It's like watching a movie that was made using an old console engine, but the controls get handed over to you, making the experience more personal, so you feel connected.  Why haven't I seen this medium explored before?  It's sheer genius.\n\nI read a lot of reviews that kept referring to the cost ($5) not being worth the 60+ minutes of gameplay.  Some Steam users  pointed out that you spend more when you go to a crappy movie, which is a good point, but I love  A Bird Story  for an entirely different reason: I'm a father, so when I considered this purchase, I thought of it as a way to share the look and feel of games I grew up on with my five-year-old daughter.  We have taken our time with it and thoroughly enjoyed playing it together.  And anyone who knows anything about kids, knows they like repetition--heck, it's even good for them.  Call me sentimental, but I am confident that  A Bird Story  will be the equivalent of a timeless favorite book that my daughter and I will return to time and again.","March 22, 2015","true","2.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Being the oldest of 7 children, I shared a room with two of my siblings. As a result, I spent a portion of my early years dreaming of what it might be like to be an only child, and to have a room all to myself.\n2. I can't remember if this game came in a bundle, or if I impulsively bought it during a Steam sale, but upon rediscovering it in my library, I thought.. Oooo a very short game, with only one achievement!?  Should make for an easy 'complete game' to display in my Achievement Showcase.\nAnd so, that is how I approached A Bird Story.\n\nThe Review\nA Bird Story is a sweet, visually pleasing, children's story... Not that it's, necessarily, for children, but its goal, I believe, is to touch the mythical child within us all.\nAnd, I suppose on that level, I would have to say that this game was quite successful.\nUnfortunately, though, the child that awakened within me was this restless little brat who got bored after 35 minutes and began whining about wanting play Rocket League, instead.\nMaybe it was the soft and subtle silence, of this game, that made mini-me want to seek out the big noise of Rocket League?  Or, perhaps, my inner little one's dream bubble burst, when it realized that, it actually might sometimes get lonely, being an only child?\nStill, whatever the reason, in the end, it was the "grown up," achievement driven me, that finally completed A Bird Story.","September 7, 2015","true","1.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/recommended/327410/","Nico-Kun","¤ βℓооđч ¤ Nico-Kun!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/","653 products in account","An interesting short story from the devs of To the Moon, it follows a small kid who finds an injured bird and takes care of it while it recovers. It's pretty clear that this game is experimental in nature, trying to tell a story without the use of dialogue, and I'd say it does a pretty decent job at it. It's all accompanied by some beautiful music, and the art style resembles the one found in To the Moon.\n\nHowever, I'd say that, even if you enjoyed To the Moon, this game might not be your cup of tea. As I mentioned already, it's somewhat experimental in nature, not only for the lack of dialogue, but also because the gameplay (if you can call it that), is minimal: all you do when interacting with the game is making the story move forward.\n\nEven then, I personally enjoyed it, it was an interesting experience, and it wasn't very long, so I recommend it. However, as I said already, be aware that this game might not be for you if you're expecting a lot of gameplay.","March 11","true","3.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathjohnson/recommended/327410/","deathjohnson","DeathJohnson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathjohnson/","122 products in account","I kind of wish there was more of a rating system in place in the review system, as it is, all I can do is state that I don't recommend this game, and the big red thumbs-down that comes with it seems a bit harsh for a game like this. It isn't bad, but overall, there's really only a small group of people I would recommend this game to, and for that, I'll go through a series of questions:\n\n1. Did you play and enjoy "To The Moon"?\n\nIf your answer to this is "no", then you're already in the group I wouldn't recommend the game to. If you haven't played it, I'd recommend playing it, it's about 10 times the game A Bird Story is for only about twice the price. If you played it and didn't enjoy it, then there's really no hope for you to enjoy A Bird Story whatsoever. It's a somewhat similar style game, but there's much less to it, and it's a much less memorable experience overall. I played A Bird Story today and I can't even remember for sure if there was more than one song in the soundtrack, there must have been, because there's a soundtrack for sale in this game, but all the music sounded the same to me.\n\n2. Does the idea of a story told with no dialogue, or even any text whatsoever, appeal to you?\n\nThis is the thing that nearly turned me away from the game altogether, it's an extremely unappealing concept to me. The story had to be kept extremely simple because of it, and even then, there are some parts that can be a bit confusing with no text of any kind explaining it, nothing major to the story, just a few little things. I can't really understand why the decision was made to make the game without text though, the only possible benefit to it I can see is that it would make localizing the game in countries that don't speak English extremely easy, you wouldn't even need to hire a translator.\n\n3. Are you interested in the background of the patient in To The Moon's sequel?\n\nI was, and that was the biggest influence in my decision to buy the game and play through it, but I'd say it's not worth being the big influence that it was to me. Really, after playing through the whole game, I still feel like I know next to nothing about the main character, there are a few character traits, but they would be so apparent that I'm sure they would have to be obvious in the next game, so you wouldn't miss out on anything by skipping this. At least, I don't think you would, I can't say for sure until the next game is released, so I can come back and update this review then.\n\n4. Do you like really simple short stories?\n\nI'm kind of on the fence for this question, I don't mind a simple story in general, but it feels like in a story-driven game, the story should have at least some depth to it. I didn't find this story to have any, really. Basically, read the description for this game, and try to predict exactly how the story plays out based on that short description. I'd be willing to bet more than 90% of people's guesses would be right in line with how the story goes. I mean, the description of the game does specifically state that it's a "simple story", even with that in mind, I didn't expect it to be as simple as it was.\n\n---\n\nBasically, if you answered yes to all those questions, I would definitely recommend this game to you.\n\nIf you answered yes to most of them, you might want to think twice about it. The developer does have a refund policy if you're completely unsatisfied. I won't be asking for a refund as I was okay with the game as a whole, I just found it underwhelming.\n\nIf you answered mostly no to these questions, I wouldn't even consider buying it. Even if you play through it and go get a full refund, it wouldn't even be enjoyable enough to you to be worth the time spent playing it.","November 13, 2014","false","1.2"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","23","42","0","2"

He is imaginative and isolated, and the story that unfolds from his time caring for the bird is thought-provoking and heart-warming. This is, essentially, a feel-good game, but there are heavier undertones present that minimally occupy the story.\n\nWith a poignant soundtrack and characters that express themselves without dialogue, Freebird Games has accomplished something significant. It could be said that A Bird's Story is more visual novel than game, but that doesn't lessen the experience. This is a story, and it is the story of a tragically alone child who grows throughout the course of his time caring for the bird. Whether the bulk of the experience is purely in his imagination is of little merit: by the end of the story, he is more whole.\n\nAbsolutely recommended.

Social misfit kid disconnected from parents finds happiness in his imaginative interactions with an animal. Bad comparisons aside, as long as you don't play the game with the expectation that it will replicate To the Moon's format, you'll be in for a pleasant hour. It does replicate many of the things that made TTM great (great soundtrack, throwback 16 bit graphics, quirky sense of humor), but eschews the more complex story of TTM for a stripped down narrative that focuses more on emotion than complex narrative development.\n\nI've seen a lot of backlash against the lack of dialogue in the game, with the general impression that, as RPS put it, it just adds a "bonus sense of pomposity" to it. This strikes me as an overly cynical view of the game. As I experienced it, the lack of dialogue forced me to search elsewhere to fill in the narrative gaps, a search that A Bird Story rewards by layering the game with a series of subtle, effective cues. A blanket placed around a sleeping child's shoulders. A pile of briefly read notes scattered on a table. Taken in isolation, none of this means much, but I found that the sum total of these snapshots was enough to make the experience sufficiently immersive.\n\nA Bird Story didn't move me to tears, and it didn't have me laughing so hard that I couldn't catch my breath. But it did make me smile, and its whimsy and simplicity carried me back to my childhood, if only for an hour, and that's where I think this game succeeds. It's a brief ode to the boundless imagination of childhood, to the inherent mutability of what we perceive, and to the small joys and miniature heartbreaks that we encounter in our daily lives. The game never aspires to be more than a brief snapshot of a lonely kid, but within those confines are small moments of levity, loneliness, and genuine warmth, and that was enough for me.","November 26, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Granted, I haven't had a chance to play To the Moon yet although it is in my Steam library and I'll get around to playing it when I have a chance.  However, getting back to this game, I truly loved it.  It has a beautiful story, music, and art.  As much as I would love to reveal what the story is about, I can't do so without revealing major spoilers.  Instead, I'll simply describe what I loved about this game.\n\nA Bird Story narrates a story through the use of graphics, music, and, of course, gameplay so no words need ever to be said.  Now if a game can truly convey a story without ever uttering one word, that truly is something special, I think.  As another reviewer has mentioned, this game does play more like a visual novel, specifically like a kinetic novel.  I say that because you don't really get to make any specific choices as to how to control the main character.  When prompted, you have to move your character as designated.  However, because the story is beautiful and touching, I think it makes up for the lack of choices.\n\nIf there is one negative, I'd say that I would have liked it if there had been an option to save at any point.  Despite that the game is pretty short, I still would have liked a save point option rather than the game determining from where I could leave and start again.  Other than that, I really liked A Bird Story a lot and the ending has me intrigued.  There's sure to be a sequel in the works and I can't wait to try it out if/when it comes out.  :D","June 29, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well, it's not really a game - it's more like a short film with arrow keys. I had held out on buying this for ages because even though i liked To The Moon, i found the interactive sections rather tedious - they took away from what was otherwise a sweet story. Here those sections are pared down to the bare minimum, and the pacing is vastly improved as a result. There isn't a single line of dialog or character of text but, through beautiful music and very well-timed pixel animations, A Bird Story takes you on a rollercoaster of emotion. It's a story of a lonely child who finds a friend in an unexpected place.

So, what could go wrong? I will tell you what. Nothing. This game is another masterpiece I absolutely enjoyed and loved. The story is about a little kid and injured bird he saved. This story uses no dialogs and not even one single word and it still tells more than most of the games. I will not spoil the story for you, but I can tell you about other aspects of this game.\nIt's made in RPG Maker, so it's using very pixelated graphics and it can even look like some jRPG from screens, but that's not the case, don't worry. I have to say the art of this game is absolutely magnificent. I was thinking a little while playing this game and you know what? I don't think any other art style could tell story such as this one. Creator of the art is the Artist (with big A). Another thing is animation. It's extremely clever and smooth, sometimes I couldn't even believe how well the animations were used, really. You are walking in the forest and suddenly, you are in your living room and it even makes sense! Graphic side of this game is top notch. What else does the story need? Oh right! The music. The music is absolutely amazing and fits very well with the story. Most of it is piano music, but don't worry, it's not pretentious and you won't cry. A lot.\nAbout the gameplay - keep in mind that this is very linear game with a lot of cutscenes and it's not the longest, the playtime is around 1 hour, so keep that in mind, please. Story itself is great, I didn't except it to be that great, especially after To The Moon, because that was masterpiece, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I mean, it's not as good as To The Moon, it didn't bring me to tears, but it still made me feel. I was very satisfied with the ending. So I absolutely recommend it.

If you're interested in this and haven't played To the moon yet, you should probably avoid this for the time being. But if you have played To the moon and want something more I'd totally recommend this. It's shorter than To the moon and I am fairly certain that if you're not willing to spend a small amount of money on this (IMO 4 Euro for a game ~1 hour long is worth it but others might disagree) I'd say you can probably. As this isn't the real sequel to "To the moon" but more of a prequel to the sequel coming.\n\nAlso note, the game is still running in the same engine as To the moon but this time it plays even more as a visual novel than To the moon did so the controls shouldn't be too much of an issue.","November 9, 2014","true","1.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I feel that this beautiful little game is an appetizer before the next big Freebird title. There is no point in comparing Bird Story to To the Moon, since they serve different purposes. Bird Story is a story of friendship. It is full of creativity and imagination. The fact that there is no dialogue makes the player only pay more attention to what is going on. The music is the perfect soundtrack, relaying the emotions that the characters are feeling. While the graphics are retro, they are beautiful. Clocking in at an hour playtime, it is pretty short. However, its a "game" that I know will be played through quite a few times. A short and sweet title that put a smile on my face.","December 27, 2014","true","2.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

So the story is a prequel for the next game by Freebird Games and takes place before the events of To the Moon in one section in the life of the 2 main character's next patient and tells a very touching story about a lonely little boy with an incredible imagination and a bird with an injured wing and left me and probably most people crying if not teary eyed at least by the end. The soundtrack in this game, like To the Moon is fantastic and is a must buy if you plan on buying this amazing game. It has a very nice blend of reality and the imagination of a little kid. I suggest playing To the Moon first before this one but I still highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great story.\nKan Gao you really have a gift of emotional story telling and I can't wait to play the next game: Finding Paradise whenever it comes out!","November 9, 2014","true","3.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

They have been some of the most beautiful minutes of my life. A Bird Story is not a game, in that it doesn't provide you with an aim, or an enemy to overcome. It invites you to share in the dreams of a boy, and his only friend: a wounded bird. This is the first game (for want of a better word) I have ever played that has successfully conveyed both a story, and a truly touching character. There is no glorified murderer here, running around a small enclosure butchering those with slower reactions, nor is there a spurned plumber fighting his way to his royal girlfriend. There is simply a boy, a bird and all those that reject him. Many won't like it, but I hope those that do love it enough to overcome preconceived prejudices as to what a gaming experience should be like and can simply bask in the magic of the dream world, and its exquisite music, for single glorious hour.

However, none of his creations and foundings (like Parachute Umbrella, magical Paper Airplane and Space Ejecting Seesaw, ) proved to be successful in this task. But one day everything changes. In a forest he finds a real, living bird being attacked by as real badger.  Boy manages to save his new avian friend, but it turns out it has an injured wing. Our little hero takes care of the bird and takes it to the vet to get it fixed. As they spend more time together, boy starts having doubts if his cause is just. Isn't he using a poor living animal for his own selfish purpose? As his mind is being torn by such thoughts he shows his friend the world. Finally he decides that he should return the bird to the vet, to someone who could properly tak cacre of it.\nBut just before he hands in the bird a thunderstorm begins. Boy realizes that this might be his final chance of leaving this wicked world. He takes the bird (the missing part of his old plan), sits on his Paper Airplane and flies straight into the storm. While he was still in the real world he watched 'Back to the Future', so he knew that his (air) vehicle has to be hit by a thunder at certain speed to let the magic happen.\nUnfortunately his experiment fails, as his plane is destroyed by a thunder. As he wakes up after hitting the ground (remember laws of physics don't apply) he thinks that his bird died in the process. Depressed by all these things the boy goes home to continue living his miserable life. But the next day he is woken up by a familiar voice. As he goes out he sees his bird healthy and together with another living bird. The boy says his final goodbye to his friend and the game ends.\n\n\nI recommend A Bird Story, because this game is one of the few games where the main character ultimately fails his task.","March 6, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/san1281/recommended/327410/","san1281","sanitarian1281","http://steamcommunity.com/id/san1281/","1229 products in account","Kan Gao is the genius behind 2011’s To The Moon, an RPGMaker game that tells a science-fantasy story of wish fulfillment wrapped around a powerful love story. It’s a singular achievement and a work that has moved even the manliest of gamers I know in certain internet circles to find there’s something in their eyes (including the rather less-manly me). When he released his latest work, I didn’t hesitate to spend some of my Steam credit picking it up. A Bird Story is exactly what the title indicates, a brief narrative about a boy and a bird, and it’s not necessarily for everyone. I say this not because it’s bad but simply because it’s nowhere near as impressive and heart-wrenching as his previous work.\n\nFreebird Games’s bird story is that of a lonely boy who rescues a wounded bird from a badger attack and, in nursing the creature back to health, develops a relationship that gives meaning to his otherwise largely-friendless existence. The nameless boy is what we used to call a “latchkey kid”–his parents are an unseen presence known only through the notes they leave him on the door. The boy (literally) dreams of flying and plays with paper airplanes. One day, he finds the bird with the broken wing and his imagination soars. Naturally the journey of bird and boy has an inevitable ending, one which the player will reach in about an hour. Gao uses no dialogue in this story, and as a consequence, the other humans are both figuratively and literally shadows; while this de-emphasis on any but the main characters has a narrative purpose, it does weaken the connection one can make with this world. Another flaw, in my view, is how fantastical the story can become at times. While the boy’s imagination clearly plays a strong part in A Bird Story, it’s a little hard to take much of what you see at face value, and this also serves to hamper immersion.\n\nAs with the earlier game, this RPGMaker-based title sports a very limited keyboard interface, and once again Freebird has made the unusual decision to disable most common forms of screen-captures. The keyboard controls you can get used to readily enough, but I’m at a loss to understand why Gao seemingly wants to make it harder for people to review his games.\n\nPart of what made To The Moon so powerful was its haunting and evocative soundtrack. A Bird Story has a similarly well-done soundtrack and I highly recommend it. As for the game itself, as Gao freely admits, it’s different. What I like about it is that he’s stripped out many of the gamey elements that frankly just didn’t work very well in To The Moon. Unfortunately, in its brevity it tends to sacrifice the strong characterizations and narrative complexity of its older brother–thus it suffers by the inevitable comparison. However, if you approach the title with an open mind and don’t set your expectations too high, you’ll find that it’s a gem that’s well worth your $5 investment. (Frankly, even if it isn’t your cup of tea, there’s little risk involved on your part, because Gao is offering a no-questions-asked, money-back guarantee, which I think is extraordinarily generous.)","November 29, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, none of his creations and foundings (like Parachute Umbrella, magical Paper Airplane and Space Ejecting Seesaw, ) proved to be successful in this task. But one day everything changes. In a forest he finds a real, living bird being attacked by as real badger.  Boy manages to save his new avian friend, but it turns out it has an injured wing. Our little hero takes care of the bird and takes it to the vet to get it fixed. As they spend more time together, boy starts having doubts if his cause is just. Isn't he using a poor living animal for his own selfish purpose? As his mind is being torn by such thoughts he shows his friend the world. Finally he decides that he should return the bird to the vet, to someone who could properly tak cacre of it.\nBut just before he hands in the bird a thunderstorm begins. Boy realizes that this might be his final chance of leaving this wicked world. He takes the bird (the missing part of his old plan), sits on his Paper Airplane and flies straight into the storm. While he was still in the real world he watched 'Back to the Future', so he knew that his (air) vehicle has to be hit by a thunder at certain speed to let the magic happen.\nUnfortunately his experiment fails, as his plane is destroyed by a thunder. As he wakes up after hitting the ground (remember laws of physics don't apply) he thinks that his bird died in the process. Depressed by all these things the boy goes home to continue living his miserable life. But the next day he is woken up by a familiar voice. As he goes out he sees his bird healthy and together with another living bird. The boy says his final goodbye to his friend and the game ends.\n\n\nI recommend A Bird Story, because this game is one of the few games where the main character ultimately fails his task.","March 6, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was used to the RPG Maker style of the other Freebird Games releases (having fiddled around with RPG Maker many times) and knowing how much effort can go into just one scene, I was always pleasantly impressed with the attention to detail, use of interesting effects and animations and even the choice of scenery and tear-inducing music. All this apart from the actual fantastically detailed storylines of the games.\n\nSo when I came to A Bird Story and saw some mixed emotions from the reviewers and audience, I was a little taken aback.\nThen I played it, and once again, I was pleasantly surprised and even more impressed with flawless RPG Maker effects and techniques I have never seen before.\nThe developers and the description of the game have made it well-known that this is simply a whimsical short story that also serves as a prequel to their upcoming title "Finding Paradise" and is NOT to be portayed as a To The Moon sequel.\nI think that many users expected this and were not happy.\n\nHowever, after completing this, I have to say that once again, I curse Freebird Games for destroying any manly thoughts in my head (once again) and yet, I would definitely support them for the next game and the one after that.\nIt is exactly what the name suggests. A simple story about a bird.

Made by the same team that did To the Moon (TTM), A Bird Story is more of a mildly-interactive experimental pixel art piece than an actual game. There's very little input needed from the player, absolutely no dialog at all, and not much explanation for what's really going on.\n\nIt's worth seeing it for yourself, as it is an endearing little adventure about a kid and a bird, but it's extremely short (about 1 hour), it moves rather slowly, and it feels pretty arbitrary when the game wants your input and when it doesn't. Many times, you'll be watching a little scene play out, then you'll hit a few buttons, and it's back to the scene. It felt somewhat like a little bar popping up, saying "are you still paying attention?"\n\nI'm not sure if TTM is the same way or not (I haven't played it YET), but on the surface this game felt cutesy, while lurking beneath was a deep, strong current of melancholy. There's charming music throughout the various scenes, but something felt unsettling. Maybe it's because other than the bird, the kid feels as if he's barely attached to the world at all. Other characters and animals appear as specters that he can walk right through, a few impossible things transpire that are straight out of a bedtime story book, and various parts of the world start to blend in with each other. It almost feels as if there's a deeper meaning, like the whole thing is a metaphor for illness, or the kid is really an old man reliving beloved memories as his loved ones watch him slip away, or something.\n\nIt's not overtly a sad story, though, and there are some smile-worthy moments (even if the Yakety Sax section is a little painful), but the whole thing is over just a little too quickly, and with a bit too little weight on some of the emotional moments. I wish I could go into more detail without giving major spoilers, but there were a few sections that seemed to say something big was happening, and then they simply end, and it's on to the next thing.\n\nI enjoyed my time here, but only just. It's extremely short, the game seems to not really need you to play it, and it feels like there's more to the story that simply went over my head. On the plus side, it's a charming story at surface-level, the music is fantastic (and written by the writer/director!), and the pixel art is well-enough-done.\n\nI don't remember how much I paid for this game, but it couldn't have been more than a couple dollars. If it'd been $10 or something, I'd be a little upset, but I enjoyed my time here, and if you're able to immerse yourself in a charming, somewhat-shallow little adventure story, you might too.\n\nOne final thing, and it disgusts me that I even need to say it: If you buy this and end up liking it, please don't get a Steam refund after finishing. It's short enough that you can, but please don't.","December 1, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a tale about friendship most of all, and about helping one another: the kid, emotionally, the bird, physically.\n\n\nStory?\nStory is basically all that matters here, as there are no action-packed scenes, scores, enemies or anything like that. It's just you and the world and bird. It's well written enough to keep you playing for the short time it lasts (I wished it lasted more, but it's just about 2.5 hours long).\n\n\nGameplay?\nThere's not much to it, actually. You move in a 2D world (with that impossible perspective) and interact with some objects but mainly what drives the action is the moving around and finding things. I don't remember if you actually control the bird, but that's not really important.\n\n\nGraphics?\nVery simple 2D (low bit rate) stuff, but enough to keep you interested. Again, it's about the story (look at the title) not about the graphics.\n\n\nSound & Music?\nSound design is awesome and the music is dreamy and top notch. Since there are (if I remember correctly) no words in the story, after the general feeling and visuals, the music and sound have to be the most important factor for you to be pleased. And they are!\n\n\nReplayability?\nI would, in a few months, just to have enough time to almost forget it but not that much time to forget how good it was.","January 1","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many times, you'll be watching a little scene play out, then you'll hit a few buttons, and it's back to the scene. It felt somewhat like a little bar popping up, saying "are you still paying attention?"\n\nI'm not sure if TTM is the same way or not (I haven't played it YET), but on the surface this game felt cutesy, while lurking beneath was a deep, strong current of melancholy. There's charming music throughout the various scenes, but something felt unsettling. Maybe it's because other than the bird, the kid feels as if he's barely attached to the world at all. Other characters and animals appear as specters that he can walk right through, a few impossible things transpire that are straight out of a bedtime story book, and various parts of the world start to blend in with each other. It almost feels as if there's a deeper meaning, like the whole thing is a metaphor for illness, or the kid is really an old man reliving beloved memories as his loved ones watch him slip away, or something.\n\nIt's not overtly a sad story, though, and there are some smile-worthy moments (even if the Yakety Sax section is a little painful), but the whole thing is over just a little too quickly, and with a bit too little weight on some of the emotional moments. I wish I could go into more detail without giving major spoilers, but there were a few sections that seemed to say something big was happening, and then they simply end, and it's on to the next thing.\n\nI enjoyed my time here, but only just. It's extremely short, the game seems to not really need you to play it, and it feels like there's more to the story that simply went over my head. On the plus side, it's a charming story at surface-level, the music is fantastic (and written by the writer/director!), and the pixel art is well-enough-done.\n\nI don't remember how much I paid for this game, but it couldn't have been more than a couple dollars. If it'd been $10 or something, I'd be a little upset, but I enjoyed my time here, and if you're able to immerse yourself in a charming, somewhat-shallow little adventure story, you might too.\n\nOne final thing, and it disgusts me that I even need to say it: If you buy this and end up liking it, please don't get a Steam refund after finishing. It's short enough that you can, but please don't.","December 1, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am gonna play through it again soon, because the music is just so well done. I am also excited for the next game this developer is going to make. The artwork is also well done in this game and makes me want to start drawing again.\nNow if you are expecting it to be a long game, then dont get it. The description for this games says; "A simple & surreal 1-hour short" so clearly its not going to be as long as To The Moon.\nThere isn't going to be dialogue in this one either, which is nice because to me, it feels like it would have been ruined. The music is literally telling the story, the music is intense at times, smooth, or just funny. You will see what I mean if you play it.\nThis game is literally like an old black and white silent movie, just without the screen change from the action to the dialogue of what the actress/actor is saying and the game is in color. The music, just like in a silent movie, is what is developing the scene. So if you don't like the fact of that, then don't get the game.","December 26, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Secondly, if you are expecting this game to be like that one, it's not. A Bird Story is far shorter, has zero dialogue, and much less interaction than To the Moon. With all that said, I don't think that's a bad thing. To the Moon and A Bird Story are two completely different experiences and the choices the developer made for each makes complete sense. Once again, the music is absolutely amazing and I'll definitely be listening to the songs again on my own.

It follows a young boy in an unidentified urban setting who clearly feels alone and estranged from other kids. He eventually rescues a bird from a predator and places it in his backpack, carrying the bird home to nurse it back to health on his back porch. From there the story follows the emotional journey of this Young Boy as he tries to find the bird’s place in and world and struggles with what could happen. Despite the lack of more then archetypal characters the story has, it’s extremely endearing.  The young boy, as the only dynamic character, cycles through emotions of depression and joy as well as love and pain. The story is sympathetic to his emotions. The reactions of nature will change with his joys and his pain. In short we have a character driven story with a young boy we can greatly relate to and other static character built to draw out his reactions. In the end it’s a tearjerker of a story and certainly worth experiencing. The presentation of A Bird Story is very similar to its predecessor in that it keeps the 16 bit art style. Once again this is used excellently to connect the two stories together in the same universe and the art style itself is very quaint. It’s not the most realistic or the most dynamic but there is something about it that’s endearing all the same. The weird hand drawn cut scenes are also gone which leads me to believe that the developer has realized their limitations within A Bird Story which goes a long way to strengthening the piece as a whole. As far as game play goes….well there isn’t any. The game acts more as an interactive short story then as a game. The few challenges that are present are “jump here” or “move here”. These do enhance the story by making the player step into the shoes of the character, but they are gimmicks which don’t really affect the overall game. In the end we simply have to realize that A Bird Story is something more akin to an interactive book than a video game. Sound design is where this game thrives. The OST is extremely memorable because each track connects to a certain instance in the story where the emotions are elevated. Not to mention the instrumentalists put together just beautiful music. The sound effects and cues are well timed and have a level of depth to them. When your skipping through puddles or flying over the city skyline the sound effects help ensure you believe it. Everything feels homey and inviting until the main character feels fear or foreboding. During these moments the OST is haunting. Honestly buy the soundtrack edition of this game, it’s amazing. So then does A Bird Story succeed? Let’s look at the summary.\nPros:\n-Memorable OST\n-Engaging use of SFX\n-Emotional and relatable story\n-Extremely well developed main character\n-Visuals are quaint\n-No more weird cut scenes\n-Emotional replay value\nCons:\n-Little to no game play\n\nFor you completionists out there, this game is not much of a challenge. By that I mean there is no challenge at all. A Bird Story is completed simply by playing the very short game. Upon finishing the story you will receive the only achievement. So of course, there is no completion bonus.  With that in mind I give this game a rating of 8.5/10 and a completionist rating of Finicomplete it!","March 2","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was used to the RPG Maker style of the other Freebird Games releases (having fiddled around with RPG Maker many times) and knowing how much effort can go into just one scene, I was always pleasantly impressed with the attention to detail, use of interesting effects and animations and even the choice of scenery and tear-inducing music. All this apart from the actual fantastically detailed storylines of the games.\n\nSo when I came to A Bird Story and saw some mixed emotions from the reviewers and audience, I was a little taken aback.\nThen I played it, and once again, I was pleasantly surprised and even more impressed with flawless RPG Maker effects and techniques I have never seen before.\nThe developers and the description of the game have made it well-known that this is simply a whimsical short story that also serves as a prequel to their upcoming title "Finding Paradise" and is NOT to be portayed as a To The Moon sequel.\nI think that many users expected this and were not happy.\n\nHowever, after completing this, I have to say that once again, I curse Freebird Games for destroying any manly thoughts in my head (once again) and yet, I would definitely support them for the next game and the one after that.\nIt is exactly what the name suggests.

So, knowing the successor to "To The Moon" was gonna release sometime soon, I thought I'd give "A Bird Story" a try, more so because it was so cheap. Can't beat having a cheap hit to your Steam Wallet; not some massive $30.00 whatever, you get me? :) Anyways, in short, I was bored to tears this night so I decided I'd give this game a try. Yeah, I'm feeling much better now. "A Bird Story" was beautiful, simplistic, and meanful. Definitely a PERFECT way to spice up a good hour and a half of your time.

But anyone who has played To The Moon, the creator's previous work, knows that this is not necessarily grounds for criticism.   Any fan of classic 16bit Japanese RPGs could tell you that simpler graphics, animations and musical phrases, when used correctly, take on a metaphoric quality that can be more effective at communicating concepts and emotions than the most detailed scripts, character models, animations, and fully orchestrated scores ever could.\n\nThis is a director who demonstrates not only an understanding of this type of restraint, but a mastery of its employment.  Here, as in To the Moon, Kan Gao is able to get a lot of mileage out of lovingly drawn 16 bit pixel art and a beautiful miminalistic piano score.\n\nA Bird's Story is a much simpler narrative than To The Moon, but it is no less elegant.  It is a deeply sentimental story, but also one with restraint, two characteristics rarely found in the same work.  The entire story is told, quite effectively, without a single word and the ending hints that this narrative serves as a small teaser for the creator's next big project, something undoubtedly to be anticipated.  But in the meantime, if you have an hour and a couple of bucks to spare, this is beautfully rendered little story.  Nothing pretentious enough to pretend profundity, just a lot of heart and beautiful craftsmenship. 4/5","January 2, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is not to speak ill of A Bird Story--it's a fantastic experience.  The story is wonderful, though it can feel a bit slow and rocky until the last ten or fifteen minutes, where it all wraps up with some amazing scenes.\n\nThe story itself is very fanciful at times, and it can be difficult to separate reality from whimsy and imagination, as they blend together at many points.  Further, the story is told completely without words, which is an interesting choice that I think pays off.  Everything is told through interactions and setting, and you get to peice together whatever sort of stories you want about some parts.\n\nMy only complaint about this game is that the transitions from gameplay to "cutscene" are not always clear.  Conrol is given and taken away from the player in such a way that is ocasionally annoying or odd, but it never bothered me enough to take me out of the story.\n\nDefinitely buy this (and the soundtrack, which is, as usual for Kan Gao, absolutely wonderful) if you liked To the Moon, or if you just want an interesting and at times touching story.  I highly recommend this game to everyone.","December 25, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We all have a certain amazement at the world of the every day when we are children that seems to slowly fade as the rigors and routines of our adult lives set in.

I went in expecting it.\n\nThe best way to describe it is it feels like Gone Home or Dear Esther, a minimal gameplay experience with a story that is told entirely without words. This was risky given the nature of pixel art, but Kan Gao makes it look easy.\n\nWhat some people might be wondering though is, how does it compare with "To the Moon", Kan Gao's last commercial release? They're two different gameplay experiences, both emotional and both great stories. It feels much shorter, maybe an hour and a half or so, but much more well made. However, I think "A Bird Story" is less intrusive with its gamey elements than "To the Moon"; oftentimes, puzzles in TtM felt more like a strange side game than a natural extension of the game. Gao's beautiful music returns and often is worth the price of admission alone, flowing effortlessly along with the visuals.\n\nWhile the story felt more experimental and Studio Ghibli-esque, I'm hoping the proper "To the Moon" sequel returns more to the form of the first game. And while it may not be readily apparent, there is a connection to the world of "To the Moon", and now I'm left waiting for one day to come with a bucket of my own tears.\n\nDARN YOU FREEBIRD GAMES!","November 7, 2014","true","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When I first heard the game wasn't going to have any dialog I was kind of sceptical about the game. Turned out it was actually the right choice, and fit the story perfectly. Adding dialog would've probably just made the game a bit akward. If you've played "To The Moon", the other game by Freebird Games, you might expect something completely different, but that isn't really a bad thing. I'm kind of sad that we might have to wait another 2/3 years for a new game (episode) that is going to be multiple hours long, which this one is not (one hour). The story that is presented in this game is very touching in a way, and might be relatable for people that were outsiders when they were young.\n\nSo, if story based 16-bit games are something you are interested in, this game is definitly a must buy.\n\nOverall I would rate this story based game a 7.5/10.","November 7, 2014","true","1.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It gets that fdone very well. Its easy to get immersed in the story specifically because there isnt any dialogue, you start to notice all the nuances of the main characters life. Because its a story with no dialogue, the creator of the game made it so that you wont get bored. This is done by putting omages to other games like Zelda and Mario in throughout and making the whole thing feel like a dream. You never know what will happen next because literally anything can happen. Thats what makes this adventure feel so great.\n\nAs far as the story itself, you start feeling a bond to the boy and the bird. Despite the dream-like feel of the game, these two characters feel very real and their problems are also real. This is an hour long tale of a lonely boy and a hurt bird which will leave you happy in the end.\n\nIf you played "to the moon", then you dont need any explanation as to why this game should be bought with the soundtrack. If you didnt play "to the moon", fix that please.","December 29, 2014","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is not only a literal fact about the absense of written or spoken language, but also very much true of the emotional experience that it creates. In putting aside conventional story telling technique, A Bird Story takes a massive risk, but pulls it off amazingly\n\nThere's no manual to get a backstory from, and the interactive elements are extremely minimalist. Yet despite all that, those brief pieces of interactivity and choice are enough to make you feel emotionally invested in the story.\n\nKan Gao's musical score is superb, reminisent of those found in the SNES games of Squaresoft & Enix. More than that, though, the entire emotional pacing of the game is driven by expertly used audio cues and sountrack changes. It may not be one that you would listen to outside of the game, but you will want to own it none the less, so I strongly recommend picking it up too.\n\nThe lack of written word was hard at first, but it actually worked better than any prose could have. The player is put in the position of the child, with the world being confusing and scary, yet full of promise.\n\nMuch like Dys4ia and other works of interactive fiction, there will be debate as to if A Bird Story really counts as a game or not. But even if it doesn't, game developers could learn a lot by looking at what Freebird Games are doing","December 29, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Yet it's still a touching experience and cleverly done in how it works with no dialogue, through just the action on the screen and emotional music which will accompany you in every scene.\n\nIf you've played "To the Moon": This game is set in the same world. The boy will grow into Dr. Rosalene's and Dr. Watts' patient in the next part of the series. But "A Bird Story" doesn't feature the doctors. Also, it doesn't contain shocking plot twists like TtM - those will only happen again in the sequel (from what I heard).

It's definitely not one for the ages the way To the Moon was, and it doesn't try to be.  Instead it tries to be a simple, unassuming little wordless story and manages that goal quite well.  Don't go into it expecting a deep emotional experience like TtM and you'll be rewarded with a cute little tale with  bit of heart.\n\nWhat does impress me about A Bird Story is in the transitions from reality to dream and reality.  Using these old school-esque graphics (but beautiful nonetheless) they pull off some pretty stunning effects.  Well done to the team, you did an especially great job on that.\n\nIn short, if you likes To the Moon and you're realistic in your expecations, you should really enjoy this short game.

Haha these games really are full of emotion and I can't express it enough. I wish there were more games like this to be honest! This game has a fantastic story and purely awesome scenery.

It's not too much "to the moon" that you'll be teary-eyed but it's a nice, soothing, simple, surrealistic, imaginative narrative to play through without anything to interrupt the experience, like, say, dialogue (hehe). Regardless, it's a refreshing and nice story that takes a stroll away from the norm.\n\nI was hoping for something more along the lines of To The Moon. Gameplay is too simplistic (which isn't a bad thing for a narrative game like this). Music isn't as phenomenal as To The Moon but overall nice.

Some may complain it's not a video game, but most video games are an experience and this definitely is one. It's moving and interactive enough to keep you invovled. Where it falters in actual gameplay it makes up for it ten fold with the story. Not only is the story heart warming, but the visual art is striking and appealing, worthy of being it's own art piece. The soundtrack played a nice role in making it emotional, since there is no dialog so I would grab it with the soundtrack just to have that great musical piece. You can decide if $4.99-6.99 is too much for a twoish hour long game, but I think when it goes on sale it's definitely worth the price.","December 3, 2014","true","1.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

To The Moon was, and still is, my favorite game of all time. After playing the shorter A Bird Story, I express similar thoughts. While the story takes roughly an hour to work through, the game attaches the player to each and every character with an emotional connection stronger than most every other game I have played. With a library currently filled with 224 games, A Bird Story easily makes the top three. Kan Gao's new transitions and seemless storyline worked well with this new piece. I am willing to bet that, no matter who is reading this, if you were to take $5 and one hour of your time to play A Bird Story, you would feel just the same as I do now. Don't get deterred by the slow-paced progression, because most of you will be sobbing by the end credits. In conclusion, I honestly believe A Bird Story has got a little of bit of everything for everyone.

The game tells a story about growing up, teenage courage, facing reality, losing innocence and giving up dreams, about conformity, socialization and such. There are metaphors all over the story. I'm kind of a pessimist, so the way I see it, as objectively as I could--this game is a mourning for one giving up his once most precious treasure in order to blend into this world his body actually lives in.

Because it's only little over an hour long, I'll withold the rest of the plot for you to enjoy. However, I'll tell you this: it's a beautiful, a little bit sad story.\n\nWith an interactive story I mean there's not much real gameplay. You can only move around and interact with some objects. Instead of text dialogue, the story is told by the graphical events and occasional spoken or thought pictograms. I was initially sceptical how that would work out, so I was pleasantly surprised to see it's a splendid way to convey little tasks and small bits of story.\n\nGraphics are nice, hand-drawn pictures and bitmaps. Especially the music is beautiful and atmospheric, well thought to fit the story. It will change smoothly when traveling through the surreal landscape of the boy's memory.\n\nIf you played To The Moon, their previous game, know that A Bird Story is shorter, less sad and there's (even) less "playing" or decisions. If you liked it or story-driven adventure games in general, you'll probably like this one. Games like this are more about feeling, observing and art than skill, action and doing. It's a single, whole experience: I don't see myself playing it more than once, but that was a happy experience.","November 9, 2014","true","1.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It is entirely a story on rails.\n\nWithout giving too much away about the story, I found the anthropomorphised nature of the bird main character too hard to believe. I get that it's an allegory about love and possessiveness and all that, but I feel that the choice of using a wild bird takes away from the idea. Wildlife are exactly that, wild. They are not, and will not ever be made friends with, just ask that guy who hung out with bears and then got ate by one.\n\nThe whole experience presented by A Bird Story is a short one, the soundtrack is lovely, and on the whole is probably worth your five bucks. That said, it's nowhere near as epic as To The Moon.\n\nBuy it.","November 7, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I found myself laughing at the most little things (like the exchange in the elevator).\n\nFinishing this game, I want to say it's kinda like the movie short "Paperman"-how it expresses so much through body language and music instead of words (and of course, paper planes!) and "To the Moon" in a beautifully crafted "game."\n\nJust as Kan have written countless times, play this game with no expectations. It is not like To The Moon but it still has that same feeling of warmth/adventure as you learn more of the main character through your travels. The music blends so well and beautifully, almost being the words to the muted characters.\n\nFinishing thoughts: this is a wonderful bit to get you hyped for the second episode in this series.

First of all I want to say how amazing this idea of a game was, the fact there are no words really makes the player think about the story and almost interpret what they believe is going on, making a more personal connection to the game. I really can't express my feelings about this game all at once but I will say that the music was amazing, the story was truely wonderful, and I can't wait to see more. For 5$ this game is worth it not only for an amazing story but as a lover of the classical music genre I would buy this game and the dlc just for the music alone and it would be well worth it. But adding an amazing story is what makes Kan's ideas so amazing and why I will always enjoy playing through his stories.\nThanks!","November 7, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's absolutely no dialogue, but in a way that makes this title rather interesting.  You have to pay attention to what each character is doing to understand what is going on...despite just being thrown into things without a huge clue of what is going on.\n\nIt's a very touching story about the bond a boy makes with a bird he finds, and the memories he makes with it along with his imagination taking over.  At times it's a little hard to tell what is real...and what is not...as it blends together very well.  It's only about a hour long as the author says, but think of this more like a prologue or elongated trailer for what their next big title will be than a title all by itself.\n\nI definitely enjoyed it, and I hope you do too!","January 10, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So how does "A Bird Story" stack up compared to that game?\n\nAs you have probably already seen in the screenshots, both games are made in RPGmaker. Most people either love or hate RPGmaker games, personally I do not really care as long as the game is good.\n\nAside from the graphics, A Bird Story does differ a lot from To The Moon. The first difference is the length of the game, To The Moon was not a very long game but it still was a lot longer than A Bird Story, which only should take you one hour to complete. Second difference is there are no conversations, unlike To The Moon where you would get sucked in the story, A Bird Story takes on a different, more art-like story.\nThe third difference is that A Bird Story is a 'feel good' game and no tearjerker like To The Moon.\n\nSo yes, both games differ quite a lot from each other, which is not a bad thing. Both games are good in their own way, you just should not expect a game like To The Moon, even though it has some moments that reminds you of To The Moon.\n\nOverall 'A Bird Story' is recommended to anyone who enjoys 'art' games and want a nice 1-hour experience.\n\n","February 9, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A Bird Story from Freebird Games, the creators of the fantastic "To The Moon", is another atmospheric adventure game this time taking the player into a boys mind and imagination upon finding an injured bird in the wild. The gameplay is much shorter this time, just over an hour worth. There is much less interaction between you and the story. No puzzles, nothing to read. Just a few times when you must click on the screen to progress the story. The story is less imaginative, as with "To The Moon", many tears were shed, I barely felt anything for the boy or the bird even though I'm an avid bird enthusiast. I can't help but feel this game was rushed out to capitalize on the success of "To The Moon". This game isn't nearly as rich and polished as its predecessor. If you've played To The Moon and are looking for less of the same then this game might be for you. If you haven't played either I'd definately recommend skipping this one and playing "To The Moon" instead.","December 27, 2014","false","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I expected the same thing from A Bird Story but the narrative just wasn't there. In a literal sense, the narrative was absent; the entire story is only told through visuals, music and the occasional thought bubble Sims style. One could easily (and justifiably) argue that Brothers also had no vocal narrative, but the difference is that A Bird Story’s story is either a bit too subtle and abstract or else is just overall very weak. The prior could be my own fault for not being able to pick out the nuances of the characters actions, but the latter felt like it was more the case. I want to love this game as much as I did To The Moon, but the narrative of this narrative only game is just not strong enough.\nFor a buck, A Bird Story is a cute little adventure with a boy and a bird, but I really don’t think the majority of players will get the quality of enjoyment out of it as they should.","February 9, 2015","false","1.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

They are completely different productions and can't really be compared to each other. That said, after reading such great reviews I really wanted to like this game, and I thought I would. But, to be honest, I was thoroughly bored and it took me 3 runs at it to even make it through to the end. Consisting mostly of cutscenes with the odd 'move here' and 'press enter', it just lacked...well, pretty much everything. While I like zen games, this one had me falling asleep and I couldn't recommend a game that was almost unbearable to try to finish.","April 16, 2015","false","2.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I am one of those. I bought that game on GOG.com (that's why it's not on my Steam library) and i consider it one of my most important games of all. A Bird Story is barely a game, but that's not necessarily negative. It is the surreal story of a boy and his friendship with a bird with a hurt wing. It is a rather vague, short story with some obscure metaphore in it and the peculiar choice to be told without one single word being spoken/written on-screen. I liked this choice, it's rather brave and remembered me the first part of a movie i loved (it was Wall-E, basically the demonstration that cartoons are not only for children). Anyway, even if i liked the setting and some of the narrative, i have to say that the rythm is very, very slow (i have finished the game in 71 minutes, half of which was boring roaming from one place to another) and it really feels like the few "interaction" moments could have been avoided, because they just felt needless to me. The story is nice as it is, though kinda cliché. Globally, i don't think i can recommend this prequel-to-the-sequel of To The Moon. It's overly short, and doesn't transmit anything particular. I think the most heartfelt moment for me was the reveal of the next game's name, which is really commoting. The art in this game is beautiful, but it felt like a super unnecessarily long trailer to the next one, and the constant surreal aura that's in it is very confusing. I think you can play Finding Paradise, when it's out, even without playing A Bird Story. It's not bad, and unlike someone else i didn't think that it automatically had to reach TTM standards, but i think this game is, simply, rather boring and irrelevant. I suggest to skip or, even better, watch a gameplay, since it doesn't change much.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nI'm not criticizing the lack of interactivity in any way. I don't think a work of videogame art obligatorily has to be interactive. Actually i'm criticizing that they INSERTED those random, boring interactivity moments inside the game. It felt complete without them.","December 1, 2014","false","1.2"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","17","35","0","0"

The music and the art style were good, so atleast we got that going on for the game. THE ACTUAL story was boring.

Like To the Moon, this is very much an interactive story with little actual gameplay. There is no dialogue, and the themes and motifs explored in the game lend themselves to the eventual sequal of To the Moon, called Finding Paradise.\n\nThat said, this game is definitely different from To the Moon. There are no plot twists, less intense emotions, and only an hour long. I would recommend trying Gao's other games, like The Mirror Lied, to gauge whether or not a game like this might interest you. This game isn't for everyone, and fortunately Gao understands that, so if for any reason you don't like this game, you can message him for a no-questions-asked refund. I don't know if it's quite worth $4-6 for the game (+soundtrack), but I think of it as a way of supporting the work of Freebird Games, so I certainly have no regrets.","November 8, 2014","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is a somewhat surreal experience for adults, as it tries to mimick what is going on in the head of a child and mixes reality with imagination, which I find very intriguing. The major downside for me is that it does not have much interactivity, as most the game is playing an cut scene and even if the players gets control, there are no choices as it is completly linear.\nThe soundtrack is amazing as before, no big orchestra but a smaller scaled sound for a smaller game. The aestetics are debatable, I am personally not particularly fond of the RPG-Maker graphics and they tend to look very crowded despite only being 2d-sprites.\nThe experience is different from To the Moon, but enough to stands on its own.","January 1, 2015","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The fact that I do not consider this piece of fiction to be a game has nothing to do with why I won't recomend it.\n\nWithout going into much detail, 'A Bird Story' tells the story of an imaginative kid that has troubles when it comes to socialise with his classmates and that saves an injured bird. This bird becomes his best friend until it has to leave. I am inclined to think the kid is autistic but that is just speculation and it could be that I am reading too much into it.\n\nWhen it comes to how the story is told, this 'game' is quite competent at it. The introduction is a bit weak but it gets better as you go through the game. There is no text and no voice acting and everything is told through the environement or the movements and expressions of the characters. The game has notes of humour and can be quite cute at times but it also made me cringe other times, although that may just be me. However, there is little to no interaction and almost no exploration outside the main path. The whole piece is like a set of cutscenes and you just have to walk from one to the next one or, at best, you have to interact with a couple items before advancing and, even then, those items are marked with big green arrows or green sparkles. Any interaction feels superfluous and sometimes it seems like it would have done better without them. The game is also very short, I fully completed the game in 71 minutes according to Steam. It is so short that I did not even earn all the Trading Cards and I will have to leave it open for a while to get the last one.\n\nThe artstyle, while a bit bland looks good and represents very well what it is going on and the feelings of the different characters. The music is good, mainly piano pieces. There is one song I did not quite like but it's part of a joke and saying which one it is might ruin it if you are interested in playing the game.\n\nSomething that is unacceptable is that there is no options menu to my knowledge. I was unable to lower the game's sound and music and set the game to windowed.\n\nMy biggest problem with this game and the reason why I do not recomend it (besidesthe ones mentioned above) is how boring the story is. Why is it that most games of this genre pick stories that are so uninteresting? It is as if it was a mediocre story for a children's book but I am uncertain as if a child would enjoy or understand this game without the help of an adult. There is good talent behind this game and it pains me to not recommend it but, overall, I did not enjoy it.","May 5","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some of that is the use of gray scale mostly which even in pixelated graphics adds wonderful shading. The game looks good simply.\n\nOn the audio\nFirstly there is zero voice acting. No one ever talks. In fact the game uses thought bubbles which are either filled with (.....) or an image for the "need this" use.\nThen you have the music. Considered soothing by quite a few out there. Personally I find it sad and depressing with no cathardic release. Think elevator music without a beat. It may be played well but you still don't really want to listen to too much of it.\n\nOn the gameplay\nAll you ever use is the arrow keys, the enter key, and the space bar. Walk this way, jump here, and pick that up.\n\nAnd here is where I explain why I don't care for this game.\nSure it's visually apealing, but that just isn't enough for me. The protagonist is never apealing partlly because he's never really fleshed out. Bored in school and abandoned by parents is a flat and nearly facetless presentation. Walking around in a world where everyone else is a voiceless shadow requires a dynamic protagonist and they just don't give you one. The game tries really is supposed to be trying to get a deep emotional responce from the player. But you can't do that if there is just so little for a game to connect with.\n\nPros\nWell made.\nKinda pretty to look at.\nHas one accievement, if you manage to play through the whole game.\nHas cards.\n\nCons\nThe music.\nNo one talks. Ever.\nYou never get to make any choices, it's all predetermined.\nLinear one way plot.\nCan a game be too short and yet entirely too long...\n\nHonestly I understand a lot of players love this game. But I've played visialy graphic novels with vaster character depth than Bird Story delivers. There has been a lot of discussion on the age of players in regards to this game. Perhaps younger users get more out of this. I may be too worldly or mature for what it presents. Truthfully though I don't find aimed at younger players any excuse for such symplistic depth.\n\nIf you take this as a simple concept story which takes you along for a short ride, than in that Bird story does deliver.\n\nIf you like this game, I'm happy for you. Personally I found it sad and a little boring.\n\n\n\nInterested in more reviews like this : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation","November 19, 2015","false","4.4"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","21","44","0","1"

However, simply put: making and releasing a game in 2014 that only runs at 640x480 (no hyperbole!), yet asking money for it, ..... that is not okay. It just isn't.\n\nIf EasyPeasyGameCreationTool 1991 hasn't been updated for use in the real world in a few decades, use something else!\n\n\n\nP.S.: If you can get this for around $2, the price of admission for you and your friends/family is certainly well-invested, however be prepared to have it destroy your window placement, wreak havoc upon your desktop, and maybe even consider using the creepy Windows magnifier tool (press Win and + together) to make it bearable in windowed mode. At $5 you're overpaying.\nP.P.S.: Plus points for the devs' no-questions-asked refund policy, even though that is promoted in the context of this title more because fans of their previous game had wildly different expectations for this title (and not because of the insultingly antiquated engine employed). I don't belong to this group quite yet, hence can't speak about how it compares to that title.\nP.P.P.S.: If films (or video games) have a reasonable chance of bringing you to tears, you could even contemplate setting your budget for this to $3.\nP.P.P.P.S.: There's the odd funny easter egg here, and certainly permissible creativity in scene transition has been employed in the game's design, but - and this is a big but - some core aspects of it just feel thrown in because why not, like the moving-back-in-time storytelling approach, or his faceless clone, the slapstick chase(s), etc. Feel invited to point me at a developer-sanctioned full-spoiler explanation of "what actually happens".","December 31, 2014","false","3.5"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","2"

The visuals are also a plus, especially some of the backgrounds which looked gorgeous. Still, the technicalities don't really make up for its lackluster 'story'.

I just don't think it was accomplished here.  Kan Gao would like to tell beautiful (or cute), and meaningful stories with beautiful art and music, with pixel graphics for the 'mundane' bits.  Some of that is there...  Yes, there is a pixel graphics for the engine, the music is quite nice, and there are some nice static background art.\n\nWhat there isnt is a particularly interesting story this time, and the gameplay, while secondary for this kind of VN/game hybrid is simply leading you around by the nose doing things rarely relevant to the story.  I wanted to like this game, and for perhaps $1 or less (say, in a bundle), I would feel like I got my money's worth.  Unfortunately, I bought it 50% off, at US$2.50, and feel like I did not get very much for my money.  I use a $1/hour baseline, and then adjust if the game is short but amazing, or the long time is boring time.\n\nI was bored at least half the time, honestly.  Sorry.  There it is.\n\nI wish Kan Gao and the team success and look forward to the next game, which had a little teaser and reminded me and many others of To The Moon... Perhaps the story will be a bit deeper and more compelling than this one, as I felt I could sum it up in one paragraph.  I won't do it here, because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who may want to play.\n\n4.5 / 10","December 15, 2014","false","1.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","3"

Soundtrack is really nice but I couldn't really get into the story because it passes the limits of story reality for me.\n\nThe world, while based in the real world, is almost completely full of unreality. It makes for a nice aesthetic but stopped me from connecting with the story. Part of the magic is that the wild bird suddenly completely trusts the boy, becomes his best friend, and makes kids at his school (who previously ignored him) play with him. The bird never struggles or escapes and always goes willingly (otherwise you'd have to see the boy forcibly capture and detain it). He 'saves' the bird from the vet by running away with it because he doesn't want it to be put in a cage. He makes paper planes and flies in them (which is probably supposed to either symbolize something or be an alternative to him travelling to places).\n\nIt's probably a decent game for someone who is young or emotional but don't try to apply any adult logic to it. If you can stop thinking about things and just go with the flow you might be able to enjoy the story.","October 3, 2015","false","2.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Kan Gao's game is about the story the emotional journey it brought us through but a bird isn't human, or it isn't River, and it doesn't have anthropomorphic quality for us to feel anything about it at all. A story about a dog would've been more interesting because dogs can actually look like they have emotion whereas birds don't. Also what made To The Moon a feast despite its graphic and its weird mouse control was the conversation, because it was funny (not because it was deep and everyone has some sort of deeper understanding about life or whatever). There were important issues being talked about, but far more than that, the delivery were top notch. You laugh, you can't wait to know more. A Bird Story has no conversation at all, it's funny moments aren't funny. Musis is not so good. Let me put it this way, To The Moon can be and hour and a half movie and it can work, A Bird Story at best would be the short movie Disney or Pixar put in their movies before Toy Story 3 or Big Hero 6 plays. You'll pay for Big Hero 6 and you get a dog-human relationship short movie at the start, before the movie begins, and that short is free, bonus package. If it's good, nice, if it's bad, well okay, this isn't what I came here for. In this case, A Bird Story is the bad short movie (not that Pixar had ever produced a bad short movie before their main feature screened). There sn't much story to tell, there isn't much depth, yet they make the short movie a one and a half hour movie. That's what it feels like playing A Bird Story, it's can be as a side story, it's not good as the main event. All throughout the game, I can only think of "quick, hurry, continue, go on, get on to it already, get through with it, please be over!!"\n\nIt's not a bad story, but a whole game shouldn't have revolved around it. It's a bad game, yes. If we're talking gameplay To The Moon was also a bad game. But what it lacks in gameplay, it pays up with a hell of a damn good story that we can feel about. I used to have 4 bird as a pet. I wasn't a very good pet owner. One of them died to a cat and I cried. Two of them died because I forgot to put the cage in when it rains, I cried. The last one flew away while I was feeding it, I left too much opening for it to jump out, I CRIED. I was heartbroken a few times but I couldn't even feel anything about this.\n\nIt's not worth buying, it's not worth playing.

The story line itself however, is much shorter, very confusing, and does not draw any sort of emotional connection, as I thought I would get after reading other reviews of this title.\n\nI frankly am majorly disappointed by this title, and I hope that the developer can closer replicate the layers and intricacy of the story as seen in "To the Moon" before their next release.  My honest advice, would be to wait until they finish the sequal, as this is a pointless stepping stone that is both a waste of time and money.\n\nPros - Soundtrack, perfected control system of series\n\nCons - No emotional depth, Almost no player interaction, Short and dry\n\nOverall - 2.5/10","December 29, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I guess it is the type of people that try to find sybolism in rain falling from the sky in movies. In reality  this is a game with a JRPG  look, without anything else. It tries to tell some sort of story, but in reality all it is is you walking around, looking at shadowy figures, while a bird flies up to you sometimes, and you ride a paper airplane. Its literally 1.5 hours of that. Most of the game you don't play, you just watch yourself repeatedly walk through 4 total environements: classroom/school, forest, bedroom, and city. There is no dialogue, which is supposed to be "artsy", but just makes the game more boring. It was literally the longest 1.5 hours of a game in my life. The few times you get control it is only just to walk around for a bit, and do nothing besides open a door or two or pick something up and put it back down/give it it someone. You do the exact same things, see the exact same repeated scenes, in the same environments, with the same 2 actual characters (everyone else are just shadows). I call this game the walking simulator. Furthermore, you can't acess sound/video settings from the pause menu, meaning you can't mute the game, unless you quit your current game?? Then there is no real save feature, just certain pictures of specific points that aren't clear that you can apparently start back up, but you don't know exactly where that is, so that's kind of worthless. I became so disinterested and uningaged that I started watching DBZ while I finished up the game, as most of the "game" (loose terminology) just plays itself. The story of DBZ was better, and it's free to watch online, instead of paying for this poopshoot. I couldn't have cared less how the "story" (could sum up 1.5 hours in about 10 seconds, that's how much actually happens) ended up, or what happened to the bird and the boy, because surprise surprise, I couldn't form a connection by neither of them saying or doing anything of interest. If the idea of watching nothing really happen and sporadically taking over to walk around interests you, then this is the game for you. But with anyone who has something better to do (sharpen a pencil, get a colonoscopy, etc.) look the other way. 3/10.","June 30, 2015","false","24.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

In honesty, this game was in effect a ponderous, meanderingly minimal interactive 'adventure' that spectacularly failed to deliver.\n\nYes there was the broody music and the familiar gameplay but the overtly sentimental, forcefully connective tale of a boy who befriends a bird felt overplayed and, frankly, dull.

The environments and soundtrack are beatiful and some of the mechanics are fun. But there really wasn't enough there for me to enjoy this. It's a short game (finished in just over an hour), but the the pacing is painfully slow, with cutscenes used liberally between pretty limited gameplay sequences that try to convey certain details in subtle animations but just end up making the thing drag. I think gameplay is sparse because this really isn't so much a full-out game as it is an interactive story with some gameplay elements. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but where the story is trying to be emotional and trying to draw certain parallels, it just comes across very dull and predictable. Unfortunately, when your game is heavily reliant on being story-driven, a predictable approach just kills the interest.","August 28, 2015","false","1.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I didn't expect this.\n\nA Bird Story's no dialogues design approach, and I do mean absolutely 0 dialogue, is what I found the most problematic. Even in AAA titles with full facial motion capture cannot convey all details into a game with just that alone . They require speeches to help. That just goes without saying that 2D sprites/ RPG maker is even less up to par with that job. No matter how much effort were put into drawing each sprites for different animations, the full intent simply does not convey well and at times it becomes tideous to guess what the characters are actually feeling with no dialogues or any text at all to understand what they are really thinking. It's like reading a Sims chat in the Sims, yes the general feeling is understandable, but I have really no idea what the character is thinking/ saying exactly, and it hurts a narrative heavy focus expierence like A Bird Story deeply.\n\nThe game continues on worse than a silent movie- (a silent movie do have at least some text to help audiences know what the actor is reacting to or thinking), with things that aren't making any sense keep on happening (moving trees, environment kept changing etc.)  makes following the story incrediably dull and hard to endure. All my interactions- as rarely as they are available, are most often meaningless and did not really make me feel any bonding with the bird, which is supposedly the character I should care about.\n\nA Bird Story is the first game I ever requested a refund, and I truly hope Finding Paradise would turn out better.","December 24, 2015","false","1.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

A Bird Story is kind of a spiritual successor to that game, in that it was made by the same team, has the same artist and I believe was stated to be a story in the same world, albeit with no reccuring characters. The difference between To the Moon and A Bird Story though, is that the latter has no dialogue, no actual characters or tangible story to relate to. It has very few interactive elements and that makes it just feel like an unemotional, less deep version of To the Moon. I'm not one of those people who says games have to have deep mechanics or even a lot of interaction to be considered games, but to me A Bird Story just feels like 1/10th of the game To the Moon is. To the Moon's dialogue and story and characters and storytelling elements are all so beautifully done and made an emotional and touching experience that I adored. I just can't say the same for A Bird Story. It was by no means a bad experience, but it just left me kinda disappointed and unimpressed. Maybe my expectations were too high. I usually love minimalist storytelling, but to me there has to actually be a story hidden under the surface. A Bird Story is not that kind of game.","January 20","false","3.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

Unfortunately, this game isn't an Adventure RPG.  Now, the description says it's an interactive animation, which is a more honest description, but I feel it even fails at that.  Why?  Because it's not "interactive."  On occasion it tells you to take the controls, but even when it does your option is only to do exactly what it wants you to do.  If you need to turn on a light, it doesn't let you do anything but turn on the light.  If you need to walk home, it doesn't let you do anything but walk home.  I don't consider that interactive, and I just felt annoyed and frustrated when it had me take control.\n\nSo why'd I give it two thumbs up instead of one?

So when I got Indie Gala’s Dragon Rock bundle one of the games that really stood out was A Bird Story.\nA Bird Story is the story of a boy and an injured bird, it follows them from meeting to when the bird has healed and ready to leave. The whole story is told without words or writing what so ever and is only about 1 to 2 hours long. Its an intriguing idea and caught my interest straight away. On Steam the game has rave reviews so I was really looking forward to this one.\nThe graphics are 16 bit pixel style, but they are beautiful and well done, as the story is sold on its emotional content the simplistic beauty if them works just right. The developer has really workedhard on the details too, the way things move is stunning and it really draws you into this world of fantasy. But if your not a fan of the retro style you might struggle with it.\n\nThe story is a sweet tail and you will probably find yourself thinking back to your own childhood while playing it, although I’d never looked after a injured bird as a child it reminded me of events with family pets and such. And that’s really the story, its not some deep underlined story that leaves you a moral question at the end, Its just a story of a boy and an injured bird. But that’s why its beautiful, its pure childhood innocence’s and nothing more. But this does mean the story is very linear and there is little to no exploration to be done and for a 1+ hour game that’s not really surprising, but its a shame there wasn’t something for replay value.\nNow I’d love to tell you how great the controls are, but unfortunately I can’t. The directional controls are done on the arrow keys, why the hell its not on WASD I’m lost to explain and to add insult to injury the action buttons are Space and Return. Its such an unnatural set-up and on top of that you cant even move in diagonals so although the path ahead of you might snake and wind your left in a situation where you can’t follow that path in a natural way. It really spoils the experience at times and that’s sad.\n\nBut my one biggest problem with this game is how it avoids text or speech in anyway, I understand that this game is sold on this ideal but why include notes you can’t read or situations that require pictures to give you some idea of what’s happening? It feels like the developer had this great idea of a communication-less story and then got lost how to tell that story, that’s a shame as I feel just by tweaking or changing some instances in the game would really fix this.\nI don’t hate this game, its by no means terrible but I do feel its an incomplete or unrealized game. The story is clever and the graphics are beautiful, but there’s so much more to a game and this is where A Bird Story falls down. I’ve been struggling to decide if I can recommend this game to readers, the truth being I really want to be able to but I just can’t. The elements are there, but they are executed badly. But I must point out Steam reviews disagree with me, so maybe you should also read those.\n\nIf you enjoyed my review, you can find more at Cyberus UK[www.cyberusuk.com].","March 31, 2015","false","2.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There is no real gameplay to speak of other than walking and hitting a use button once in a while but that's good if it's just a story to be told one is looking for.\n\nNice about it: How the story is explained despite the utter lack of text and voice. You can select a text language when the game starts but fun thing is the "start" and "exit" buttons as well as the credits are the only texts you'll ever see. The story is told only through sparse sounds, basic reactive symbols or thought bubbles above people's heads and just as minimal but effective movement, gestures and facial expressions. It's supported by equally simple but fitting music.\n\nSo-so: The story. The game felt somewhat pretentious to me. The drama in it is highly artifical. The boy you control is lonely and seemingly a bit detached from reality. Maybe even mentally ill. But he acts silly regardless. Even it's cute and kinda adorable: I very much doubt you'd ever see anyone bond and fool around like this with an animal, least not see the same sentiments in return as you project them towards it. This is part of why the game sometimes feels detached from reality too and thus loses some of it's authenticity or "power" to me. It's hard to relate with a topic that should feel like an ordinary thing that could happen to anyone but that has as much strange or unrealistic elements and moments as "A Bird Story". I reckon the bond between human and animal could work just as much or better when it was grounded in more solid matters. I know a manga about a couple witnessing the slow death of their dog in a perfectly ordinary time, place and dimension and that one impressed me better. "Abusing" some lost child on the other side to do half the groundwork for it as in "A Bird Story" feels almost like a chliché in comparison.\n\nFurthermore, the way the boy acts and how other characters and the world is shown (the boy is the only character with an actual face - all other people are simple shades/vague silhouettes, and most of the time when he stumbles into other people it's either him or them acting in hostile or evasive ways) could give already sufficiently misanthropic or animals-obsessed people the idea that their ways were perfectly fine. Or support the misconception of humanizing animals. Animals are not people. People are not animals. Whoever thinks otherwise probably sees the world only in black and white. And I'm afraid the small world in "A Bird Story" is just that even if obviously seen through the eyes of a naive and perhaps delusional child who couldn't be expected to see it with less shrouded eyes anyway.","July 7, 2015","false","1.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If it’s even a game. It’s kinda hard to call it a game. It's more like a story that you get to move around in. Now, coming from someone who adored To The Moon, I really wanted to like this “game”. Sadly, i just can’t recommend this. The story in this game is that a boy finds a bird. The whole game is about the boy's friendship with the bird. The story isn’t terrible, but it didn’t grab me anywhere near the way To The Moon did. And that’s the problem. When you have “game” 100% based on the story, and the story isn’t great, it’s doomed to fail. Sure, it’s heart warming, and im sure the main point was to show some deep message about the relationship between humans and other animals. But it didn’t grab me. It didn’t ever make me want to find out what happened next. Ultimately, i quit playing with two acts remaining. I think the biggest problem with this game is that there is no voice acting. Everything is told through animations. That is fine, honestly even the story they are trying to tell isn’t great. It’s not some complex masterpiece. At least it wasn’t from the first 4 acts i played. The music is great, just like in To The Moon. The graphics have charm i guess, but they are a far cry from amazing. I guess this game is pretty charming, but being cutesy isn’t enough for me.

And despite the artistic, dream-world wrapping around it, to me that is an insufficient depth of story to cary the full game. A five minute movie, yes, but not a full hour. As a result, I was mainly bored while playing it and only continued because I knew it couldn't last that much longer.\nSo I found it disappointing, especially since I really liked To the Moon and its complex, unusual and yet very human main characters.

My favorite example from A Bird Story are the two silent interactions between the protagonist and the stranger on the elevator. It's such a small subtle thing, but little things like that give a game world huge character. Very few other games writers/directors have such great writer's perception to be able think of and effectively portray those types of subtle little human moments, but Kan Gao is an excellent director in that regard.\n\nAt the same time, though, I was also disappointed. While To The Moon was an extremely complex story with many characters, layers, and themes, A Bird Story is so simple it feels dull. To The Moon also had a certain degree of gameplay, what with hunting for memory links, solving puzzles, exploration, and some occasional mini-games. But sadly, in A Bird Story, it's pretty much just like watching a 2 hour cutscene where sometimes you press ENTER or hold down an arrow key for the movie to continue. (On more than one occasion, you can literally hold down any of the four arrow keys, and the protagonist just walks in any direction he wants. It literally doesn't matter where you want to go. It's just a movie that plays.)\n\nThe almost completely absent interactivity/gameplay might have been fine if the story was complex and compelling enough to keep you wanting to know more. To The Moon excelled at this by making you hungry for more information about Johnny and his life, what the rabbits meant, what the hackey sack meant, who Anya is, what the significance of the moon is, etc etc etc. There are so many mysteries, curiosities, and unresolved threads that you just have to keep going. But in A Bird Story you kind of know exactly what is going to happen, and it doesn't really defy your expectations or surprise you at all.\n\nSo my verdict is that A Bird Story is like watching a film that is the product of a pedestrian writer but an incredible director. It's hard to completely like it or dislike it.\n\nTo The Moon is as emotional and wonderful and beautiful as Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind or Annabel Lee.\n\nThe writing in A Bird Story is unfortunately about as complex and interesting as its title. Still great direction, though.\n\nTLDR: Do not expect to get To The Moon out of this, but you might still enjoy it depending on whatever idiosyncratic tastes you might have.","December 30, 2014","false","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I tend to enjoy story-centered and exploration-based games, but this one just never got my attention.\n\nMost of the game drives itself, and you don't have to make any decisions. When you need to accomplish specific tasks, there are clear onscreen cues. I'm OK with all of this.\n\nThe game felt slow. It may have mostly been a problem of character movement speed, during both player-controlled and automated portions. There weren't any surprises to the plot. It's a predictable story and an unoriginal plot. Some graphic elements seemed well-done, but nothing struck me as exceptionally magical or impressive. (The "nest quest" sequence was the most interesting part graphics-wise, I'd say.) I wouldn't be surprised if (nearly) all of the sprites were from a generic sprite pack.\n\nNothing was exceptionally wrong about this game, it just failed to impress. When this genre was new, this game may have been worth a try. Now that we have plenty of exploration/story games to choose from, I think this one can very safely be skipped at any price.\n\nSince it's so short, though, it won't ruin your day if you pick it up for less than a dollar.\n\nI imagine a lot of negative reviews will come from people who don't like what this game was striving to be. I do like what this game was trying to be, and I still can't quite recommend it.","July 19, 2015","false","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The artwork was smooth, the controls felt acceptable, the soundtrack and sound effects were beautiful. It impressed me up until the point where the words 'interactive' were introduced.\n\nThe story follows a boy, seemingly walking a blurred line between his imagination and reality, finding a bird, and going on a whimsicle journey together. I have to qualms with the story, although it didn't really strike me much, but the interactions of the adventure felt limited to one or two directions - the game often popped up a little box showing you which direction keys, or enter/space, to press, at what time. Sure enough, you can walk up, down, left and right if you want, but you're still forced to take a certain direction to progress the story. I know it is required if you're an 'interactive pixel animation' to keep the story going, but it felt more like you were being ordered to do soemthing rather than properly interact with the pixel animation. Go left. Press space. Go right. Keep going right. Although the music gives the player some emotion whilst going through it, I was left just keeping my finger on one of the directional buttons, only to be distracted if I bumped into a tree or something. I'm not going to lie, the 'waiting period' I experienced whilst keeping my finger depressed on a directional button was met by some anticipation to get it over with. Maybe I just didn't have the patience, but a lot of it was just going back and forth, and I felt it didn't really add much to the story.\n\n\nAnd that's another area I think the game fell short on as well - the story. It's slightly interesting, but at the same time I don't think it conveys the ideas Kao had in mind. One minute you're in your apartment, and the next you're in school, and then you're in a mixture of both - yes, the symbolism and 'blurred line between imaginary and reality' does play a part in this, but I don't think it really has a purpose. Why is this boy blurring his lines? What do the treetops coming out of the lockers mean? What is it actually meant to symbolize? With these burning questions in my mind, I became less and less intrigued with the story. It was good for the start, but I think it didn't need to keep 'blurring the lines' so constantly - so much that it was a blur altogether.\n\nA Bird Story does have some good ideas in mind, but at this price I don't think it adds up. It isn't bad at its core, but the amalgamation of all its shortfalls makes it an 'experience' that tests your patience rather than immerse you in story. It has great art and music, and I can tell a lot of effort went into the sound effects and background art, but the linearity of the story doesn't quite do it justice. That being said, Freebird is at least offering a refunds policy to people that feel genuinely ripped off, so that's nice of him.\n\nFrom this game, I can only partially see what to expect in To The Moon's sequel, but unfortunately it was hampered by what could have been a great preview of it. I wish all the people at Freebird all the best, and I'm having high hopes for To The Moon's sequel despite me feeling underwhelmed by this game.","November 12, 2014","false","1.2"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Even when compared to To the Moon (which I know is not what the game sets out to do), it's hard to recommend this game even for its story.\n\nA Bird Story reminds of a story I read in a World Literature class, "The Parting of the Ways" by Higuchi Ichiyo. Briefly, the story is of a young love between a poor boy who wants nothing more than the love of his life and a girl seeking to escape the squalor of life.\n\nI remembered this story in particular because you would think this would be the beginning of some Hollywood romantic-comedy--in actuality, the story ends right at the parting of the two.\n\nBoth individuals know the fact that neither one can truly understand the motivations or the feelings from the other as they have their own understandings. Neither one of them are happy with the outcome. They know that they won't cross paths again.\n\nSimilarily, with the case of ABS, where the game feels like it begins is when it actually ends. I also feel that cynical realization that I cannot share the same understanding with the creators' passion\n\nIt's sad because I can see the spark of what the developers created, and I hope To the Moon 2 (or whatever it is called) succeeds where this game fails.\n\nThe Story's Story\nThe narrative works off the video-game mystique of the NES with being told with zero dialogue or facial expressions (visual-aids and surreal imagery to explain everything.) This part I loved about ABS.\n\nUnfortunately, the narrative wasn't given much to work off of. It comes across as a artsy facade of the "Boy Meets X" movie cliche from the '90s. An odd period when you could say a boy befriends his rubbery friend without raising eyebrows.\n\nYou know the kind of story: Quirky, outcasted boy isn't accepted among his classmates, but suddenly finds a friend to change everything for the better. The new friend has some medical issue that becomes the focus and the reason for why the two stay friends. Some people chase them down trying to separate them when they don't understand their friendship. And, ultimately, friendship conquers all trials.\n\nThe only interesting aspects are when you consider the unexplained details. Why is the boy's parents never around to see him and leave him only notes? Why does he have an odd fascination for paper-airplanes? Why is the vet so adament for getting the bird back? What is all this surreal imagery doing here? (Hint: Why do the faded-out antagonists, the teacher and the vet, remind you of the two doctors of To the Moon?)\n\nAll of which will probably be explained in the next game teased at the end.\n\nWhy Am I, the Player, Needed?\nThe gameplay is no longer disguising itself as a puzzle; you aren't solving any brain-teasers and unfolding events in their logical order. You are playing out cinematics with some controls to keep you awake. There are no fail-states, which is not the problem.\n\nThere is nothing to distract you or to tax you on time. Nothing to expand the story or to reward you for your time.\n\nThe game knows what it is, which only makes me wonder why not release it as a movie. (And the devs caution potential buyers that this game isn't for everyone, and they will let you refund it.) I bet the game would've been better recieved if it was a movie than a video-game.\n\nThere's no reason (yet) to explain the need for it.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nNothing much else is needed to be said. Oh, the soundtrack is goregous as always.\n\nI'm quite fine with the discounted price, so I won't refund it since I knew what I was getting into. I'll be happy if this project was to experiment with story-telling because I think that's what the developers work best with. Perhaps with the community's feedback they'll create something worthy for full price.","September 16, 2015","false","6.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It had, at times, awful gameplay and a lot f times I just felt like throwing away my controller and close the game but it always pulled me back in with it's story.\nThis however I feel has all the bad things from To The Moon and almost none of the good things.\nPROS:\n- the soundtrack is very nice, it may not have a For River in it but none the less is very nice\n- the visuals are nice, I especially like the transitions, and there is one place when you go from home to the school in a "corridor" kinda way, which I liked. It meant to symbolize that you do not want to go, you cannot wander around in the places you previously could, you HAD to go to school. Or at least that's what I got from that scene :) and I really liked it.\nCONS:\n- What disappointed me the most was the story. It was just meh. I was very hyped when I found out it was going to be a story told without any words, but it just didn't grab me. It was touching at times but very predictable and it didn't leave with anything. Months after I finished To The Moon I catch my self thinking about it but this is just a story about a lonely boy who saved a bird and remained as lonely as before.\n- And finally the gameplay who managed to be even worse that To The Moon. You can only move a tile at a time and I constantly went to far before turning right or left. I know it was probably meant to be played with the keyboard and not with a controller but as long as it has controller support I think it should be  more optimized for it. Given that the only "gameplay" it has it's movement I expected to be more...OK. You push the left stick up and it plays an animation until it reaches the next tile, the problem is the tiles are quite large and if you want to move left or right you have to wait for the up animation to finish and then it moves you so you always end up on the tile above the one you wanted and more often than not I was kinda running in circles which is really frustrating and immersion breaking. I didn't try it with the keyboard and I don't intend to because I feel it's lazy from the part of the developer to not test and optimize it's game.\nI know that it's a small indie team but movement on a grid has been around for more than 20 years and it's not rocket science.\n\nSo in conclusion I cannot recommend this game even though I was looking forward to it ever since I played To The Moon and I bought it in the first day it appeared on Steam. I feel the developer was just lazy at what makes a game be a game. I'm all for story oriented games, I love To The Moon, Gone Home, Dear Esther but those being "walking simulators" they did a very good job at the walking mechanics, this is just rubbish at it. Maybe if it was 1h long animated film I would have appreciated more, but it's not.","November 14, 2014","false","1.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Light on story and extremely light on 'game' elements, this will be worth the price of admission for some, but I feel this would benefit greatly from a price drop.\n\nPros: For anyone who has played the amazing 'To the Moon,' this game is set in the same universe and is basically a prequel to the next full game in the series. As such, the graphics and music are familiarly pleasant.\n\nCons: Sadly, I can not put 'story' in the pros column. Even setting aside my high expectations from To the Moon, the story here, while cute, is both too short and too predictable to be considered a pro. Everything you expect to see happen will occur, and when the credits begin to roll it will be difficult not to feel at least a little cheated. If there were any surprises within the story, or if it had been at least a 3 hour journey as oppposed to a 45 minute one, then this might have slid by me with a recommendation, if only barely. A game like this must encourage the player to develop a strong bond with its characters, and there's just not enough here to do that. It would help if the price were lowered a bit as well. At 45 minutes, this game is like paying $5 to download a single episode of a TV series, only you'll get more story out of the TV episode.","November 19, 2014","false","1.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

About a child. And there's a bird in it. If you grew up watching kid's movies with an animal theme in them, I'm sure you can piece together the plot of A Bird Story.\n\nKid finds animal- adults try to take animal- kid loses animal- kid finds animal again.\n\nIt's as formulaic as it gets. And I wouldn't mind it as much, if there were some actual characters in this story. I don't mind characters without a voice (like the Naia and Naiee in Brothers), but all we know about the child is that he's a dreamer and likes birds. We know his mom loves him, but we never see her. We know little about his teacher and vet, except that they want to bird. To take care of it. Because it was injured.\n\nSeriously, why would anyone sympathize with the kid, if he's preventing the bird from appropriate medical care? I don't often sympathize with children for this exact reason. They let their near-sightedness get in the way of something far more important going on.\n\nAnd the way the child's imagination is handled is really strange and lazy. At first, it seems more like how he perceives the world, and how he dreams. But then he gets away from the vet by... dreaming up a giant paper airplane... and flying away...\n\nDid I miss something?\n\nA Bird Story can be enjoyed by somebody out there. Somebody who hasn't been exposed to the cliches of most animal movies for kids, and who doesn't mind bland characters, with some odd plot development.

It is an original, touching story, which will entirely engage you, with lovable characters, a heartbreaking soundtrack, and perfect timing in its direction and production. Everywhere you turn, there is wonder. Kan Gao created a masterpiece there.\n\nUnfortunately, A Bird Story has none of this. The story is cliché, utterly predictable from the start. There are only three different settings, which are repeated without any change. The musical theme is the same everywhere, and it's not very interesting. There is no character development to speak of. Worst, the pacing is just very ... off. Repeated scenes of walking through corridors towards the same place you were before. For such a short story, you would want some variety. But there is none. It's not full of wonder. It's just annoying.\n\nArt is an experiment. There is no doubt that Kan Gao is bursting with talent. But in this case, the experiment failed. I think the attempt was to create something subtle and low-key. But it's just so subtle that the "player" risks being totally un-engaged.\n\nI guess I should say something good? The ending is quite sweet. But, it's also very predictable.\n\nI'm glad I bought the game (plus the soundtrack) to support video game art, but I find this very hard to recommend, even to fans of this genre of art-story games.\n\nI would like to thank the developer for supporting Linux!","November 8, 2014","false","9.1"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","7","22","0","3"

The surreal imagery could have led to so many interesting possibilities but instead the story goes nowhere and tells a very banal story. The music is amazing and the visuals are very interesting and I can see the Kan learned a lot and improved but in the story aspect, the main thing of this game, it just falls flat to me. Where "To The Moon" is one of the best, most emotional, most interesting and most original story I have ever heard, sticking with me and making me feel warm when I think of it; this one feels like it took the safe route and told a very bland story in a visually interesting but not emotionally interesting.\nIf you want to see what Kan Gao can really do play "To The Moon", it's a must!

The emotional impact of the game is undermined by the relative predictability of the story and certain elements (characters?) are introduced solely to create some arbitrary sense of conflict and urgency. There is little sense of exploration, and gameplay consists mostly of following corridors that may/may not open up and the odd bit of interaction.\n\nThere is some decent animating with the sprites to convey without dialogue, but the limited scope of the plot in general keeps that potential leashed.

The whole emotional connection from To the Moon just wasn't there. The visuals and music still had a very great feeling to them. This game had even less gameplay than To the Moon did. In that game there was exploration that you could do and some puzzles, but in this one it felt like simply just walking from point A to point B over the same few set-pieces.

I really did. I feel like I'm killing my inner self because of this, and I could barely write this review. But someone had to do it...\n\nI played the first game that the developer created, To The Moon. It was a touching story that kept me guessing every once in a while. I liked it, and when I heard that the dev was making a spiritual successor to To The Moon, I was curious to see what it would be about.\n\nIt was either trying waaaaaaaaay too hard to be unique or not hard enough. The gameplay is basically use the arrow keys and press space. That's nothing really above To The Moon, though, so that isn't a problem, at least to me. The story was WAAAAAAAAAY too... confusing, something about a boy and a bird, having no words really doesn't help this story out. The graphical style is neat, but only the player and the bird (and later someone else) are colored, the other are black, just like some in the people in TTM, although in there it made sense with some explination while in here... it feels lazy. Soundtrack is good, that's nothing different.\n\nThere are three problems this game has that I cannot forgive, however. One is that there are no words spoken. That may be cool to some, but for me it feels like an unnecessary thing that the game shouldn't have had. The story would've been better if they spoke and I could forgive the lazier parts of the graphics if they told the story with words. Two, after the initial sale, this will be five dollars or your regional equivelant. I got To The Moon for ten bucks and I felt like that price tag was reasonable. This is half that and I feel completely ripped off. Third, I JUST SAT THERE AND WATCHED CUTSCENES ALMOST THE WHOLE GAME! I'M LAZY BUT I'M NOT LAZY ENOUGH TO WANT EVERYTHING TO HAPPEN IN A CUTSCENE!\n\nI can only compare this to a piece of art.

Not only that, but other visual design elements in the world and storytelling have substantial meaning, and it feels like everything is done deliberately.\n\nThe soundtrack is also fantastic. Lighter and more subtle than To the Moon, it fits the feeling of each scene, even heightening the emotions. I would say it's the strongest part of this piece, and could probably be listened to separately from the game itself (though I did not buy the soundtrack bundle).\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly linear, as expected of an interactive story, and that's not a bad thing. Simple controls makes telling the story much easier, and the lack of dialogue removes any distracting "press this to continue" to remove you from the story. I'm glad with this choice, as it pushes the player to pay more attention to what's actually happening between the characters.\n\nThe story, without giving away spoilers, is my biggest problem. I didn't feel nearly as much emotion as I did during parts of To the Moon. While I think it is a good story, the entire time I was thinking "this would make a great indie movie," rather than "this is a great interactive story experience." There's immense amounts of character development, but due to the length (approximately an hour), I didn't become as attached to the characters as I feel I should have been. Maybe that's my problem, but I think a bit more length to the story would have helped a lot.\n\nGive it a shot. It's a good interactive story, and if you're a fan of To the Moon, you'll likely like it a lot. If you're interested, give it a go, for $5 it's a great deal, and if it goes on sale again, you have no reason not to try it out. I know I said a lot of negative things, but it's a geniunely entertaining story, if not as much of a tear jerker as I was expecting.","January 1, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Those of you with too many games to play and not enough time may appreceiate such a contained and compact experience. I particularly like the way the game merges locations in leiu of jump cuts.

In this case, there really is no gameplay at all, simply walking between cutscenes and the slowest quicktime events ever. As far as a game, it's entirely unengaging.\n\nThat leaves it with if the story is strong enough to offset it, but I really don't think it is, certainly not for over an hour of game time. The idea is a 'cute' idea, but it could be done in a 5-10 minute short film far more effectively. Because of the choice to put this in 'game' format, the story progresses at a very slow pace, and the time it takes to wait for things to happen, even things like transitions from one scene to the next, is so long that I simply lose interest. There's about 30 seconds 2/3rds of the way in that were pretty entertaining, but the rest is just a slog through the story.\n\nWithout good gameplay or good storytelling, there's really not much to go on, and I rather regret the purchase. To be fair though, the developer has some good work with To The Moon, so I'll still give their next thing a try, I just hope that it's closer to To The Moon (with a strong story that offsets the low gameplay) than it is to this.","January 2, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of people have been comparing the games, and when I first started "A Bird Story" I can't say I didn't do the same. After having finished the game though, I don't really think they should be compared on the same level. "To the Moon" is a dialogue driven novel-like game which spans an entire lifespan, while "A Bird Story" is meant to be a short story about a particular time in a young child's life.\n\nIt was difficult at first to become immersed in "A Bird Story" but as I played I became more invested in the story. I liked the the game can translate into lots of cultures due to no language barrier. I think the lack of dialogue adds to the experience because it makes you focus on the emotions of the child. Just like with "To the Moon," the soundtrack is lovely (and contains the songs from "To the Moon" Holiday Special episode) and I cried profusely near the end for a good chapter long. If you want to play this game, but don't want to be dissapointed by it not being just like "To the Moon," I would try to play this game first, or wait a little longer until the memory of "To the Moon" fades a bit before starting this game. The game should be judged on its own rather than in comparison to another game.

There were moments in which I couldn't help but smile and laugh to myself, there were moments in which I found myself fighting back tears. Just as in To The Moon, the atmosphere of whimsy and levity complements the melancholy and moments of sorrow perfectly. As a caveat, if you have never had a close connection with a loved animal, you may find this game uninteresting or slow. Which brings us to a brief breakdown of "the game" itself.\n\nWhile it does not follow traditional game structure or exhibit a high level of gameplay, I found the minor engagement of the user through simple controls to actually add to the game's tension towards the end of the story. First, you're using arrow keys to walk and enter to interact in basic ways with the world. Before you know it, you're using those same arrow keys to... do things that make you rethink what "controls" really entail. The simplicity is necessary to maintain the spotlight on the story itself. This title is worth every cent of the $5 you spend on it. Have you checked cinema ticket prices lately? And even if you regret your purchase, the developer has a 100% money back return policy. Look it up.\n\nIn terms of content, let me be very clear: it is A Bird Story. It is a story first and foremost and the key plot device is a bird. Or more particularly, the player's relationship with a bird. This is no aspiration for a new To The Moon, although a few not-so-subtle references did make me smile. What it is, however, is a very unusual work of fiction that explores themes such as social isolation, adolescence, moral culpability, and relationships. We've all experienced the confusion, reckless emotions, and hardships that accompany growing old. In this context, A Bird Story bears a good deal of symbolism that can only grow in meaning as we evolve as individuals.\n\nA Bird Story is a poignant diversion into a realm of nostalgia.\n\n9/10\nwould run from the cops again","January 5, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is undeniably short, but its length isn't a detriment to its quality or value thanks to its low price tag and excellent pacing throughout. There's not much in terms of interaction, with most of the story being told through numerous cutscenes, but when the player is allowed to take control, it's usually to partake in a significant or meaningful event that drives the story forward. There's no branching paths or alternate routes to take, but there didn't really need to be for such a tightly focused and well-crafted narrative experience.\n\nFor the price of a movie rental on iTunes, you can get this brilliantly-executed interactive adventure game. It might even surprise you with just how meaningful and poignant it manages to be in spite of its low budget and short length.","December 29, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Going from home\nto school and going home back again, after some time you don't even completely\nrealize how you got to your destination.\n\nThe soundtrack also fitted perfectly into the game, not much to add there.\n\nWhat I found to be extremely annoying though are those long pauses, moments\nwhere your screen goes blank and stays that way for a moment. If it would have\nhappened once for every chapter it would have been ok, but there were moments\nwhere it happened quite often in series which was simply put quite irritating.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed this short little story and can recommend A Bird Story if\nyou're aware of its shortcomings and what this game is not.","December 30, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't take long before you realize that this isn't a typical game; this is a game with a lot to say.  This game is brief and simple but there are moments that gave me pause.\n\nTo those who complain about the game's length let me ask you this: would you rather pay $5 for a one hour game that you will always remember or $5 for a longer game that you won't?  I usually don't care for game critics very much but there is a quote from Kevin VanOrd that I think articulates the viewpoint really well:\n\n"A game's length, on its own, is such a meaningless indicator of a game's value or worth."\n\nPersonally, I would gladly pay for a brief game that leaves an impact on me.\n\nI'll end with some pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n+Heartwarming Narrative with Memorable Moments\n+Clever usage of childhood perception in both the story and the landscape itself.\n+Has a clever way of demonstrating nostalgia, I won't spoil it.\n+Sprinkles of humor help maintain narrative balance.  The humor often references other things like old TV shows and other games.\n\nCONS:\n-The player is often left watching rather than playing.\n-Slow start.  This is surprising because of how short the game is, luckily things speed up relatively quickly.\n-The player is often asked to retrieve certain items or perform specific actions via visual cues.  In some cases it feels like it adds to the narrative in a meaningful way but there were a few times which felt unnecessary.\n\nCONCLUSION:  If you like memorable artistic games with 'feels' I would highly suggest playing this game.","December 4, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately the interactions\nprovided were simply so linear (you could not do any other thing except that\nsingle interaction at a given time) that they seemed more forced than anything.\n\nThe story itself was actually extremely cliché, but it was executed perfectly\nand did not leave any questions open.\n\nThe level design is the best thing about this game. It's not that the level\ndesign was something special or breath taking but how well it was designed to\nreflect the boys everyday life, especially the tunnel vision. Going from home\nto school and going home back again, after some time you don't even completely\nrealize how you got to your destination.\n\nThe soundtrack also fitted perfectly into the game, not much to add there.\n\nWhat I found to be extremely annoying though are those long pauses, moments\nwhere your screen goes blank and stays that way for a moment. If it would have\nhappened once for every chapter it would have been ok, but there were moments\nwhere it happened quite often in series which was simply put quite irritating.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed this short little story and can recommend A Bird Story if\nyou're aware of its shortcomings and what this game is not.","December 30, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To the Moon was beautiful.\n\nA Bird Story didn't capture me like To the Moon did. The music was pretty and the graphics were the same, but the storyline wasn't great. There were a few times when I went "huh?" For example, the vet breaking into the house...why??????? Or when kid gets a creepy telekinetic twin....\n\nI understand that a lot of games like this are supposed to be artsy and use symbolism/etc to tell the story, but the way it was done was odd.\n\nThe most "gameplay" you get out of this game is pushing the arrow key for a split second and then the game takes over for you. In To the Moon, I felt like I was actually involved. This game, I just sat there and stared at the screen for 99.99% of it.\n\nConsidering there is no dialogue at all, only music and sound effects, the story does a decent job of getting the point across.

While the soundtrack is well done and the story is well thought out, the lack of dialogue has a negative impact on the game. Dialogue would not fit the story fantastically, but without any clear ideas or progress I found myself distracted from the story. To The Moon had plenty of serious dialogue and would still be great without the comedic portion of it. Sadly, A Bird Story failed to draw me into the plot as well as To The Moon did. This does not mean that A Bird Story lacks other merits, I was just dissapointed that it was missing the emotion that drew me into the previous game. A Bird Story has great backdrops and sets, and in my opinion a lot of them are better than those in To The Moon.

Not a word is spoken, yet so much is expressed through facial expressions and animations that you wouldn't notice at all, and both slapstick comedy and more dramatic moments are carried off expertly.

It felt rather long for a single dream, but the feeling of being in a dream was done very, very well. I can't wait to learn this boy's life story in Episode 2 of the To the Moon saga.\n\nWhile the engine is still my biggest complaint with the creations of Freebird Games (I mean really—when has RPG Maker ever been a good program?), A Bird Story felt a lot more polished than To the Moon in terms of gameplay. The game also retained the same great storytelling, but while the soundtrack was amazing, it didn't quite reach the level of awe and emotion that To the Moon did. That, however, would be a very hard feat to pull.\n\nIt was worth the long wait for this game, but now we still need to wait an indefinite number of more years for Finding Paradise. :( Oh well.

The plot tells the story of a boy who lives a boring life, until that it is... until he finds a bird in the woods. Veterans of 'To the moon' who are looking for the same emotional rollercoaster ride in the previous game will find that this tale doesn't play with our emotions as deeply. Instead what we have is a sweet tale which maintains its ambience through out the game. Dialogue, and therefore voice acting, is absent in the game, however the sprites are used exceptionaly well to tell the story. Gameplay revolevs around moving your character and interacting with objects. There are no puzzles in this game, which I personally found was a good thing as it helps to keep the plot going forward and which is the main selling point of this game. Audio is also good with soft and sweet music played through out, similar 'To the moon'.\n\nIf you want a nice story (abit short one) or want game like 'To the moon' this game is for you.","March 11, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a result, I do not think it would be to everybody's liking. For example, if you are easily bored, don't like piano music, don't like 'artsy things', don't have the patience for RPG-maker, like to complain about things, are tight on money and need to make every penny last, hate birds and/or boys... uh, or, hate freedom....

It didn't have anywhere the emotional impact its predecessor had, and just dragged on. People who really enjoy these kinds of game may like it, but it isn't the must play game that brought waves of tears and emotions through beautiful story telling and heartfelt soundtrack.","March 18, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I say story instead of game, as it is more of an interactive story with some movement and selection by the player.\nBy the same team behind To the Moon, so anyone who enjoyed that will love this and with the added bonus that it is a prelude to the next game in that series. :)","March 21, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll find yourself trying to decipher how Gao programmed some things to work, and that could feel a bit awkward in some dramatic moments.\n\nIn all seriousness, I paid as much for this as I would a movie and I don't regret spending a dime. Whether you are a fan of To The Moon or not, I highly recommend this interactive story to anyone with $5 to spend.","March 21, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If your coming to this from to the moon your in for something nice. if your coming in fresh its calming and very beautiful i hope you enjoy. I would say get and play to the moon while you wait for the continuation of this as the 2 main charcters from it return. plus if this wet your beak ( :3 ) to the moon will really get to you.\n\nTL;DR a cute fun short story that is great.","November 8, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't expect to laugh so much, and I didn't expect how much more interactive this game would be compared to Kan's other projects.\n\nHowever, when the game ended, I wasn't sure how I felt. There were so many loose ends that never tied themselves together.\n\nAnd I never figured out how much of this story the kid imagined in his head and how much of it was real.\n\nI'm eager to find answers in "Finding Paradise", but I kind of imagine you could play that game and skip this one without missing out on too much.","November 8, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story features no direct dialogue, which adds to the mystery of this little mini-episode within itself.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game for its price, it's a great little story that seems to be the pilot for a longer story to come.","November 8, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
