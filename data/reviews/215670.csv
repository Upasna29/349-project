The focal point of the game comes at the end, wherein you're brought to a place where the clues of the game start adding up, forming the hints that start showing the big picture of what has happened.\n\nThe problem with this is that the game's ending clues are determined by your seemingly arbitrary actions and choices. Even worse, the changes that are possible barely even change what the game's purported ending is supposed to be. To top it off, at the end, you're actually directed to an online forum where you're encouraged to share your ending and what you think it meant.\n\nThis makes it feel like the game doesn't actually have any story at all. Nothing is resolved, nothing is explained, the game literally just gives you a few hints and goes "hey you figure out the plot, because I sure as hell am not." It doesn't feel smart or creative at all, it just feels lazy, like the dev wanted to make a game that has lots of interesting symbolism but isn't nearly creative enough to write anything interesting. If I'm just supposed to use my head and think up something myself, I see no reason to pay some pretentious dev money to do so.","October 7, 2014","false","1.7"," 126 of 159 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","126","159","3","6"

Please tell me it isn't so!\n\nTo sum it up; nothing happens. The entire game. Nothing. I could understand the notion of 'interactive sotrytelling', if it were actually a story. But stories need to have things like plot, themes, characters, conflict and resolution. This has nothing.\n\nYou awake in a strange place and attempt to make your way home. Along the way you make some grisly discoveries, some of which are optional, and the game seems to be building quite an interesting little intrigue. But then in the climax and conclusion, not only is nothing revealed, but it becomes clear there is no possible conclusion to be reached.\n\nThe first time through, I chocked it up as a failure; thinking this must be a kind of puzzle game, where you must take the proper course of actions to experience all that you should, and discover the truth by the end. There is even a small teaser at the end, seemingly intended to be interpreted this way. However, with subsequent playthroughs and some research online, the truth is revealed; this isn't an experiment in narrative.

We start with our nameless protagonist in an unknown house in the middle of the night with no memories how or why he got there. The story gets more interesting when he finds a dead body in the next room.\n\nThe most engaging aspects of this game are how the story is told and the atmosphere. First, the story is never complete. As you make your way from the house to your home you can find clues about the events that have happened and piece together the murders. How much you find and how much you progress in being 'Sherlock' is completely up to the player. This ambiguity is the most sparkling and the most trembling part of the game at the same time. The conclusion of the game will vary based on what  you discovered and what choices you have made throughout the game. This undoubtedly will leave many frustrated and with a lot of questions after finishing the game. In this case a replay of the game is needed, but unfortunately it might not bring the resolutions players want to see.\n\nWhile the graphics and the music (there is no music) aren't the strongest parts of the game, the atmosphere is. It is highly recommended to play this game in one sitting, at night, with headphones on. The crackling  wood, loud thunders, footsteps with the visuals will pull the player in searching for answers. You will never be frightened, but you will always be wondering: "what's in this next room?"\n\nHome is a very special meta-game, where its uniqueness derive from not what's happening on screen, but what is in the mind of the player. The story of the game might not get complete after several playthrough, because the events of the game have already happened, the murders too. It is not really important what happened, the important thing is how much you know about it and the ultimate goal is to know everything of course.\n\nRating: 72/100; Replay Value: 4/5; To Beat: 1-1.5 hours; Played on: -","July 24, 2013","true","1.2"," 43 of 55 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","43","55","0","0"

It looked similarly charming, and both games obviously draw inspiration from Silent Hill 2.\n\nSo, why is it that Lone Survivor plays out like a haunting love letter to Silent Hill while Home feels uninspired?   I think it is greatly because Lone Survivor smartly crafted its own story while taking on the mechanics and atmosphere of Silent Hill.  Home, on the other hand,  shoplifts nearly all of its parts from elsewhere but tweaks nothing in any interesting ways.\n\nIn short, Home sets itself up for failure due to a seeming lack of confidence in its own story.

You are searching for your wife, and immediately, you are led to believe that the character you control killed her in a drunken stupor. [I am very engaged]\n\nYou arive at your house having been led to believe that your digital wife cheated on you, and you killed her for it. You are then asked to descibe what happened, based on what you have seen in the game. It concludes with a story of what "must have happened" based on your previous responses and actions.... except that the resulting storyline is contradictory and rediculous. Did you find your wifes body? No? Oh, well then she was just a figure of your imagination. Did a former coworker return to town for something? Yes? Well then clearly he was the one sleeping with your wife.\n\nWait... was she made up, or was she real and triffling?

Focusing more on psychological horror and the fear of the unknown rather than explicit violence and disturbing visuals, Home draws you in with an mysterious if not interesting story which puts you in a house that isn't yours. The ambiguity is executed well but Home shoots itself in the foot by having Home TOO ambiguous and leaves you in the dark for no apparent reason. It also doesn't really give you any indication wheather or not walking through a specific door or interacting with a certain object will lead to you ending your time inside one of many houses, but this could be seen as a positive as it has multiple endings for multiple playthroughs.\n\nTHE GREAT\nThe atmosphere is so thick you could shoot at it and the bullet would get stuck. An eriee feeling persists for the entire game (Which previously mentioned isn't very long) and all throughout all playthroughs. Some of the events are unerving and give of a foreboding feeling as if someone, or something, is about to chase you through this pixelated nightmare. A climatic ending would've been satifying but would've also broken the flow, at least it would've for my playthrough.\n\nTHE UGLY\nThis game is ambiguous to the point of being frustrating. Some of the options which lead to the end of the current house you are in aren't obvious which mean you have to replay the game up to that point just so that you can figure out what is happening. And about the ending, although it's not too climatic some closure would've been nice at least. Instead I was left with several murders unsolved, a bloodied knife, a recently fired gun, a bad leg and absolutely no clue of what had happened or how to figure out what had happened unless I replayed it again, and again, and again....\nSimilar to Dear Esther, there's very little gameplay and an eriee feel to it all and some may hesitate to call this a game at all.\n\nTHE VERDICT\nIf it were any more expensive than $3 then I wouldn't recommend it. There are other games like Lone Survivor which have a lot more to it and may seem more worth your money and time. But for my money and time, Home is an experience which is not terrible but still a way better game than Amy ever was.\n\nSIMILAR GAMES\n-Lone Survivor, in more ways than one\n-Dear Esther.

THIS. GAME. Especially on sale.  You will buy silly little apps for your phone that you will use once and never turn on again that will cost more than this and give you NOTHING. This game must be played with headphones on, at night, when you know you won't be disturbed.\n\nIt's brief, but somehow that plays right into the charm. This adventure will make you feel like you've been sitting at your desk for hours, and it's only been 30 minutes. You're never sure what's lurking behind the next door, but you know you'll never like it, and you will usually be right.  The atmosphere is amazing.  The sound is perfect. The story is devastating. No two people who play it will interpret it the same way, and that's just fine.  You can discover 50% or 100% of the paths, and it will not detract from how the game is played at all. So satisfying, so discombobulating was this game that after I finished it in one sitting, I've not opened it since.\n\nIt's not bloody, and it doesn't use cheap scare tactics.

From here it's up to you to find out what happened. This is the first problem, I surely like games that based themselves in mystery and even those that leave some of the story open to interpretation, but Home relies HEAVILY on that certain aspect. While some people may like that, it sort of irritates me that I cannot find the true explanation of this game. There's 2 ways the story can go, it all depends on what you decide in the basement part of the game, but you have the same 3 endings if you choose one or another because in the end, they're both tragic as hell.\n\nThe graphical setting of this game, while not being my favorite, it fits Home very well. What I liked about Home is that is relies a lot in describing what's happening with accurate words like when you're reading a book, and that really helps to set the seriously dark atmosphere of the game. And oh boy, what an atmosphere it is! The sounds are great overall (whose may scare if you if you're not expecting them!) and the music is almost non-existant but in the last sections it is creepy as hell, which fits the whole situation.\n\nDon't play Home if you're expecting the typical jump scares that seem to be what everyone cares about these days. Home's horror is entirely psychological, with a loud sound here and there but that's it. It's more about exploration than horror really, I wasn't playing this for the horror, but to reveal the truth in the whole plot. This is what led me to be a bit disappointed towards the end, because while being a very good story and all, it doesn't have a real ending. You're the one who makes up the ending, and I'm terrible at that to be honest. Now there is something that I think it MAY reveal which of the "ways" the game goes for the endings is the real one, based on the letter that is inside the safe located in the character's house. Again, it's really hard to talk about this without any spoilers so... moving on...\n\nYes, I was going I bit off-topic with the whole non-conclusive story, Home offers a great hour and a half of mystery and lots of blood and death. It may be worth the price of 2 euro, I'd say yes if you're gonna hunt the achievements (they help you discover the ways the story may go, which I missed on my very first playthrough since there were no 'guidelines').\n\nAlthough being very good, it's lacking some things, maybe a bit more story development, and not being so vague about it. Again I do say, it's one of those 'games', there's not much to it than walking around, inspecting objects and saying Yes / No to certain things, some people hate that, but I like it when a game is interesting enough, in whice Home did not fail me at all.\n\nFinal Rating: 7/10","November 8, 2015","true","4.2"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

You'll walk left and right, open doors and find clues. The clues help you find out why you woke up in someone else's house and what has happened to your wife Rachel. Objects you can interact with will have an outline when you walk next to them. You will collect items, but have no inventory. The game spans a few locations and each location has several different rooms. Two houses, woods, a sewer system and a factory. There are locked doors and you'll need to find keys, hairpins and other ways to open them. After each location, the character will reference objects that you found and ponder what they could mean.\n\nThe art style is very pixelated for better or worse. It doesn't feel too detailed. The only animation is the character's walk animation. Everything else is a static object. The game is very story based and you will be reading a lot. My only problem with the dialog is that it has its own screen. It takes me out of the game when it has its own screen. As game calling itself horror, it is all at night and your character is carrying a lantern. While you come across pixelated horror such as dead night watchmen and read about it, there is no threat. So its not scary. Nothing is out to get you. There is no pressure.\n\nAs you search through the locations you'll tackle a few light puzzles to progress forward. You'll find dead bodies and read through text about how rancid trash is and some back story about your character. Even with no map, I don't feel like I ever got lost. Most things you find, you get a choice to take it or not. Find a bloody knife, do you take it or leave it? Normally the choice would be laughable. Of course people want to take it. Well everything you take leads up to something and what you take and the story molds itself nicely to what you have and don't have.\n\nThat's really what this game excels at, an interactive story that molds itself to your choices. Do you uncover a pair of bodies? Do you take a video tape that is potential evidence? Do you read a letter that you find hanging out of a mailbox? Did you find a list of names or not?\n\nHome can be played in an hour or so. My second time through I speed ran it in about 20 minutes. There are many different endings depending on the choices you made. Even with different endings, I don't feel like the game is worth replaying. Its over too quick to give impact to any ending. The game feels like there wasn't much effort put in. Everything is text, no real animation. I'm reading emotions rather than seeing the graphics convey the emotions. Television and video games are visual mediums. I should be seeing things, not reading them. I wouldn't be so harsh on the text if it didn't have its own dedicated screen to take me out of the game.","November 18, 2014","false","1.4"," 37 of 52 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","37","52","2","0"

However, just because it's cheap doesn't mean it's good.\n\nFirst things first, this game is not scary. At first Home feels eerie, but you'll soon come to realize that there is absolutely no threat in this game. Like, at all. There is absolutely nothing out there that can hurt you. The only time I ever got scared while playing Home was because one of the sound effects was way too loud. Other than that, there is nothing that should even remotely scare you in the game.\n\nHome is basically a game where you walk around, pick up stuff, and read in-game text. To mix things up, there are also a couple of puzzles that are fairly easy to solve. Home ends in various ways depending on what you do and what items you pick up throughout the game. So if you pick up weapons thinking that you might encounter some threat, you're going to get an ending that you probably don't want.\n\nAnd speaking of endings, they're dumb. I'm not going to reveal my ending, but mine just didn't even make sense. I literally facepalmed and shook my head after only "playing" the game for an hour, beating it, and then getting that ending. After this  happened, I decided to go out and read other people's endings to see if they were as bad as mine. They too, are dumb. Every ending I read either didn't make sense or was just straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Or both.\n\nJust doing one simple thing can get you a dramatically different ending. This is usually a good thing for games with different endings, but the differences in Home are WAY too huge. They're night and day type differences for some choices. Usually for an ending to be so different you have to do a lot different from your previous playthrough. In Home, however, one change in the right spot completely alters the ending. Some people might play through the game a few times just to see what endings you get, but I usually don't do that. Reading suffices.\n\nPersonally, I was fine with paying a few bucks for something so dumb. I'll play anything, and I would actually recommend getting this if you're bored as crap and want something dumb to play for an hour. But if you're a serious gamer that wants something good for the money, don't get it.","March 1, 2014","false","1.0"," 51 of 78 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","51","78","0","0"

That's why we make such big deals about morality systems and multiple endings, to feel like we actually have some agency in our pre-programmed experience. Home offers just that, the ability to shape the story through your actions, and decide the outcome.\n\nIt's just so boring you won't even care.\n\nI don't want to get into too much detail about the gameplay because honestly, if you know nothing about the game and can immerse yourself in the experience, it's pretty effective the first time. The atmosphere is appropriately mysterious and oppressive, and there are a number of unsettling things to uncover. And there are a few scares to be had, but they're all just loud noise jumpscares that the game does not earn in the least. Aside from that, it's really just a low-res walking simulator. You walk right, you walk left, you go through doors and holes in fences and up stairs and down stairs, and you look at things. There's a lot of reading. A LOT.\n\nThe variable elements of the story are based on what points of interest you actually examine during the game, and your responses to several Y/N choices upon finding certain things. At the very end there's a final sequence of Y/N questions that, unfortunately, kind of blows the entire premise. The first one has a right and wrong answer, and the wrong answer gets you a super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ "I have no idea" ending. The questions after that affect your own fate, but in terms of the overall story just give you a super vague rundown of how certain characters might be involved. I've played through a couple times, and if there's a way to get a more satisfying ending out of it I haven't found it.\n\nIf you've got it in your backlog you might as well give it a chance, but outside of the decent atmosphere it falls pretty flat as both a game and an experience.","September 12, 2015","false","1.8"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","29","40","2","0"

It is no masterpiece, but for what it is, it barely has any flaws.\n\nIt is short, at times cryptic, at times less engaging than it should be - but it still managed to save itself a spot in my game-related memory. Why? Quite easy actually - I'm a sucker for interesting and novel ways to tell stories. Not just in games, but media in general. Home, however, is a game toying around with the very concept of narration.\n\nIs there a clear end to the story? A clear solution? Nah, not really.\nIs my story gonna be different from my friends story? Is he gonna play the same game, but get a different vibe, a different conclusion so to say? Yep, most definitely.\n\nIn the beginning we all get the same set of jigsaw pieces, but we will transform them, cut them, add to them and put them together in the way we like to do - and there is gonna be a picture, that works for us - maybe only for us. And that's basically the whole kicker to "Home". The gameplay is simple, the graphics are simple (yet fitting) and the sound design is mostly basic, but convincing. It does the theme justice. And the story - for all it is - is quite simple as well, yet intriguing and novel in execution.\n\nThe game does not say: "There you go - this is it. You figured it out, bro."

Lone Survivor was good, Home not so much. Once you start Home, the game informs you that it is best played in a dark room while wearing headphones and that it should only take an hour or so to beat. Suitably prepared for jump scares after the recomendation to use headphones, I dawned them and turned off the lights.\n\nYou begin by waking up in a strage house with no memory of the events prior to falling asleep, so far so standard. After stumbling around the house looking at things, the game's first piece of horror comes in the form of a door slamming somewhere in the house. This did startle me and now made me feel unsafe in what I had hought was an empty house. For about the next twenty minutes the game makes me feel tense. The sudden noises and clostrophobic amount of light you have to see by do well to create a sense of atmosphere and tension.\n\nHowever, this didn't last. Around the thrid time hearing a noise I was on the edge of my seat; expecting something to leap out and tear my face off any second. By the eigth time I heard a noise, I realized 'any second' wasn't ever going to come. All too soon I realized that all the game had up its sleeve were noises, creating the illusion of being stalked by something that never shows up. Indeed nothing much happens at all in this game.\n\nStarting from the most generic opening, the game never solidifies. You are searching for a way out of you initial location and get home to your wife, stumbling through the wake of some monster or killer that is presumably present. Along the way you come across a bunch of seemingly unconnected murder victims and personal effects of your wife, all of it remaining a huge mystery up until the end. But instead of there actually being any form of resolution the game down right expects you to choose your twist ending; blatantly asking you which twist is the one that happens. Then you must choose how you rationalize the events with the ending you chose. This ends up creating a jumbled mess of meaningless atempts at symbolism and rendering pointless any build-up you might have felt as you are forced to choose the meaning behind every mystery in the game.\n\nAdmittedly I missed one or two things. I never found out what was on the tape and I missed one or two rooms in the factory because I didn't realize the door that required a key card would lock behind me and force me to exit the level.

Even if the game weren't a pile of random environments and situations that might be considered spooky, anything they might have lended to the plot would all be rendered meaningless by choosing your ending anyway.

That's not a put down of either old or new games, just an observation that I think applies to this one in particular.\n\nSome may feel it is laziness to leave so much to the imagination with the game's story but I found that a nice contrast to games that spoon feed you endings that often leave a lot to be desired. Of course, you may feel not being provided with a nice tidy well explained story leaves a lot to be desired but with this game it is on purpose. It is part of the design. Either you will appreciate this or not but it is what it is. I liked it myself.\n\nThis game struck me as more of a mystery with horror elements. This isn't a jump scares kind of experience at all. With the right mindset though, there is a bit of tension at times as you wonder what is going on or what might happen where you are about to go next.\n\nIf the above sounds interesting or appealing to you, my guess is you'll like it.

Given the way that the text slowly and agonising reveals mundane details about uninmportant objects, this may have been a blessing in disguise.\n\n"Atmosphere" in this sense pretty much comes down to two things: It's dark so you have to use a flashlight, and there's a noise filter. Occaisionally music or ambient sound will help a little and it is usually to signify something that should be important and horrifying. Partially due to the presentation and your character's narration, events fail to have significant impact beyond "oh, okay then". I spent the whole game waiting for it to start in earnest.\n\nThe story itself, and its "big reveal" is pretty obvious from the offset. I missed a few clues here and there due to the previously mentioned text issues, or one way doors that inform you that you have missed something and yet prevent you from returning. At the end, you are basically given the option to let things play out in the way you expect, or to have the horrible reveal simply not be there. This might have been a good element if it weren't for the fact that when choosing this option the plot simply does not resolve itself; the character is content simply to say "there are still unanswered questions" Maybe picking different options will give a more satsifying conclusion, but I have no desire to replay it.\n\nHome is very short, which is not something I consider to be a negative, especially when telling a short story with replayable elements. Even at its advertised playtime of 1.5 hours, Home outstayed its welcome. Puzzles that involved using things over and over until they click, mazes, and "hunt the progression ball" made the entire thing a dull slog to an underwhelming end.\n\nIf you want a short, atmospheric horror game, play Serena, or Justine, the free story for Amnesia: the Dark Decent. If you want a 2d pixel horror, play Lone Survivor. As it stands, I cannot reccomend Home. It is a dissapointing waste of potential.","February 17, 2014","false","6.7"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","0"

For what it's worth, it has a really pleasing visual style. I didn't come across any bugs while playing - the whole thing functioned pretty smoothly. It was atmospheric enough, sound design was okay, controls were intuitive despite minimal instruction. I really wanted to like this game and I was excited to play it.\n\nBut - and this is a big but - the game was predictable and unchallenging to the point of being boring. The (potential?) twist was apparent early on, and the level of control over the outcome that was promised honestly amounted to little more than some contrived yes or no questions at the very end of the game, and a resulting pretty vague text summary. I wouldn't have minded this so much if the gameplay was interesting but it really wasn't much more than just walking from room to room. The puzzles were hardly puzzles at all, no critical thinking (or even just plain old trial and error) required. I spent the entire time feeling a little bit like I was playing a tutorial, just waiting for the game to start.\n\nUltimately, it's an interesting idea, with great visual design, but the story needed more time to incubate and mature. I just didn't care about any of the characters. I didn't feel engaged at all; I didn't feel like the story was even really trying to engage me. Though I appreciate that this game wasn't aiming to be an amazing platformer or adventure game or anything, I still feel that better gameplay elements were needed to justify using this platform to deliver this story. I don't particularly understand why it had to be a game as opposed to perhaps a visual novel or a short story. I don't understand why the only thing I was given to do between tiny dribs and drabs of story was slowly walking through often repetitive environments.\n\nThis game was purchased for me as a gift during a steam sale, and while I don't regret playing it, I'd hesitate to push anyone to spend money on it.","December 19, 2015","false","6.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Atmospheric, keeps you on edge and the old school graphics are really neat. I loved the idea that only a small part of the screen is lighted, to add to the already creepy mood. I'm an easily spooked person and scared of the dark, so my imagination went haywire.\n\nThe problem though is that the game literally hands you a notebook and says "Here, write something down". You walk around, trying to piece the story together and basically depending on what you answer, your character will think that is exactly what happens. But there doesn't really seem to be any consequences or rewards to it. So technically, the game could end in many different ways, but when you've played it once, then you'll already know all the other options.\n\nOnce you realize this, the game becomes a huge let down. I played it to find out the story, not just answer Yes or No to a couple of questions and then basically write a story myself. Everything is also thought out in a "That probably happened.." and "I probably did that...", which makes the answers in general seem like nothing really did happen.\n\nI guess the game is supposed to be thought provoking like the movie "The Blair Witch Project", and personally I don't like such stories. I want a solid story which you can follow, not just things that happen and then you have to make up your own mind as to what -really- happened in the end.","November 28, 2013","false","0.8"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

In the end, depending on what you uncovered, your character recalled all your path. Between several bodies, an apparent serial killer lurking around and strolls through sewers, cave, forest or the plant where you worked, Home was made to experience several stories in an atmosphere of horror.\n\nIndeed, the goal isn't really to scare the player (though some sounds are unexpected) but to let him imagine the worst and to wait for something or someone appearing suddenly. It's kinda psychological: will you look under rags and decide if it's your wife or not? Do you want to see the reality or not?\n\nHome is mainly going from a room to another to collect things (or not if you don't want to include some parts in the story). You can also jump down or find another way around: in that case, you will advance at the same speed than with a leg that hurts. There are some occasional puzzles: find a switch to open a door, turn valves or restablish some power for example.\n\nThe game is made to look like a retro one, which is something that I like because it's giving also a particular ambiance and less scary than 3D stuff. The soundtrack is composed of only ambient sounds: winds, cave echoes, doors, etc... It is sufficient.\n\nWhy did I play it again so as I've played it in 2014? When I was looking at my library, I kinda thought that I didn't play it. I saw achievements not unlocked with 79 minutes of playing and looked at the news. They were added the 6th november 2015. Well, it's a nice discovering, prompting me to reinstall the game and to play it again.... with the controller too. The commands are smooth with it....\n\nIn the end, Home gained a new interest with achievements, even if I reviewed it earlier, it would have still been a thumb up. If you like games like that (not many scares, ambiance leading you to ask if your character is sane, retro graphics), go for it. It's really a little gem.","November 29, 2015","true","3.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Although I applaud the game for being what it is, it lacked quite a few things to make it recommendable.\n\nIn brief, the game was not engaging enough.  The horror atmosphere was the main drive for the game, but by the end, after seeing similar generic sets especially near the end, the effect had worn off.  The "puzzles" can barely be considered puzzles, no cognitive thought required.  And the story, I could not get myself to care about the main character or his lover or anyone else to care how they had died or if they were still alive.  There really is no satisfying ending to answer all the questions I had by the end (what was the shadowy figure in the forrest?), which is what I believe the devs intended to let our own imagination be the horror, but it just feels ineffective and lazy, especially if the ending is decided by a few promts at the very end, many of which I found myself not caring how I replied to.\n\nI don't regret my time spent in this game especially for the price I paid (mere pennies during a sale), but I won't try pushing others to spend money and time into this game.\n\nIf I were to recommend a game of similar style, I would suggest The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.

Many may just find it very ugly, still, it serves its purpose and it is nice to see that with such simplistic graphics comes a great atmospheric game that belongs to the horror genre.\n\nIt is not a long adventure - the game tells its tale in an hour or so. This is a tale of an unnamed protagonist who finds himself alone in a house with just a flashlight beside him. Without the recollection of how he got there, of course. Then his journey begins and continues in the sewers, a dark forest and a few abandoned places only for him to be able to find his way - you guessed it - home.\n\nThe game is really about immersion - we only interact with highlighted objects and make decisions as to whether or not a certain item should be picked up and / or used. I especially liked how most of the highlighted objects can be looked at twice (resulting in more than one monologue). I did not notice this during my first walkthrough then I was eager to hear what our hero has to say. He might just mention something for the 2nd time that brings us closer to the big picture.\n\nAnd what this big picture is? Naturally, I avoid spoilers here but I have to admit the ending is a bit vague - perhaps that is the intention of the developer.

The estimate of 1.5 hours to play through in one sitting is about right, so it's not very long.  Also, it's rather linear and there's not a lot of stuff to do; you walk around finding objects to solve fairly simple puzzles while reading bits of text about the story.  And I think that's the real draw here, the story -- your actions will influence the story and its outcome.  The ending seemed relatively open-ended to me, leaving room for different interpretations of what just happened and why.  I've only played the game once so far, but I think there is some replay value in making different choices to get different endings and see aspects of the story.

The ambience hit and the story-telling was both unique and interesting. I wanted to know what happened just as much as I wanted to play the game. Off to a great start!\n\nBut as the game progressed, the scares weren't there anymore. It went from horror to a dark-style story-telling game. There's nothing wrong with that but if you're going to market a game as "a unique horror adventure game", it needs to be scary all the way through. It wasn't. It was eerie at best and even that might be an overstatement. Luckily the story was still interesting.\n\nUp until the climax anyway.\n\nAfter a long journey back home which is plagued with dead bodies, item collecting, and more mysterious than the game seems capable of solving, the narrator gets home, goes into the basement, and finds a sheet lying on the floor. Then the player gets to decide if his wife's body is underneath said blanket. If you pick the "yes" option, you get to decide if the narrator killed his wife or if someone else did it. It's pretty straight forward but disappointing. But if you pick the "no" option, suddenly his wife never existed (even though there's a note from her in the office still), he was sleepwalking the whole time, and the fact that she didn't exist is suddenly the player's fault. Yep, the player gets blamed for taking his precious wife away. Either way, after the anti-climactic reveal, you get the go through the house again and look at all the items you picked up along the way. As you examine the items again, you get to decide more plot points which are either not important or just plain silly. Then the narrator leaves the house, goes through a monologue, and that's it. Game over.\n\nNot only does Home fall short on the promise of horror, the story-telling is annoying and the plot, no matter what ending you choose, is flimsy and ill thought out. Home had so much potential at the beginning but it really just fell on its face. If you're going to promise something in the subtitle, make sure it delivers. Otherwise you're going to end up with something like this.","March 31, 2015","false","5.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I was expecting to be afraid, or at the very least to feel on edge. Being the scardey cat that I am, I surprisingly never felt uncomfortable. It was somewhat of a letdown in that respect.\n\nWhat I did like about the game is that while finding clues, your character will sometimes propose questions that basically ask you how he should interpret them. You can make him start to feel guilty, as if he's done something wrong, or you can project that onto other characters. This seemed to play a big role in how your character inevitably decides how to handle what he's discovered, and inevitably deciding how the story will end.\n\nLike for many other reviewers, that still didn't feel like enough. You never find out the truth of what happened, only your interpretation based on what you observed. I admit, in retrospect it's clever and almost enough. But I wanted to KNOW what happened; so I was left feeling unsatisfied.\n\nI wish I didn't have to give a yes or no recommendation as I could see how some people would enjoy it for the very reasons others don't—and vise versa.

But like any established genre, there are certain tropes and cliches that, while not necessarily problematic by nature have a tendency to stand out as lazy, boring substitutes for more creative writing like someone grabbing various pieces of other works to form their own blob of uninspired concoction.\n\nThe reason this is at all relevant is for the fact Home, something of a horror/choose-your-own-adventure mashup, seems to exist almost as an example of how an over reliance on tired tropes can create something that's both immensely dull and almost laughable. With every line of dialogue it cements itself within an impenetrable block of ambiguous, derivative nonsense, substituting in player choice for a lack of any definitive answers and in the process creating an abundance of narrative dissonance.\n\nIt's entirely possible I chose the "wrong" path, made inaccurate assumptions about what may or may not have happened by which to base my outcome on, but if so that doesn't dispel the issue of how easily it is to make said mistakes and thus wind up with a story that's so convoluted and full of holes that any answers you may be hopping to obtain might legitimately not exist. Perhaps it's a bit telling that the most interesting element of Home are the stories and explanations people have come up with to try and make sense out of the experience, though as far as I've read never quite being able to explain away all the gaps in a way that is at all believable.\n\nAs far as I can tell those answers are by design nowhere to be found. Whether this is the result of over ambitious, disorganized, or just lazy writing (or some combination there of) I couldn't say, but the end result is little more than a mess that I'd be happy to never have to wade through again.","October 28, 2014","false","0.9"," 24 of 46 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","24","46","0","0"

I'd recommend it only for those who are interested in playing through what is essentially a short story where they are allowed to choose how the narrative develops. There is a generally spooky atmosphere, and the graphics are minimalist in their presentation. The story itself plays out slowly and the player is left to figure out, through interpretation and choice, how the events presented unfold.\n\nUltimately it sets out to do what it tries to, and doesn't purport itself as much more, which is good because there really isn't a lot to it. There aren't any challenges to speak of, and the game is only enjoyable for one or two playthroughs, which are also very short.

With its simple presentation and gameplay, that is really all it has going for it. The game gives itself the horror tag, including a suggestion to wear headphones and turn off the lights like many recent games have done. However, the game isn't intensly scary at all. If there is one lesson to be learned from Slender, it is that sound design can make for very terrifying and suspenseful situations. Home didn't apply this lesson (though it could have been due to fiscal restraints. They credit freesounds.com as where they got some of their samples). THe atmospheric noise isn't all that tense, and only twice does a loud noise occur that gives me a small jump. More like a bounce actually. Sounds also abruptly stop like when the door animation finishes, or if you suddenly stop your character moving. Its sorta nitpicky, but it took me out of the game. As well as the audio, the aesthetics are just nothing to write home about. It has very plain looking pixel art, and nothing truly looks grimy or dusy or anything that the character narrates. One doesn't need immense graphical fidelity to make an image foreboding or creepy, but rare spatters of pixel blood just don't do the job.\n\nThe actual gameplay is simple point and click adventure fare. You interact with objects, and the player character has text describing what it is, or if it can be used to proceed through the game. There aren't any puzzles, just you traversing through these semi-familiar locations.\n\nWhether or not you choose to do certain things in the game (e.g. pick up a gun, go to certain places that may contain extra information) will lead to a different ending. Home plays with the idea of player choice, and makes the mystery turn out however you feel it is going while you make decisions. I can't elaborate too much for fear of spoiling anything, so I have to leave this part thin. There are multiple endings from reading the forums for the game, but I am content with taking the one I ended with.\n\nIn the end, the game is very underwhelming. This is clearly an early attempt by a new designer, so it is flawed. I think I just wanted this to be something more. As a horror game, it fails. As a story, it is just interesting enough to recommend, but nothing so thought provoking as a new insight on narrative through play, or even as a mind bending thriller.","July 1, 2014","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Gameplay seems to be just a linear exploration and interacting with stuff that gets highlighted. You are then prompted for your thoughts on some interactions. You say whatever you want/think about it from the given options.\n\nYou basically are fed ambiguous information that your mind tries to decrypt. You always have the same basic path to reach the same end-point. And you always have to make one fundamental choice.\n\nWithout giving any spoiler, since this game is all about the experience, the ending ruins everything. Not because there is an ending, but because basically you answer some relevant questions and are given an akward explanation that goes with whatever you answered. This is crucially flawed, in my opinion, since "every run will be different", but not by much: there's one critical event at the very end that is foreshadowed throught the irreversible middle-sections that the narrator uses to conveniently sum up the important things you perceived, and the rest is pretty much meaningless. The ambience is pretty much all this game has going in its favour.\n\nShould you pick up the knife on the floor, covered with what appears to be blood? It depends on your current view about yourself, a guy that seems to know very little about himself. Does freeing the rat from the rat trap in any way change the outcome of it all? I don't know, and I don't care enough to find out. Is it that the list of girls you run into twice mean that you murdered them? You can see where this is going. You, the player, are the one that is putting meaning into the things you find. The one and only thing I was curious about while playing the game was whether or not you did have someone watching you, which would either be your criminal partner or the real killer, and if I decided to have found the dead body at the end would have actually made anything happen relevant to most of my actions through the session, but even that isn't enough to make me want to go through playing the game again. The reason I have 2.1 hours on record is also because when I first played the game there was no autosave mechanism implemented and had to quit at about 40 minutes in because of stuff in the real world; the game is that short.\n\nAlso, I don't consider this to be a major spoiler, but Home is absolutely titled the way it is because a) you find yourself initially in someone else's, and b) you end the game at yours.\n\nThe game has a metascore of 69 out of 100: I guess it's a fair value. I personally got Home at a big discount, and I'd advise you to do the same if you really want to play it. If you want something with a little more gameplay and can handle the horror genre, try Lone Survivor since it's an overall better investment.","May 29, 2014","false","2.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There is no ending, only a long and boring summary of what you did. Gameplay is hideous : it's linear with a fake sense of choice.\n\nMaybe worst of all, in my opinion, is the sound design. Sound is of primary importance in horror games, and audio in this game completely throws you off the game. Soundscape elements are redondant, mixed too low and all in all not immersive at all.

I like that it went for an open-ended style, and maybe I just didn't play the game close enough to a solid conclusion, (I picked up certain things, left others, thinking some items would lead me to get a more incriminating ending, not as though I knew what the game actually had planned or how picking up those items affected my playthrough).\n\nMy main problem is that the game sets up a pretty obvious twist that your character is probably going to end up being somehow responsible for the disturbing discoveries he keeps making (and enthusiastically questioning as though he's never seen them before since he has amnesia/sleepwalks). Then the game just throws the choice to you in the last minutes of gameplay as to what happened. As soon as it hit this point I thought maybe the ending would be really dynamic, and hey, it's cool that I'm taking a small hand in the storytelling, but the choices it gave me were actually pretty unsatisfying, they changed some of the main elements of what transpired but that just made me feel like it didn't really matter much what happened, anything could've happened, there's no shocking reveal, I'm just writing the ending and then it ends, which as a mystery just doesn't work well. The ending was nothing more than a bunch of text boxes explaining my playthrough, and really hazily describing some of the decisions I made along the way. I just played the game, Home, this is old news to me and your summation doesn't make the story any less asinine.\n\nAs a Horror game it really doesn't succeed in much. There's some small amount of atmosphere but very little ever happens. I experienced a single jumpy moment when a very loud spout of steam came from a pipe in the sewers, and then nothing else happened the entire playthrough. Discovering bodies here and there was not very impactful, and I'm not even saying subtlety is bad, it can be very good, but at no point was I really given incentive to care, more often I just thought to myself "Is there going to be a cheap twist ending where it turns out this guy I'm playing is the bad guy?" and just because I can Choose My Own Adventure (Ending) so that he's not, that doesn't make the ending any better, it just makes it so neutral that I could hardly be arsed to even try to be invested in what was going on. I would try playing through again once or twice to get different endings, but to be honest the amount of walking and mind-numbingly simple button pushing puzzles and item-fetching bouts are too monotonous for repeat trips. I'm gonna call it here and say I don't recommend this one. It's a promising concept, but I'm pretty sure much more could be done with it than this in terms of storytelling and delivery.","October 28, 2014","false","1.0"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Because of game's forks and points of no return at them and no clues that they are exist, you can miss stuff. Like that card-locked door in the car shop (I suppose?) which closes behind you.

However, there is no real ending, just a recollection of your experiences and what you previously selected as being the truth, everything is interpretable - for better or worse - and while never being able to know everything does leave the game to linger in your mind a while, perhaps prompting a replay, ultimately feels a little lacking.\n\nThis is a very short game, which can be done in 45 mins even when exploring everything.  The intro of the game recommends 1 1/2 hours, but with the limited areas to explore and even accounting for getting lost a little, I really fail to see how so much time could be spent on one playthrough.\n\nHome has the feel of point and click adventure games (without the point and click), but is too shallow to really fit in this category, and as it can be finished quite quickly, can be consumed quite adequately via a Let's Play on youtube.  I ended up both watching a Let's Play and buying and playing the game myself, just to see if I can change the ending, and while choosing different options and exploring a bit more thoroughly, ended up with an extra couple of sentences in my ending.   I bought Home on a 99p sale, and feel this was a fair price for feeling like I'd done my best to get a different ending, and also to contribute to supporting the developer a little.\n\nThe best thing about Home is the nostalgia that comes with playing it, reminding me of the games that first introduced the gameplay elements that Home uses, such as the slow opening of doors, and descending stairs like Resident Evil.  Home doesn't rely on Jump Scares or Gore in the same way as modern horror games tend to now.\nI just hope that Home inspires more classical suspense horror games.  To me no game comes close to capturing the depth and suspense from the first few Resident Evil games, and even in the 8 bit style of Home, I'd be happy if someone put in the time to give a really rich and deep suspense/survival horror game.\n\nSadly, all the deep puzzle games of old, like Resident Evil, and Tomb Raider, have evolved into action games rather than puzzle games, and while I enjoyed the Tomb Raider reboot a lot, really miss the games that require some planning, and problem solving.  So here's hoping Home maybe inspires some in the future.","July 2, 2014","true","0.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

There may not be goblins and monsters, but the 3D sound and plot twists are sure to scare you. Now, before you play, here are a few tips on how to make the best of this game:\n\n1. Play in one sitting (the game is about an hour and a half long)\n2. Play with headphones\n3. Lights off\n4.

It tries to run solely on atmosphere, with story delivered through pages of text. I actually quite like this approach, allowing the player's imagination to really shape the story, but what plot DOES exist is sparse and ambiguous. It's supposed to be, but even so, that also makes it incredibly unsatisfying. The gameplay is just walking around, finding keys to open doors. With a bit more depth to that, combined with the atmosphere (which is admittedly pretty good) the game could have been really good. It's an interesting diversion for an hour or so if you can get it really cheap, but for the most part there are better games doing similar things.","November 25, 2013","false","0.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Yes, it's atmospheric as hell, this is good.

Because of game's forks and points of no return at them and no clues that they are exist, you can miss stuff. Like that card-locked door in the car shop (I suppose?) which closes behind you. Well done! And, as I was saying, my ending consisted of a text window wich main character only askes questions "Why? Was it all me? Have I been sleepwalking?"\nBy the end of the game developers suggest you to share your story, like it is a unique experience and complete sandbox. I did not share my, but looked at other players' 'tweets' - "I think...", "But who was that shadow..?", "Maybe... Or maybe..."\nReally?\nIt kinda like Dark Souls lore speculation, but only w/o item descriptions, enemy and location design and no freaking clue what  truly happened.

The endings are a little strange, mostly because your decisions are really black and white and are based on things that you'd think are beyond your control.  The gameplay is essentially really simplified adventure game puzzles, with no item combination or anything.  The game takes about forty mintues to play, so pretty short, too.

There is also one single part of the game where, after having used a gamepad for the entire journey, I was forced to use my keyboard. Quite confusing.\n\nThe story comes of as a simplistic "choose your own adventure" format. Home is comparable to a 2D, side-scrolling Dear Esther, except you also have a very basic inventory system and the sound design is severely lacking.\n\nEven though it was somewhat enjoyable, I can not recommend Home to anyone knowing what I do now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/recommended/215670/","LordWeh","Lord Weh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/","344 products in account","An intriguing, slow, minimalist and moody horror game. You wake up in a strange house next to a body, you want to go home.\n\nAt only an hour or so long you can play the game in a single sitting, which the game suggests. Whilst the game is linear (to be expected for an 'adventure' game) you actually have some amount of input in the final outcome. The clues you find and the way you choose to interpret them has some bearing on how the story ends.\n\nThe interaction is fairly minimal, but it felt effective as I played, choosing whether or not to disturb a body, touch a murder weapon, peek into someones drawer or take a discarded photograph. The art style leaves the environments sketchy, with good use of sound and text building immersion. In fact, sound is a very key part of the game and heightens the experience considerably.\n\nWhilst the game is generally quite slow, the atmosphere is well achieved and there is a feeling of mystery and elements of dread throughout. You feel like you're stumbling over questions and possibly answers as you explore, gaining insight into what has happened.\n\nIf you do commit to playing the game, do it one sitting, play it with headphones on, in the dark, as the game suggests. Interact with everything you can, watch for clues in the environment, listen carefully and try to piece the story together. At the end you'll shape the ending to reflect your take on the story.","February 4, 2013","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game is very inventive with the genre and really tests the limits of its minimalistic style. The horror is more psychological, and creeps up on you gradually. I love how cerebral the experience becomes, as opposed to a typical blood and gore, jumpscare kind of horror game.\n\nThe game allows a lot of freedom, and every decision you make eventually has an effect on your character and his psyche. Unlike most games, where you HAVE to find a certain key to unlock a certain door to even move on...this game gives you choices. Sure, you can find the key and discover more secrets...but if you choose not to, other opportunities present itself. Essentially, you create your own story of what happened here in this mysterious situation. Your character actually tells you how they would feel about certain decisions and will react according to your choices, adding to the dilemma. You can really empathize with him, or you may even become suspicious of him...\n\nThe narrative style is very atmospheric and well written, playing out like an engrossing book or well made horror film. My experience in the game was extremely grim, and it made me curious to start a new game and try again, to see what I could do differently. It was that good.","July 5, 2013","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'll admit, I haven't played any games in this genre since Silent Hill was released on Playstation, and I wasn't too keen on the genre as a whole. Nothing has changed since those days, so I wasn't expecting too much when I decided to get a copy of Home.\n\nWhen I first played Home, I was left with a feeling of what I like to call ".... Really?" So I decided on a second playthrough, and that's when things got a little more interesting. The main hook for me was the pixels (always a winner for me.) Graphically the game is good, and the overall aesthetics are brilliant. The 2nd thing that caught me off guard was the "you decide the outcome" factor, again this adds to the replay factor and it was something I didn't know about (I should really read about these games before I try them.)\n\nWhat bothers me about Home is that everything is there, but it all just seems kind of obvious, at least plot wise. The atmosphere that the game is trying to portray is completely absent, and I really just didn't click with the game. I think Home deserves a couple of playthroughs before it's judged though, because it is trying, and it shows. If you like Survival horror or you want to get a hold of an interesting indie game then it's definitely worth looking into. I'll give Home a recommendation, but don't expect too much.","December 19, 2013","true","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

Not that "[adapting] to your actions" really means anything when your actions are almost entirely determined by what you noticed you could interact with, and not really how you would behave in this situation.  Also, the adaptive narration is sloppy.  When I played it, because of my actions, I got a text box describing my character preparing to kill himself with a knife.

Because of that, a lot of different things can be interpreted from the story and there is no definite explanation for what's going on. That makes this game truly outstanding.\n\nSo to summarize, it has a great story, GREAT atmosphere and suspense, and can be replayed for different experiences. I also really like its look.

I can appreciate both the low-end programming and the design limitations and inspirations it foces you into. But they're definitely not for everybody, and it's going to take a rare sort that can be scared by 8 bit graphics (or a weak sort...like me.) Home takes around an hour to play. Maybe longer your first time, before you know the map and what areas are safe; once you do you can run through it comparatively quickly. The ending is interesting, and has both good and bad parts; it actually changes depending on your decisions. Do yourself a favor and *don't* visit the developer's site until after you beat it. There's neat things to see there, but it spoiled my ending ahead of time. And the ending itself, being an experimental game of building your own narrative, leaves perhaps too much up to the player...a bit of an anticlimactic resolution after all the tension and build up.

Imagine me as Steve Carell and the other person being Home. It's THAT bad. Home is a indie horror story made by Benjamin Rivers, and I can tell you by far, this is the worst horror game I have ever played. Imagine putting a "Then a skeleton pops out" anticreepypasta and making it into a game. It's not scary, the atmosphere didn't give me spooks, even when I was supposed to be scared, I wasn't. The plot is way too easy to figure out, game is incredibly short, and just a bad game. I have warned every single one of my friends to never get this.\nAnd I hope this will help you too from making a bad purchase.

The game never really explains the story, just drops hints for the player to find and interpret, leaving a lot to think about after the game is finished.\n\nHowever, I don't know if this really qualifies as a game, since there isn't really a way to lose, or any real puzzles to solve.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prokog/recommended/215670/","prokog","Confederate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prokog/","78 products in account","Home is a psychological thriller where every decision you make from what things you inspect through to where you choose to explore add up to give you one of multiple endings. "The protagonist" is trying to find his way home, but as you lead the way as "the narrator", our main man finds out just how much trouble they're in.\n\nFor a cheap game that lasts exactly an hour and a half as the developer claimed, it's amazingly effective. I played it after midnight in full darkness with headphones on as requested at the start of the game and it made it a very eerie playthrough. It'd be nowhere near as effective if I played it during the daytime, but I could probably have gotten away without the headphones given I've got a surround sound set up.\n\nIt's not the perfect game because one of the endings basically is a cop-out, but the other endings are much better. But again because this is a cheap game clearly made by a solo indie developer, I can forgive the minor flaws. It's a good thriller.\n\nEDIT @ 2014-02-23:\n\nMore than a year since my original review date, I have not played this game again. Buy this game when it's cheap for a thrill, but I add the additional warning that the replay value of this game is very low.","November 6, 2012","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Definitely a game with replay value, but only if curiosity pulls you more than the lack of substance. It felt a bit too floaty for me, with a lot of potential for more that just didn't deliver.

A play through only takes roughly 30-45 minutes but it's designed to be played 3-4 times to see how the story plays out each time.  A lot of the plot points are up for you to decide based on how you interperet the evidence you were able to find during the murder mystery.  The game is as much about what you clues you didn't find as to which ones you did.  There are plenty of points in the game where you will make one choice or forget to go back and check on something that you will want to revisit on subsequent play throughs.  The creepy atmosphere the developer was able to achieve was quite well done through sound, text, and pixels.  It is best to do each play through in one sitting, with the lights off and with headphones.  It was a really nice change of pace for an evening and I highly reccommend it for anyone looking for something a little different in between more time consuming games.  Also, it is super cheap so the short length shouldn't be a deterent to anyone.","April 22, 2013","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(That's why it says I've played this game for a good 24 hours - I went to work and ran errands during a playthrough.)\n\nIt says you decide what happens, and that couldn't be truer. At the end of the game, you're left with your experiences - the things you picked up, the things you saw, the things you did - and you actually decide what you think happened (I pretended that absolutely nothing happened - it made so little sense that even the MC was confused, lol). There is a TON of replay value; almost every outcome you can think of is possible. I liked it!","September 9, 2012","true","24.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/215670/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","A 2D walking simulator where absolutely nothing scary happens. You walk to the left, sometimes to the right, open doors, and press A next to things with a white box around them.\n\nEverything you examine and/or pick up is presented as some kind of "clue" that potentially explains some aspect of the aftermath in which you now find yourself, so for the whole game it seems like you are piecing together some kind of mystery. Usually in a mystery game you put together all of the clues and evidence and ultimately conclude what happened. But HOME just shows you a series of items in a sequence and then asks, "What do YOU think explains this item? A or B?" There is no way to honestly know the answer one way or the other, so you just pick one at random. It really doesn't matter what you pick, because the game just says, "That is an interesting theory.The end."\n\nREALLY?\n\nThe game is essentially a 50-minute long opinion survey about itself. It takes a sharp turn away from being a pretentious indie game and instead veers headlong in the direction of being an oddly narcissistic one. Can a game be narcissistic? I wouldn't have thought so, but HOME has made a persuasive argument that it can.\n\nAlso, there was a point in the game where the controller vibrated non-stop for ten straight minutes for no apparent reason. I almost quit there just to maintain feeling in my hands.\n\nThe only positive things I can really say about it are these:\n\n1) The game does have a pretty good atmosphere.\n\n2) It's an interesting narrative experiment, even if I personally consider it a failed one.","November 27, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You are this pixelated guy who literally just walks around opening doors, flipping a few switches, and picking up random things. That is the entire game. You have to do so much reading, but the texts comes up 1 word per minute, and if you press a button to speed it up it just skips the entire thing. I missed tons of things because I don't have a reading problem but didn't want to spend 20 minutes for him to finish his text thought. There is no horror. I finally gave up because there is no direction and I turned random valves and nothing seemed to happen and I had nowhere to go and no idea what I was supposed to do.

You appear in a home, (Big woop) And are equipped with a flashlight. You must explore the house looking for your family, eventually adventuring through a house, a sewer, a street, a factory and a forest. The game certainly gives off a creepy feeling, but listen carefully, because THIS IS NOT A HORROR GAME. Like I said, this game is creepy, but all the while you're waiting for something, ANYTHING to happen, but it doesn't. Certain things you do influence the ending of the game, but all endings are fairly predictable. You're not running from anything, there's nothing that's going to kill you, you're literally just walking around, looking for anyone who's alive. If you still want to play this game, stop reading here, because this is where the spoilers begin. You keep encountering deceased bodies, but you don't know why. Like I said, you're not running from anything. Once you get to YOUR home, you find an empty building. IF you took the gun you found in the sewer, it turns out YOU killed your wife. AAAAh! How scary! This isn't really a horror game, but if you're looking for a really boring *Walking around during night time simulator 2011*, You really should buy this game.","April 21, 2014","false","3.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The gameplay is rather intutiive and consists of moving your character and selecting items for puzzles. A run-through is a about an hour and a half. Replayability is somewhat limited but making different choices and getting different endings is interesting. The puzzles were enjoyable and kept major back tracking to a minimum. The graphics are pixelated which I really enjoyed due to the dark nature of the game. There is no music in the game only sound effects. The sound effects are great and really build suspense and dread.\n\nThe game's plot is not linear and is up to interpretation, especially the ending. The game focuses on the player's choices and psychology. Although the game is labeled as "horror", the game is more about dread and the atmosphere of the unknown. This is not a game about jumpscares or scary monsters, but more about the suspectiability of human memory and how humans can become monsters. The creator of the game is also very engaged, making sure to fix bugs and even adding an additional area after the initial release.\n\nIf you like a story that is interpretative, like suspense, or like psychological games, I would highly recommend the game.","November 25, 2013","true","3.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

(Relly wish there was an option for that, dang it!)\n\nOn one hand gives a very good spooky vibe of suspense that something may be coming after you at some point. The story throughout the game changes depending what you find and if you decide to pick up certain items or not. Trying to figure out what happened, what lead up to it, and if the decisions you make have an impact on the storytelling. May require you to replay it a few times to understand what fully happened, or if you may have overlooked something.\n\nOn the other, short and eventually the suspense dies out about a 1/4 way. Granted the dev team did recommend you play it throughly in one sitting, and they did say it would be 1.5 hours long at the start of the game. But for a $3 game, it's a very good price for it.\n\nI do recommend this to those that may get easily spooked and new to horror games, as this is just a small taste of it but without the frosting on the cupcake.

First thing to look for is the stupids calling it a walking simulator or more likely not knowing what the word "pretentious" means. Now, the way the narrative works is a sort of unspoken agreement between the developer and yourself; the yes/no question/answers leading to the maker putting words for the plot changes into your mouth. Largely, this fits okay, butsuddenly "realising" it's all a dream was a little odd. The open interpretation AND the choice to change the plot allows for a strange and dynamic relationship between the two is ultimately a fairly unique feature if one that's a little bit subtle to mention. It's certainly not lacking a plot despite how much some may say.\n\nThis is not a game to play as a speedblitz or one to play to win. It's closer to Gone Home than most exploration/adverture games. Maybe not even a game, but there's nothing wrong with that. It is cheap as chips and pixel games are lovely to play, especially when they're in this style.\n\nThe ultimate issue would be a slightly meh ending and not being scary. The odd sound is a little jump-rousing and the atmosphere is rather dank and uncomfortable but it is not scary. But neither are 90% of supposed horror games. There's also the attempt to give it replay value but if you play it No Stone Unturned on the first playthrough then the exploration element is largely done with.\n\nOh, and there's no Vsync. It bugs me, anyway. Hey, it's £2 and not bad. Certainly a good first effort. Give it a go.","December 25, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe I just didn't make the right choices, but I didn't find this game particularly fun — I got pretty bored, to be honest. Nor did I find the ending satisfying, interesting, or impactful.\n\nI also didn't appreciate how they executed the choices that determine the details of the ending. Asking the player what to have the player character do is one thing. Asking the player what the results of those actions were, or what someone else did — which is what it started doing near the end — is something else entirely.\n\nThere are many doorways and branching paths, so I got lost a lot, which wouldn't have been so bad if I'd been given the freedom to explore fully. But sometimes I would go through a certain door only to be told that I couldn't go back, or that the character didn't want to go back. That would have been nice to know before I went there, that way I could have gone back and explored the rest of the area. I understand that a story where your choices determine the ending is one where you will have to forego one path in order to take another, but I would have appreciated some warning before the game made those decisions for me. Otherwise I'm not really the one choosing what happens.\n\nThe game did not make it clear when my actions had been effective. An example: Turning a valve. If it needed to be turned again, I'd expect the character to state this out loud, without my needing to examine the valve again. I don't think I've ever played a game where this wasn't the case. But in fact, it wasn't until I went where I was trying to make the water level descend and saw that it hadn't worked, then went back and examined the valve again, that the character told me that there was still water running through the pipe.\n\nLastly, as I approached the end, the game made sure to make me regret my choices by bringing up things I could have done but didn't. It felt like the game was giving me the finger for not doing "the right thing", which feels unfair when the point of the game is creating your own journey. What's worse is that one of those things that I didn't do, was not because I didn't want to do it, but because I didn't realize at the time that I could do it. The game didn't make it particularly clear at the time that it was something I could do there, and I had been under the impression I had to find another place to do it. Nope, apparently not, and by the time I discovered this it was too late.\n\nBut, I won't say you shouldn't play it. It's only $2.99, it's a nice time-waster whenever you have an hour or two to spare, you might like it better than I did, and I'm sure it might be fun to play it several times and see what other kinds of endings and details you can get. But I personally don't have much interest in doing so.\n\nP.S. The only technical gripes: 1) The cursor didn't disappear the entire time I was playing, which got pretty annoying. 2) The game doesn't tell you at the beginning that you quit by pressing Q. Esc did not work, so I had to use Cmd+Q. I thought this must be a bug, until I finished the game and it told me to quit by pressing Q. I guess I should have thought to try that, but the game also should have told me at the beginning. Not to mention they might want to consider having Esc also quit the game.","November 13, 2014","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this respect, this game is far more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror game. Perhaps, it might be said, this is one of the very few thriller titles to be found in games, since it makes the decision to exclude both combat and any direct enemy confrontations. As other reviews indicate, despite mentioning that you choose the ending, the absence of any indication of whether you truly confront the cause of all the events led them to disappointment.\n\nHowever, while I can understand this perspective, I think that the game stands up well enough on its own, with the interesting use of interaction with objects influencing the narrative, to get by with this. In fact, the very real recognition of your presence at certain points makes this an especially interesting title to me, whereas for others it seemed a copout. It wasn't the most graceful integration of the player's involvement, admittedly, but it was closer in tune to what I had hoped Deadly Premonition would do, if familiar with that title.\n\nEither way, for as cheap and short as it is, and for what seems to me very decent quality (sound design/writing/artistically), I'd say this title is a steal if you're interested in games that experiment with interactive narratives.","February 28, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Play the game first if you're interested,  it takes 90 minutes.)\n\nMy approach to this game was wrong.\n\nI had a restless night to kill, I had only my Macbook, and needed something graphics-lite I could play with my keyboard. Home seemed like the perfect fit.\n\nIt seemed set up as an adventure game with an easy interface. Great! I found myself quickly analyzing clues, trying to piece together what was happening. That being said, the game doesn't challenge you to *actually* understand much of anything - and so my character's frequent questions about what he was looking at just fed the sense of mystery.\n\nI was expecting answers. That's not a good start.\n\nThe atmosphere is generally unsettling because the game teaches you very early on that the game's volume is on 5 and the game's audio jump scares are on THIRTY MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING TWO. I turned down the whole thing and ruined the atmosphere just to save myself a heart attack. But it's a cheap parlor trick - nothing ever comes out of the shadows, it's just noises.\n\nThere are many choices you can make. Do I pick up the bloody knife or leave it? Well, I seemed to be an amnesiac in an unknown environment with dead bodies everywhere, so yeah, I'll take the knife. I'd hate for something else to take the knife and kill me with it. My character then muses, "Did I really need this knife?" ..... Well now wait a minute, I thought I was being practical. Am I just being paranoid? Does the game think I'm a violent person now?\n\nI picked up the knife, I picked up the gun, I picked up most objects that seemed useful. And some objects I decided seemed pointless wound up being typical adventure key items. Why am I given the choice to pick it up or not if I need it to progress? Seems strange. What do my choices even mean?\n\nSo I get to the end, ready for the story to come together. The game asks me if I find my wife. For some intuitive reason, I just don't get the feeling I do. So I answer no. I'm comfortable with that choice. But then the game asks me another 15 questions about the items I've collected and everything else that is going on. Well I mean, I'm not sure, I've only been playing for an hour. Is there a right or wrong answer? If I'm not sure, do I really have to pick yes or no?\n\nI didn't have any solid understanding of what was happening throughout what I was experiencing, and I'm sure most people would agree with that - it's designed that way. So why then is the game quizzing you on this understanding at the end of the game? I never answered yes or no - I only answered, "Um...yes?" or "Grrr, pff, I dunno, no?" It would take a clearer narrative to expect any clearer reaction, wouldn't it?\n\nI mean, what arrogant self-assured idiot would go through an obtuse series of unrelated mysteries and think, "Dude, I know EXACTLY what's going on here"? There literally is no right answer, so attempting to decide what your choices meant within a meaningless context is itself an utterly meaningless action.\n\nAnd of course, the few paragraphs of text that serves as the game's recapitulation and conclusion was the confirmation that I didn't know what I was talking about, because my choices as a whole didn't make any cohesive narrative sense, even for the ♥♥♥♥ing narrator. I remain just as confused now as I did while I was playing. Actually, more so.\n\nI suppose that's the risk of an open-ended story, but it would have been nice to see the developer take the time to script his endings a bit more to ensure that most or all players would reach a conclusion that makes sense. I understand that western storytelling relies too heavily on clear denouements, but when it's the player dictating the storytelling, the ending feels more arbitrary than artistic.\n\nSo just to be clear, my recommendation is based on the fact that it's a cheap, interesting, and unique experience that you might not enjoy, but that's okay. It wasn't my cup of tea, but I'm glad I played it.","February 9, 2015","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeekF2DO/recommended/215670/","GeekF2DO","GeekFrom2DoorsOver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeekF2DO/","43 products in account",""Home: A Unique Horror Story", is a game that doesn't play off the standard definition of horror being something to scare you, but rather something to shock you. This is a game like no other game I've played before (keep in mind I don't play a lot of indie games) and I walked away from it pleased with the gaming expereince I had. I'm a gamer that loves rich stories, and while this is a short game, taking me only 2 hours to beat at a leisurely pace, it definitely succeeds in being a game with a story I won't forget. You're thrown into the story head first as you wake up at night in a strange house you don't remember entering, with a flashlight by your feet, and a throbbing pain in your head. You must find your way home, and as you do you discover more and more about your character and the life they live. What's really cool about this game is that the information you learn as you go along doesn't necessarily define the protaganist, but rather helps the player create an opinion of who they might be. Each player can interpret what is going on for themselves to create their own ideas of what is happening in the story and how it really ends, which I think is what makes this game really unique and fun. With classic pixelated graphics I feel this helps the gamer focus more on what's happening to them in their story rather then how the game looks, which I really liked. I did a full let's play of this game in only 4 episodes on my YouTube channel, so if you're unsure if this is the kinda game you wanna buy hop over to my videos here on Steam and give the first episode or two a look.","February 23, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe I just didn't make the right choices, but I didn't find this game particularly fun — I got pretty bored, to be honest. Nor did I find the ending satisfying, interesting, or impactful.\n\nI also didn't appreciate how they executed the choices that determine the details of the ending. Asking the player what to have the player character do is one thing. Asking the player what the results of those actions were, or what someone else did — which is what it started doing near the end — is something else entirely.\n\nThere are many doorways and branching paths, so I got lost a lot, which wouldn't have been so bad if I'd been given the freedom to explore fully. But sometimes I would go through a certain door only to be told that I couldn't go back, or that the character didn't want to go back. That would have been nice to know before I went there, that way I could have gone back and explored the rest of the area. I understand that a story where your choices determine the ending is one where you will have to forego one path in order to take another, but I would have appreciated some warning before the game made those decisions for me. Otherwise I'm not really the one choosing what happens.\n\nThe game did not make it clear when my actions had been effective. An example: Turning a valve. If it needed to be turned again, I'd expect the character to state this out loud, without my needing to examine the valve again. I don't think I've ever played a game where this wasn't the case. But in fact, it wasn't until I went where I was trying to make the water level descend and saw that it hadn't worked, then went back and examined the valve again, that the character told me that there was still water running through the pipe.\n\nLastly, as I approached the end, the game made sure to make me regret my choices by bringing up things I could have done but didn't. It felt like the game was giving me the finger for not doing "the right thing", which feels unfair when the point of the game is creating your own journey. What's worse is that one of those things that I didn't do, was not because I didn't want to do it, but because I didn't realize at the time that I could do it. The game didn't make it particularly clear at the time that it was something I could do there, and I had been under the impression I had to find another place to do it. Nope, apparently not, and by the time I discovered this it was too late.\n\nBut, I won't say you shouldn't play it. It's only $2.99, it's a nice time-waster whenever you have an hour or two to spare, you might like it better than I did, and I'm sure it might be fun to play it several times and see what other kinds of endings and details you can get. But I personally don't have much interest in doing so.\n\nP.S. The only technical gripes: 1) The cursor didn't disappear the entire time I was playing, which got pretty annoying. 2) The game doesn't tell you at the beginning that you quit by pressing Q. Esc did not work, so I had to use Cmd+Q. I thought this must be a bug, until I finished the game and it told me to quit by pressing Q. I guess I should have thought to try that, but the game also should have told me at the beginning. Not to mention they might want to consider having Esc also quit the game.","November 13, 2014","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never finished it the first time and I've switched computers since then, but I came back to Steam and decided to redownload it and give it a play.  This game has a very rich, complex story, and some events within it are obvious, while the rest of it leaves you to ponder.  I like the interaction you get within the game and your impending sense of "aloneness."  It makes for a spooky game you can get immersed into.  The sound effects are subtle, but creepy.  I think they work well with the pixel graphics, and a few of the noises legitimately made me jump (I'm easy to scare when I'm engrossed in these kinds of games, so it probably won't scare most other people.)  The game isn't a jump scare game like you might think or expect, though.  The story is what keeps you up thinking at night.\n\nMy only complaint with this game, is that you don't get true closure in the end after you have supposedly "solved the mystery."  It leaves the ending open and squirming in your own mind.  I think some aspects are painfully obvious (i.e. the character had something to do with the killings in his temporary mental state, which he talks about.)  Some, on the other hand, don't give you full closure.  Why was he in the strange house?  (aside from it being necessary for the plot)  Who was the other man who had "killed his wife" and why was it important?  How long was the character unaware of the time frame in which all these events happened and he began to backtrack once he was awake?  Etc., etc.\n\nThe game is great if you're looking for story driven.  It has an Amnesia feel to it in terms of the mystery of "what happened" although it might not have the solid answers you might be looking for in the end.  However, I do think the players who enjoy this will enjoy the overall mystery of the game as well as the mystery when the game is finished.  It's worth the one sitting play-through (which they do recommend you set time aside at the beginning to do.)","April 13, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Play the game first if you're interested,  it takes 90 minutes.)\n\nMy approach to this game was wrong.\n\nI had a restless night to kill, I had only my Macbook, and needed something graphics-lite I could play with my keyboard. Home seemed like the perfect fit.\n\nIt seemed set up as an adventure game with an easy interface. Great! I found myself quickly analyzing clues, trying to piece together what was happening. That being said, the game doesn't challenge you to *actually* understand much of anything - and so my character's frequent questions about what he was looking at just fed the sense of mystery.\n\nI was expecting answers. That's not a good start.\n\nThe atmosphere is generally unsettling because the game teaches you very early on that the game's volume is on 5 and the game's audio jump scares are on THIRTY MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING TWO. I turned down the whole thing and ruined the atmosphere just to save myself a heart attack. But it's a cheap parlor trick - nothing ever comes out of the shadows, it's just noises.\n\nThere are many choices you can make. Do I pick up the bloody knife or leave it? Well, I seemed to be an amnesiac in an unknown environment with dead bodies everywhere, so yeah, I'll take the knife. I'd hate for something else to take the knife and kill me with it. My character then muses, "Did I really need this knife?" ..... Well now wait a minute, I thought I was being practical. Am I just being paranoid? Does the game think I'm a violent person now?\n\nI picked up the knife, I picked up the gun, I picked up most objects that seemed useful. And some objects I decided seemed pointless wound up being typical adventure key items. Why am I given the choice to pick it up or not if I need it to progress? Seems strange. What do my choices even mean?\n\nSo I get to the end, ready for the story to come together. The game asks me if I find my wife. For some intuitive reason, I just don't get the feeling I do. So I answer no. I'm comfortable with that choice. But then the game asks me another 15 questions about the items I've collected and everything else that is going on. Well I mean, I'm not sure, I've only been playing for an hour. Is there a right or wrong answer? If I'm not sure, do I really have to pick yes or no?\n\nI didn't have any solid understanding of what was happening throughout what I was experiencing, and I'm sure most people would agree with that - it's designed that way. So why then is the game quizzing you on this understanding at the end of the game? I never answered yes or no - I only answered, "Um...yes?" or "Grrr, pff, I dunno, no?" It would take a clearer narrative to expect any clearer reaction, wouldn't it?\n\nI mean, what arrogant self-assured idiot would go through an obtuse series of unrelated mysteries and think, "Dude, I know EXACTLY what's going on here"? There literally is no right answer, so attempting to decide what your choices meant within a meaningless context is itself an utterly meaningless action.\n\nAnd of course, the few paragraphs of text that serves as the game's recapitulation and conclusion was the confirmation that I didn't know what I was talking about, because my choices as a whole didn't make any cohesive narrative sense, even for the ♥♥♥♥ing narrator. I remain just as confused now as I did while I was playing. Actually, more so.\n\nI suppose that's the risk of an open-ended story, but it would have been nice to see the developer take the time to script his endings a bit more to ensure that most or all players would reach a conclusion that makes sense. I understand that western storytelling relies too heavily on clear denouements, but when it's the player dictating the storytelling, the ending feels more arbitrary than artistic.\n\nSo just to be clear, my recommendation is based on the fact that it's a cheap, interesting, and unique experience that you might not enjoy, but that's okay. It wasn't my cup of tea, but I'm glad I played it.","February 9, 2015","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toastparadox/recommended/215670/","toastparadox","Toastocalypse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toastparadox/","167 products in account","[WARNING] This review is basically a breakdown of my playthrough/experience of this game. Therefore, it's pretty lengthy and contains spoilers, but it's worth a read if you don't mind the amount of reading, I'm sure a good portion of people who have played this game already can relate to what's written below.\n\nAfter sitting untouched in my Steam Library for awhile, tonight I finally decided to give it a go. I wasn't really sure what to expect, but with lights out and headphones in, I booted the game up and began playing.\n\nAs I wandered about the starting house, I already became pretty interested in the premise. Exploring your mysterious surroundings in search of clues in order to piece together a dark narrative brimming with secrecy and murder seemed right up my alley. I made sure to search every room, check things multiple times so I didn't miss a helpful piece of dialogue, and made sure I picked up anything I came across in case I needed it later. I couldn't wait to begin unraveling this story.\n\nThen, I left the house, and appropriately ended up in the sewers.\n\nFrom then on, the game started to fall apart for me. Once the character started dropping comments about the handgun and knife I picked up as I searched through the tunnels and sewers, it was pretty easy to figure out what was really going on. But I brushed those thoughts aside and pressed on hoping that something ahead would add a new piece to the puzzle that would make me completely rethink my theories up to this point.\n\nThen, after completing a few more areas, the tedium began to set in. I was disappointed with the lack of complexity, the only puzzles being turning a valve a few times until they opened or navigating a "maze" of pathways to find more clues. At this point the main character has already beaten the fact that everything seems oddly familiar over my head too many times for me to really question anything about the story anymore, which made me wonder why I was even bothering trying to find all of these different pieces of evidence. But there was one major problem I had that seemed to keep reoccurring throughout my playthrough:\n\nThe game faltered between rewarding and punishing you for exploring. While some areas rewarded a little back-tracking with a new key item you found for some more narrative, others decided that your curiosity should cut you off from everything else. The biggest example of this was during my time in the old factory. After coming across a door with a card reader, I remembered a note in the first house cryptically mentioning a key card and locker, so I quickly searched the different floors until eventually I found the card. I hobbled back to the locked door, and opened it to find... a hole in the ground, which served as an exit. A little disappointed, I went to go see what switching on the power would do... but couldn't. The game had locked me in that room and forced me to leave. I felt rather cheated; I didn't see any reason why I shouldn't be allowed to go back.\n\nYet I still played on, just hoping that I didn't miss out on anything important.\n\nAnd after picking through the shop, I finally arrived home. This was it. It was the moment I had been waiting for, the big reveal of this tragedy. I pretty much knew what was going to happen at this point, but a bit of intrigue sprung back up from the interest of seeing how all of my previous choices and the discoveries I made would impact the ending. It was a rocky trip to get here, but I was here now. I scavenged the entire house, picked up that crowbar and ran down to the basement, ripped down that wall and carefully approached the pile of rags. The main character was quite nervous now, bracing himself for the horror he was about to witness... but then, something unexpected happened.\n\nHe asked me if Rachel was in there or not, with a simple Yes/No response.\n\nWell... I don't know game, you tell me. Did the game really just blatantly ask me to choose what happens? I didn't really know how to respond. I decided to spare him the shock and chose 'No', to which he passed out from confusion. Once he gets up, I notice a bunch of the items I came across on my journey here are now scattered about the house. I go to examine the objects... each one asking if a certain event happened or not. With each one I examined, I couldn't believe it. After all of that, I was basically choosing what actually happened. I left the house, he rambles on about the decisions I made a minute ago... and the mysteries that were never solved? He basically shrugs them off, then rolls the credits. I sat there watching for a few minutes before I closed out completely.\n\nNow, I get that I could play through the game again to get the full story. There were probably a few things that I was missing that might have revealed something more substantial to me. But after beating the game, all replay value plummeted to zero. The fact that every decision you make during the course of the game is basically meaningless once you get to the end and basically write the ending yourself makes the whole process seem pointless. It just feels like lazy writing to build up a narrative for the entirity of the game, only to pass the reins to the player and have them create the conclusion instead without much closure. The fact that replaying a game that only took me a little over an hour to complete seemed like way too much trouble and tedium speaks for itself.\n\nAll in all, this is a game that shows a lot of promise, but falls flat on its face and delivers only a tiny fragment of what it could have been. I'm sure a lot of you have already purchased this game from a sale like I had. In that case, you might want to leave it sitting in your Library in purgatory like it probably already has been. If not, then I'd say you're probably better jamming those dollar bills into a vending machine for a snack or a drink rather than dropping them on this game.\n\nIt'll take a little less time to get through it, but like this game you'll only use it once before tossing it aside.\n\nAnd at least it'll be satisfying from start to finish.","September 6, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's start! 1. Do you like Indie games? 2. Do you like horror/thriller games? 3. Do you like to spend you time doing things that make you happy? Well if you answered yes to any of those questions then turn yourself back around right now and walk away!\n\nNow I want to get this across, Home is not a terrible game if you're not expecting too much. It just failed to be a good game in many ways!\n\nNow the start of Home is quite promising and you find yourself to be a little scared while you're walking around the underground pipeline. As you delve deeper into the suspense of this "spooky" dungeon you'll finally find a door after breaking your leg and finding other misc. items which have absolutely nothing to do with the outcome of the game! You finally get an eerie chill once you finally get to the surface where you'll find yourself in an abyssal forest with your belongings on the corpses of random dead people (spooky). Then there's the tower, you'll climb up the tower and peer off the balcony at the top, and as you hear your character say "It feels as if someone's watching me" you can kiss good-bye to any scare value this game had to offer because it ends here. The rest of the game you just wander back to your house and find your dead wife to only find out that you're a murderer who killed her, and well every other poor soul you saw in the past 20 minutes. Then you'll get the suspenseful choice between killing yourself or just walking out the door. Now after all the non-existent character developement you'll find it so difficult to decide! Because, like everything else in this game nothing has an impact especially when the ending depends on what you choose. They just make you decide after the 50 minutes of gameplay how to finish the game. After having to come to a conclusion on whether what you should do you begin to feel cheated. I'm pretty sure I payed $5 for this game at the time I bought it and boy do I regret it. This game lacks any amount of good gameplay and fulfillment which is exactly where it lacks from beginning to the end! Now where this game can go right is if you're looking for a retro styled game that can bring back memories. The design of the world makes you feel relaxed and calm which the horror factor can pull away from. Now lets face it, 8-bit, 16-bit games like this one are now creating their own genre in our day and age and graphics like these are approvable, and to be honest I enjoyed them. As a final verdict I'd like to say that this game has a decent story where the gameplay failed. It functions perfect, and it looks good. Now if you're desperately bored and you honestly can't find any enjoyment out of the free games steam, or any flash game website has to offer then keep looking because even then this game is beyond boring. 3/10","September 8, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a horror game that is designed with some very good elements of level design, music, art style, and atmosphere.\nHowever, the game at it's core is just a simplified point-and-click adventure.\n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nThere is no true element of danger in any of part of the game. The only thing that possibly serves to hinder your progress are one-way doors that progress you through chapters(for lack of a better term). There are many optional clues to be found which keeps the player engaged and motivated to search everywhere. However, the ultimate downfall of the game is that NONE OF IT REALLY MATTERS.\nThe ending of the game literally asks you to determine what happens at the end. Depending on your choices, the game retcons details and clues and the layout of your house in order to conform (mostly) to the conclusion you draw. But inconsistencies still exist, and no matter what permutation of choices you make, it still doesn't deliver a compelling or conclusive story.\nThis game would be salvageable if the clues you found determined the ending rather than asking you to do it. It's an interesting experiment in storytelling to involve the reader in choosing the story path rather than the actions that should determine the story path... but in my opinion it is extremely unsatisfying. Please abandon this line of thinking and tell a story through the actions of the character you're attaching the player to rather than asking the player directly for input.","September 13, 2014","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toastparadox/recommended/215670/","toastparadox","Toastocalypse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toastparadox/","167 products in account","[WARNING] This review is basically a breakdown of my playthrough/experience of this game. Therefore, it's pretty lengthy and contains spoilers, but it's worth a read if you don't mind the amount of reading, I'm sure a good portion of people who have played this game already can relate to what's written below.\n\nAfter sitting untouched in my Steam Library for awhile, tonight I finally decided to give it a go. I wasn't really sure what to expect, but with lights out and headphones in, I booted the game up and began playing.\n\nAs I wandered about the starting house, I already became pretty interested in the premise. Exploring your mysterious surroundings in search of clues in order to piece together a dark narrative brimming with secrecy and murder seemed right up my alley. I made sure to search every room, check things multiple times so I didn't miss a helpful piece of dialogue, and made sure I picked up anything I came across in case I needed it later. I couldn't wait to begin unraveling this story.\n\nThen, I left the house, and appropriately ended up in the sewers.\n\nFrom then on, the game started to fall apart for me. Once the character started dropping comments about the handgun and knife I picked up as I searched through the tunnels and sewers, it was pretty easy to figure out what was really going on. But I brushed those thoughts aside and pressed on hoping that something ahead would add a new piece to the puzzle that would make me completely rethink my theories up to this point.\n\nThen, after completing a few more areas, the tedium began to set in. I was disappointed with the lack of complexity, the only puzzles being turning a valve a few times until they opened or navigating a "maze" of pathways to find more clues. At this point the main character has already beaten the fact that everything seems oddly familiar over my head too many times for me to really question anything about the story anymore, which made me wonder why I was even bothering trying to find all of these different pieces of evidence. But there was one major problem I had that seemed to keep reoccurring throughout my playthrough:\n\nThe game faltered between rewarding and punishing you for exploring. While some areas rewarded a little back-tracking with a new key item you found for some more narrative, others decided that your curiosity should cut you off from everything else. The biggest example of this was during my time in the old factory. After coming across a door with a card reader, I remembered a note in the first house cryptically mentioning a key card and locker, so I quickly searched the different floors until eventually I found the card. I hobbled back to the locked door, and opened it to find... a hole in the ground, which served as an exit. A little disappointed, I went to go see what switching on the power would do... but couldn't. The game had locked me in that room and forced me to leave. I felt rather cheated; I didn't see any reason why I shouldn't be allowed to go back.\n\nYet I still played on, just hoping that I didn't miss out on anything important.\n\nAnd after picking through the shop, I finally arrived home. This was it. It was the moment I had been waiting for, the big reveal of this tragedy. I pretty much knew what was going to happen at this point, but a bit of intrigue sprung back up from the interest of seeing how all of my previous choices and the discoveries I made would impact the ending. It was a rocky trip to get here, but I was here now. I scavenged the entire house, picked up that crowbar and ran down to the basement, ripped down that wall and carefully approached the pile of rags. The main character was quite nervous now, bracing himself for the horror he was about to witness... but then, something unexpected happened.\n\nHe asked me if Rachel was in there or not, with a simple Yes/No response.\n\nWell... I don't know game, you tell me. Did the game really just blatantly ask me to choose what happens? I didn't really know how to respond. I decided to spare him the shock and chose 'No', to which he passed out from confusion. Once he gets up, I notice a bunch of the items I came across on my journey here are now scattered about the house. I go to examine the objects... each one asking if a certain event happened or not. With each one I examined, I couldn't believe it. After all of that, I was basically choosing what actually happened. I left the house, he rambles on about the decisions I made a minute ago... and the mysteries that were never solved? He basically shrugs them off, then rolls the credits. I sat there watching for a few minutes before I closed out completely.\n\nNow, I get that I could play through the game again to get the full story. There were probably a few things that I was missing that might have revealed something more substantial to me. But after beating the game, all replay value plummeted to zero. The fact that every decision you make during the course of the game is basically meaningless once you get to the end and basically write the ending yourself makes the whole process seem pointless. It just feels like lazy writing to build up a narrative for the entirity of the game, only to pass the reins to the player and have them create the conclusion instead without much closure. The fact that replaying a game that only took me a little over an hour to complete seemed like way too much trouble and tedium speaks for itself.\n\nAll in all, this is a game that shows a lot of promise, but falls flat on its face and delivers only a tiny fragment of what it could have been. I'm sure a lot of you have already purchased this game from a sale like I had. In that case, you might want to leave it sitting in your Library in purgatory like it probably already has been. If not, then I'd say you're probably better jamming those dollar bills into a vending machine for a snack or a drink rather than dropping them on this game.\n\nIt'll take a little less time to get through it, but like this game you'll only use it once before tossing it aside.\n\nAnd at least it'll be satisfying from start to finish.","September 6, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played and completed this game back a couple years ago but just recently played and beat it again. It's a great story. It's not for those who don't like slow games or games where you just basically walk around and investigate. Choices don't seem to matter but I've only played through twice. This game is very short, about an hour and a half. At the begginning of the game it tells you it's best to have headphones on and an hour and a half of free time to finish it in one sitting to get the full effect. This I absolutely recommend doing. With this game a lot is left up the the imagination of the player which I love but many people who need hand holding or have never enjoyed a good cliffhanger in a book do not appreciate. It is a great game for what it is and it has psychological elements although very subtle. The story feels slow but in fact isn't. The game itself is 1 1/2 hours. Depending on how you play and if you're a completionist or have to explore everything the pacing is basically based on how you play. I enjoyed this title and highly recommend.

I am assuming this was done by one man, as the whole created by Benjamin Rivers thing does too. And this is fairly impressive for one man, so props to him. However, just because one man made it, it is not automatically awesome. Does Home stand as a good example of a indie horror game?\n\nSo, Home. Critical praise all-round.  Disliked by many players. Why? Because the game is simply dull. It is not very scary in the traditional sense. No real gore, no jump scares. So very un-American horror movie. The horror on display here is psychological, and real, but weak. It takes the Silent Hill approach of giving you a room full of alluded to knowledge and asking that your mind takes it from there. I would say it is fairly unsettling, but considering that I was playing a bombastic loud-n-proud zombie game (Dying Light) about 3 hours earlier, in a dark room with some gore and alluded to happenings and was significantly more on edge, Home could be doing a bit better in this department.\n\nThe point I am trying to get across here is that Home on the surface makes a good bone-chilling horror experience, but fails to deliver.\n\nHome contains some light adventure game elements, but they actively conflict with the plot. In order reveal secrets or in some cases progress the game, one must find items strewn about the current portion of the map being explored, however the point of the game is to get to your titular home, and exploring to find items to unlock more information is illogical considering that.\n\nTo surmise. Home seems alright on the store page, but in all reality it just can’t hold up. I have a general philosophy that a game should deliver 1 hour of entertainment per $2 spent of it, and home has provided me with 1 hour of mediocre entertainment for $3. I don’t plan on replaying the game, and I would only recommend this if it goes on sale for 1 dollar or less.\n\n4/10\nWould not recommend\nDon’t bother\n\n~Moose\nYou can find more of our reviews on our curator page here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/technosharkreviews#curation\n","June 24, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It didn't last long until I realized that it wasn't horrifying at all. Sure, the controller vibrated at times and you could hear some sounds, but at large... nope.\n\nShort it was, took me almost an hour to complete. That was in one sitting as there is no way of saving, which is a con for sure. The story is carried forward by dialogue prompts which pop up whenever an object is being looked upon or if the character hears a sound or something along those lines. Those prompts are the only thing that keeps it interesting... for a short while. It becomes somewhat meaningless in the end when the game lets you decide whetever something happened or not. "Did I do this? Yes? No?", "Do I find this in here? Yes? No?". It felt like no matter if I chose "Yes" or "No", the outcome would be the same.\n\nWell... pros... cons.\n+ Short.\n+ The graphics are somewhat good looking.\n+ The sound is decent enough.\n+ The story is interesting...\n- ...for a short while.

In all, it's nice, atmospheric and of course cheap.\nSo be a man, pick it up, maybe even gift it to the wife as an anniversary present.

It just barely does it for me.\n\nSpoilers!!! Maybe? Beware nonetheless\n\nWhile I didn't really find this game to be the horror-esque it claimed to be, I did find it was a nice quick play through that involved some exploration and a classic, choose your own adventure style.\n\nI had some trepedation at first, as always with games that claim to be horrors, wondering what kind of jump scares awaited me on the other side. Home offered no jump scares really... and as I played I found out my character, though he came across death multiple times, had no possible way of dying... so that was a disappointment at first... and although it let me take my time and start to explore a bit... it actually took away from the whole feel of it in the end.\n\nI went about exploring the first area entirely, the house with the dead man, trying to find what I could. I took some papers, left the gun... and found a video which I never really got to see the outcome of... I missed a point in the home where I could've viewed it I guess... but as the game progressed I found myself enjoying the exploration and the possibility of finding more clues as to why your character awoke where he did.\n\nThe time flew by and before I knew it I was at the end. It was a very short game though but having bought it on sale for 75 cents I really can't complain.\n\nBy the end I got to choose how I interpreted the clues I had stumbled upon, kicked myself for missing a few pieces of the story and found myself kinda, just a little bit... wanting to play it one more time just to see what kind of ending I could get the second round. However I have still yet to play it again and unless the mood really really REALLY strikes me to, I most likely won't.\n\nSo, with that said...\n\nStory: 7/10\n\nI enjoyed it as I started to get into the game. I liked the choose your own adventure style of it and the whole mystery aspect. However I was very disappointed with the horror aspect the synopsis claimed this game to have. It left much to be desired.\n\nReplay Value: 5/10\n\nI might replay the game once more to figure out what I missed and what else I can get, but as for that I think this game would be retired from my shelf.\n\nGraphics: 5/10\n\nWasn't much of a fan of the choice of graphics this time round. While the developer did a good job overall with his choice... I felt the game could've used more detail that doesn't come with the old pixel-style graphics. It left much to be desired.\n\n(Sale)Value: 6/10\n\nI mentioned I had bought this for 0.75 and I found that to be worth it. It gave me enough entertainment for the time the game lasted.\n\n(Full) Value: 1.5/10\n\nI wouldn't have bought this game had it been the full 2.99. Granted its only three bucks but seriously... I've seen much much MUCH better games go on sale on Steam for 5 bucks... and that 3 bucks would've been better invested towards those games.\n\nAmbiance/Music: 8/10\n\nThis is what helped the game move along for me. Ambiance alone can help make or break a game so I applaude the developer in this aspect.\n\nOverall... out of 10... I would give this game a 5.5/10 good for the quick hour or two you may play it, but then shelf dust after that.","December 28, 2013","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toastparadox/recommended/215670/","toastparadox","Toastocalypse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toastparadox/","167 products in account","[WARNING] This review is basically a breakdown of my playthrough/experience of this game. Therefore, it's pretty lengthy and contains spoilers, but it's worth a read if you don't mind the amount of reading, I'm sure a good portion of people who have played this game already can relate to what's written below.\n\nAfter sitting untouched in my Steam Library for awhile, tonight I finally decided to give it a go. I wasn't really sure what to expect, but with lights out and headphones in, I booted the game up and began playing.\n\nAs I wandered about the starting house, I already became pretty interested in the premise. Exploring your mysterious surroundings in search of clues in order to piece together a dark narrative brimming with secrecy and murder seemed right up my alley. I made sure to search every room, check things multiple times so I didn't miss a helpful piece of dialogue, and made sure I picked up anything I came across in case I needed it later. I couldn't wait to begin unraveling this story.\n\nThen, I left the house, and appropriately ended up in the sewers.\n\nFrom then on, the game started to fall apart for me. Once the character started dropping comments about the handgun and knife I picked up as I searched through the tunnels and sewers, it was pretty easy to figure out what was really going on. But I brushed those thoughts aside and pressed on hoping that something ahead would add a new piece to the puzzle that would make me completely rethink my theories up to this point.\n\nThen, after completing a few more areas, the tedium began to set in. I was disappointed with the lack of complexity, the only puzzles being turning a valve a few times until they opened or navigating a "maze" of pathways to find more clues. At this point the main character has already beaten the fact that everything seems oddly familiar over my head too many times for me to really question anything about the story anymore, which made me wonder why I was even bothering trying to find all of these different pieces of evidence. But there was one major problem I had that seemed to keep reoccurring throughout my playthrough:\n\nThe game faltered between rewarding and punishing you for exploring. While some areas rewarded a little back-tracking with a new key item you found for some more narrative, others decided that your curiosity should cut you off from everything else. The biggest example of this was during my time in the old factory. After coming across a door with a card reader, I remembered a note in the first house cryptically mentioning a key card and locker, so I quickly searched the different floors until eventually I found the card. I hobbled back to the locked door, and opened it to find... a hole in the ground, which served as an exit. A little disappointed, I went to go see what switching on the power would do... but couldn't. The game had locked me in that room and forced me to leave. I felt rather cheated; I didn't see any reason why I shouldn't be allowed to go back.\n\nYet I still played on, just hoping that I didn't miss out on anything important.\n\nAnd after picking through the shop, I finally arrived home. This was it. It was the moment I had been waiting for, the big reveal of this tragedy. I pretty much knew what was going to happen at this point, but a bit of intrigue sprung back up from the interest of seeing how all of my previous choices and the discoveries I made would impact the ending. It was a rocky trip to get here, but I was here now. I scavenged the entire house, picked up that crowbar and ran down to the basement, ripped down that wall and carefully approached the pile of rags. The main character was quite nervous now, bracing himself for the horror he was about to witness... but then, something unexpected happened.\n\nHe asked me if Rachel was in there or not, with a simple Yes/No response.\n\nWell... I don't know game, you tell me. Did the game really just blatantly ask me to choose what happens? I didn't really know how to respond. I decided to spare him the shock and chose 'No', to which he passed out from confusion. Once he gets up, I notice a bunch of the items I came across on my journey here are now scattered about the house. I go to examine the objects... each one asking if a certain event happened or not. With each one I examined, I couldn't believe it. After all of that, I was basically choosing what actually happened. I left the house, he rambles on about the decisions I made a minute ago... and the mysteries that were never solved? He basically shrugs them off, then rolls the credits. I sat there watching for a few minutes before I closed out completely.\n\nNow, I get that I could play through the game again to get the full story. There were probably a few things that I was missing that might have revealed something more substantial to me. But after beating the game, all replay value plummeted to zero. The fact that every decision you make during the course of the game is basically meaningless once you get to the end and basically write the ending yourself makes the whole process seem pointless. It just feels like lazy writing to build up a narrative for the entirity of the game, only to pass the reins to the player and have them create the conclusion instead without much closure. The fact that replaying a game that only took me a little over an hour to complete seemed like way too much trouble and tedium speaks for itself.\n\nAll in all, this is a game that shows a lot of promise, but falls flat on its face and delivers only a tiny fragment of what it could have been. I'm sure a lot of you have already purchased this game from a sale like I had. In that case, you might want to leave it sitting in your Library in purgatory like it probably already has been. If not, then I'd say you're probably better jamming those dollar bills into a vending machine for a snack or a drink rather than dropping them on this game.\n\nIt'll take a little less time to get through it, but like this game you'll only use it once before tossing it aside.\n\nAnd at least it'll be satisfying from start to finish.","September 6, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know your sitting there saying dont tell me its good cuz it look liek ♥♥♥♥ n stuff man. >:I No only idiots think like that. Anyway this game is very well put together has some admittidly creepy moments. And has a very good atmosphere you dont get from most games. And this game ACTUALLY MAKES YOU THINK and no not with horrifyingly easy puzzles but with what is happening in the story as you progress. The story is good but its something you have to put together as you go the game is not going to set you on one path of story and tell you everything thats going on. So yes I did really enjoy this game. I found very little wrong with it. The only thing I possibly could have asked would be to make it a bit less of a run around and grab ♥♥♥♥ sort of deal in some spots but other than that very fun and definitely worth going and buying. Especially since it's only $3-4 dollars cant remember. But yes thanks for reading and ttyl.","September 2, 2012","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The entire plot is based on your character remembering what happened. This is interesting because there is actually what happened and what you tell yourself. The description will tell you that you shape the story but this is not totally true. You shape your perspective but the game makes it fairly clear what actually happens, whether you allow yourself to believe it or not. I did not think it was particularly scary so if your new to the horror genre this is a good starter. I would not say its a replayable game, at least not for me, because it was very wordy, especially towards the end. This is not a problem at first, but after an hour and your getting to the end where, in most games, there is action to keep you interested, instead there is more text than usual. It doesnt take long to play at all, in the beggining it estimates 1.5 hours and I was pretty close to that time. How long it takes really depends on how much you explore. In the beginning you can pretty much explore everything no problem, but in the middle there is a lot more available that you may or may not choose to ignore.","February 9, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought that my "choices" were simply revealing more or less of the complete story as I went on. But it turns out, your choices *are* quite relevant, and become more and more impactful as the story progresses, to the point where you doubt and second guess yourself. The second guessing and uncertainty really helps build the suspense, and helps the player to develop their own questions. That's the beauty of this game. It's an experience designed not only for suspense, but for curiosity and doubt and fear, as one would expect for something of the genre.

Home's major twist is that your decision to pick things up, push things around, go through or ignore certain doors, ultimately decides what that overall narrative is.\n\nIf that kinda gameplay isn't your thing, of course you're going to hate it. As long as you know what the general idea is going in, I don't think you'll be too disappointed.  In a way, I kind of love the game not so much for its storytelling as its dependence on community-interpretation.  On their website, you can see everyone's analysis of what they thought was going on.\n\nIn some small way, it goes straight back to the Lovecraftian base fear of the unknown.  There are no exact answers, only an attempt to put together the pieces that are there.  I'm pretty sure there are no happy endings here, just a terrible situation.

There's definitely an atmosphere here with a decent story but even at almost 2 hours of gameplay (1 hour is you're just blowing by) it does get tedious towards the end.  If you've seen the description, you definitely know what the graphics will look like so I won't even get into that.  This game actually asks more questions than it answers.  I still don't know what happened.  The game did crash for me on my first playthrough which made it a bummer to have to start all over again.  Not sure that the different choices made actually made much of a difference in the end (some things were different, but nothing substantial).  I would give this game a 4/10.\n\n","December 24, 2013","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's incredibly vague about what you are supposed to do. At first, I thought the goal was a linear 'escape-the-building-don't-get-killed' game, but then I started to disover "secrets". The word "secrets" is in quotation marks because if something is clearly in front of you and outlined in white there is nothing secret about it.\n\nHowever, there were a few things I quite enjoyed about this game.  The retro style was charming, and the way the lantern created a sphere around the protagonist, while not original or realistic to how a flashlight would work, was visually interesting. I also felt as though my decisions had a major effect on the game.\n\nIn this case, the effect felt too major. I felt like I was controlling the entire universe around me which was not an escape into an interactive story at all. I was in some sort of slimy murder fantasy that would ruin any jerking session. And...\n\n**SPOILERS BELOW**\nThe only pleasant part of this soiled grimy fantasy was the bit at the end where I had the option to kill myself. Every time I picked up an item the character said something along the lines of "And I don't know why I pick that up" and I beat my head against the keyboard. This game had no monster, and nothing chasing me. I did not get a single feel of danger while I played this game.  This game may have had "dark" elements but it certainly was not a horror.\n\nEven after giving me the pleasure of blasting my brains out, it guilt tripped me about not finding all the secrets. I got the bad ending and nothing about it made me want to try again. All it made me want to do was skip to the end to shoot myself again.\n\n$2.99 may not be a lot of money, but that is an hour and a half of my life I will never get back.","August 21, 2014","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Atmosphere is great, pixel art more often fits than not and overall idea is amazing... But. But. Sometimes there are some visual changes underlined in text without any reflection to the reality of the game, which breaks description into soemthing of little importance. Also sometimes text can get very specific about certain things without any reason whatsoever so one has to scroll throught tiny walls of text. Watching animations of opened doors, of passing from one are to the other can get tedious after few minutes.\nAll in all, not bad, could be better, applause for idea, a little bit of 'boo' for some stuff.\nNice little experiment to play for the middle of the night.","October 31, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeekF2DO/recommended/215670/","GeekF2DO","GeekFrom2DoorsOver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeekF2DO/","43 products in account",""Home: A Unique Horror Story", is a game that doesn't play off the standard definition of horror being something to scare you, but rather something to shock you. This is a game like no other game I've played before (keep in mind I don't play a lot of indie games) and I walked away from it pleased with the gaming expereince I had. I'm a gamer that loves rich stories, and while this is a short game, taking me only 2 hours to beat at a leisurely pace, it definitely succeeds in being a game with a story I won't forget. You're thrown into the story head first as you wake up at night in a strange house you don't remember entering, with a flashlight by your feet, and a throbbing pain in your head. You must find your way home, and as you do you discover more and more about your character and the life they live. What's really cool about this game is that the information you learn as you go along doesn't necessarily define the protaganist, but rather helps the player create an opinion of who they might be. Each player can interpret what is going on for themselves to create their own ideas of what is happening in the story and how it really ends, which I think is what makes this game really unique and fun. With classic pixelated graphics I feel this helps the gamer focus more on what's happening to them in their story rather then how the game looks, which I really liked. I did a full let's play of this game in only 4 episodes on my YouTube channel, so if you're unsure if this is the kinda game you wanna buy hop over to my videos here on Steam and give the first episode or two a look.","February 23, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gmrleon/recommended/215670/","gmrleon","Gmr Leon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gmrleon/","269 products in account","This shouldn't be called horror, and that's its biggest mistake, if you ask me.\n\nFor many, I suspect, horror involves more explicit terrifying elements than corpses and the shifting sounds of buildings. In this respect, this game is far more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror game. Perhaps, it might be said, this is one of the very few thriller titles to be found in games, since it makes the decision to exclude both combat and any direct enemy confrontations. As other reviews indicate, despite mentioning that you choose the ending, the absence of any indication of whether you truly confront the cause of all the events led them to disappointment.\n\nHowever, while I can understand this perspective, I think that the game stands up well enough on its own, with the interesting use of interaction with objects influencing the narrative, to get by with this. In fact, the very real recognition of your presence at certain points makes this an especially interesting title to me, whereas for others it seemed a copout.

It's like you walked through your house the night before, filled up a big bag of random stuff and spread it all around town afterwards. And now you've got to pick all the stuff back up.

Home's major twist is that your decision to pick things up, push things around, go through or ignore certain doors, ultimately decides what that overall narrative is.\n\nIf that kinda gameplay isn't your thing, of course you're going to hate it. As long as you know what the general idea is going in, I don't think you'll be too disappointed.  In a way, I kind of love the game not so much for its storytelling as its dependence on community-interpretation.  On their website, you can see everyone's analysis of what they thought was going on.\n\nIn some small way, it goes straight back to the Lovecraftian base fear of the unknown.  There are no exact answers, only an attempt to put together the pieces that are there.  I'm pretty sure there are no happy endings here, just a terrible situation.

Let's start! 1. Do you like Indie games? 2. Do you like horror/thriller games? 3. Do you like to spend you time doing things that make you happy? Well if you answered yes to any of those questions then turn yourself back around right now and walk away!\n\nNow I want to get this across, Home is not a terrible game if you're not expecting too much. It just failed to be a good game in many ways!\n\nNow the start of Home is quite promising and you find yourself to be a little scared while you're walking around the underground pipeline. As you delve deeper into the suspense of this "spooky" dungeon you'll finally find a door after breaking your leg and finding other misc. items which have absolutely nothing to do with the outcome of the game! You finally get an eerie chill once you finally get to the surface where you'll find yourself in an abyssal forest with your belongings on the corpses of random dead people (spooky). Then there's the tower, you'll climb up the tower and peer off the balcony at the top, and as you hear your character say "It feels as if someone's watching me" you can kiss good-bye to any scare value this game had to offer because it ends here. The rest of the game you just wander back to your house and find your dead wife to only find out that you're a murderer who killed her, and well every other poor soul you saw in the past 20 minutes. Then you'll get the suspenseful choice between killing yourself or just walking out the door. Now after all the non-existent character developement you'll find it so difficult to decide! Because, like everything else in this game nothing has an impact especially when the ending depends on what you choose. They just make you decide after the 50 minutes of gameplay how to finish the game. After having to come to a conclusion on whether what you should do you begin to feel cheated. I'm pretty sure I payed $5 for this game at the time I bought it and boy do I regret it. This game lacks any amount of good gameplay and fulfillment which is exactly where it lacks from beginning to the end! Now where this game can go right is if you're looking for a retro styled game that can bring back memories. The design of the world makes you feel relaxed and calm which the horror factor can pull away from. Now lets face it, 8-bit, 16-bit games like this one are now creating their own genre in our day and age and graphics like these are approvable, and to be honest I enjoyed them. As a final verdict I'd like to say that this game has a decent story where the gameplay failed. It functions perfect, and it looks good. Now if you're desperately bored and you honestly can't find any enjoyment out of the free games steam, or any flash game website has to offer then keep looking because even then this game is beyond boring. 3/10","September 8, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a game like no other game I've played before (keep in mind I don't play a lot of indie games) and I walked away from it pleased with the gaming expereince I had. I'm a gamer that loves rich stories, and while this is a short game, taking me only 2 hours to beat at a leisurely pace, it definitely succeeds in being a game with a story I won't forget. You're thrown into the story head first as you wake up at night in a strange house you don't remember entering, with a flashlight by your feet, and a throbbing pain in your head. You must find your way home, and as you do you discover more and more about your character and the life they live. What's really cool about this game is that the information you learn as you go along doesn't necessarily define the protaganist, but rather helps the player create an opinion of who they might be. Each player can interpret what is going on for themselves to create their own ideas of what is happening in the story and how it really ends, which I think is what makes this game really unique and fun. With classic pixelated graphics I feel this helps the gamer focus more on what's happening to them in their story rather then how the game looks, which I really liked. I did a full let's play of this game in only 4 episodes on my YouTube channel, so if you're unsure if this is the kinda game you wanna buy hop over to my videos here on Steam and give the first episode or two a look.","February 23, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this respect, this game is far more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror game. Perhaps, it might be said, this is one of the very few thriller titles to be found in games, since it makes the decision to exclude both combat and any direct enemy confrontations. As other reviews indicate, despite mentioning that you choose the ending, the absence of any indication of whether you truly confront the cause of all the events led them to disappointment.\n\nHowever, while I can understand this perspective, I think that the game stands up well enough on its own, with the interesting use of interaction with objects influencing the narrative, to get by with this. In fact, the very real recognition of your presence at certain points makes this an especially interesting title to me, whereas for others it seemed a copout. It wasn't the most graceful integration of the player's involvement, admittedly, but it was closer in tune to what I had hoped Deadly Premonition would do, if familiar with that title.\n\nEither way, for as cheap and short as it is, and for what seems to me very decent quality (sound design/writing/artistically), I'd say this title is a steal if you're interested in games that experiment with interactive narratives.","February 28, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Especially since you can play through it multiple ways to arrive at different endings. It's a little like a "choose your own adventure" book, although there's a unique twist: because of the character's amnesia and unreliable memories, a lot of the choices aren't about actions or decisions, they're really interpretations of an ambiguous scenario. This is actually rather original and brilliant. Also, pretty neat how such a seemingly "simple" game tracks many minor decisions and discoveries and item pick-ups throughout a playthrough, then in the finale asks how you want to interpret it all.\n\nThe mixed reviews I feel are mostly due to one reason only: people don't like to feel confused. The plot, however you choose to progress/interpret it, is kind of convoluted, and you will probably feel confused at different points (its ok). Important thing is, the game is not nonsensical. It would've been nicer if at the end, once everything is being rehashed and tied up and re-interpreted, if there was just a little bit more detail or clues provided by the game (especially re: how that "first man" could possibly fit in), if it was a little less the player's responsibility to figure it all out. Hope that's a fair critique, because I do understand what the developer was going for.\n\nOnce you beat it, check out: http://homehorror.com/whathappened/whathappened.php. Major "spoilers."\n\nPS: I think I overlooked another reason this great game got mixed reviews. It was/is misrepresented. The top tags for this game are Horror and Adventure, whereas it would be better tagged as Story-Rich, or Story-Driven, and as a type of Interactive Fiction. The developer himself acknowledged he was inspired by the Visual Novel genre. Yet he also wanted to create a great deal of "hype" and player investment in the game and its universe, so he really stressed the "horror" element. Not that there aren't some nice scares and plenty of general spookiness/dread/unease throughout. But it all boils down to this: this game isn't about "horror" and it isn't about "adventure" ... It may not even be a "game," exactly - it's an experiment in narrative form, and it's about the fallability of memory, and fatally subjective interpretations of events. It all boils down to the final few questions where you're asked to decide what you/your protagonist believes went down. The "boss" in this "game" is basically your own mind/conscience, and, surprisingly, it can still kill you.\n\n10/10 Would be confused/uncertain/delluded/quesy about my own actions again.","April 5, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolorurple/recommended/215670/","thecolorurple","TheColorUrple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolorurple/","511 products in account","(Warning: I discuss spoilers. Play the game first if you're interested,  it takes 90 minutes.)\n\nMy approach to this game was wrong.\n\nI had a restless night to kill, I had only my Macbook, and needed something graphics-lite I could play with my keyboard. Home seemed like the perfect fit.\n\nIt seemed set up as an adventure game with an easy interface. Great! I found myself quickly analyzing clues, trying to piece together what was happening. That being said, the game doesn't challenge you to *actually* understand much of anything - and so my character's frequent questions about what he was looking at just fed the sense of mystery.\n\nI was expecting answers. That's not a good start.\n\nThe atmosphere is generally unsettling because the game teaches you very early on that the game's volume is on 5 and the game's audio jump scares are on THIRTY MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING TWO. I turned down the whole thing and ruined the atmosphere just to save myself a heart attack. But it's a cheap parlor trick - nothing ever comes out of the shadows, it's just noises.\n\nThere are many choices you can make. Do I pick up the bloody knife or leave it? Well, I seemed to be an amnesiac in an unknown environment with dead bodies everywhere, so yeah, I'll take the knife. I'd hate for something else to take the knife and kill me with it. My character then muses, "Did I really need this knife?" ..... Well now wait a minute, I thought I was being practical. Am I just being paranoid? Does the game think I'm a violent person now?\n\nI picked up the knife, I picked up the gun, I picked up most objects that seemed useful. And some objects I decided seemed pointless wound up being typical adventure key items. Why am I given the choice to pick it up or not if I need it to progress? Seems strange. What do my choices even mean?\n\nSo I get to the end, ready for the story to come together. The game asks me if I find my wife. For some intuitive reason, I just don't get the feeling I do. So I answer no. I'm comfortable with that choice. But then the game asks me another 15 questions about the items I've collected and everything else that is going on. Well I mean, I'm not sure, I've only been playing for an hour. Is there a right or wrong answer? If I'm not sure, do I really have to pick yes or no?\n\nI didn't have any solid understanding of what was happening throughout what I was experiencing, and I'm sure most people would agree with that - it's designed that way. So why then is the game quizzing you on this understanding at the end of the game? I never answered yes or no - I only answered, "Um...yes?" or "Grrr, pff, I dunno, no?" It would take a clearer narrative to expect any clearer reaction, wouldn't it?\n\nI mean, what arrogant self-assured idiot would go through an obtuse series of unrelated mysteries and think, "Dude, I know EXACTLY what's going on here"? There literally is no right answer, so attempting to decide what your choices meant within a meaningless context is itself an utterly meaningless action.\n\nAnd of course, the few paragraphs of text that serves as the game's recapitulation and conclusion was the confirmation that I didn't know what I was talking about, because my choices as a whole didn't make any cohesive narrative sense, even for the ♥♥♥♥ing narrator. I remain just as confused now as I did while I was playing. Actually, more so.\n\nI suppose that's the risk of an open-ended story, but it would have been nice to see the developer take the time to script his endings a bit more to ensure that most or all players would reach a conclusion that makes sense. I understand that western storytelling relies too heavily on clear denouements, but when it's the player dictating the storytelling, the ending feels more arbitrary than artistic.\n\nSo just to be clear, my recommendation is based on the fact that it's a cheap, interesting, and unique experience that you might not enjoy, but that's okay. It wasn't my cup of tea, but I'm glad I played it.","February 9, 2015","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never finished it the first time and I've switched computers since then, but I came back to Steam and decided to redownload it and give it a play.  This game has a very rich, complex story, and some events within it are obvious, while the rest of it leaves you to ponder.  I like the interaction you get within the game and your impending sense of "aloneness."  It makes for a spooky game you can get immersed into.  The sound effects are subtle, but creepy.  I think they work well with the pixel graphics, and a few of the noises legitimately made me jump (I'm easy to scare when I'm engrossed in these kinds of games, so it probably won't scare most other people.)  The game isn't a jump scare game like you might think or expect, though.  The story is what keeps you up thinking at night.\n\nMy only complaint with this game, is that you don't get true closure in the end after you have supposedly "solved the mystery."  It leaves the ending open and squirming in your own mind.  I think some aspects are painfully obvious (i.e. the character had something to do with the killings in his temporary mental state, which he talks about.)  Some, on the other hand, don't give you full closure.  Why was he in the strange house?  (aside from it being necessary for the plot)  Who was the other man who had "killed his wife" and why was it important?  How long was the character unaware of the time frame in which all these events happened and he began to backtrack once he was awake?  Etc., etc.\n\nThe game is great if you're looking for story driven.  It has an Amnesia feel to it in terms of the mystery of "what happened" although it might not have the solid answers you might be looking for in the end.  However, I do think the players who enjoy this will enjoy the overall mystery of the game as well as the mystery when the game is finished.  It's worth the one sitting play-through (which they do recommend you set time aside at the beginning to do.)","April 13, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It runs at a resolution that is actually LOWER than a gameboy colour's (which is a frightening trend) and the sounds are just regular bleep bloops, nothing special there, but w/e I didn't play it for graphics.\n\nBasically, you walk around. Home is pretty much a 2D walking simulator. While you walk, you come across random ♥♥♥♥, and you say either yes or no and things slightly change. It sounds spooky , right? You get a slightly different ending eventually depending on your choices. And at the end, the writer flexes his muscles and breaks the fourth wall, citing choices you've made. That's the most impact your choices will make - the entire game WILL play the same regardless of what you do, and choices are ultimately a gimmick to attract sales or whatever.\n\nIt's supposed to be a horror game, but the feeling that you're being stalked wears off after oh, I dunno, the first 20 minutes of hearing impromptu noises but never seeing anything that threatens you. By the way, nothing threatens you. Home puts in a good effort to build in an atmosphere, but when there's nothing threatening you there is just literally nothing to be afraid of. I'm a horror game ♥♥♥♥♥ and I went through this without blinking!\n\nOne thing the game does well: it invests you in the game to a certain point. Lack of horror aside, the game drip-feeds you with clues as to the backstory, and I often found my own mind whirring, thinking and generating my own theories as to what happened. This is truly one of the few times a game has done this right for me, so bravo. Unfortunately, the ending is just so subpar. I'm not gonna spoil anything because there is literally nothign to spoil - basically, it just confirms everything that already happened and ends. This wouldn't be bad, except all you have at this point are your theories, and the game doesn't confirm ANY of them! You're left with more questions than answers - and it's alluded you'll learn more with another playthrough with different choices. Don't waste your time...\n\nStay away, save your two bucks.

It didn't last long until I realized that it wasn't horrifying at all. Sure, the controller vibrated at times and you could hear some sounds, but at large... nope.\n\nShort it was, took me almost an hour to complete. That was in one sitting as there is no way of saving, which is a con for sure. The story is carried forward by dialogue prompts which pop up whenever an object is being looked upon or if the character hears a sound or something along those lines. Those prompts are the only thing that keeps it interesting... for a short while. It becomes somewhat meaningless in the end when the game lets you decide whetever something happened or not. "Did I do this? Yes? No?", "Do I find this in here? Yes? No?". It felt like no matter if I chose "Yes" or "No", the outcome would be the same.\n\nWell... pros... cons.\n+ Short.\n+ The graphics are somewhat good looking.\n+ The sound is decent enough.\n+ The story is interesting...\n- ...for a short while. Feels meaningless in the end.\n- No way to save. Have to play the whole game in one sitting.\n\nI can't recommend this. Although, it usually is cheap so if you want to give it a go, feel free to do so. No bigger loss when it comes to money or time.","June 18, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike Dear Ester, Home is engaging. The closer you get to the end, the more tension builds in the game and in your own head, and your experience comes closer to mirroring that of the character you play. In Home, atmosphere is the star and it gets so thick you can cut it with a knife. It's one of the few horror games that really filled me with a sense of dread and unease as I moved cloister to the end. I had two issues, you can't save and one flawed puzzle at the end. The game is an hour or so long so I had to abandon my first attempt at about 30min in. One of the final puzzles requires an alt+tab out of the game to play an ARG or just google the answer, breaking the experience either way. Overall an excellent experience, double so given the low price of admission. Also, the developer seems cool, he answered my question about a mac version on twitter :P","September 5, 2012","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

With 'retro-styled graphics' and a simple interface, Home essentially lives and dies on its narrative and atmosphere.\n\nOne of those is better than the other.\n\nLet's start with the atmosphere. Very little of the screen is visible, relying on your flashlight to illuminate your immediate surroundings. I think this works well, and helps build tension -- especially in new areas, or when the (sparse) sound effects kick in.\n\nAt the beginning of each area, there's a moment of unease as we -- like our protagonist (?) -- don't quite understand what's happening. Unfortunately, the longer we spend in one place, the more the reused environments and lack of interaction exposes the threadbare locations. Honestly, each screen has maybe one thing to examine, or interact with, and the whole thing is stretched longer than it should be.\n\nThat is the perfect segue back to the narrative. The mystery is pretty standard, and depending on what items you pick up, or how you answer the binary choices (Blablablabla. Yes or No?), things will change, but not nearly as much as I would like. Furthermore, some of the choices clearly align with the developers' intended canon, and others are likely to illicit a "Really?" response from gamers.\n\nTo be frank, I would have preferred a smaller, more focused game with a dedicated narrative and more interaction (see Gone Home, or at least improve the branching paths like in Telltale's games). As it stands, it was an interesting experiment but not one I'll dwell on, or recommend.","December 3, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ellen Ripley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/denverdad/","95 products in account","Home reminds me of the games I played on my uncle's computer as a kid back in the 80s and that isn't a bad thing. Back before games became all about high poly counts and over the top action, there was an elegance in their simplicity. Obviously this wasn't always the case. There were plenty of terrible games back then as well but there was something about the style of video games back then that made for a memorable experience.\n\nMuch like a good mystery novel leaves you with more questions than answers and doesn't give away the entire story, the video games of my childhood were entertaining during play but often left you with plenty of things to ponder long afterward. You'd wonder about that one-off robot with one line of dialogue and where he came from. You'd lay awake in your bed trying to figure out if there were more secrets hidden in that dark cave your just finished passing through.\n\nHome feels like an homage to that era of gaming... an era where one's imagination was as much a part of the experience as the production itself.\n\nI'm not surprised to see a fair number of people giving Home negative reviews but I hope the developer doesn't take them to heart. I've read several of these negative critiques and to be perfectly honest the bulk of them simply have no appreciation for games that aren't multi-million dollar titles produced by teams numbering in the hundreds. These are the same folks who can't appreciate most indie films because they don't know how to process a movie that doesn't spoon feed them the plot between explosions. I don't fault them for it. They simply don't know any better.\n\nI tip my hat to you Benjamin Rivers. Well done. What we have here is a unique piece of retro-styled choose-your-own-adventure story telling and it is beautiful in its simplicity and originality.","December 14, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm gonna give Home a high rating because this kind of game, even though brief and with only 5 bottons, shows us that games can be more than just long-winded first-person-shooters with over-the-top graphics. Home pulls at the heart strings in a simple and creative way, using only 8 bit graphics and good-old-fashioned who-done-it storytelling - 9 out of 10.","December 28, 2012","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then you spend the rest of the game trying to figured out what happened that night.   Takes about 3-4 play throughs to get all of the achievements.  Creaking pipes are supposed to scare you somehow, other than that, zero horror.  I recommend only buying this game on sale.","February 21","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would say 'Recommend' just to encourage the developer, but I don't know whether if it's a game that should be judged on recommendation. From what I remember, the game was very short with a dark atmosphere. There was a bit a storytelling and a bit of thrill when playing it for the first time. I'll have to try playing it again. It's nice material for showing to a casual game friend when hanging out because it doesn't seem to require much time to go through.","January 26","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This does not tell a story as well as a lot of other indie games. The game would ask you a questions like : "what happened?" "what was next?" "what do you think?"\nThe whole gameplay was like going there, picking it, going further, using something we picked for no reason. I'm angry actually. It looked awful, had no style, wasnt interesting. I was expecting that something is about to happen. Right now. The interesting part is going to start.
