Soul Reaver is a shining example of how a game should be made today and contrary to being told that 'everything has been done already', this pisses in the face of that theory with the level of creativity and love put into it, which also happens to be a thing of the past.\n\nIn Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver you play the role of Raziel, formerly the vampiric Lieutenant of the vampire lord Kain, who stripped Raziel of his wings out of jealousy and cast him into The Lake of The Dead, Raziel is then resurrected as a wraith by The Elder God to become his Soul Reaver and gather souls and the strength to eventually gain enough power to kill Kain.\n\nThe level design is of Metroidvania-esque influence , giving you a massive open ended layout where you collect items which increase your health and energy, find powers (special attacks), uncover tons of cleverly hidden secrets and gain special abilities from defeating each boss that allow you to progress to places previously inaccessible on your quest to become the ultimate badass.\n\nAt it's core it boils down to combat, basic puzzle solving, exploration and platforming, but is set completely apart from any game of the kind with it's incredible (to say the least) plot, writing & lore, Godlike pacing that mixes all of said core elements together amazingly well so that none of them ever feel monotonous and stale, a genuinely evil art direction & theme, thick atmosphere, great level design, badass ♥♥♥♥in combat in which you have to 'fatality' enemies in varied manners such as impaling them with spears, throwing them into sunlight, spikes on the wall, pits of fire, pools of water which dissolves the ♥♥♥♥ers and many other badass ways after weakening them in combat which is then followed by devouring their souls which restores your life.\n\nOn a technical level, the visuals may appear dated to most at the first few glances but you get over that the instant you see how brilliant, unique and badass the art direction is, which is of far more importance than having millions of polygons that make up a bland, uninspired and soulless piece of ♥♥♥♥. The sound design is fantastic with everything sounding how it should, brilliant OST that blends in extremely well with the situations at hand and the voiced dialogue is simply of another caliber.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend you play this with a controller and you're going to need to use Xpadder to map it as a keyboard as this game has a lot of issues with analogue sticks, that being my only gripe.\n\nThis is an essential game that is near flawless in every aspect that defines gaming and is a sad fact that a damn PS1 game nukes the ♥♥♥♥ out of any game of it's kind today.","January 10","true","38.3"," 80 of 88 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","80","88","2","9"

Over the millennia, Kain and his vampiric lieutenants evolved new abilities, with Kain always developing them first and the others soon following. When Raziel, the "hero" of the new game, grew wings before his leader did, Kain saw it as blasphemy, tore them from Raziel's back, and cast him into a giant swirling watery grave.\nAfter his features have been almost completely eaten away by the water, Raziel is saved by a being known as the Elder God, who sets him on a quest to free the world from the parasitic influence of the vampire clans and destroy Kain.\nFor the time of the release of the game the graphics are good. The levels are fairly big and well designed.\nThe movement is smooth and clean.\nThe sound, for the most part, is excellent. The voice acting is some of the best I have heard.\nOverall, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is an excellent game and if you like adventure games with puzzles, this game is for you.\n\nSounds 7/10\nGraphics 5/10\nGameplay 9/10\nAtmosphere 9/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","December 18, 2013","true","10.3"," 71 of 75 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","71","75","0","0"

Unspeakable pain... relentless agony... time ceased to exist... only this torture... and a deepening hatred of the hypocrisy that damned me to this hell. An eternity passed, and my torment receded, bringing me back from the precipice of madness.  The descent had destroyed me... and yet I lived." ~Raziel\n\nThis game, to me, was the start of the Legacy of Kain series. Although, technically, that was actually Blood Omen. As a matter of fact, the first Blood Omen unknowingly set the stage and essentially serves as the backdrop for all of the Legacy of Kain games. In Soul Reaver however, you do not actually play as Kain. Instead, you play as one of his vampiric lieutenants, Raziel. But almost immediately, things immediately go bad as when Raziel approaches Kain and shows that he has evolved by gaining a set of wings (the first evolution of all of Kain's vampiric brood), Kain considers this a transgression against him. In an act of rage, he rips your wings from you, and then has you thrown into the Lake of the Dead. Burning, trapped in the abyss, Raziel reaches the bottom but he is lifeless, his body practically destroyed.\n\nBut centuries pass, and Raziel awakes, somehow still alive, but a twisted shell of who he once was. Then, as he looks around at his surroundings in the Abyss, an onimous voice booms: "Raziel, you are worthy." This being, only ever referred to as "the Elder God" in the Legacy of Kain games, claims that it is he who is responsible for your rebirth, or rather... your undeath. He calls you his Soul Reaver, and gives you the mission of hunting Kain down, for it is him that is responsible for the decay and ruin of the world, Nosgoth. But to reach Kain, Raziel will have to also hunt down and kill his vampiric brothers, long since corrupted while Raziel was away from the mortal world. Raziel himself had only just gained a set of wings before his execution, but his brothers... they had became monstrous to say the least.\n\nThis game, like all of the other games up until Nosgoth, are action adventure games. As this is a PC port of a game that is  sixteen or so years old, it's important to have reasonable expectations. For instance, some textures may flicker or not appear properly like they were meant to every once in a while. Controller support for this game is unfortunately borked, for when I tried to use my 360 controller, it appeared to work at first, but then Raziel would not stop moving at all. I at first recoiled in disgust and anger, using keyboard controls, but eventually became used to it and also remembered how much I still loved this game so it didn't matter to me after a while. Controller support does in fact apparently work for the other Legacy of Kain games, although, I can only confirm this for Soul Reaver 2 as that is the only other one I've started to play after finishing the first Soul Reaver. Personally, Soul Reaver 1 crashed for me about five or so times. But as you can save at any time while playing the game, I shrugged it off and considered it only a mild annoyance.\n\nYet, keyboard controls aside, I found combat as fun as it always had been in this game. As most of the enemies you face are vampiric in nature, simply knocking it down and shouting mean words isn't enough. Either pick up a weapon, impale, and then devour their soul, or beat them down a bit, grab them, and toss them either into water, a spike, or onto a fire. Combat becomes a simpler matter once you obtain the Wraith Blade, however, if you get hit and are no longer at full health, you lose it, forcing you to go back to the earlier methods. Another thing I always loved about this game is the bosses aren't "hit it until it's dead". A spider boss? Grab its eggs, set them on fire, and toss them back at them. A boss that is immune to water but not sunlight? Break some windows to let a little sunshine in and watch as it screams in agony. A certain boss near the end of the game that is invulnerable otherwise, you literally lure into a gigantic incinerator and burn him alive. There are only two specific boss fights that are... well, disappointing, and honestly, frustrating.\n\nAs you adventure through the wastelands of Nosgoth, as an undead vampire turned Soul Reaver, you have the ability to go between both the spirit world and the material one. As a matter of fact, if you run out of health in the material realm, you are forcibly sent back to the spirit world until you consume enough souls to regain your strength. Unfortunately, this does somewhat make there be little stakes in the game... as you can only receive an actual game over if you run out of HP in the spirit world. It makes bosses an easy matter as well. Get sent to the spirit realm, eat souls, find a portal, and try again until you win. Still, I always (and still do) thought that going in and out of the spirit world to bypass obstacles and solve puzzles was such a cool thing to do. I just love the visual effects it has on the world. It's not literally just the absolute same area but with a blue tint, no, these columns become shorter in the spirit world, allowing you to climb up them and then using a portal, you're back in the material world in an area that would have otherwise been inaccessible.\n\nEventually, when playing this game, it becomes second nature, but I'll just say it beforehand: "If you are in a spot and are seemingly stuck and it absolutely seems like a dead end, transfer over to the spirit realm."\n\nPerhaps for me, the only truly infuriating aspect of the gameplay of the game is... well, block puzzles. I can't blame the game for having puzzles, no, but good god, if you actually explore the side areas, there are just so many block puzzles. There are other puzzles that are not block related but every time I ran into another one that did involve blocks I just... I hate block puzzles so much.\n\nBut in the end, I recommend this game (and series, as I wouldn't consider this a spoiler whatsoever, but Soul Reaver 1 ends by directly leading into Soul Reaver 2, so I don't know why you'd buy and play Soul Reaver 1 and then not buy and play Soul Reaver 2) not for its gameplay but... well, for everything else. The story, the music, the voice acting, the atmosphere. As long as you are able to appreciate an old game (and be willing to use keyboard controls) and move past the issues of... well, less than perfect PC ports, you'll probably enjoy this game/series.\n\nSo yes, even though I somewhat feared that the nostalgia I felt for this game was greater than the game itself, I was pleasantly surprised. It's not perfect of course, but it's very much worth playing.\n\nOne last thing to note, though. A couple of days ago, one of my friends actually recommended Nosgoth to me. I said I had it in my Steam library, and had been meaning to try it out because I loved the original Legacy of Kain series. He responded with: "What's Legacy of Kain?".\n\n8/10.","July 1, 2015","true","20.5"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","42","47","4","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somethingsomethingsome/recommended/224920/","somethingsomethingsome","Twisted_omeN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somethingsomethingsome/","161 products in account","(Ignore my time on record as I've spent most of my playtime offline)\n\nEasily one of my most favorite games of all time! I remember playing this on the original Playstation like it was only yesterday. In my mind this game set the bar very high for what video games were capable of. Wonderfully written script and rich dialogue, Extremely clever puzzles that make you consider all possibilities. A unique and large open world game that managed to pull off one of the first concepts of streaming data directly from the disk, cutting out loading screens from area to area. Crystal Dynamics had outdone themselves when making this game, and it's a shame that we don't get games like this more often.\n\nBy today's standards this game would be considered a little rough around the edges (remember, this is 1999 we're talking about), but if you can look past its dated graphics and very rare glitches you will find a well crafted story with unique characters, all of whom are well rounded and are even pursuing their own goals.\n\nFollowing the noble vampire Raziel, now turned undead wraith, on his journey to seek revenge for the betrayal of his creator Kain, you will find that the world they inhabit is dark and desolate, but not without reason. As their destinies unravel, you soon realize that there is more at stake than just Raziel's personal vengeance.\n\nThe Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is heavy on storytelling and puzzle solving, but the combat isn't the best (in fact the combat is terrible). Many of the puzzles are far from obvious. Some are on such a large scale that you may have to visit several areas just to solve one and move on, but they are definitely rewarding as the further you go the more you learn of kain's actions, Raziel's resolve, and this dark, slowly dying world and how it came to be the way it is.\n\nI have tried this on several computers and can easily say it runs quite well on modern machines. It runs on essentially any resolution, although I'd recommend playing at 4:3 resolution as that is what this game was made for. Widescreen works, but the game stretches. If it doesn't run well on yours then there may be a complication or something affecting its performance.\n\nThere is a problem with the audio, however. Sometimes the audio suffers from problems and you may miss some dialogue and key ambiant effects without realizing it, but it's easy to figure out as you can identify it when the sound starts to get choppy or, say, when you jump and the grunting noises you normally hear are missing. It's an easy fix, simply quit and restart. Now I know some people might find this a daunting task, and all I can do is assure you that this game is well worth the time and patience.\n\nWhen I saw this game on steam, I was a little apprehensive to play it at first, as I was afraid my nostalgia would cloud the fact that this may be a terrible game after all. But once I ran it, I fell in love with it all over again. It can stand on it's own merits, and comes from a time where people were more worried about clever storytelling and breaking new ground than trying to introduce exclusive features and new DLC packs to increase product longevity. It's a masterpiece from another era, and shows that video games can be more than the generic "Action Adventure" label that is used to describe them.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game and any other in the Legacy of Kain series.","January 5, 2015","true","22.3"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

It has been a fundamental pillar in my gaming life, it was one of the first PC games I played and I love it. Just look at my avatar - it's Raziel. First time playing it was way back in 2002 but I have fond memories of how awesome this game was. Yes, I can see the flaws it has today, it did not age that well ... but please hear me out. Soul Reaver is a game that was revolutionary in it's time. It combines combat and puzzles in the big post-apocalyptic world of Nosgoth. Both are difficult so if you like more casual games I guess this one is not for you. The game does not take your hand, you have to try stuff out for yourself. And die a lot in the process. But not really die since this game created a great mechanic of shifting between physical and spectral realm. So if you die in the physical world you shift to the spectral one. If you die in the spectral world you reset at the Elder God. You can however shift when you want and this gives the game it's dynamic feeling. Boss fights feel very satisfying when you finish them. You also get a power from each boss you beat, adding extra layer of gameplay each time. All of this was fun, but, the story and narrative is why I love this game! The story telling is what this game nailed - from the writing to the voice acting. Plus it has a really cool soundtrack as well. Some downsides are here as well, the game is old so graphics and compatibility are not that great, though it runs fine on my Win7 laptop. The open ending can also be annoying for some people, although it is not that bad (and continues well in SR2). And I could write all day about this game but I will stop right here because you already know if you want it or not from what you have read. I will end this review and give one of the most true and heartfelt recommendations I ever gave on Steam.","October 30, 2014","true","0.1"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","26","33","0","1"

I was gifted the Legacy of Kain collection for my birthday last year and I'm thankful for that because I enjoy having digital copies of old beloved games.\n\nAs a warning, I find this difficult to play with just a keyboard and mouse, although it is possible. I’m currently looking for another way around this, as my controller does not hook up well either.  That is my only complaint. Keep in mind, as well, that this game was released almost 20 years ago so it has clunky graphics and textures but this makes me love the game even more. Nostalgia.\n\nEven with it’s old graphics, I find this game quite eerie and creepy, although it has no horror tag. The characters, the story, the vampires/creatures and the music, ambience has always given me chills.\n\nI think what makes me recommend this game is the plot.  It’s hard not to love a game with deep and captivating storyline.  Kain raised Raziel (the protagonist, whom you play) and his brothers from death, turning them into undead vampires. Kain saw an unfortunate fate in store for him in the future, and had plunged Raziel into the Abyss to save himself.  The vampires depicted in this game are supposed to evolve over time, becoming stronger, while gaining new abilities. Unfortunately many vampires were left weak, with few valuable skills after Kain took over Nosgoth. The “Elder God” brought Raziel back to life but not in his original form nor his vampire form. Many centuries had passed and the God deemed Raziel as his  ‘soul reaver’, to hunt down Kain and seek revenge, to save what was left of Nosgoth, which Kain had left in ruins.\n\nYou are given an option to switch between the living world and the spirit realm.  Raziel doesn’t necessarily have or need a weapon either. You can pick weapons up when you find them but you can also use your claws and tactics such as tossing your enemies in an open flame, sunlight spots or into water.  There’s also some strategy involved - mostly block puzzles - and you can collect glyphs to gain new abilities.\n\nTLDR; 7/10 overall... Rich storyline, confusing controls at first.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/recommended/224920/","dfactor","Dfactor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/","1000 products in account","Legacy of Kain is a well known franchise amongst many oldschool players. Some were introduced to the series with Blood Omen, others began with Soul Reaver. While the core gameplay was different both of them shared rich story and nice voice acting. Soul Reaver is the second game in the franchise and is a direct sequel of Blood Omen.\n\nThe gameplay consists of exploration, battles with vampires, boss battles, platforming and puzzle solving. While I do like the franchise I also do not have bias due to nostalgia and do not like to see the game through pink glasses. Exploration is fairly nice, game offers interesting locations and architecture and there's a lot of backtracking and hidden secrets. Battles (at least at first) are interesting, but quickly start to get redundant and boring. While the game introduces a couple of new enemies the core battle mechanics stay the same, as you advance more through the game you get more power and enemies aren't a real threat, just an annoyance to stall you a bit. Boss battles are good, but short. They're not the "win by brute force" type of battles as you need to find a weak point / solution to defeat the boss. Platforming is fairly frustrating as the camera and controls are far from perfect. Nothing is impossible and can be mastered after trial and error, but jumping onto series of tiny ledges can be painful, especially if you fall down and are forced to redo the entire segment. Puzzle solving is fairly Tomb Raiderish, but also gets too repetitive: "Block puzzle A is introduced, now do it a couple of more times. Block puzzle B is introduced, now do it a couple of more times again.". The best part of the game (aside from story and voice acting) is the soundtrack. It's great and memorable, a lot of people know Soul Reaver's "Ozar Midrashim".\n\nThe PC port has flaws. It runs on newer systems, it's possible to run at 1080p and 60fps. However, it suffers from audio issues. The music has crackling noises, dialogue skips. The only solution is to play it in software, texture unfiltered mode. Another flaw is that the hardware mode goes up to 1080p, while software mode goes up to 2160p. Makes sense, right? When compared to PS version the soundtrack is pre-recorded. It has less tracks and doesn't really change according to what's happening around you.\n\nShould you get this version of the game? That's up to you. If you can oversee no texture filtering then go for it. If you prefer better overall experience, but lower framerates then go for the PS version. Dreamcast is supposed to be the best version.","January 8, 2015","true","25.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","1"

Well now that that's out of the way I can move on to the game. Soul Reaver was my- well most peoples introduction to the Legacy Of Kain series and holy hellblazes did it leave an impression on me. The realm shifting gameplay was truly innovative at the time and the voice work, particularly the infallible Simon Templeman is incredible. That man has a voice crafted by the gods. On top of that the plot is astounding and a lot of it is all down to luck. If I recall correctly this game was heavily rushed by the publishers forcing the team (featuring video game goddess Amy Hennig) to cut out the original final portion, this led to them making a sequel. It could've ended here. Oh and the port is flawless so far, you might need a program to map an Xbox controller but my Nyko Airflo worked with it off the bat.\n\nThe music by Kurt Harland of Information Society in a time when video game scores by famous industrial musicians were increasingly popular creates the perfect soundscape and more significantly the song Ozar Midrashim that features prominently throughout the game adds a lot to what is possibly the single greatest opening FMV of all time. In fact I highly recommend you just go on YouTube and look it up, if that doesn't convince you I can pretty much bet that no words I could write here would.\n\nThis game, along with Metal Gear Solid are, for me, the absolute pinnacle of the PS1 era. I can't recommend this entire series enough.\n\nEdit: I last played this on Vista on my old PC so I don't know how it runs on Windows 10.","October 9, 2015","true","2.2"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","14","19","4","1"

It's certainly not laughable by any means.\n\nAs mentioned before, I certainly recommend the game, and the Legacy of Kain franchise as a whole, to anyone who doesn't mind playing old looking games, and likes a good gothic setting, with great character presentation.

I love that dark dirty atmosphere, the mythology and the design of characters (especially bosses). I love the puzzles. I love boss fights, where you can have time to think about their weak spots. Finally, I love the idea of two planes - if you're too weak, you move to the spectral realm and you can do other stuff before going back to material realm. Feels good, no immersion-breaking "you died, try again" scheme. However, the game is still far from perfect in my opinion.\n\nThe camera and controls are just messed up. Seriously, it feels like they weren't tested enough. For example, seeing Raziel's butt zoomed in when you need to judge distance is nothing but good gameplay design. The level design often doesn't conform the camera movement, which, combined with camera-dependent movement direction, makes it very easy to fall off narrower platforms.\n\nI understand that many of those issues were common in that gaming era, especially the camera work, which apparently was a plague of TPP games back then. On the other hand, it's weird that noone complained about that during testing stage. It just feels bad and makes the game unnecessarily repetitive and frustrating on some locations (especially Rahabim clan's).\n\nAnyway, if you're immune to frustration, you should play it just for the atmosphere. It's so dark I sometimes felt like I didn't want to go any further into that darkness. It's like you never know what you're gonna meet in the next chamber/corridor. The graphics is also good, just low-res. Good colors, good textures and good models. It's still immersing, even though it's so old. The music makes you sink ever deeper.\n\nThat ugly world, corrupted with pure evil, makes me want to drink fresh human blood.","November 7, 2014","true","18.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

He kills you and throws you into an abyss. After that your corpse is resurrected and you have to traverse a dead world you helped destroy inorder to kill your murderer.\n\nThe game is focused on puzzles moreso then combat, due to the fact you actually cannot die. The player instead shifts between the lightless and weightless dimension of the dead to the material realm. This is very important for specific puzzles and sidequests. The game takes place in a semi-open world with no loading screens.\n\nAnother big part of Soul Reaver is just how many sidequests there are. Just running through the game will land the character with no health upgrades and no special glyph powers. Should the player return to prior areas you can find new things that you didn't see previously.\n\nHowever there are some minor flaws.The game ends on a cliffhanger that leads directly into Soul Reaver 2. There is also an entire website devoted to all the content that was cut prior to release.\n\nThe other important aspect of this game is it's port. SR1's PC port is flawed in a few ways. Much of the soundtrack doesn't play at specific moments, and this reduces the quality of the game in a lot of unfortunate ways.

Please\n\nSeriously this game was apart of what probably is THE best series ever made in gaming. None have stood out and have been as enjoyable as The Legacy of Kain. Soul Reaver is probably my favorite. (although If I had the patience for a Dos emulater I'd play the first Blood Omen as well and be just as happy) The game has an equal amount of combat and puzzle solving and the puzzles for the most part are straight forward, but some what confusing... until you remember the spirit realm will alter the room your standing in and hopefully help you reach that ledge that's to high or make a hole in a room you didn't think would have one and lead to a boss (hint hint sarafan hint hint) Also there are plenty of secrets you can find that can be possibly holding a power as a reward when you have found it.\n\nNot to mention the Lore in this game is fantastic and the amount of history that exists in the world that is sometimes only lightly touched upon but does exist in the gothic dying world known as Nosgoth is just as abundant as the lore that thrown at your face. The game's Narrative I think is what really makes it a legendary game. The morals discussed between Raziel and Kain. The concepts are enthralling and the roles each character plays no matter how small it seems still has a major impact on the world.\n\nThis game turned it up to an 11 out of a possible 5. Thank you Crystal Dynamics for such an amazing Game.","December 17, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not a deal breaker at all, but could be frustrating to a younger gamer that is used to a game holding your hand.\n\nNow a lot of people have been complaining about the controls and lack of 360 controller support. You need to remember, this game came out way before Xinput controllers. Simply put, go buy a cheap direct input. Also pc games hadnt really seen a standardized control scheme for keyboards either.

It is hideously broken and riddled with issues. The controller support is an absolute joke and it lacks mouse support entirely, relegating you to either playing it all with the keyboard or to acquire Xpadder or a similar program. The game also inexplicably corrupted itself and I lost all my progress. Aside from that the graphics and game play have not aged well and I made it to the third boss before quitting because the platforming frustrated me to the point of almost snapping my controller in half, made worse by the flimsy and roundabout way in which I had to use my controller. Raziel apparently has the need to hurl himself forward after landing on platforms so half the time I would fall off and have to start the section again. The only upside is that the story and dialog are still rock solid but if that's all you want you'd be better off watching all the cut scenes on YouTube.

Soul Reaver is an action/adventure/puzzle solving game in where you (Raziel), are harnessing a deep hatred for your former leader and pseudo-father figure, Kain, that runs so deep that an elder god decides to  utilize you as his weapon of destruction against Kain and his forces, as they have left the entire world in shambles from centuries of war and butchery.  So let's get down to it!\n\nGameplay:  Definitely one of the high points of this game (and there are many) is just the overall gameplay.  The controls might be a little loose, but the targeting and the executions are spot on.  And fun.  Like, suprisingly fun.  Nothing quite like taking a spear from a wall and impaling a demon/vampire creature straight through the abdomen, while absorbing it's soul afterwards for sustenance.  If this sounds like fun, definitely get this game because you will be doing this a lot.  Don't misunderstand though.  Incredibly, this game actually focuses more on puzzles rather than direct action.  Even boss fights are generally a small puzzle that needs to be solved, rather than directly assaulting the giant, horrific monstrosities (because let's face it, that immediately doesn't sound like a good idea as soon as you see any of the bosses).\n\nOh, and this game is not exactly easy.  Some of the platforming can be very difficult due to the loose controls, and the world does not exactly hold your hand.  It is very open-ended.  Very few hints are littered throughout the world to guide you on your way, but just enough is given to you if you really pay attention to what is being said.  In an age of games that practically play themselves, this particular type of difficulty in a game is a very welcome feeling.\n\nThe only slightly negative part of this game are the overwhelming amount of block puzzles.  Block puzzles.  Block puzzles.  BLOCK PUZZLES.  At any point in time through the game, it's a good bet that a block puzzle is within at least two rooms of where you are currently located.  They are interesting, but the developers really went all out with these puzzles.  None of them are too overwhelmingly difficult, but when they're in every room, it becomes mundane and repetitive.\n\nGraphics:  Fantastic graphics for it's time.  Remember that this game did come out in 1999.  A mere three years after Super Mario 64.  There are a lot of clipping issues obviously for this particular period in time when this game was developed, but overall the game is pretty gorgeous.  Animations are very smooth, enemies are interesting, environments are gloomy and downright spooky, and bosses are horrendously disgusting looking.  Even for today's games, those bosses are the things of nightmares.\n\nSound:  So the sound in this game is phenomenal, and probably the highlight of the entire game (at least it was for me).  Every movement makes a sound that is very adequate for what it is representing, but the sountrack that kicks in every once and a while is perfect for the theme of the game.  Dark, gothic, and eerie.  Partners perfect with what is happening on the screen at all times.  Especially the opening cutscene music, that also just happens to play near the end during a particularly important part of the game.  Oh, and the voice acting talent is, for lack of a better word, incredible.  Tony Jay is still severely missed.  The script is so well written that several games that are released these days, could learn a lot from sitting down and playing this game.\n\nLasting Appeal:  So the total game took me about 12 hours to beat, and that's exploring a good amount of the world.  Didn't go for 100%, but pretty close.  Beyond reliving the adventure again, there is not too much reason to revisit this game after beating it.\n\n\nTL;DR - Great gameplay with a few flaws + decent graphics + fantastic audio + incredible story = 8/10\n\nPC PROBLEMS:  I would strongly recommend against using they keyboard and mouse controls (even though it is possible to just use them), and follow the community guide in the hub that points you to XPadder so that controller use can become enabled.  It is a very short and easy to follow guide that will have you using a controller flawlessly within ten minutes.\n\nAlso, I know other Steam users are claiming that the game would crash on them constantly, but I personally never had this problem.  I only ran into a few glitches in which I decided to restart because the audio would fall behind drastically, but if anything that was just an annoyance and I wasn't forced to restart if I didn't choose to.","October 4, 2015","true","11.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

So for all I care it could be the best game in all of existence but if I can't actually play it then there is a problem, even if you can run it please note that there are some issues like the keyboard controls which are very unintuitive. In addition there is no way to control the camera at least not with the mouse, you have to press ctrl and 0 to move the camera left or right. Although you can use xpadder to adjust the control layout, but if you don't want to download it for whatever reason, then you better get used to the archaic controls. So as much as I have been enjoying this game, I can't recommend it because it simply isn't up to the level of quality that it should be.

Steam really needs to test run this stuff before putting it on the market.  I had to delete one of the files to make it work in the first place and it won't respond when I start it up half the time, forcing me to reboot my computer every time I want to play it.

At one point, there was a rushing water sound effect that got stuck and was loud that I couldn't hear any of the dialogue.\n\nTo be fair, there are some good aspects.  It looks great and I think the controls are a smooth adaptation.  Their responsive and work well at least.  But they really need to work the bugs out.\n\nI realize that this isn't exactly high priority for Steam, but if we're going to pay for something, we expect it to work.  So, I would hold off for a while or just find it used.  A PSX and a copy of Soul Reaver will run you about 25 bucks total depending on where you get it.

Though not on PC. Running on Windows 8 with a mediocre laptop, I could get the game to run with no audio problems or graphical issues, but as anyone who's played on PC for more than az week knows: you need a controller for these kinds of games. Simple enough. The game has controller support and it's plug and play. And there's the problem. It's controller support is total ♥♥♥.\n\nThe in-game character likes to run up to the right when you idle, and he never runs straight. You can't just use the d-pad like the original game either. The only way to make it work is to download multiple control mapping programs. Sure, there are keyboard controls, but there is sincerely no viable way to play like that. You can't map the mouse whatsoever, so good luck scrunching in on your keyboard trying to make an accurate jump. I'm really depressed with how this port acts and I'd like to save anyone who was wither a fan like me, or new to the game from that feel.","June 22, 2014","false","0.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

So, when I found the collection was available on PC for $5, I quickly scooped it up because Gaben.\n\nTLDR: Moar Puzzle, Less Fight. Like? Buy. Not like? PASS\n\nOverview: This game takes place in a land called Nosgoth. You play a death angel who turns into a zombie-vampire hybrid who can't die now. Your job is to get revenge on Kain, for leaving you in this ghoulish state, and then ruining Nosgoth while you were in the underworld. The game truly is an Eidos title in more ways than one.\n\nPacing:\n\nThe game's pacing is nonexistant. It managed to feel the same during all 10 hours I played. Maybe it picks up later on, I don't know tbph. Once could call it postapocalyptic.\n\nGameplay-Combat:\n\nThe combat just seems to lack flow. Many many areas are full of enemies that respawn so constantly that it's almost not worth it to fight them every time, and just run+jump past them. Or use Spirit Realm if you can get away with it. The first boss of the game is a puzzle boss. Bleh. Without spoiling anything, I had to use a walkthrough in the same manner I used a walkthrough with HeXeN.\n\nGameplay-Puzzles: BLOCK PUZZLES, SON. Also, stuff that isn't obvious. Painful and requires a walkthrough beyond the first twenty minutes or so.\n\nStory: The story is an odd thing, one that doesn't irk me or compel me. Perhaps it's because the first game in the series isn't available for PCs. The game manages to advance the story without drowning you in exposition too much, although there are a few too many cutscenes for my liking.\n\nControls: Standard clunky PS1-ported-to-PC controls. Can't even use a mouse. A shame, because i'd love to LOOK UP.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I can't wholeheartedly reccommend or deny LoK:Soul Reaver, in spite of me being forced to put a NO. It depends. Do you like Tomb Raider and other similar games? Liked HeXeN? Dive right into this gem. Want a more actiony thing to play? AVOID. The puzzles get to the point of feeling forced, imo.","December 3, 2014","false","10.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I recommend finding a PS2 emulator, because this one will just reaffirm your belief that Steam and game developers hate players.","August 15, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HowardHeyman/recommended/224920/","HowardHeyman","HowardHeyman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HowardHeyman/","56 products in account","Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver is a forgotten gem that spawned one of the best written and best voice acted franchises I've ever seen. Sadly, the industry is at a constant change and this game couldn't just keep up with it's speed.\nLet's start with the good elements, the story.\nSoul Reaver tells the tale of Raziel, a vampire damned to an eternity of agony by his creator Kain. Who somehow survived his descent into the lake of the Dead and is now transformed into a ghoul, a shell of his former self. Raziel then swears to get his revenge against the man who once betrayed him and who has now led his land to ruin.\n\nFirst things first, the writing is just amazing. From the brooding, gothic narrations of our character Raziel, to the shakespearean speeches of our antagonist Kain. Amy Hennig surely did a great job of defining who these characters were and a way to identify this game among the ocean of poorly written cash grabs that plagued the industry at it's time. World building is in every corner of this game, from little tidbits about the lore to just small visual details of the dark and Gothic steampunk fantasy setting of Nosgoth. Which was something you didn't really see that much in 1999.\nThe voice acting is amazing and it still holds up to this day, from Michael Bell's gothic narrations of Raziel, to Simon Templeman's defiant and perfect representation of the amazing villain that is Kain.\nIn fact, this game's opening sequence has to be the best opening sequence I have ever seen in a game, it's visuals look great (even today kinda), the voice acting and narration not only manages to set the character motivations and general setting, but it also manages to be great at it.\nThe problem with the story though, is the ending. Without spoiling that much all I can tell you is that the game ends in your average "To be Continued..." cliffhanger, which is not satisfying at all.\n\nOn the other hand, the thing that draws this game back is the gameplay. Not that it's bad, but it's horrifically dated. Soul Reaver is a Zelda-esque game that features a fully 3D open world with explorable dungeons and collectibles, but the catch is that in the game you are allowed to visit another realm of this world, The "Spirit Realm" let's you see things that are not normally present in the physical realm and it also acts as a warp place whenever you lose all of your health. Now, the main draw in all of this is that the Spirit Realm kinda makes the game a little too easy, because there is no real consequence to dying, it really just makes most of the tension go away from combat, which also get a little too repetitive sometimes. But of course, the main draw here are the puzzles. Now, do you expect to see puzzles that creatively use the realm switching mechanic? Well, Yes and no. Because for the most part you are treated to just block jigsaw puzzles (A little too much like in Zelda), these get VERY repetitive, VERY quickly and as I said really don't do more than just make the experience less enjoyable. Now, but when you're treated to realm switching puzzles it always just comes down to plaforming while switching back and forth between realms. Now, this could be enjoyable if only the controls weren't so dated. The camera is the biggest offeder here, because the game constantly requieres you to look up, but the camera can only rotate left and right. Another problem with the open world is that most of the collectibles featured in this game are completely useless, because the game is far too forgiving. I often found no difference between having a long health bar and a bunch of OP power-ups or not having them at all. Another problem with exploration is that the game gives you no sense of direction in any way, and there are no unique or indistinguishable areas in all of Nosgoth that help it either due this game's graphical limitations.\n\nAnother thing that hasn't aged well about this game either, are it's graphics.\nMost of the areas just look very same-ish or would look good back in 1999. Another issue I take with the graphics is that many cutscenes are poorly rescaled more often than not leading to some mess of blurry pictures that are supposed to be FMV's.\n\nThe soundtrack is also good, but not something amazing. What's really good about it is how it dynamically changes depending on the environment you're on.\n\nOverall, the only way I can reccomend Soul Reaver is if you buy it in the Legacy of Kain Collection bundle, when it's on sale at that. It's a good game, one I will certainly remember in the years to come. But it's just such a chore to drag through this game's flawed and clunky gameplay just to get to an unsatisfying ending. Because in the end, most of the good elements this game once had are now gone. Why? Because this is no longer 1999. Most of the things this game does (Lack of loading screens, amazing voice acting, great writing, open world, etc...) are now standards to the game industry and they are just no longer impressive when you play it nowadays. If this was 1999 I would've given this game a must buy, but sadly in the year 2015 this game cannot find a proper place to fit in.\n\nMaybe you'll like it, but for your own sake try to not to buy this game individually.\n\nPC PORT REPORT:\nNow, the main reason you shouldn't buy this game is because of the god forsaken PC port. This game was clearly intended to be played on a Playstation 1, and it shows in this port. Because the controls are ♥♥♥♥, with weird camera controls (LCTRL and RCTRL?) that while they can be rebinded, never offer an experience as gratifying as playing with a mouse. Plus, this game restricts controller support, only offering support for now dead gamepads (I tried with my DirectInput controller and my XInput controller and niether of them worked). The menu's are poorly rescaled and as I mentioned so are the cutscenes. And of course, the crashes. I didn't get as many crashes in my playthrough of the game, but they are here.\n\nThis is just a lazy straight-up port of the PS1 version of the game. If you ever plan to play this game, just get it for the Dreamcast or the PS1, and if you don't have either of those consoles, just emulate it.\nIf you don't want to emulate it either, do not buy it standalone. Buy it in the Legacy of Kain collection bundle when it's on sale. I got it for 5$ with the rest of the series and so should you.","March 27, 2015","false","25.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

However, equally noticeable are the inadequacies of the game engine in realizing the ambition the devs had regarding "the bits in between cutscenes", or "gameplay" as it is otherwise described.\n\nThe first, and perhaps most irritating problem is that this is at heart a console game, and the port is BAD. The controls are, by default, WASD for movement and the arrow keys for actions. That's right - NO MOUSE. I know this is an old game, but it's a real shame that including support for one of the most basic faculties of a PC wasn't considered a priority, it couldn't have been too difficult to implement considering how much better the game would be for intuitive camera controls.  Without them establishing even a basic awareness of your surroundings can take around half a minute of slowly shuffling around and resetting the camera, which makes even simple tasks extremely fiddly and only accentuates further problems.\n\nSecondly, the combat. I can see what the devs were trying to do but it comes out too clunky and situationally a nightmare in the hands of some poorly designed environments. The combat is based off some novel principles - most of the games enemies are undead, and as such require more killing than usual, most encounters will involve incapacitating enemies before destroying their body, with the use of fire, water, sunlight or simply impaling them. This is an interesting mechanic but quickly becomes at best a chore and at worst extremely frustrating.\nThe worst example I can provide is when the player is required to enter a room which contains 3 aggressive enemies but no environmental means of finishing them off, by this time the player has access to a weapon which can incapacitate and finish enemies, while remaining available at all times - but only when the player has full health, as a result, taking even a single hit will remove the player's only means of winning the fight and will require the player to retreat to heal before trying again, this would perhaps be a "fun challenge" if the combat possessed any depth, but the lack of any means of blocking or countering enemy attacks makes this an almost impossible task, requiring either luck or to get enemies stuck in the terrain - there is only one attack type (which I might add, is assigned to the same key as USE, have fun bashing doors), this gives the player basically no options regarding combat and allows no means of skill to assist in most encounters. (BTW the example takes place in a room with a multi-level block puzzle. Also the enemies respawn occasionally. FunFunFun.)\n\nLike I said, the story is excellent, but if that's all you're there for then you might as well just watch a silent playthrough on youtube, which I actually do recommend.\nBut as far as playing the game yourself is an option, I'd say don't bother.\n\nTL;DR -- Gameplay sux, v. dated, bad port but great story, voice acting & visual design.","December 5, 2013","false","4.7"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

There is no mouse-support whatsoever and even if you play with a gamepad, you can still only go strict left, strict right, strict forward or strict back... No diagonal movements allowed. I also experience a bug where my character just continues to run in the direction it was last going (even though I'm not touching my gamepad at all). I've tested my gamepad and it's not broken. It is in fact the only game where this happens.\nThe bad commands make even the easiest tasks incredibly hard sometimes.\nScore: 3/10\n\nScenario: The story is just superb and well thought. You really get sucked into this universe from the first few minutes you start playing this game. It is as complex as it is entertaining. You'll have some pleasant surprises along your road, and some less pleasant surprises but I won't spoil ANYTHING! :)\nScore: 9/10\n\nVideo/Audio: Soul Reaver is such an old game that it becomes hard to judge such things. Some textures have been polished, which is nice, but on the other hand, the sound seems worse than in 1999 on the PSX version of the game.\nScore: 6.5/10\n\nOverall: The game itself is really great and fun to play. You'll have about 10-20hrs of pure pleasure (depending on how good a gamer you are). I would certainly recommend this game if you don't mind playing with both hands on the keyboard all the time since there is no mouse support and game controller support is really bad.\nScore: 6/10 I would give the PSX version a 9/10, the points lost are due to the controls and the bad audio.","March 29, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It combines puzzles with a pretty nice fighting system and one hell of a cool story to top it all off. If any of you have played the original release on PS1 you already know this game hasn't been named one of the best games on PS1 without a reason.\n\nHowever this port is quite unsatisfactionary to say the least. It plays just like on PS1, it looks good and I had no problem with setting up my controler to work with it (be sure to not only change the configuration of the controler in game but also to select it to be the prefered method of playing from the pause menu in order to make it work) but there is one huge problem. It crashes randomly. I have tried multiple different resolution settings but either way it crashes every now and then.\n\nI have managed to get only about 4 crashes throughout the whole game but at the very end of the game, there are a lot of cutscenes and I had to replay all of them at least 5 times to get past them. It would always crash. Finally, I decided to check for integrity of the game cache (which is an option that can be found when you right click the game in your library and then go to properities) and it found 2 corrupted files. Guees what? One of them was my save file and it got deleted. Right before the last boss fight. All in all, I have managed to find a save file at this exact point on the internet and I have finished the game but I am still quite dissapointed that Crystal Dynamics have done nothing about this problem.\n\nTo sum it all up - If you like adventure games with good combat system, original story, puzzles and a big world to explore (with a lot of secrets to find, optionally) then this game is definitely for you. Even after over a decade this game still feels right and puts a lot of newer titles to shame. If you don't want to deal with multiple crashes though, you're probably better off buying the original PS1 version and playing it on some sort of emulator.\n\nOh and if you're wondering about gameplay time, it takes about 16-17 hours to complete if you decide to find most of the glyphs and some of the health upgrades but it should take even up to 30 hours (or more?) if you decide to find every upgrade and all of the glyphs. It might also vary a lot depending on how well you solve puzzles. It sometimes takes long time to figure out what to do. I used a guide only twice but I suppose it was much more rewarding to not use it more.","June 15, 2014","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's nothing quite so fun as clawing a vampire into submission, picking him up, and tossing him into a bonfire. The puzzles are a nice touch as well, although they tend to rely very heavily on the "move a block strategically" idea.

The characters in this game are pretty likable in telling the story of the game, the character you play, Raziel, often tells you, time to time, his views of the current world he is in, in a pretty elaborate and amusing way during his journey. I have to say the character development regarding him is well done once you are done with the game. This game's story takes you far into the future, centuries after Blood Omen. There are few references from Blood Omen that are mentioned in the game, I'd say it's not that important to play Blood Omen, but it's clearly recommended for future references in the other games.\n\nThe gameplay seems fresh for a PSOne/PC(1999) title, 3D Platforming is a notable element of the game, jumping around the place feels very organic in a way that it paved way for future 3D action/adventure to takes notes on basic things such as climbing using the ledge to reach another platform. Gliding feels pretty organic too because of the big and high places you will venture to, it proved useful in Raziel's journey.\n\nThis game also has puzzles for you to uncover while most of them are cube puzzle where you have position the cube like objects to its correct positions, although it feels pretty ridiculous as God of War's Kratos doing the same thing(and Thank golly, it was this game that started this element of gameplay), it felt pretty fun and I had the feeling I have to finish it right away, but I can't help that I'm thinking that Raziel would be better off as a "Plumber" of sorts, he certainly has a great talent for it, *snicker*.\n\nThe fighting system feels that it contributed a lot to upcoming games such as Devil May Cry, Dark Souls and other action/adventure games that have a feature for you to lock on the enemy in close combat while holding a button. While holding the "autoface" button, you automatically focus on your current adversary and anticipate his move. While in this state you anticipate his upcoming attack and dodge with the proper directional button and the jump button. This would lead the enemy to be in the open, off-guarded. It's a simple mechanic that does its job well in the starting stages but as you progress, you uncover more skills you can abuse to your enemies such as things from side quests.\n\nSide Quests in the game does make the game a little easier but it is no easy task to uncover them blindly though. The side quests contain powerups that would increase your health, your magic and your arsenal such as glyph spells. The game would be little more of a challenge if you play without the powerups, but just a little because of one little thing.\n\nThis game setting has you going into different realms time to time in real time. I'd say it's an impressive feature back in the day, because the 3d setting changes/transforms IN REAL TIME as you change from one realm to another and it is needed for you to do in order to progress more into the story.\n\nThe enemy designs are pretty grotesque and scary, it is what repelled me from playing it as a kid. I think third boss and its minions takes the cake that will keep preventing me from getting a sleep for a day, two or three if I was dealing with this game back then. Dealing with the bosses require you to analyze the environment and take it as an advantage to defeat you adversary, it will take time figuring it out but you will accomplish it nonetheless.\n\nThe sounds are fit the setting but the ambience of the setting puts me on edge especially when the game decide to bugs regarding the sound such as sound loops and what not, you know I just have to reset and load the game from where I was. Voice acting is top notch, it is dramatic but it does its job pretty well for a video game of its age.\n\nThis game has certain bugs/glitches such as game crashing suddenly during lengthy play times in a sitting, enemies going T-Stance on you all of the sudden, sound loops that are pretty scary and nerve wrecking. They are pretty minor and not necessarily would break the game render unplayable.  Just save consistently, you can save anywhere. I MEAN IT.\n\nI played this game using a twin PSone/PS2 controlller usb converter and the game responds well to my controller. I don't know about 360 wired controllers though.\n\nPlaying this game in this day and age is pretty refreshing from the modern games we have now and I have to say this game did age well in its own. I would rate the game 9/10 if not 10/10. A truly underappreciated game.","December 10, 2014","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NordinTheLich/recommended/224920/","NordinTheLich","Nordin The Lich","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NordinTheLich/","222 products in account","Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is one of those games you truly have to play for yourself to appreciate. This game is quite dated, having originally been released in 1999. Despite its age, and the poor graphics by today's standards that comes with such age, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, and truly the entire Legacy of Kain series in general, still remains my very favorite video game of all time. The game's story is marvelously  well written, leaving you wanting to know at all times what happens next, what's around that corner, and what kind of environments you will discover. This game hits it out of the park with not only its well-written story, but its phenomenal audio work too. The soundtrack is absolutely superb, and one of the best video game soundtracks out there. The voice acting is amazing, featuring some big name voice actors, including Tony Jay - famous for Judge Claude Frollo in Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame - Simon Templeman, my personal favorite voice actor - famous for many roles, including Gabriel Roman in the Uncharted Series - and many more. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver was developed by Crystal Dynamics (famous for the Gex series and Tomb Raider series) and published by Eidos Interactive. The lead director for the game was Amy Hennig, who later went on to co-direct the Uncharted Series. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is filled to the absolute brim with secrets and hidden rewards, and I highly encourage those of you who purchase this masterpiece of a game to explore them all.\n\nLegacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, and the entire series in general, is a true masterpiece of gaming. Its graphics may be rather dated by today's standards, but they're rather good for the standards of when it was released in 1999. The true art of this game is not in the graphics, but rather the storyline itself as you follow the fallen Vampire lieutenant Raziel avenge himself and uncover the dark truths of the hypocracy he sought to destroy. With twists and turns around nearly every corner of this exquisite work, you will be highly entertained and likely will want the other games to complete the story. I do warn you however that the storyline can get very complex, but I feel as if that merely adds to some of its charm and beauty.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I cannot recommend this game enough. I grew up with this game as a kid with the original PSOne version. I now own the PSOne disc for this game, the PS3 download of the PSOne classic from the PlayStation Store, and the PC version from Steam. Even as I own three copies of the game, I cannot help but feel as if the game deserves to cost more. At a marvelous price for the quality you get, this game and its entire series are both a must-buy and must-play, and Legacy of Kain remains to this day a true example of what video games should be: An interactive story, and an art form, not just a mindless shoot-em-up. If you've still read to this far in my review, please, do yourself a favor and get this game. If you are not pleased, I will be extremely surprised.","February 18, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkeco1/recommended/224920/","darkeco1","~DarkEco~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkeco1/","221 products in account","I first played this game about 2 years ago and despite its age i thought it was brilliant. I haven't played Blood Omen, and you don't need to in order to enjoy this game. It's a good idea to read up on a bit of the backstory as it will help you understand things to do with the world and the main antagonist, Kain. You play as Raziel, Kains lieutenant, who was sentenced to death by Kain. Thrown into an burning hot abyss Raziel is killed but is brought back in a more demonic form by the Elder God. In return for this 'gift', Raziel must become the Elder Gods 'Soul Reaver', and feed the Elder God by absorbing the souls of his vampire bretherin during his vengeful hunt for Kain.\nThe game is an action adventure puzzle solver, very much in the same field as Tomb Raider, but more demonic (obviously). Of the 3 Soul Reaver games (that's including Defiance) this is definitely the most dark and chilling. There isn't as much story in this one as there is in the other 2 games and the story progression is pretty straight forward. You must find your vampire bretherin to help lead you to Kain in order to get your revenge. Along the way there are a few plot twists that make you think there's more to the current events than meets the eye, and the ending proves this even more so.\nThe gameplay itself doesn't drive the game nearly as much as the story, and you'll probably find that with all the games. Combat is pretty basic, and the majority of the puzzles involve pushing blocks around. Some may find the game becomes stale, but it really all depends how attached you become to Raziels cause. As the story progresses and secrets unfold you'll find yourself driven purely by the need to know what it all means.\nThe voice acting in this game is fantastic, the characters are fantastic, the environments are fantastic and the soundtrack is phenominal.

The premise itself is intriguing and great. Many might knock this because of the graphics, however this is just a port from a ps1 game. The entire franchise has an amazing storyline to tell too. There is lots to do and for some it can take time to get into the story and play enjoyably, it is rather good. The puzzles that are dotted around the game isn't seem much anymore, at least not in the games I've played, and although an old game these puzzles do in fact provide a rather stiff challenge in some areas, even needing the assistance of guides.\n\nThis game, or at least, this version of it, although good for its story and such, the port is rather bad. I say you should get an original copy on the ps1 and play that or find some alternate way... Emulators are able to play games as though they were on there original consoles and as such can provide controller capabilities, which, sadly this version lacks.\n\nThere are also constant texture glitching, now this simply could be my system at fault, however it appears as though it's an actual fault with the port.\n\nGet this game if you don't own it another way, or at least have a good long playthrough.","February 15, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is a great game. The agency, while it takes some time to become competent with due to poor but doable controls, feels really good. As you play you become better at playing, almost as if mirroring Razael's revival and strengthening. The game has a steady drip of interesting lore and a plot that leaves you wondering what the next part is. The puzzles often have you stumped until you remember that you can change the world by changing planes, which adds a layer of depth to them. The combat feels pretty decent but simple and can take a bit to become good as different enemies actually have slightly different approaches. The boss fights though are almost all amazing in that they are not blunt fighting but more puzzles. When you die you simply shift to the spectral plane, giving you a chance to come up with a new plan. The platforming, much like the typical combat, is simple. Unlike the combat though, gets more depth as you unlock more abilities.\n\nObviously the game has its flaws: dated graphics, occasional crashes with no catalyst, poor controls, and the such. But those really do come with older games and are outweighed by the better aspects of this game. This game isn't long, but it certainly isn't short. If this game has caught your eye at all, I'd definitely recommend it.","February 22, 2015","true","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stepping aside from its vampiric roots, Soul Reaver ventures into a demonic area, telling the story of Raziel, one of Kain's "first-born" vampire leutenants who was thrown into the Abyss for daring to evolve prior to his own master, only to be awaken centuries later by The Elder God in a spectral realm.\nOn his quest to avenge his death Raziel must solve a lot of environmental puzzles that involve switching between material and spectral realms in real time. Enemy encounters are quite rare, but the fights look stylish thanks to many various ways you can finish your opponents using either weapons or the environment.\nControls are somewhat awkward and require some time to get used to. Being released in 1999, the game looks amazing even today. The world of Nosgoth is huge and seamless, you will never see a single loading screen here. Voice actors do an impressive job reading through beautifully written dialogues, which makes the complete lack of subtitles even more disappointing.\nSoul Reaver is simply one of the best action-adventure games of its time. If you missed it during the PSOne era now is a good chance to join Raziel in his atmospheric journey through life and death.","March 21, 2013","true","36.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is quite dated, having originally been released in 1999. Despite its age, and the poor graphics by today's standards that comes with such age, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, and truly the entire Legacy of Kain series in general, still remains my very favorite video game of all time. The game's story is marvelously  well written, leaving you wanting to know at all times what happens next, what's around that corner, and what kind of environments you will discover. This game hits it out of the park with not only its well-written story, but its phenomenal audio work too. The soundtrack is absolutely superb, and one of the best video game soundtracks out there. The voice acting is amazing, featuring some big name voice actors, including Tony Jay - famous for Judge Claude Frollo in Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame - Simon Templeman, my personal favorite voice actor - famous for many roles, including Gabriel Roman in the Uncharted Series - and many more. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver was developed by Crystal Dynamics (famous for the Gex series and Tomb Raider series) and published by Eidos Interactive. The lead director for the game was Amy Hennig, who later went on to co-direct the Uncharted Series. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is filled to the absolute brim with secrets and hidden rewards, and I highly encourage those of you who purchase this masterpiece of a game to explore them all.\n\nLegacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, and the entire series in general, is a true masterpiece of gaming. Its graphics may be rather dated by today's standards, but they're rather good for the standards of when it was released in 1999. The true art of this game is not in the graphics, but rather the storyline itself as you follow the fallen Vampire lieutenant Raziel avenge himself and uncover the dark truths of the hypocracy he sought to destroy. With twists and turns around nearly every corner of this exquisite work, you will be highly entertained and likely will want the other games to complete the story. I do warn you however that the storyline can get very complex, but I feel as if that merely adds to some of its charm and beauty.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I cannot recommend this game enough. I grew up with this game as a kid with the original PSOne version. I now own the PSOne disc for this game, the PS3 download of the PSOne classic from the PlayStation Store, and the PC version from Steam. Even as I own three copies of the game, I cannot help but feel as if the game deserves to cost more. At a marvelous price for the quality you get, this game and its entire series are both a must-buy and must-play, and Legacy of Kain remains to this day a true example of what video games should be: An interactive story, and an art form, not just a mindless shoot-em-up. If you've still read to this far in my review, please, do yourself a favor and get this game. If you are not pleased, I will be extremely surprised.","February 18, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is so much lore and history to discover in these games. SoulReaver is technically the second game if you put the games in release order with BloodOmen being the first, but it's set far in the future of all the other games. This may be a little confusing with some of the characters dialogs because they often refer to events which the player would not have witnessed (yet). This for me is what has kept me curious of the whole history of Nosgoth and wanting to play more.\n\nIn this game you'll experience a unique concept, puzzles and gameplay. Exploration is rewarding and the story will make you want to uncover the truth behind Kains evenful actions. If you love vampires, a dark gothic atmoshpere and a gripping plot you'll love these games!!!!","December 5, 2013","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't played Blood Omen, and you don't need to in order to enjoy this game. It's a good idea to read up on a bit of the backstory as it will help you understand things to do with the world and the main antagonist, Kain. You play as Raziel, Kains lieutenant, who was sentenced to death by Kain. Thrown into an burning hot abyss Raziel is killed but is brought back in a more demonic form by the Elder God. In return for this 'gift', Raziel must become the Elder Gods 'Soul Reaver', and feed the Elder God by absorbing the souls of his vampire bretherin during his vengeful hunt for Kain.\nThe game is an action adventure puzzle solver, very much in the same field as Tomb Raider, but more demonic (obviously). Of the 3 Soul Reaver games (that's including Defiance) this is definitely the most dark and chilling. There isn't as much story in this one as there is in the other 2 games and the story progression is pretty straight forward. You must find your vampire bretherin to help lead you to Kain in order to get your revenge. Along the way there are a few plot twists that make you think there's more to the current events than meets the eye, and the ending proves this even more so.\nThe gameplay itself doesn't drive the game nearly as much as the story, and you'll probably find that with all the games. Combat is pretty basic, and the majority of the puzzles involve pushing blocks around. Some may find the game becomes stale, but it really all depends how attached you become to Raziels cause. As the story progresses and secrets unfold you'll find yourself driven purely by the need to know what it all means.\nThe voice acting in this game is fantastic, the characters are fantastic, the environments are fantastic and the soundtrack is phenominal. Everything in the game pulls you in and makes you really care about what has happened to the world, and makes you want to know why (i won't go deeper as i don't want to spoil anything). This is easily my favourite game in the series and i highly recommened anyone to give it a try.","August 23, 2013","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was hands down one of my favorites the storyline is like a good book or movie, that being said I am totally not loving the control interface and the movement is extremely clunky with a keyboard.  this game was made for a gamepad.  The camera is manual aim and you have to constantly move it so it is looking in the right direction and the controls you press will change direction as the camera moves (extremely frustrating) there is no strafing movement either.  i remember this being alot more fluid.  Story is still the same so it is entertaining but i think that some time could have been spent updating the graphics and motion issues plus there should be a controllable zoom for 3rd person view it is a little close to raziel and this only compounds the camera issues.

I could say that isn't really the case. A lot of that time was spent trying to get it to work. The game would work perfectly one day, then would just stop working on another. There are even times where it crashes taking a few steps after the game lets you play. Not to mention the amount of times I had to reinstall this game.\n\nAlthough I'm totally fine with the game only being 30FPS, I tried SRHook to play it at 60. Doing so will make the game skip all the cinematics. I asked on the Game's Discussion page if there was a way to still get the cinematics to play while using SRhook, and was told that there isn't anything that can be done. So, I just decided to remove SRHook when I got to parts that had cinematic cutscenes.\n\nI used a Dualshock 4 and Inputmapper to map the controller buttons to be keyboard inputs since just using an xinput controller won't make it work properly.\n\nIt's really a shame that this game suffers from these problems as it's still pretty solid during the times when it actually worked. It felt like it did when I first played it on the Playstation, I never finished it then, which is why I got it here on Steam. Besides the problems stated above, I didn't encounter any game breaking bugs or glitches. Just make sure that when using SRHook, cap the framerate at 60 as it'll mess the game up a bit when played higher than that, specifically with some puzzles that need the constrict ability. But that's not the game's fault. The gameplay still holds up, each boss isn't just a straight up fight, and are themselves puzzles (except for two). The story is a big part of the whole Legacy of Kain saga, and is still in my opinion one of the best in gaming to this day.\n\nIf you can put up with the crashing, and are lucky enough to not have the game stop working at all, it'll be a good experience. If you have very little patience with these things, you may want to pass on this version and play it on the PS3 or if you still have your PS1.","August 8, 2015","false","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Always loved this game, so I'm a bit biased. Take it from me, this series has one of the best stories in gaming period. Try it out if you like it I defy you not to play all of the others just to unravel the tale. Destiny, time travel, interdimensional conspiracies, vampires, and false gods this game is the best place to enter into the series. Between the voice acting and the writing this game is good enough, but Soul Reaver boasts the most enjoyable gameplay in the whole series.\n\nThe enemies and the environments work togather to create an interative playground for you to test out different and creative ways to clear out rooms. There are several ways to stun enemies from beating the hell out of them, to psychokenetic force balls to throwing rando crap at their faces. And once you've gotten them stunned they're your toys. You can grab them and throw them at hazars like spikes or flames, off cliffs or into the brimy deep. Impale them from afar or up close. It's just too much fun to experiment with.\n\nThe big plus that always had me entranced with this game is there is no death and no fail state. Your experience flows and remains fun regardless of how good or bad you are doing. While in the physical world if your health is brought down to zero, the world is transformed into the spectral realm. This changes the shape of the world and the enemies that spawn. Devour enough souls and you can return to the physical world die in the specral realm and you are transported back to the first room in the game. This would be frustrating if it werent for the fact that along your journey you discover way gates, and there is a gate right after the first room. So you rarely actually lose progress and through all of this there is nary a load screen.\n\nAll and all I've played the whole series and love each part for different reasons but this the the best in terms of the total package.

It is challengine to play, has amazing characters, and "Tomb Raider" style puzzles.  The puzzles aren't as difficult as "Tomb Raider" puzzles, but has its own unique style.  Its a darker game, about vampires, and doesn't follow suit with the stereotypical vampires.  The ambient music is dark, and it fits with the game, plus it doesn't overpower the gameplay.  It is a platformer that really makes you think.\n\nThe downsides to this game are minor.  It can be too confusing or difficult at times.  The graphics aren't new, so this game may look to be poor quality, but was pretty good for its time.  A few glitches that can hinder gameplay (not many at all) are around.  Weapons don't respawn since they stay where you left them.\n\nFor those who enjoy a challenging puzzle, platforms, and a unique style of gameplay, this game could be for you.  The story for this game is one to remember.  The only downside to the story is it continues on to the second game, so no second game, no complete story.","January 10","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Soul Reaver is way too old to be compatible with modern day computers. Now then . . .\n\nThis is a game mirroring an era where getting lost was part of the experience and the gameplay and voice acting were stellar. While newcomers to the Legacy Of Kain series might be lost a bit, Raziel provides a clean slate for players. Someone to identify with and someone who grows more mature along with us as we play. And the voice actors, oh dear Nosgoth, the voice actors. Intimidating when they should, imposing when they need to be and identifiable every step of the way. Vampires were never before cast under this kind of light and Soul Reaver gives more lore for us to swim into the tragedy of what it means to be part of a machine that could as well be a metaphore for today's game industry or any industry for that matter.\n\nJust be prepared to get lost a bit.","January 13","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These are not required to beat the game, but they can help out in the long run. With an epic plot and voice acting, this game shall provide much amusement.\n\nIt can also bring frustration as it has one feature in it that was about as popular in games in the 1990's as disproportionate breasts (e.g. much bigger than the frame of the one who has them) - BLOCK MOVING PUZZLES!!! If you're terrible at puzzles in general...you might want to bypass this one, if you want to do them as well as figure out where to go, where to jump and navigate a path through a dying landscape, then this is worth checking out.","December 30, 2015","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sony Playstation, Doritos, and Mountain Dew. That is what made my childhood. Now I can play this again.\n\nThere are a few issues that many don't know how to fix in order to make the game run, but if you know anything about compatibility in windows it gets easy. Once you get it all set up with Steam's version, you can play. Though I will recommend that you change the controls around to suite you're needs. (After playing Defiance, and Skyrim, Oblivion, and a bunch of others that use WASD cotrols... You get my point, right?)\n\nOver all, this game was one of the best I've ever played. I'm actually kind of sad that Eidos canceled the sixth game only one year into making it.","May 8","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't matter how buff your system is, the models and textures look blurry and old. They are old.\nThis game is HARD, you are not going to sail thru it like a lot of the games that come out today. Some of the puzzles in this game are so devious that you can get stuck for hours...... The combat is lame at the start, but by the time you are done it's pretty good. The devs really use the environmental hazards well.\n\nThe story in this game is so good that I can't think of a word to describe it. This game is slow to start, but a few hours into it and I think any gamer would be hooked..........\n\nI had ALL KINDS of strupid issues trying to get this to run on windows 10, and even more issues trying to get it to function with an Xone controller.......... but I did get everything working, and I am glad. The environments and story in this game draw me in pretty deeply. No matter what gen gamer you are, this game is a timeless classic.\n\nHints for Windows 10 users:\n\nMake sure you select a resolution that is x32 instead of x 16. The x32 resolutions are at the top of the list rather than the bottom where one would normally find them.\n\nDon't even mess with the graphics settings in game, use your Graphics card to set up effects and aa values. The only thing you need the launcher or in game settings for is to set the resolution.\n\nNo matter what kind of hardware you have, chjoose the rendering option that mentions direct x.\n\nIf you wanna use a 360 or Xone controller you will have to set the control option to KEYBOARD and then press the buttons on the controller in keyboard settings. Analog controls simply do not work with this game unless you are using Pinnacle Game Profiler or something else that is able to read analog input as mopuse coordinates.\n\nExpect to spend some time getting the game to work on W10............","May 21","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have tried all suggestions from eidos and steam forums and cannot get this game to work.\nIt has \"Controller Support\" if you can call it that, but it is literally unusable because your character just moves forward. Everyone, even the eidos forum moderators (which shouldnt be telling you to use 3rd party software) tell you to use xpadder, but I couldn\'t even get xpadder to work. Maybe cause i was just fed up and tired idk\n\nIf you want to play this game, find some other way to play it.
