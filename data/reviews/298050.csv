I am going to start off with that I do like and why followed by the big issues and what they need to do to correct this.\n\n1. Sound! Omg, I was smiling from ear to ear when I realized the music for the colony ship landing was the same from the original.\n\n2. Graphics are great and their attention to detail just amazes me, like having the ship’s path curve AROUND the star. The races are detailed and beautifully rendered.\n\n3. The UI is clean and unobtrusive. This is great because you get the whole galaxy as your backdrop.\n\n4. I love the colony manager and how they display your information, it is a great take on the MoO 2 mananger with a modern UI.\n\nI have enjoyed playing, but I can say the same for the countless MoO clones. Sadly like them I see this getting played for a bit until the combat becomes so bland I don't pick it up ever again, usually two to three games.\n\n1. Combat - The combat is real time and I have no direct fire control of my ships. Sure I can get into tactical mode where I tell them where to go and who to shoot but that does no good if I cannot control the weapons. I don’t want a real time combat, I wanted MoO turn based ship combat. Sure you could get bogged down in MoO 2 space combat if your fleets got really big at the end game but that is why you had AUTO. In MoO 2 you could make some really nuanced ships, and special variants, in this because of the ship combat AI you are forced to make brute force ships.\n\n2. Research - I love MoO 1’s research, you could play multiple games and get different techs each time. I only ever saw Hand Phasers once out of countless games. This made research unique and you were always checking in on the other races to find out what they got that you didn’t. Here I find myself making strange and unintelligible choices. Why must I choose between fusion bombs and fusion beams? This doesn’t make any sense, all it does is make an optimal research path that min maxers will figure out and share, it does not add variety.\n\n3. Range - There is no range mechanic. In the first MoO games you were limited by how far your fuel cells would let you go. A scout now however can go all over the galaxy and find everything and everyone. So instead of a gradual expansion moving forward and meeting aliens, you are thrust straight away into contact and have to start shoring up your solar systems at the Starlane warp points so you can at least hold on to some of your colonizable planets.\n\n4. It has been brought to my attention the 500 turn limit can be turned off. It is the Excellence victory condition in the Advanced Options menu. These options need to be labeled better. I am testing a game with the turn limit turned off. (update) I got far too bored and just stopped playing.\n\n5. Star lanes - These don't belong in a MoO game at all! Part of the tactics were worrying if commiting your fleet was going to leave you open at home. You could pick where and when to attack, now you just walk right into bottleneck after bottleneck after bottleneck. These need to go NOW. I had an anomoly pop up near my homeworld in my first game and I thought, ok without a star lane it must take a while to get to it right? Nope, one turn, one turn for a distance the same distance as the star lane going to the next star system. That star lane took FOUR turns. This makes no sense. These need to go.\n\nIf you haven't purchased it already I suggest waiting. I would rather play MoO 1 or 2 before touching this one again.","February 28","false","14.1"," 635 of 809 people (78%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","78","635","809","16","39"

Unless you are a casual player, I do not recommend this game.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably curious to know why I feel this way. Let's start with what I think those core mechanics are, and what makes them deeply flawed. There are three, and you've seen them before in other, better games:\n\nPlanetary management\nResearch\nCombat\nI don't believe diplomacy is a core mechanic, and I am fairly confident it will never become one, as spending just a few minutes in-game will show you how easy it is to abuse negotiations, and how illogical--and obnoxious--the AI is; in every match I've played (single/multiplayer) the AI demands credits from me, regardless of our relationship or my behavior, and if I fail to appease them, war is soon declared. If you've played even a handful of other 4x titles, this should sound quite familiar.\n\nPLANETARY MANAGEMENT\nPlanetary management consists of dragging and dropping colonists across three lines of resources: research, food, and production. The resources earned every turn depend on the planet type and the planet's modifiers (mostly positive, and a few negative), mid/late-game research, and specialized buildings, but consecutive colonists in a line provide diminished returns on resources. At a glance, it might seem worth it to distribute your colonists in a balanced fashion, but as a resource, food is overwhelmingly powerful, and as the research tree is terrible (technologies impact your empire in a lopsided manner) there's almost no reason to ever assign colonists to research over food or production.\n\nFood is overwhelmingly powerful.\n\nThe turns needed to produce new colonists from food are on a relatively linear curve, meaning that the sooner you start massing food, the sooner you cap out your colonists. There is no "soft" cap on your colonists, only a maximum that the planet can support; you'd think that certain buildings would be required to steadily increase how many colonists you can sustain and provide for--especially on inhospitable planets--but the developers opted instead to determine that "hard" cap from a planet's size, not from it's structures, and reduce the available food on those inhospitable planets. This means that it is still desirable to colonize small worlds; in other games, small worlds are undesirable, as many turns/credits are needed to build/buyout structures which increase the population cap.\n\nTerraforming a world can increase the maximum colonists that it can support, and a handful of late-game technologies can be researched that also increase this maximum (it is important to note that these technologies apply to all of your worlds), but the turns needed for these two things are substantial, and typically the game is decisive by the time they're available to you.\n\nThe only reason a player might be inclined to not mass food is the dimishing return, but this penalty is minor, and unless it is tuned to become quite severe, it will remain irrelevant. Immediately prioritizing food will make your worlds much, much stronger in far fewer turns than opponents who do not. Some of you might be saying that I am mistaken, that prioritizing food means you're sacrificing something critical elsewhere, like system defenses or ships, but considering the poor design choice of star lanes and scanners (structures that reveal incoming ships), you have potentially dozens of turns to adjust your production in response to threats. And since you will be earning more credits per turn than otherwise, you can afford more and earlier buyouts.\n\nIf structures were required to increase the cap on your colonists and/or they tuned the diminishing return on food, it could allow for more diverse gameplay. Unfortunately, that is unlikely to happen, as the bulk of gameplay is tied to what you research, and as I said earlier, the research tree is terrible.\n\nRESEARCH\nThe research tree is terrible.\n\nThe majority of it feels required, not optional, leaving little room for experimentation or alternate strategies. There's a clear meta. This problem is compounded by the incredible number of prerequisites required for each successive research.\n\nYou replace newly unlocked technologies--particularly for ships--with even newer ones before the effects of the former are even felt; it is possible to have your newest ships become nearly obsolete after only a handful of turns. Considering how long it can take ships to travel across your controlled systems, they're unlikely to even see combat before becoming obsolete. This happens constantly throughout all stages of the game, and keep in mind that I never prioritize research; I unlock technologies at a slower rate than was intended.\n\nFew technologies feel satisfying. The developers had some technologies that were binary; you chose one or the other, and that was it. In the most recent patch, the developers changed a substantial number of technologies to binary. This would be an issue if not for the fact that you can get an upgraded version the technology you did not select in the very next research, making that previous choice completely pointless. This happens constantly throughout the research tree.\n\nOutside of structures that modify your resources, the bulk of what you earn from the research tree feels underpowered. This is constrasted by extremely overpowered technologies scattered in the tree, like the battle pods, or an empire-wide reduction in the production needed for structures and ships. Some technologies should require a minimum number of research-oriented structures before they can be unlocked--at least then I'd be penalized for not focusing on it, and players who do feel satisfied when they're given those overpowered technologies.\n\nCOMBAT\nSpace battles are attrition-based and entirely unengaging, and the AI controling your ships (enabled by default) is atrocious.\n\nThis is how a battle begins: each fleet deploys on the far side of a randomly generated field. There is often debris, like asteroids, in the field. When you un-pause (battles are paused by default), your ships immediately move towards the enemy fleet, regardless of their equipped weaponry, and they immediately fire any weapons that are in range. I have watched so many battles (spectating combat is only available in singleplayer) where a salvo of missiles fly right into an asteroid. Fire that gunner, please. If that doesn't happen, the salvo destroys an enemy ship. Because missiles have the longest range of any weapon, the first salvo effectively determines the battle. Fully armed, every generation of ships I produce equipped with missiles is guaranteed to destroy at least two enemy ships. There is no reason to equip any other kind of weaponry, especially when you unlock a "special" for your ship that gives missiles secondary targets.\n\nPoint defenses and weapon modifiers that take up more space within your ships are either unimplemented or a waste; and even if they were neither of those two things, the AI that brings your ships into what is basically melee range completely removes any advantages they might offer. Why do my missiles need more speed or armor when they're being fired point-blank? Why does my ship move into melee range in the first place?\n\nI don't have enough characters to further explain the other lacking aspects of this game.","April 23","false","51.3"," 397 of 504 people (79%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","79","397","504","15","19"

I still have my old floppy discs for it, and the manual which was absolutely necessary to pass through the regular security checks the game ran to prevent piracy.  And it was a masterpiece, one only exceeded by Master of Orion 2 in the canon of space 4x games in my estimation.  After the absolute travesty that was MOO3 I thought we would never have another one to rival the first two.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThis game is EARLY ACCESS.  That has to be emphasized.  There are races not yet available for play (The Darlok, Klakon, Meklar, and Silicoids), I've had one solitary CTD, and a few graphical glitches here and there but on the whole this is already an amazingly polished title with astounding voice acting (by such luminaries as Mark Hamill and Alan Tudyk) and gorgeous graphics.  I enjoy just sitting on the main game map, watching the stars twinkle and shine, the nebulae shift and flux, and my ships flying through the space lanes with a massive bow shock in front of them as testament to their faster than light speed.\n\nThis is the first game since the old MIcroprose days to capture the FEEL of Master of Orion.  Everything about it is immersive, from the extraordinary animations for the alien race leaders you meet, the constant chiming in from your advisors (some of which are voiced by big Hollywood names ... hearing Alan Tudyk as the Psilon advisor just makes me smile every time he speaks up).\n\nThere is no proper campaign at this point, but plenty of open, free space to play around in, conquer and be conquered in turn.  You can play a game from beginning to end already, through conquest, diplomacy, research, economic might, and several other victory conditions of your choosing.  The game map on Medium or Large is huge, and I know there was some concern that it was only going to contain, at maximum, 100 or so star systems but believe me when I say that at the pace this game plays that is an ideal number.  It feels as grand as games offering thousands of systems to conquer and plays at a more thoughtful pace requiring more attention to detail (unless you automate production and let the game do it for you, which is an entirely viable strategy, focusing your own attentions on matters of military and diplomacy as your governors churn out buildings and units like there's no tomorrow).\n\nI had some concerns about the ship design system.  There are still aspects of it not in game, but I will tell you straight away that it lacks the complete customization of a game like the GalCiv series.  You won't be putting together the building blocks or your ship here, choosing from hundreds of hulls and nacelles and fiddly little bits.  But it still manages to be intensely satisfying, with lots of graphical bells and whistles (I especially love the Psilon ship designs which harken to the flying saucer days of 1950s alien conspiracy theories).  I felt no great lack of customization in the end and the polish on these ships outshines much of what players could manage on their own.  I suspect there will be more hull designs to come, more options to choose from, but again it is still Early Access.\n\nIn short, if you loved the original MOO or MOO2, if Civ5 was your cup o tea, or if you relish getting stuck into the kind of gaming experience that will have you plastered to your PC for hours without a break and every minute of it spent feeling like you ARE the emperor of a burgeoning space-faring race out to charm, deceive, or otherwise conquer all who dare to raise a laser cannon or tachyon beam against you ... this IS the game you've been looking for.\n\nFor all the supposed successors to Master of Orion that have come and gone over the last 20 years, this is the first one to do it justice since MOO2.  What Wargaming have made is a clear labor of love and it retains enough of what made MOO the father of the 4x genre while blessing it with enough that's new to bring a much-loved franchise into the 21st Century.\n\nBuy it.  NOW.\n\n10/10","February 25","true","35.8"," 442 of 600 people (74%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","74","442","600","20","40"

I spent countless hours and many lonely nights as a teenager playing MOO 2, and it was revolutionary.  Only to have the francise and name get dragged through the mud with releases that were progressively worse with each release.  This latest installment is not excluded from that plummet from greatness, and downright borderlines on being used as coaster... Well if it were an actual Game CD and not a digital download, but you get the idea.\n\nLike many have said before, the AI is terrible and completely boring.  A faction whom you were friends with, all of a sudden asks for money like a crack head in front of the gas station, and when you refuse the will declare war on you within a few turns, unless you are considerably stronger than them, hey even crackheads know what battles to pick.\n\nThe diplomacy is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  It is so easy to exploit any other race on any difficulty level that it does not even seem fair.  Imagine telling a 5 year old that you will give him a $20 baseball mitt for his leather satchel full of $100 bills, don't ask me how he got that satchel, I just know he has it.\n\nCombat is atrocious!!!  Visuals are decent, but get very redundant and boring after the 3rd time seeing the exact same thing.  If this were still 2010 the graphics would be amazing... Unfortunately it is 2016, and for today's standards, they are quite poor, with little to no interaction.\nEven with all of the die hard fans, pleading and begging for the developers to change the combat on every forum that I have read, there does not seem to be any change in sight.  If I had the control to do so, I would fire every single one of the pilots and captains of my ships, because they fight like they have been drinking everclear and doing bong rips all night.  Not utilizing any of their weapons (yet another steaming pile of dung aspect) to their potential or capabilities.  Don't even bother with guns or beam weapons, just build all missle ships and you should have no problem, as they are way over powered, and anyone who happens to be on the recieving end, literally has no defense...  Yes point defense weapons exist, but they too are being operated and developed by the same people that have been pulling all nighter parties with my digital pilots.\n\nTech tree = Garbage...  Unlike MOO 2 where I was Sooooo excited that my little digital aliens worked their butts off to get the newest cool techs to help me conquer the galaxy, these little guys do the same thing, however its so boring and redundant that I could care less, at no fault of thier own... These little alien nerds are doing the best they can with what they are given.\n\nThe early access games have now are an amazing way to for developers to make money from us poor saps, to help them continue development and make it better for the fans and players.  But these guys seem to have taken the money and ran.  Seemingly none of them have been listening nor reading forums, for what the true fans want to see in MOO again, because none of it exists.\n\nI cannot recommend it to ANYONE!!! I can say pretty confidently that both fans of the series will feel just as violated and sad as I did (like a virgin on prom night), and even if you have never played the MOO series before and are just looking for a good Space 4X game, there are far better ones out there for much cheaper, that will give you so much better experience then this failed abortion will.\n\nNow with all the bashing out of the way... If this is truly NOT the end product, and the devs decide that care more about putting out something great again, as opposed to a money making scam, then I would love to give it the old Siskel and Ebert two thumbs up.  But until then I shall remain in a disarray and wish that I would have quit after 2 hours of play and requested a refund.","May 9","false","33.9"," 111 of 133 people (83%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","83","111","133","10","7"

Game is still on development and the devs will use the users reviews to try to improve (or at least I hope so).\n\nThis being said now... let's be honest.\n\nGeneral interface and galactic strategy\n\nThere we find a rather similar build than MOO2 (and, for God's sake, I WILL ignore  MOO3). All the mechanics are very similar: colony management, research, economy, exploration and colonisation... The real fans of the saga (as I am) will see again those great comboes we used to love in the series (plasma torpedoes and Dauntless Guidance system... it never fails!).\n\nThe graphics look cool enough. MOO has never been a game about graphical aspect, but about lore, strategy, economy and diplomacy. A rather simple 2d map with some 3d effects that are rather nice to observe. The close ups to the planets look beautiful. However, the animatics of the colonisation are always the same, one for each planet type. Considering the random terrain generators available nowadays, I can´t help but think that this could have been done better.\n\nFirst setbacks: Colony management\n\nSo, we start managing our colonies... what is the first thing we find? Freighters are gone. Yep.  Not anymore. All the food economy part is done in the background, I don't really know very well how, but I never had to worry about investing to make sure the food arrived to all my colonies (and I had a good ammount on barren worlds).\n\nThis may even be ok, but there comes the counterpart: The introduction of a "Colonist transport". Each one of these units permits you to move 2 million colonies from one colony to another... and then they dissappear.\n\nSeriously!? How did we come to this setback!? The freighter mechanics in MOO2 was BEAUTIFUL! Easy, intuitive, but still with enough economic impact that would make you reconsider about colonisiing that volcanic ultrarich planet. How is it possible that suddenly I have to micromanage the construction, movement and deployment of a ship to move colonists!?\n\nThe "I-really-hope-they-fix-this" tech tree\n\nCongratulations. Now you are a Psilon. I don't care that you are called Bulrathi, that your ships are immense and anything else. Now you are a Psilon. Why? Because you have access to all the technologies! ALL OF THEM!\n\nThis is absolutely bad. No more difficult choices, like "Damn, fighters or battle pods?". Nop. Niet. I really hope this has yet to be implemented.\n\nThe nonsense diplomacy\n\nSo, in my first game as Bulrathi I ended up next to the Mrrshans. They asked me for money, I said no, they declared war. Ok, fair enough. Second game: They ask for money, I say yes, but later they ask me for more and... bingo! war again.\nSuddenly no option to declare peace.\n\nIt really feels like a "wannabe MMO2", and I find that really sad. In all these years of Sid Meier's games there have been a lot of advancements in the AI diplomacy... why isn´t it applied there? Why don´t they ask me to stop being friends with someone? Why don´t they force my hand by making me retreat from a planet? Why there doesn´t seem to be any alliances between other races affecting me?\n\nAnother hope they fix soon.\n\nCustom ships? Somehow is here, but not really clear..\n\nThe first problem is that the ship editor is not easy to see, It is hidden in the top right menu. The second problem is that the interface is simply... unclear. You have an small image of the ship on the right side; the stats are placed all around the screen, making it really uncomfortable to actually see them.\n\nSo... yes, it's there... but not quite. It requires a lot of improvement.\n\n\nThe great setback: The real time tactic battles\n\nWow, just wow.\n\nNow all tactical space battles are real time. Wich, may be honest, sounds weird on MOO, but it could be rather cool. However what we find here is not. At all.\nFirst, the default battle has the AI set on, so the computer will control your ships.\nSecond, this barelly makes any difference, as most of your ships will only advance on each other firing up until they are about to collide, then start trying to dogfight. Even crurisers and battleships!\n\nFor the all mighty God of sakes, what the hell is that!? You want to make an RTS space battle? Hell, learn from Homeworld, in example!! Whats the point on having a superheavy ship, if it is goung to get in close combat anyway!? What's the point of the long range missiles, if they are going to keep closing by until shooting them point-blank?\n\nAnd even so, the supposed "tactic" doesn´t go any further than pointing the ships to go somewhere, attack something, or use an special skill such as "shield capacitors". Nothing else. So all the tactical sense is absolutely lost, it is simply not fun to play. You can simply let the AI do everything and try to enjoy the show!\n\nAnd talking about the show... the cinematic camera sucks really hard.\n\n\nFinal conclussion\n\nI want to love this game. I really want, but I can´t. I have played for just 3 hours and I'm already bored. So, at this stage I can´t recommend you to buy Master of Orion.\nWell, yeah, if you get it you will get a copy of MOO1 and MOO2. They also included MOO3, but just ignore that one.\n\nI will keep updating this review as the early access patches go on.\n\nUPDATE: 19th March.\n\nOk, played a few more games.\n\nBuggity buggity bug\n\nThis is actually quite a bug that costed me a whole game. When proposing a research treaty to another race -which costed me few hundres of credits- the other race asked me to pay a few hundred credits extra in order to sign the deal\n\nI agreed, as the game didn´t warn me, and found myself with -400 credits in my bank. Next turn, all my ships and buildings were scrapped.\n\nIt's been reported already.\n\nDiplomacy: "With friends like you..."\n\nPlaying as humans I decided to try the diplomatic game. First race: MRRSHAN (proud, war lovers...). Managed to get an embassy stablished, sign trade deals, research deals, share charts, non-aggression pacts... Cool, right?\n\nWell, actually the diplomacy here summarizes in this:\n\nME: Hey, Mrrshan, I got fusion beams, you got fusion bombs. Deal?\nMrrshan: Deal.\n\nAnd then:\n\nMrrshan: Hey, human, I want your graviton lasers. Let me offer you 90 credits in exchange.\nMe:  Errrh... well you see... I think the deal is a bit...\nMrrshan: YOU ARE PLAYING WITH FIRE, HUMAN!!\n\nFrom there, fell from "friendly" to "neutral". Few turn later, it was impossible to make almost any deal with them, and everything ended up in war.\n\nSo... Diplomacy means making your allies happy with presents? That's... lame.\n\n\nStupid, stupid, stupid AI\n\nAI really needs more work.\n\nA game I dominated the galaxy. The human empire stood on its 3-systems empire, not trying to colonize anything else, or build any fleet. For hundreds of turns, I swearh. I ended up conquering them with a single titan.\n\nSuicide pirates: Do you imagine a 1750th sail ship charging heads on against a 2015th navy destroyers? Well, if you can, that's basically what happens in MOO. Huge attacks of 3 ships with a combined power of 24 (yeah, two-four) charging heads on against a fortified planet.\n\n\nPeace treaties: "NO, YOU PAY YOU SCUM!!"\n\nOk, I start a war that, although I could win, it didn´t help me long term. So starting acting in defense and tried to sign a peace treaty.\n\nMe: Hey man, that's stupid, shall we stop this war?\nPsilon: Yes, but the logical thing is that you pay me.\nMe: Ok, how much?\nPsilon: FIVE MILLION CREDITS, TEN OF YOUR COLONIES, ALL YOUR TECH AND YOUR SOUL!!!\nMe: Eh.... No?\nPsilon: YOU BARBARIC IGNORANT!\n\nThis doesn´t change even if you are sieging their homeworld with the freaking Death Star itself.","March 6","false","10.8"," 353 of 493 people (72%) found this review helpful 61 people found this review funny","72","353","493","61","26"

It might be an okay 4X game, but it is not a good Master of Orion title.\n\nPositives:\n\n+Looks cool\n+Stable (No crashes)\n+Good voice acting\n\nIn essence, the game looks very pretty and sounds very cool. Many of the voices actors were immediately recognizable, and they do a fairly good job over all. The GNN skits get a little annoying after a while, so I usually just skip them now. They are too time-consuming. The graphics are great and the animations are wonderful. Lastly, it isn't a broken piece of junk like Master of Orion 3 was. The main bugs I have seen have been UI and text-related. This seems to be where they spent their resources.\n\nSo, on these merits, it is already better than Master of Orion 3 was. That is a very low bar, though.\n\nNegatives:\n\n-No Turned Based Combat\n-Excessively Small "Battle Maps"\n-Broken Diplomacy\n-Temporary Treaties\n-Bad AI\n-Restricted Customization\n-Generalization\n-No Leaders\n-Star Lanes\n\nThe game is at the very core, nothing like its predecessors. I know many people who will not buy this simply because it is no longer turn based. I'm hoping that the battle maps can be made larger, or possibly scalable, but I did not see this. Also, the AI is terrible. It will decide to fly directly into and attempt to shoot through asteroids, as an example.\n\nDiplomacy is now completely and utterly broken. You essentially have to hand over all your money, all of your revenue, give them a technology, and hand over one of your colonies, in order to obtain a non-aggression pact. I can't fathom what it would take to secure an alliance. This was as a race with "+25% Diplomacy", as well. So, I don't think that the system is working at all.\n\nOh, and if you happen to get ahead in technology, the AI will simply demand you give them the technology you worked so hard for. Not even an exchange. Refusal pisses them off, and you cannot edit the "deal". Either give me technology, or I get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at you. Great system.\n\nRemember how treaties used to work? Both sides initially lose money, but over time the "trade" or "research" treaty would add to your revenue? Nope. Temporary. Basically, you gain nothing for a number of turns. Then, out of the blue, "Yay! Get 348 BC!". The treaty is then TERMINATED, and requires renegotiating. That is now a treaty.\n\nWhile you CAN still customize all of the weapons on your ships, there are less customization options. Also, the "System" part of ship customization has been turned into "slots" or "modules". And yes, they put anti-missle rockets here. I don't understand why.\n\nWhat I mean by "Generalization" is that there is a lot less specialization in the game. The races used to be extremely diverse, and had completely different playstyles. Not anymore. I know that "custom race" is coming, but the base races are so very similar that I don't expect too much from this right now.\n\nThis one is easy. Just add in Leaders.\n\nStar lanes? Really? This one was completely unexpected. You move around by moving to the "warp points" inside of a star system, and then can "warp" to predetermined systems adjacent to your current system. Want to get to a system "south" of where you are? No Star Lane, no way. Gotta take the long way around.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game has been massively simplified, and bears very little resemblance to the classics. If you are a die hard MoO 2 fan, don't pick this up. If you are, however, a fan of games like Civilization 5, this may work for you. It has been streamlined into, essentially, a space Civ 5 game with cool-looking battles. Oh, and famous voice actors.\n","February 27","false","3.2"," 526 of 755 people (70%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","70","526","755","12","19"

Game is unfinished, unbalanced and too easy at the moment. Buy only if you A) Want to support the developers or B) Want to experience all the patches that will come untill release. At this time the game will give you about 10 hours of fun before you will realize that it needs to be finished to give you about 100+ more. It plays well though and I like it a lot.\n\n*** See the bottom for updates. ***\n\nFirst impressions from Early access, review will follow when the game will be released.\n\nIf you cannot bare bugs, strange behavior and missing depth to some parts of the game elements then DO NOT buy this game yet, except you would want to support the developers.\n\nIf you are a 4X fan in general:\n\n* This game is a lot like Endless space when it started, but has a lot more potential. The tactical combat mainly is going to be better in my opinion due to the possibility to control the ships. The production values overall are higher.\n* Game lacks depth at the moment which is coming in few months I hope but is very well playable now. I will repeat myself here; the game is very similar to how the Endless space was at launch.\n* The art and voice overs are TOP quality. Music reminds me a lot of Star Trek for some reason.\n* Graphics are OK for a 4X game but in my opinion the ship models could use some work, especially at the strategic layer.\n* If you want to experience full depth and engaging game from the start then you should wait a bit... I suppose the game will be feature full in the summer.\n* Strategic game is turn based and tactical combat is RT with pause.\n* Map options are limited at the moment. Map size, difficulty and number of races mainly.\n* If you like 4x games in general then you will most probably like this game too. The gameplay is fluid and quite fast, no HC micromanagements at the moment.\n\nIf you are core MOO fan and "old school gamer":\n\n* If you are expecting a graphically updated MOO 2 then you will be disapointed. This game is going to be a bit different. This is in no way a clone of the old MOO games. It uses the same basic structure but the feel to it is not the same.\n* Game is not finished; you can see it mainly in tactical combat which is lacking a lot. And the combat is not turn based (maybe it will change?).\n* Research and race stats are done differently than in MOO2.\n* No NPCs yet.\n* The voice overs can be a bit annoying if they will not fit your "expectations" from how you have imagined them in MOO2 for example.\n* This game is, in my opinion, for new generation of players. It will have a lot in common with MOO2 but will never be the same...\n\nI like how the game is looking now and what potential it has so I recommend it in general but be careful here. Even though it fits my "needs", it may not fit yours. Do a bit of research and watch a lets play on youtube first.\n\n*** Updates: ***\n\n10 hours in\n\nSo after playing a bit I've found following things that will be worked on most before the release, or at least I hope so.\n\n* Espionage is missing at the moment, but the foundations are there. You can build and research upgrades for your spies.\n* Ground combat is a placeholder at the moment. No armies battling at the moment, only simple explosion animations.\n* Tactical combat is a bit better than ground combat but it's still a place holder too.\n* No story at the moment as far as I can tell.\n* Races are not complete, the racial stats are too simple at the moment to be considered finished.\n* No race specific tech at the moment.\n\n*** Developers update about upcoming changes in Early access: ***\n\nSome of the features that will be added during other Stages of EA.\nMore Playable Races\nCustom Races\nEspionage\nNew victory conditions\nMinor Races / Independent planets\nLinux and Mac Support\n\nSome of the features that we will improve are:\nMultiplayer\nShip Design\nTactical Battles\nThe tutorial\nThe Galaxy generation\nBalance in general\n\n*** Early access phase 2 update ***\n\nA lot of thinks added, fixed, adjusted, but still a lot is missing. Game is still suffering from missing key features like espionage, better research tree and rase diversity.","February 25","true","24.1"," 196 of 266 people (74%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","74","196","266","9","3"

The Tech tree is lacklust and has you choose between a temporary boost which will become useless in a few turns or a long term one. One that won't even be used anyway because the benefits don't really show up in combat.\n\nCombat is a hit or miss, most of the time. I have just seen the AI smash me with frigates (early/mid game) and Destroyers (mid/late game). I copied the AI and discovered the trick to fleet management. 1 or 2 large ships for show and brute force, and have them follow with dozens of destroyers to take the damage while the big ships crank out damage.\nReplace the destroyers in a few turns and get them back in the fight. A super fleet with only big ships will be worn out and will take way too long to replace. Unless you have cash to just buy it out.\n\nThe best weapon is the missle and anything else really is a waste of time. The games PD does not seem to work very well. All of the PD weapons are stacked and thus fire as one, essentially firing on one missle, allowing missles that could have been fired on to hit your ship. This may have been fixed in EA3 but I keep getting bugs that rendered the game unenjoyable for me.\n\nThe AI lacks any real flare and is quite boring and really just stands as a speed bump to Victory.\n\nThe game does not have a feel for an epic space tale. It feels more like a game for competition/tournaments. The only thing that makes the game hours long is that it is turn based which it does not even need to be.","May 6","false","27.4"," 85 of 108 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","85","108","2","0"

The product in it's current state is playable and can be enjoyable, depending on what you are looking for: it'sclose to a polished finished title +++\n\n.

While my review stands for the game's current state, the dev seems to indicate that they're going to be putting a lot more work into it before considering it to be "complete", with at least one more phase of early access.  That's promising, but the fundamental problems with the game are still quite severe and quite difficult to fix.\n\nIf Stellaris had been decent I would say to not even bother with MoO, but the fact is that Stellaris is also kind of a turd and really feels like an early beta.  Given that status, and the fact that it may take several months - or worse - a $30 dlc for Stellaris to get decent I'll be keeping my eye on MoO.  I wouldn't buy either MoO or Stellaris in the state that they're both in, but with another couple of months of dev work I think its possible that either game could reach the point of being fun.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe game is now in its third (and presumably final) phase of early access, and appears to be relatively feature complete.  The only thing I would expect them to implement is the Galactic Council.  Keep in mind there is a Galactic Council in the game, but unlike in previous incarnations of MoO this council is just a means to a diplomatic victory, which is itself just a shortcut to a conquest victory as the AI will only vote for itself meaning that no one can be elected victor until one player has ~66% of the Galaxy's population.\n\nBut on to the state of the game, right now it has serious AI, balance, and galaxy generation issues - but I'll be generous and assume they fix all of these at release.  Despite that assumption, the game would still be bad.\n\nThe real problem with the game is just how generic it is.  It is the exact same space 4x game that has been getting regurgitated over the past 20 years with nicer graphics and sound.   They could have very easily called it Endless Space 2, Horizon 2, or Polaris Sector 2 and no one would have known the difference.  That wouldn't have been a problem several years ago, but right now the market is absolutely saturated with generic space 4x games that all play virtually identical to one another.  Ultimately, MoO's problem is that its only benefit over those games is the graphics, but you're paying $40-$50 for those graphics.\n\nIf you really want <Generic Space 4x N> you're much better waiting a month for a steam sale and picking up one of the other ones for $5.  Honestly, the graphics in Endless Space aren't even that much worse than what you get in MoO and Endless Space is 4 years old.\n\nAnd that was assuming that the problems with the game get fixed at release - and there are a lot of problems for a game in the "final" stage of early access.\n\nRight now the AI in the game is absymal.  The other empire's AI is extremely simplistic in diplomacy and outright bad at playing the game.  Your own colony governer AI might as well be non-existent.  You have 3 choices for how it controls your population, all of which are bad, and the "autobuild" order which causes the colony to build from a bad predefined build order that is identical for every colony.\n\nThere are also serious galaxy generation issues.  I've had multiple starts where I am right next to another Empire's homeworld; multiple starts where I've been trapped by unstable wormholes (which you can only traverse very late in the game) in some tiny, garbage, walled off area of the galaxy; and one start in which just about every empire was completely isolated to a handful of systems by unstable wormholes.\n\nThen there are ship design issues.  Phase 3 put a new ship design system in that just sucks.  Its hard to tell whats new, impossible to tell what the DPS on a weapon is without actually putting it on your ship, and just difficult to use in general.  Plus if you let the AI "autoupdate" your ships when you get new weapons/ship systems it completely erases your previous design and replaces it with the stock design, rather than just updating the existing components with the newly researched ones.\n\nFinally comes the balance issues, particularly in the late game where weapon damage scales much faster than ship health.  Another annoying late game thing is that production becomes irrelevant.  Even a huge ultra-rich max habitable planet will take 20-30 turns to crank out your larger ships if you max out production.  It's not even worth bothering trying to build a larger ship with a smaller or less mineral rich planet.  Conversly, it only takes a few turns of credit income to just outright buy that same ship, making the late game entirely about how much money your empire can generate per turn.\n\nAs I said, the game is bad even if they fix these issues.  But the issues are numerous, and *all* of these issues have either seen no improvement through early access or have actually got worse.  Because of that, I don't have any faith that any of this will be fixed, and combining the poor state of the game's features with the poor state of the implementation of those features gets you a real stinker of a game.  I see no reason to buy this over any of the other generic Space 4x's on the market, especially when I expect many of those to go on sale for $5 in a month or two while this game will sit around the $40-$50 mark.\n\nAt the absolute very least I would wait until Stellaris comes out to see if thats any better than this before making any space 4x purchases in the near future.","April 24","false","17.0"," 148 of 219 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","148","219","3","9"

I have played MoO2 for probably thousands of hours since I first bought it about 18 years ago, and still play it a couple of times every year.\nFrom the first early teasers I was really hoping this game would be a true Master of Orion sequel. I went in to play for two hours. Forced myself to stop just before the 2 hour mark due to feeling VERY, VERY dissapointed, then I went to watch several youtubers to see more of what the game has to offer.\n\n*The races are dumbed down variants of their own MoO2 counterparts, the traits are little more than minor stat buffs in different fields. Not game defining traits that you based your core strategy around, and give each race a unique play style.\n\n*Technology has a civ-style tech tree, which do feel bland, thin and very constricted. I am happy they decided to hold on to one of MoO2s defining features, that you could only choose one discovery per technology. In MoO2, that was something that further allowed you to gradually define your empire and playstyle as the game progressed. However, this feature feels somewhat dumbed down in this game, as at the first tiers of research you get all the discoveries, cutting out some potentially very difficult decisions. Later on you will need to make choices however, which is nice.\n\n*Combat is very boring. While you CAN control your ships to some extent, especially if you repeatedly pause and overview their orders, they fights mostly manage themselves rather quickly.\nIn MoO2, combat was a great, it was the climax of the game, where you finally got to test your ship designs against the enemy, and where your actions and tactics mattered the most. It was far from perfect, but it had potential to be FUN. There were definitely possibilities to improve, perhaps by getting rid of the coarce grid, reducing fleet-sizes or making huge fleets easier to manage, adding MORE weapons types, tactical options, etc, etc.\nBut rather then keeping what was good and improving on it, they decided to make combat uninspired, dull and nothing like Master of Orion 2. (It is pretty tho).\n\n*Ship customization was the last huge feature of Master of Orion 2. Each ship had a maximum mass, and you could add ANY mix of weapons and modules into it. Mostly, each type of weapon was interesting and offered a unique tactical option. The process of creating ships was always interesting and challenging.\nThis new Master of Orion does, very unfortunately, dumb this down... I feel constricted when it comes to customization. Weapons feel bland and lacks uniqueness. This lack of interesting ship design also further hurts the already boring combat.\n\nI was hoping for a reinvention of one of the best games in history, an improvement on what already was great. But this is not that, at least not yet.\n\nIf they want to get my thumbs up, and amount to anything but being another failed MoO2-clone in my opinion, they need to do a total design-makeover and adress the immense dumbing down of the races and technology, find a better and more interesting way to design ships (likely with more subsystems and weapons). And most important of all: make combat something that is actually something more then a mere cinematic experience with minimal interactions.\n\nI will ask for my moneys back, but I will keep my eyes on the game. Perhaps eventually it will grow to finally be a decent game. But I doubt that will happen, as major design changes rarely happen this late in production.\n\n[EDIT] Thinking about it some more; this game is actually not that bad if you don't compare it to MoO2, there are no obvious game-breaking features that actually ruins the game. If you are in the market for a uncomplicated, mainstream space-4x, you might very possibly enjoy the game.","February 25","false","1.8"," 525 of 843 people (62%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","62","525","843","26","59"

In 96' I was focused on school and well, being a seven year old.  I came in with little knowledge of the game that has inspired so many.  After two near-complete games (and several restarts) in MoO: CTS, I had to boot up MoO2.  Then Endless Space, then buy Starbase Orion for moblie, then go against my own better judgement and pick up StarDrive 2 with its new DLC.\n\nSadly, Master of Orion has been recreated by two other studios, in my opinion, than what the holders of a beloved IP have created.  While I understand the game is Early Access, it is missing several features found in games like I've mentioned above, with a much heftier buy in price.  With the release of Stellaris announced for May, and Endless Space 2 on the horizon, I just don't see this game being released with the amount of depth I want from a 4x strategy game.\n\nWhile starlanes are not a terrible way to go, Endless Space just does it better, especially with things like arp technology.  Compared to a free movement games like SD2 or Orion (MoO2 as well), it is a stark difference.  Never figured out why I couldn't get past a few hours with most space 4x games until playing the games I have mentioned.  I much prefer the Civ styled movement of anywhere you want to go you can go (with technology) and enjoy it a lot more in space 4x games.\n\nCombat currently is a glorified, pretty, cinematic viewer.  Currently your ship designs don't matter much as a lot of weapon systems are non-fuctioning, and A.I. fleet loadouts are rather unbalanced (scout and cruiser spam).  As per their feedback page, this is something they are hoping to expand upon.\n\nFor a reinvisioning of the MoO2 technological system, other games do it much better.  The choices of which technology to use are few and far between, and further are pigeon-holed into pretty obvious decisions.  Compared to Civ styled research systems, games like Endless Space, Endless Legend, or Civ 5 do it far better.  Their are more choices to be made while filling out the tech tree (Masonry vs Calendar etc), providing a more rewarding progression system, even if they don't follow the system provided by MoO2 and SD2 (locking out techs to be stolen/trade for/conquered).\n\nThere is currently no leader system or unit leveling.  While many might consider this as so what?  It really kills replaybility.  In Civ 5 having one of your main military units through the ages is a huge boon.  They have several upgrades that drastically change the unit, and create a connection to the game.  You will do what you can to use, and save, your beloved high level units.  There is no attatchment here.  Unlike MoO2, SD2, Endless Space, or Endless Legend (also having unit leveling), there is no leader system.  Nor is there an abstracted one like Civ 5 (great persons).\n\nColonial depth is pretty barebones for a game like this.  There are no luxury resources or strategic resources currently in the game, and I feel that is something that will not be added.  In Civ 5 you have all sorts of different resources that affect your empire (just as SD2, Endless Space, and Endless Legend have) and can also drastically change gameplay.  In ES, if I don't have say anti-matter, I can't even build certain powerful ship systems.  It will require trading or war to advance my ideas.  In Civ 5, it is basically the same.  I want to build nukes but hold no uranium.  Either I'm trading or conquering my way to them.  It creates a believeable universe, for me, as it akins back to real world geo-politics.  Wars are fought over resources.\n\nTo expand Galaxy (and colonial) depth, it is missing several events found in games like Gal Civ 3, SD2, and ES.  While some are there, they are miniscule and few compared to the games above.  Further, their only resource(s) called Artifacts don't add much to the game.  Each one is a flat bonus to science, industry, food, or credit generation.  Take for example the relic system provided by Endless Space which leaves a plethora of 'wonders' that enhance planets left behind by the Forgotten (Masters in MoO).  Or SD2 which had things like habitats pre-built, or angry beings already on the planet that will require wiping out or dealing with the negative consequences.  In MoO: CTS, it is really hard to care about system X or colony Y.\n\nRaces are aesthetically different but don't add much variation to the game.  Endless Space, and especially MoO2 and Endless Legend have very different races that can alter a gameplay in several small ways or in a few drastic ways.  For example, not being able to research but instead using currency to move up the tech tree, or not being allowed to grow at all beyond your initial city.\n\nPresentation is where the game shines, and for at least me, it doesn't equate to an amazing game.  The voice-over work is pretty good, but can also become annoying after a while.  The GNN is a good example of this, it has several cringe worthy moments not helped by lackluster voice editing.  The graphics are decent for a 4x game, nothing amazing but good.  Better in some ways and worse than others.  Some GUI things need to be cleaned up, current planet management is pretty ridiculous when trying to demolish an old building no longer needed.  Currently, buildings are randomly plopped on a globe and you get to wade through them one by one.  A list of what is built on the planet would help a lot.\n\nI won't say much about the A.I. as it is a known problem, but it really can't be said enough: it can barely play the game and won't challenge even a newcomer.  Hopefully this can be ramped up drastically in the coming months.\n\nAll in all, I don't think I would have bothered with this if it wasn't for its IP.  I can't suggest this game to a newcomer to the space 4x genre as currently, I think Endless Space is far more appoachable.  Teaching a lot of intricate systems in an easy to use GUI, allowing you to expand in the genre if you want more complexity and depth without hitting another huge brick wall of a learning curve.  For veterans of the genre that date back to Civ 4 and 5, or even further with games like MoO2, Distand World Universe, and Gal Civ 2:  the first playthrough will be enjoyable but the 'itch' to play a 4x game will be inflamed as you scour through suggested games to scratch it.","March 16","false","26.5"," 164 of 256 people (64%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","64","164","256","12","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DocAcula/recommended/298050/","DocAcula","Dr.Acula","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DocAcula/","185 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSecond Update EA Version 2:\n\nShort version:\nThe game is shallow in its current state and doesn't even come close to MoO2. I can't recommend it as it is now. I hate how the starlanes system has been implemented.\n\nThe longer version:\nI've completed one match through a council victory after about 8 hours. Now in the second EA phase I'm in an active campaign on hard as Terran. I've got to my breaking point in terms of frustration with the game.\n\nFirst of all let me say that visuals look nice and the performance is pretty good. The controls and UI work for the most part, but some things are still bugged (it's an early version),\n\nResearch:\nFrom what I've seen the research system is not to bad. It's actually working pretty well even though it has been moved closer to what Civilzation does. A different approach would've been more interesting. Most technologies provide you with several unlocks to improve your empire. Sometimes however you have to make choices. This is always where it gets interesting. Do I take the faster ships or do I go for the better bombs for example? At the moment the spy system has not been implemented so your choices matter even more if you're not creative.\n\nDiplomacy:\nThe diplomacy system is weak. I've made a few deals with the AI, but at a certain point when you start expanding and growing. Trade agreements are extremely weird. You first have to pay a pretty hefty sum only to have an increased income per turn for a limited number of turns. Due to the high initial sum I actually have my doubts that it brings in much profit. Why not have a penalty per turn in the beginning and the longer it runs the better it pays until the agreement is cancelled? It worked much better in MoO2. In addition the AI is just insanely arrogant. In my last game even on neutral ground every single race always demanded every BC I had plus 10-20 BC per turn and one of my best planets as compensation. It just doesn't make any sense. When in the beginning it was possible to do agreements after about 100 turns everything went completely nuts. I only had one race I had "decent" relations and with them I made an alliance. But even they demanded these stupid compensations for fair trades like technology exchanges. Oh and lets not forget the unreasonable demands like "give us 512 BCs and your great planet that is extremely far away from our empire". And they get angry when I refuse?\n\nShip Design:\nThe things I completely hate are the ship design system and the combat. I have no idea what they were thinking when they designed that. Every ship type has a predefined number of slots. The engine, armor, shields and targeting computer is almost the same as in the old games. However the weapons and special systems are a pain to handle. When you implement a new weapon system the numbers are extremely confusing. Sometimes the dps is lower but the overall attack is higher. Changing a weapon to heavy doesn't even change the dps and usually lowers the overall attack value compared to standard weapons. In the end I've only used standard weapons and ignored the upgrades and my ships where always superior to any AI ship. Btw. whenever you research new technology for ships the game always tries to upgrade all of you existing designs. But it doesn't really tell you what exactly the change does. It increases or lowers the building price and provides some icons on what appears to be upgrades, but the auto upgrade usually made the ships worse and I always had to fix the setup afterwards.\n\nTactical Combat:\nThe combat system is just there. You have barely any influence on what happens during the combat. You see your ships flying in. You then start in Pause mode in which you can assign a target. However you can't specify what weapons you'll use or how specials are used. You can change the formation, but even that system is implemented poorly. In addition I can't control single ships to pull the damaged ships back. If I select one ship and issue a command, the others do the same. Also the AI does an awfull job with firing and targeting. Hey look my ships have frontal assault weapons. What do we do? Park the ships in a way so they can't fire. So in short the combat system is complete c*** even with the most recent upgrades. Also it's funny how a fleet with a much higher military rating (120.000 vs enemy 80.000) gets completely obliterated. The best thing at the moment pretty much is to simply simulate the combat and just wait for the result. It's more likely to have a good result compared to the so called "tactical combat" anyway.\n\nTravel:\nLet's talk about the most controversal topic => starlanes. In general I don't really like the idea behind starlanes but I could get behind it if was implemented in a good way. Well, it isn't! The current travel system makes travel sloooooooooow. Let's say you want to go from system a to system b and you have 2 systems in between. Even with the best engines in this case travel time will be at least 5 turns. Why? Well let me explain the route your ship will take:\n\n1. Turn => Move from start point to jump point\n2. Turn => move to next system\n3. Turn => move to next jump point\n4. Turn => Move to next system\n5. Turn => Move to target location\n\nThis is only with two systems in between. The bigger your empire gets the more systems you have in between and even with the best engines it's possible to have 2-3 turns when traveling between two connected systems. The Stargates help a bit, but you have to consider where you place them because they are pretty expensive (5BC per turn/gate on hard).\n\nA much better implementation would have been if your ships have a certain distance they can travel each turn and it doesn't matter whether you enter a system or move between jump points.\n\nOther Stuff:\nPlanet leaders / ship captains are gone. Your ships do not gain any XP neither. So it doesn't matter how many battles your fleet does, the crews do not get better at their job. It's all narrowed down to technology. Whenever you get something new and shiny you should have enough credits available. Upgrading ships has been moved closer to civilization. All upgrades are instantanious and are just costing money.\n\nWhat else is there? Well GNN is annoying. The news themselves are giving you a bit of information around how you are doing, but holy **** the talking of the robots is awful. The voice over has to be redone for this or remove it. It's neither funny nor entertaining. It just makes my eyes roll whenever I hear it. I haven't seen anything from the Antarans or other ancient aliens yet. There was some hint to it in the GNN news, but it's probably not in the game yet if it is there at all.\n\nBtw. we now also have barbarians....I mean pirates in the game. They are just there to annoy you. They can have their own little pirate outposts that provide you with money/population upon destruction. Again it's very similar to Civilization which seems to be the overall problem this game has. It tries to be Civ in space.\n\nI just don't understand why it seems to be so difficult to take games like MoO or MoO2, look at what both games had and then build on it. Why reinvent the wheel when it was working fine 20 years ago? There is still time to improve aspects of this new MoO, but as it is now I can't recommend it. The EA phase 2 update hasn't changed my opinion one bit.","February 28","false","22.6"," 174 of 275 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","174","275","5","4"

No one needs to hear about the 4x mechanics and there are few surprises in the MOO reboot.\n\nBut a 4x game can be implemented in many different ways, so I'll try to explain what directions the game designers have gone on a couple of key-points\n\nI go on and on about this things, so here's a summery with scores on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest :)\n\nComplexity: 4 (Fairly simple)\nGraphics: 8 (beautiful and functional)\nSound: 7 (Quietly immersive)\nOriginality: 2 (Not nuch in the way of innovation)\n\nConclusion: if you're a fan of the 4x genre, and you like games to be simple enough that you don't have to read a 2000 page wiki before playing, then this might well be a game for you. If you're a fan of the MOO franchise and you can get past the fact that there's no turn-based combat, then you won't be dissapointed.\n\nIf you used to play MOO2 in hotseat mode with a friend and you're looking to relive those times you will however be disapointed. Hotseat not implemented :(\n\nIf you wanna check out some videos, I've recorded my first playthough here.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CRbn8LasCoE?list=PLMCa1UUnJ90XfhIWsnnrFBuiJh-LXxhuJ\n\nAnd then the wall of text...\n\nMaster of Orion is (at least in the Early Access version) a fairly simple 4x game. This is not neccesarily an inherently good or bad characteristic, as it depends on what kind on game experience you're after.\n\nWhen I say 'complex' I'm thinking about the number of mechanics, or choices that the player has to consider at game start, or thoughout the game. A complex 4x game offer lots of choices at game start, normally in terms of which side to play and certain start conditions, as well as numerous dicisions throughout the game than often are irreversible.\n\nOther factors include 'mini-game' mechanics such as tactical combat.\n\nMOO has plenty of mechanics, but they aren't particularly deep. For example, you can choose your race or create a custom race using a pointsystem, but the amount of diversity is fairly small and I found that I'm able to play the game in pretty much the same way regardless of my pick. I'd compare the race selection to that of Civ5, where your civilization give you a small advantage in a given field. An example of a complex 4x game would be Age of Wonders 3, where the choices of class, race and speciallities are much more important to the kind of game you can subsequently play.\n\nIt also has tactical combat (not turn based to the lament of many die-hard MOO fans), but the choices you make do not have a huge impact on the eventual outcome. To be fair, I think tactical combat is something that will receive a lot of attention as the game developes - I'll update this review, when that happens). The game DOES have tactical combat, and it is posible to enhance the outcomes of battles if only slightly, so this aspect is certainly more advanced than civ5 to make that comparision again, where combat is pseudo-strategic but it's nowhere near as important as it is in games that focus more heavily on the strategic aspects, like the HOMM series for example. On the other hand units in MOO who fight, do not gain XP (as they do in Civ5 and most other modern 4x games). This makes losses from combat a matter of economy only - not emotional to any great extent.\n\nThe Tech tree in MOO is very, very standard, and something we've seen a thousand times. A linear progression of techs from left to right with pre-requisite techs being needed to start research. The thing that made and makes MOO a little different is, that some techs are muturally exclusive, meaing you get to choose between two techs. This is great, but since you can obtain the 'other' tech later through diplomacy, the choice becomes a little irrellevant. I'd have preferred more choices that was FINAL... The tech-tree complexity is only present if you've never played 4x games before :)\n\nPlanet and millitary buildup is a function of the tech tree, and it is equally simple. Planet structures are unlocked by tech and usually improve either, resources, research, food, or currency either directly or inderectly. Other buildings improve morale  or planetary defences but there aren't THAT many structures in total, and although each building incur an upkeep cost, you'll want to build most builings in every colony. This makes the developement of colonies a somewhat trivial decision process, that you end up automating, either my muscle memory of allowing the AI to handle it. More complex games add dimensions to colony/city/castle developement by putting a cap on how many improvements of a given type you can maintain in your empire or implement some sort of diminishing return. in the 'central star system with multiple planetary colonies' structure that MOO uses, it would be nice to have some structures that improved a given thing (like research in the whole system).\n\nThe part of the game that offers the highest level of (potential) complexity is ship design. You can create your own version of a given ship-class (frigate, destroyer, cruiser etc.) up to some pretty ridiculous ship sizes. All very cool! This offers the promise of a mechanic, where a clever player might exploit weaknesses in an opposing player's ship design (too heavy on the missiles maybe?) to exploit and defeat. As of right not the ship design feature still feels a little incomplete and you can't review the designs of your oppsing players, even though you've met them in combat. That, in combination with the unfinished tacticat combat makes this a mechanic of great potential complexity. but not quite there just yet.\n\nMoving away from the gameplay I'll briefly say a little about the 'wrappings'. A little unfair maybe, for the game is drop dead gorgeous and the music and sound effecs have yet to annoy me.\n\nAll colonizing is preceeded by a cutscene showing your colonyship landing on the pristine planet, while all space combat shows the opposin fleets warping in. Very cool stuff, in you're into that kind of thing. I don't spend a lot of time reveiwing  this sort of thing in a 4x game as I usually end up skipping them quite quickly, but there's no denying that the game looks beautiful, and not just in the cutscenes.\n\nThere's a pretty good VO on your various tech advisors and good sound effects on the weaponsystems etc. No complaints there!\n\nFinally in terms of originality, I have to say that MOO bring very little to the party that we haven't seen before. This is a reboot of the MOO series and it seems like the developement of the game has been focused on NOT to repeat the mistakes of MOO3 (which I didn't play so I can't tell you if they succeeded). But it means that you're not gonna find a whole new take on the 4x genre here - you're gonna find a game that you can by, install, start and be playing in no time at all, with a very flat learning curve.","April 3","true","103.1"," 71 of 107 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","71","107","3","0"

Will update review as patches are released.\n\nPros:\nAs a long time fan of the series, this is a VERY welcome reboot of the series.\n\nI've played several short games to get a feel for the game, have an ongoing multiplayer game going with a friend around turn 250, and have completed a large 6 race game with the Psilons achieving every tech (was gaining 3000 tech a turn by the end), 24 colonies, 519 population, 646k credits, 1.3 million conquest, 1.14 million excellence, claimed Orion for my own, and after all the other races declared war on me I wiped them off the face of the galaxy by turn 448. Around turn 300 I was already insanely powerful (power through great technology) and could almost vote myself the supreme leader, but chose not to.\n\nIt feels a lot like MOO2 with a lot of nice new UI features like improved menus, empire management, game summary, etc. Below I'm going to say a lot of things to be aware of or cons to the game, but really the game has a lot going for it, namely it's a VERY good reboot of the game and while it's still missing a lot, it has placeholders to show it plans on implimenting everything we'd expect and then some.\n\nI kinda miss the old MOO2 theme music (listening to it right now while writing the reivew), but I like the new soundtrack as well. Graphics are what you're epxect out of a game these days. The game feels a lot like the things I love about MOO. There are a lot of cool newer features like improvements to notifications, but I wish they could add a little bit of customization to them. Also really like the space factories element to the game. Just learned a new feature, if you goto the summary screen you can litterly got back to any turn in the past. You can click on the timeline graph and go back to a previous turn which means the save game remembers EVERYTHING that happened in every turn.\n\n\nThings to be aware of with early access:\nA lot of systems are not yet or BARELY implimented. Mainly the space combat (just hit simulate because tactical is poop atm), spying, dimplomacy in general needs to be improved, racial traits, AI difficulties, starting tech levels, ship customization (it's there but missing a lot of it's expected depth), half of the planned races, and everyon's favorite: custom race. A lot of the tooltips in the game are not very clear what those things do or even if they are fully implimented right now. The tech tree is flushed out but the UI needs some polish.\n\nThere are various minor weird UI bugs including hangs and the occasional crash. Thankfully the game autosaves every turn. There are some pretty annoying bugs for example the game insists that Neutron Blaster is stronger than the Mass Driver).\n\nMultiplayer works, but can be a little weird when you are loading a previous multiplayer game. Also the invite friends feature doesn't work, your friends just need to join your game.\n\nThe voice acting is good, but sitll needs work, obviously that's finishing polish stuff for launch. A lot of times the text of what the voice acting is supposed to be saying doesn't match what is said likely only part of the script has been recorded / integrated or they want to limit the download for early access. Some of the characters you start to just hate how they talk to you (unless you're overwhelmingly powerful then they cower and lick your boots which actually is kinda awesome). Overall how the races react to you can largely be improved.\n\n\nCons:\nNo Elarians planned for launch. The Elarians smell like expansion fodder. No Gnolmans or Trilarians either, but no great loss there. Don't like that they are tying a "new" alternate human / pirate faction to the collectors edition but honestly, who cares since if you buy it now you're getting the "collectors edition" at like normal release price.\n\nIt's REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING ANNOYING when picking a race and trying to read the racial traits having to listen to the narrator.\n\nAlso I miss the old feature where if there was nothing notable happening (everything is queued up etc) then the turn auto passes to the next turn. I wish they would allow me to customize my auto build order.\n\nThere seems to be a lot less planets per solar system from what I remember from older MOO games. I wish there where more planets. Also I miss the inter-solar system colonization vs colonly ship. Maybe it's something that's less important since everyone is post warp. If they add in pre-warp age that becomes more important.\n\n\nSummary:\nI might be a fan boy of the series, but it seems pretty damn good for early access and I'm glad they did do early access so I can give my feedback. If you've apprehensive about the game, wait closer to launch. I know I will probably binge on the game for a while then dial back until patches come out and try out the new features.","February 29","true","80.3"," 123 of 196 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","123","196","3","0"

Do you want a full graphical & UI update for MoO2? Then leave it. Better yet: pretend it does not exist. Here are the main reasons:\n\nCombat:\nIt lacks turn-based combat, the arena is very small, the AI of your ships is horrible in the realtime one, the AI OFF button is bugged, and you can't always select single units, only "fleets" of ships.\n\nUnit design:\nNow you have fixed slots (e.g.: 4 weapons, 1 propulsion, 1 computer, 1 shield, 6 special...) you can fill up to the capacity of the ship. Again, this lessens the combinations you can come up with.\n\nResearch:\nInstead of completely separate research branches, MoO has a Civ-like tree. You can leave a few techs out, but not much. You can't specialize in one branch and then trade or steal the remainder. There are some techs that present you with a choice of a technology duo, but those are nowhere near the choices you could burden yourself with in MoO2 using the uncreative perk.\n\nAI:\nThey all appear utterly insane so far, with absolutely zero sense of reality. I've seen better sense of it from Civilization enemies at launch date.\n\nLeaders:\nCompletely missing functionality.\n\nSpace travel:\nSpace lanes and infinite fuel instead of fixed max distance before needing a refuel. I don't dislike this most of the time, but some might. It does make cutting off a segment of space harder and easier at the same time.\n\n...I could go on with smaller nuances.\n\nDevelopment:\nThe main problem is, the devs stated they will not be adding turn-based combat or rewamp the research. They will add custom races, espionage, but not much else that is missing now. They created a "more accessible" game, not a successor. One without much of a character.\n\nPlus side:\nThere are positive changes as well, for instance, I love that at the end of the game, you can reload the game from any given turn. There are voiced characters, although your advisors get annoying really, really fast. And the UI responds to the now-standardized way, although there are many, many shortcuts that are missing for a power gamer. And there is a catgirl with cleavage, if you're into that.\n\nConclusion\nSo if you are a fan of old Master of Orion and want at least that complexity, go to GoG.com, buy MoO2 again, and forget this ever existed. It's way cheaper and way better.\n\nIf you are new to the world of 4X space strategy games, this might be a good watered-down tutorial. Kinda like how American beers compare to European ones.","March 18","false","7.5"," 115 of 184 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","115","184","5","0"

I think Wargame is on a good way to create a appropriate follower. I'll personaly change it to thumbs up, if Wargame consider some very simple changements.\n\nI played the old Microprose Game Title and I was addicted.\nHere my Pros and Contras for a Game which is really nearby Master of Orion 2, but which is not able to beat the old Masterpiece:\n\n+ Interface looks nice and polished, the most menus were kept.\n+ Game looking beautiful now\n+ Basic Diplomacy (except of little changements) were kept. I was so lucky about that!!!\n+ You are still playing on a Galaxy map which looks familiar to the good old one.\n+ You'll have the oppurtunity to cutomize your race!! Thumbs up for this.\n+ You are still able to design your ship and Equip it with special systems and Weapons.\n+ The most of the buidlings are quit the same as in MOO2, except of some new buildings. I cannot really give a good feedback to them yet.\n+ All old races have been considered\n+ Early Access works without any crashes, MP wasnt tested yet.\n+ You'll have now the oppurtunity to upgrade your ships (Blueprint and ships which are at colonies) immediately after absolving the research project. Nice!\n+ You are having now several Victory conditions (similar to Civ Games). Score, Conquest or be eleceted at the council of the galaxy.\n+ GNN are great!\n\nNow the Cons:\n\n- Colony Management changed a bit, not much. I still prefer the Management of MOO2 and the handling, which was much better and easier in 1990!!!!\n- I really tried to like the new "tactictal" combat. Instead of the old MOO2 it's not turn based anymore. It's now real time strategy, which looks and feels a bit too simple. On the one hand you'll save more time during the combats, which is basicly good for MP sessions. And you'll notice your special systems and weapons from you designs. On the other hand, you feel a bit helpless. Because even if you gave an order, the ships are going to attack automaticly, all ship categories are gathered to a group, you cant select a single ship. Then, you are not able to create real tacticts like in MOO2. Where you maybe activate or deactivate weapons and systems, because you was waiting for the right moment to use them. So, I'm still not sure, the only thing I know that it hasn't satisified me. Good thing: It looks beautiful and for a "Wargame" there is a lot of action, nice feature is the action cam ;))\n- Ground combat = sucks! Completly unspectacular, uggly without any action or sth. Wargame....are you serious? Hope you're going to improve this one.\n- The baddest thing is, that every game you are going to start is limited to 500 turns. Yeah, you are right WTF???? Why you guys are going to set a limit for the game? PLEASE WARGAME JUST SET THIS ONE OPTIONAL!!! WE SHOULD HAVE THE DECISION!!!\n- Okay, it's early access at the moment, but the game felt a bit too easy and a bit more to fast than MOO2. I played the Bulrathi empire and I've been very rich (very quickly I have to say) and I haven't less technologies than the Psilons had. And, I just had 3 colonies the Psilons had 8!!! Everybody who played the old MOO2, knows that this would quite impossible then =). Even If I fought against them, we had the same technology. They usually should be very strong when they having 8 colonies. Old players will know what I mean.\n\nHowever, I like the game anyway. But, as long if the cons will be exsists, I cannot give it a thumb up. Wargame, well done for now, you are almost nearby finish a very good follower! Please don't ♥♥♥♥ one of the best Gameplays ever been created in history of PC-Games.\nHope that was helpful for all of ya out there in the stars =P.","February 26","false","16.8"," 259 of 437 people (59%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","59","259","437","15","18"

You still can't fight your battles in MP, which basically makes MP a snore. I still cannot endorse this game. I don't like the direction the game is going in, and I don't think it will be ready at launch. Will update again when they do something with it. Sigh.\n\nOriginal Review: As of this point in time, Early Access phase 3, I cannot recommend MoO. It's actually gotten worse since EA2, despite the new features, and there seem to be no patches inbetween EA phases to fix what's obviously broken. Furthermore, they seem to be ignoring player feedback entirely, and many bugs that crop up go unfixed. I am very disappointed in this game so far. For a much better 4X experience, I point you in the direction of the Sword of the Stars franchise, as well as towards Star Ruler 2.\n\nThis is an EA review.

But in the face of recent games like Endless Space and Star Drive 2 I don't see how this really contributes to the genre outside of "production values." There are significant aspects of the design and art direction that appear heavily cribbed from Stardrive 2 (which in turn cribbed from MOO2).\n\nI do find the game enjoyable, but considering the overall design decisions I'd recommend Star Drive 2 or Endless Space over this for a modern space strategy game.\n\nThere's a few interesting ideas (fortifying starlanes), but these are harmed by many of the streamlining issues.\n\nFor instance not having fleet range like in many other space games turns it into "whack-a-mole" with the AI (and even worse with a human player).\n\nThe biggest faults which I do not see being handled with the planned features are tied to the end game. The effort to avoid steamrolling at the end game are very heavy handed with enforced turn limits and a 1 ship limit to Doomstars. These heavy handed approaches to ending the game at a set point don't work well when the AI and overall game mechanics lead to scattered empires that drag out conquest victories. (which is "fixed" by the hard turn limit)\n\nTactical combat is another area that could use some refinement. Although there are ship firing arcs the AI tends to circle and there's no fine control for focus fire on individual ships, the AI targets an entire group. Stardrive 2's combat seems to provide more benefit for not using autoresolve or the cinematic camera.\n\nSome of these issues might be resolved with early access feedback. But some of these issues are simply fundamental flaws with the way that game mechanics have been streamlined.\n\nSo to make it clear, the game is fun, the game is pretty. I'm honestly not a huge fan of the cartoony art style and voice overs of this and Stardrive and prefer Amplitude's more grounded approach, but that is a matter of taste and not quality.\n\nBut overall, for a modern 4x game I'd recommend Endless Space over this title.","February 26","false","12.9"," 173 of 289 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","173","289","7","5"

Many lesser issues which I will not spend time on in this post. Two major issues hurt the game however. Number 1 is the star lanes which were a terrible idea in MOO 3 and should never have been copied to this new itteration. MOO 1 and 2 were about free travel and exploration in space. The forced star lanes here dumb down the overall strategy and promote huge fleets building up at choke points. Developers claim star lanes are the more popular choice (doubt it), but at least make an option for no star lanes in game set up. The second major fault is tactical comabat (the complete lack of it). Its supposed to be a hybrid of RTS (real time strategy) but is more like RTW (real time witness). You can pause the action at any time in battle to "take control" but besides steering different groups of ships and changing their formation, there is nothing to do. You can chose tactical mode and watch the battle happen with nice graphics, or you can skip that and just get the results with a simulate option. In "tactical" you have no control over individual ships (groupings only), no control over weapons fire, and cannot tell damaged ships to pull back or retreat from the battle. There is nothing meaningful to do. The developers said turn based combat was too slow so they dropped it for real time, but at least turn based combat was meaningful and really impacted game play. These real time battles seem decided almost entirely by math rather than tactics and are neither engaging or memorable.\nAll told the game does capture much of the same atmosphere of MOO 1 and 2 and it has development potential. Wait and see how they address the problems before buying though. They haven't earned our money yet.","March 6","false","57.4"," 103 of 167 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","103","167","0","3"

Research - Research needs to be improved. There is no real choices and since researching is so fast you will just end up researching almost everything. Instead of all four initial branches merging into one, why not make it so that there are multiple branches at the end as well? Currently, researching just feels very shallow since you are going to have everything anyway. Also, majority of the research topics did not feel important at all. Why to improve your ground troops since you don't really need them in the first place?\n\n2. Updating ships - There are some weird issues like others have also stated. E.g. You have just researched new technology X which gives you a new weapon. However, when you go to upgrade your ships, you notice that the default weapon actually has better DPS. Sooooo... what was the point of researching? Also, give us more information about the weapons. What is the range, what it the accuracy of the weapon, what is the reloading time, is there any modifiers etc.? Information is power, so to speak.\n\n3. Combat - Like others have already said, there is no real effect how you control your troops. I dont really care if it is real-time or turn-based but I need to feel that I actually have an effect to the result of the battle. This needs to be improved a lot.\n\n4. Diplomacy - Needs some serious tweaking, I just bought my way to victory in 2nd playthrough (with only 3000 gold!).\n\n5. Starlanes - some inconsistencies. E.g. you have a direct route between A and B and it takes 7 turns. Then you have alternative route between A-C-B, which takes less time even if you explore the galaxies!! Also, that bottlenecking is not so fun after a while so I would recommend to add some kind of technology which allows player to travel directly between stars later in the game. (E.g. like in the Eclipse board game you have the wormhole generator)\n\nIt also has it pros, it feels already quite polished product and the first 10 hours are very enjoyable. After that, the lack of depth hits you in the face which is something which should not happen with 4X games. Currently, I cannot recommend the game with this price but again, it is early access and I think it will be improved a lot.","March 1","false","34.6"," 103 of 173 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","103","173","4","0"

Instead, it is a re-envisioning of the first Master of Orion and since I have played from the beginning when I was a kid, I find this to be quite exceptional that it is already in the Early Access stage. Yes, there are currently some bumps that are being worked through, but overall it has the same excitement as when I used to play Master of Orion I or II. As for Star-Lanes, that's a Catch 22 as to whether or not you like it, but you know what? In this game it works. And it works well. To be able to use strategy to block off your enemies and force them into a choke-point in order to push your troops through when you are ready, it is really quite thrilling. The ship designs are extremely exciting to look at and watch in the cinematic view during combat or colonization, and I like the designs/voices of the races. The population view even seems to feel slightly Fallout-4'ish with the Cartoony look, and that is even MORE awesome.

After playing the remake, I can't help but feel extremely disappointed. Looking down the discussions list, I really do question what people VALUE out of this genre.\n\nI do have a big problem with the lack of tactical combat. I think it's a damn shame. However, I will avoid talking about the lack of turn based combat, you can find about a thousand topics about that fairly easilly. But what about everything else that seems to be so poorly thought out and designed, or just plain doesn't follow what established Master of Orion as a great 4x IP?\n\nTo start: Star Lanes.\nWhy? There was already a very logical method to travel in MoO. Do you have X amount of fuel? Great, you can move Y amount of parsecs. If you can't get to a system you want to get to, you either make a priority out of fuel research, or build an outpost, which is also good for your ship count. This made exploration a much more active affair, forcing you to change your build order/priorities based on the system that was generated. Star Lanes are boring for exploration. Just mindlessly click the next thing on the path you've taken. Fuel also brings me to the next thing:\n\nResearch.\nSimplified into (or copy/pasted from) Civilization. I like civ, but not as a 4x space game, which should take research very seriously. Research was half of what made MoO interesting. You COULD NOT know everything, unless you were creative, which was an ungodly expensive race trait (which got even more expensive after a patch). To know as much as you could, you had to trade. Or steal. Or invade. The "branched" techs in this remake are shallow, and boil down to extremely superficial choices of numbers (get more industry, or more research. Woohoo). In MoO 1 and 2, the choice was very difficult. Like mentioned above, you needed fuel. New fuel was often one of three researches, and the others in the same pool could be very useful, but if you wanted to fly farther, you had to make sacrifices. I don't feel like any of the remake's branched techs make you sacrifice much of anything. However, one in particular caught my eye, and that brings me to my next point:\n\nDiplomacy\nWhy, oh why, is the ability to make a trade or research treaty stuck behind a tech choice? The other race, upon viewing my ship, called me up on my space phone and told me that they wanted to lay their eggs in my stomach. Could I not figure out how to say the word "trade" in their language? The method by which you do diplomacy also seems to be lifted directly from Civ, from the interface to the presentation of the alien race, lounging in their background of choice and talking at you as you decide how best to screw them over. What about the audience screen from MoO2? Or the holoconference from MoO3 (one of the few decent things from MoO3...)?\n\nCosmetics\nGone are the days of HR Giger inspired artwork. I understand why, it's hard to have art that detailed in a full 3D environment, but much of the game looks to be constructed of clay and coated in KBToys brand plastics. I won't say much on how the game looks, as that is as deep into opinion as I care to go, but I will say that for a PC exclusive game, I expect it to look much better.\n\n\nAll in all, I really think MoOremake is still in desperate need of work.

You can't even designate primary target to be fired upon while your ships are executing your maneuvering commands.\n2) Ship constuctor has arbitrary limits on the amount of special system and weapon types you can install.\n3) For some reason, systems are divided into separate planets and warppoints, and it takes a whole turn to travel from one point to another within a solar system. Not only does that considerably slow down travel, but it also leads to annoying games of whack-a-mole when enemy ships spread out and jump between them.\n\nThere are also numerous "minor" problems like: no espionage system, no custom races, terrible tooltips that don't show difference in damage between basic beam weapons and "heavy mount" ones (if there is any ATM), etc. But there's no point in fixing them until main issues are adressed.","February 27","false","10.3"," 173 of 306 people (57%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","57","173","306","7","2"

The package itself is a decent value purchase. There is a lot of work that needs to be done, more than I would expect for an initial early access on a major brand featuring the voice of Luke Skywalker.\n\nI'm worried that hype and brand is stronger than the content to drive sales. So far, I feel very skeptical while wishing a concerted effort to improve this game because I want it to be great. The AI is worst part right now as there is no challenge. The tech tree is far too linear and uninspired to be enjoyable. I feel like I'm being given the illusion of choice. It just doesn't feel tactical. A second, third, fourth, and fifth, playthrough and I can't seem to will myself to do any research choices differently. The advisors you are forced to interact with in game make you feel like a young child with the exception of the humans. I wasn't expecting that from a complex strategy game, and if I wanted a cartoonish casual experience I'd go play candy crush.\n\nOverall, there's potential, but there has to be some real changes in direction to encourage replay value, challenge, and choice. The graphics are much improved over previous titles, yet the interface isn't as good and often annoying. Think pop-ups and try not to puke.

It's interesting and fun for awhile.\n\nBut, sadly, it is caught in the 4x epidemic. Like all these games, this also suffers from the "4x Virus": mid-game it turns into a micromanagement department and becomes masterfully boring with no real difficulty, as you can already see what the outcome will be, and the rest of the game is just mopping up. The feeling of exploration and discovery, the unexpected events, the eagerness to advance your tech and build your empire fades away. The mid- to end-game really needs an overhaul if I'm going to waste any more time on these 4x games. Something more than an obsessive compulsive drive to finish what you started has to happen somewhere.\n\nI usually quit at that point and start a new game.

No options for passive choices like production boost, income boost or anything (you have the ability to rid your planet from pollution, but once your planet is clean again, forces you to build). The game doesnt let you end your turn as long as you have an idle planet. This is a pretty big deal because every building and ship has maintenance cost, so constantly building them can make it pretty hard to save up money. UPDATE: Later in the game you can actually get a passive income boost on planets but you have to complete 2 research options in order to do that which is just plain stupid.\n\n-Diplomacy is not finished. (or if it is, its flawed to the core) When ever the computer proposes something to you, you either accept it, or not, you cant send a counter offer. Now this might not sound much, BUT every proposal you refuse hurts their little feelings and potentially makes them hostile towards you, and when they offer like a hundred something credits(when you have like 1000) for a pretty expensive tech you have over and over, well lets just say you better forget the whole inner peace in this galaxy.\n\n-Unlike previous titles of the series, the battles are in real time, which is kinda bad, but thankfull you can pause and issue orders to your ships.\n\n-Now, the ship customization is actually pretty good, its a bit buggy right now, since you cant remove core systems you dont want to have on a ship like shields once they are on. (when you select create new ship, the game automatically gives a sample ship fitted to the max, and yes usually including shields too) So its pretty hard to create glass cannon like ships at the moment.\n\n-One major intented option I encounterd and basically where I dropped the game, is that when you delete a ship design, and you already have ships built with that design, those ships disappear(get scrapped) from the map....yup....I loved it when my attacking fleet just disappeared when it was one jump away from the enemy capital planet.\n\n-One funny fact, is that there is an option to turn the whole GNN news cast thing off. Now this made me think why did they create it like that in the first place? But thank god for that option because those droids get really annoying really fast.\n\n-I tried to play a multiplayer game, but when the room fileld with people,  just closed right after that, now I'm not sure it that was the host or not, but seemed pretty stupid to get a room full of people and just close the whole thing.\n\n-Now I saw a lot of people compare it to endless space, well, I can see where they are coming from, but I personally prefer the style of this game over ESs. Its not as deep(not nearly as complicated) but still enough to have enough to keep you playing. Also ESs space combat is just a huge no to me.\n\nOk I'm done not gonna write a novel, but I still managed to list most of the major problems with the game that to me, just makes it unplayable for the time being. Now its still in early access. If they fix all the things I mentioned above, the game can be pretty fun. The voice actors are indeed top notch. Alan Tudyk is pretty funny, makes the psilons really fun to play. Human and the kitty advisors are less stellar, but still ok, but omg Dwight Schultz gets annoying pretty fast, which makes me pretty sad because I really like him, also the dinos assistant is I think probably even more annoying.","February 29","false","11.1"," 133 of 237 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","133","237","3","10"

It's a lot simpler than the old MoO games, and it mixes in a lot of light-hearted humor.\n\nThe only major problem I have with this sequel is the "Tactical Combat" section, which is... well, just not worthwhile using: simulated combat will almost always give better outcomes and there is almost no tactics you can employ, the classic MoO2 turn based combat system was infinitely better.\n\nI feel as though they should instead take a page out of Fractal Softworks' "Starsector", where you can maneuver ships to spread damage across different areas of the ship in a semi-realtime fashion.\n\nAnother major flaw in the game design comes in the form of the fixed warp points, something which other games do, but in this implementation feels very flawed. In a few of the games I have played on medium sized galaxies I have been confined to an area of approximately 8 stars, with one enemy race. Unable to get out because of the unstable warps blocking off the remaining 75% of the galaxy.\n\nThis situation never would have happened in the classic MoO games which all inter-stellar travel was purely based on distance. If you had a ship with infinite distance you could warp from the top-right to the bottom-left star system.","February 27","true","29.0"," 122 of 217 people (56%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","56","122","217","8","3"

They need events, more objects, special effects, etc. (UPDATE: They added Nebulas which stop shields but I dont personally think thats enough to spice battles up)\n\nShip designs are bland. You have your standards such as shields, direct fire weapons, missiles, etc. but no variety in those and this comes down also to the tech tree and the fact that you seem to only unlock better versions of the same effect items. Theres no shields that are more effective against ballistic weapons etc..\n\nThe game doesnt support SLI.\n\nYou can't subjugate empires.\n\nPirates respawn in the same system several turns after being completely wiped out there.\n\nShip weapons fire in massive volleys which makes it look like duisgusting clumps of glow / smoke effects and makes combat shorter, ships dying instantly to volleys. On the same point there are no area effect point defense systems to counter a large missile barrage.\n\nRaces are too similar. They have some minor traits bonuses but nothing to have them stand apart from each other such as unique technology, unique mechanics such as being synthetic and not requiring food (they still require food) or anything realy to seperate them aside from their 6 ships looking different.\n\nYou can't select individual ships. If you have a large fleet the game will start forming squads using your ships which is handy but you cant micro manage them in that state which is another reason the combat is lacking.\n\nYou can't set the range settings in the design of the ship.\n\nThere is no political penalty for destroying planets or repeatedly waging war on none aggressive enemies.\n\nEvery other empire could be afraid of you and have a low rating of you but you wont see them teaming up to destroy you out of free or retaliation which weakens deplomacy.\n\nAI can become rediculously stubborn in diplomacy, refusing to concede to your demands when you offer them peace while they have one planet left and no fleets.\n\nDiplomacy lacks depth. I touch on specific aspects of it in this review but in general theres not many ways to use it to manipulate an empire.\n\nThere is no prompt to attack invaders (only a notice about nearby enemy fleets that comes up much to regularly to pay attention to) and theres also no prompt to act with a unit that has completed its movement during the post turn movement phase (eg you send a fleet to an enemy planet but it doesnt prompt you to attack with them when they get there you get a notice that they have nothing to do the turn after).\n\nTheres no allied victory or allied vision.\n\nYou can't see the details of an enemy or allied planet so you dont know whats built there or what you've destroyed during a bombardment etc.. (UPDATE: This has changed with the introduction of Spies who let you reveal this information but the information should be visible if you have a fleet in orbit let alone a blockade)\n\nThe research tree is very narrow it makes it hard to get to technology you want when you need to get more and more branches completed the higher up you go, which isnt that high either.\n\nThe Dauntless Guidance System re-targets enemies based off the ships position not the missiles (It makes missiles reaquire targets if their target is destroyed). Also on the topic of the DGS the missiles turn 180 degrees instantly and seem to have unlimited range after being fired initially.\n\nTanks don't seem to work against marine invasions (I could be mistaken but there is so little information that the game gives you about invasions its hard to tell).\n\nTreaties must be shared. You cannot bribe an empire into declaring war on a 3rd party or request access to their territory while keeping your own secure.\n\nThe map does not give you much information on what kind of ships are where and whats going on.\n\nHealth bars use green pips inside black borders that do not shrink as you zoom out they just start to overlap so you end up with unreadable health bars when zoomed out far enough.\n\nAnimations and effects are broken or missing in certain areas such as holograms on the deplomacy screen resetting to their generic pose and the game lacks a lot of animations like for monsters or ship destruction, events in the galaxy like colonizing a planet.\n\nShips are weak with the highest size ships dying to a few volleys from a moderate group of much smaller enemy ships in fights that use high tech weapons.\n\nWeapons are unballanced which makes a lot of them redundant as well as contributing to other issues.\n\nThere is a distinct lack of information that the game gives you. A huge number of tooltips are either missing or have placeholder text and the UI in certain situations just doesnt show you whats going on such as two enemy fleets fighting, you wont see any info untill one of them is completely destroyed.\n\nThe maps are too small. Eight civilizations on a map so small that you have other civ's homeworlds two systems away.\n\nThe Meklars research page (specifically the initial one with the advisor) has a huge graphical demand in comparison with the other areas of the game.\n\nEquipment for ships needs to be sorted. (UPDATE: Its sorted now but not very well)\n\nYou can't customize certain things such as event frequency or number of pirates / monsters, etc..\n\nYou're able to destroy a planet as soon as you arrive at it, so you dont even need to destroy the defending fleet or space station etc..\n\nShip AI is not only sub-par but broken, with destroyers flying right past stations without correcting their facing for front firing weapons.\nHopefully they iron out the game before release because its the beginnings of a great space 4X.","March 26","false","43.7"," 116 of 206 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","116","206","5","7"

Keep in mind it's still in Early Access, so it's not something I would recommend right away, unless you are a space 4X fan like myself. What I see is a solid product, especially for its price. Production value is of highest standard in space 4X, but I can't say it's of XCOM2 level (which has left all competitors behind).\n\nWhat's good and new:\n\n- overall feel is good, it's interesting to explore and exterminate and there's clearly 'just one more turn' effect\n\n- controls and UI are overall good and easily understandable and the game seems to be well optimized\n\n- systems have planets now and navigating inside a system takes extra turn, warp points become choke points and allow interesting space control strategies\n\n- bases (something like in GalCiv) in choke points and asteroids, which is fresh and keeps you wanting to research them\n\n- research has interesting choices\n\n\nNot cool but bearable:\n\n- lacks polish in some elements, for instance, icons and pictograms on research targets look like placeholders: it may look like unimportant detail, but in reality it adds a lot to anticipation of discovery\n\n- customizing your race is not implemented yet: and that was very important part of MOO2\n\n- some things are dumbed down and while some of these are good, like instant and mass upgrades of blueprints and ships in your planets, some are questionable: like fuel tanks / outreach concept is removed\n\n- tactical battles are of the kind you'd rather always skip, designing your own ships is not very helpful as well\n\n\nTL;DR Not likely to be as memorable as MOO2 or something of ratings higher than 8/10.

I've seen enough.\n\nYes, I know it's early access. Yes, I know that not everything is implemented, but I've seen enough of the bones to know that this isn't the MOO2 of my youth, polished by two decades worth of technology advances.

It all feels hauntingly similar to the dead, passengery feel of MOO3, complete with "star lanes" and a general lack of any ability to micromanage.\n\nPerhaps, at this stage of my life, I'm going to have to begin to accept that game developers just aren't pitching their product at me anymore.\n\nOf course, this generation of "professional reviewers" will love it.","February 27","false","5.3"," 254 of 465 people (55%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","55","254","465","25","33"

These are the ten races of Master of Orion I, and include the Bird-like Alkari, the Bear-warrior Bulrathi, boring old Humanity, the Cat-like Mrrshan, the subterranean lizard Sakkra, and the scientific Psilon-- with the Ant-like Klackon, Rocky Silicoid, Mechanical Meklar and secretous Darloks planned for a later release. Missing are the Trilarians, Elerians, and Gnolam.\n\neach of the races are drastically different from their originals, and overly diluted in characteristics. Rather than a race that is tuned in to it's heritage, each one must play more as a generalist instead of  focusing on a single strength or two.\n\nThe Alkari, for example, were originally highly effective in combat in space, and masters of propulsion-- a function of their evolutionary history with flight. Now, they have a 25% defensive bonus to certain combat scenarios, the end.\n\nthe Sakkra were the masters of overwhelming populations, able to reach twice as high populations thanks to their ability to live both on and below a planet's surface. Now? They grow a little bit faster.\n\nResearch\nAn important mechanic of the MoO universe has always been research. New technologies, and important research decisions: Do you want to use the new Fusion technology to upgrade you ship bombs, engines, or beam weapons? This sort of decision made decisions critical, and brought diplomacy to a monumental forefront in the game. It wasn't just about which tech you chose, it was about which tech you let your opponents have. The Psilon used to have a special racial characteristic: While they sucked at most things due to their frail nature, their brilliant minds allowed them to capture all these options instead of just one-- and use these technologies to surpass their enemies. But the tech-tree has been redesigned such that technological decisions are few and far between, and the Psilon's unique advantage has been replaced with a flat bonus to research.\n\nThe Galaxy\nIn the original MoO games, travel took time and fuel. If a star was close enough, you could reach it. If not, you did not go there. Later in the game, you could travel from any star directly to any other star, if fuel allowed. You expanded your reach by building colonies and outposts, or by researching new fuel technologies. This entire system has been scrapped in favor of a starlane system, with each star acting as a node-- and if you can navigate there, you can go anywhere in the galaxy from level one. The advantages of this system are, presumably, greater strategy-- creating choke points around the galaxy to protect your territory from opponents. Military bases can be built to "blockade" ends of starlanes, for example, from enemy travel. But it destroys the open feeling of space present in MoO2, and is completely not worth it.\n\nThe current version of the game includes pirate raiders who will occaisionally attack, forcing you to keep a few ships handy to quickly dispense them as an annoyance-- and a few stationary space monsters like a Giant Squid, Eel, or the Guardian of Orion-- usually guarding a particularly nice planet. There are a few scripted events and anomalies, but not nearly enough to keep the game interesting just yet.\n\nFinal Verdict\nThis game shows promise of being true to the Master of Orion Spirit, but I am concerned that the scope will not go deep enough to make it worthy of the name. MoO fans from the original series will find the game fun for a few hours in it's current state, but the lack of complexity and depth really prevent this game from being the huge hit it may become if the developers revise the systems they've created to make it more like the original. The controls also are unintuitive for now, space combat is boring and unmeaningful, and ground combat is non-existent. Voice acting shows promise, but has way too much repetition. "I used to be an adventurer like you, but then I took an arrow to the knee" kind of repetition, only 1000 times worse. But if the developers do what they should, this game definitely belongs on any 4X fan's wishlist. But as is, it feels too much like Civilization and not enough like Masters of Orion.\n\nWill continue to update throughout the game's development, and if the game ever reaches a fun state for non-MoO fans, I'll give it a thumbs up.","March 1","false","9.0"," 57 of 99 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","57","99","0","0"

Rigid starlanes, a very limited tech tree, no functional differences between races and overall a system that feels like a dumbed down endless space with different graphics.  And for the starlanes, no matter how good your engine is your ship depletes its moves upon arriving at a star system, and whenever moving within a star system.  Since the starlanes themselves arent that long this means if you have a good engine halfway through the tech tree or an engine at the very end of it if there are 4 systems between where you are and where you want to go it will take 8 turns to get there, your ships will never get any faster.","March 16","false","18.8"," 41 of 70 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","41","70","0","0"

Everything modification wise is low to the ground from race traits, to weapons, buildings, everything. Power level is just simply toned down overall, and simplified. Simplified does NOT mean less strategic options, in fact stacking modifiers becomes very important in this, and every single turn almost you're making critical choices as a result. Colony ships don't take 70 turns at the start where you have to sit there clicking next for 30 minutes for the game to just get going.... by turn 50 you're going to feel like you're knee deep in a game, and ordering a pizza for the long haul. Your research is absolutely critical because the board state changes so fast. Likewise movement has changed entirely, for the better. The addition of military outposts is major, and you can use warp lanes as choke points. Loving it. The new changes to troop transports? Epic. Next colony button? Genius.\n\nAlso, the first time you get a battleship you're going to feel pretty epic :) Mine just wiped out a whole fleet by itself.\n\nSo here's the very long list of stuff the game kinda needs and in no way has missing these things stopped my friend and I from playing:\n- Leaders, even with very minor attributes, will make a nice difference. I'm sure this is planned, but both my friend and I were missing that.\n- More hover over information, notably there is no way to access a stats screen for my ships beyond going into the blueprints area. If I wanted to assess my fleet it would be a pain right now.\n- Tactical combat in multiplayer as an option. I'm sure this is coming too, but can't hurt to mention.\n- More meaningful ability to understand the various scores breakdown and army strength. My friend seemed to have much higher army values, but holy cow was my army performing very well. We're not sure on any level why my excellence score is higher than his.\n- Slow down the GNN reports, they're over really quick and this is the kind of game you can really sit back with. Just keep options open!\n- When streaming it is really hard to avoid the race selection being a problem because the narration happens every time you click a new race. Maybe it could be a toggle or a button or something.\nWill alter this list as things change or as I remember the minor issues which came up.","February 27","true","20.9"," 62 of 110 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","62","110","0","0"

But! The gameplay is nice and smooth, and you can micromanage or not, depending on your mood. The espionage feature is not turned on yet, and the AI diplomacy didn't really seem very complicated which could be good or bad. If in single player with more complicated features turned on/ added, I could see a good reason to make the game unlimited turns but at the present it's fairly easy. I like that I could mine asteroids or gas giants before I had the option of transforming them into planets. The combat is not turn based and although I have run through the game, I have yet to figure out exactly how much I can manage the combat. It's in real time so clicking on your ships and changing thier focus of attack seems to be as complex as it gets. You can upgrade/ design your own ships personally or you can allow the computer to auto upgrade your designs. I like this reboot on pretty much everything but the combat---I've always liked the turn based type space battles in some 4x games and being able to choose which weapons to fire.

I mean everything from the design of ships and planets to the little touches like the cutscenes are all first class and really make you feel like you're "boldly going where no man has gone before." Now technically speaking, this game is incredibly stable and buttery smooth. I've seen very few early access games that are so smooth and have so few bugs right from jump. Achievements and other in-game annoucements via a couple newsreading robots which I think is a cute way of delivering the player useful information in a relatively immersive fashion.

MOO 3 was a train wreck that had good intensions but just was a horrible implementation. Seems this version is slowly going down the MOO 3 path with a glossy version of MOO 2 graphics slapped on top.   Graphics are good for a 4x game, sounds ok I guess but I do not play these games for a good soundtrack. In fact I play with them muted as it is about tactics and what you are going to do next turn not how nice the alien leader sounds. They spent way too much time and money worrying about that when the gameplay is lackluster.\n\nTo start star lanes really make it so easy and unplayable. Basically defend 2 planets and you are good to go. There are definite choke points which make those systems critical.\n\nCombat, ah combat. Pre beta people that are younger wanted real time combat. True MOO fans that are older and enjoy the tactical nature of turn based obviously didn't. Well they went real time, but not really. You just build a fleet, and click fight. Trying to do any sort of maneuvers or tactical layout really doesn't matter. You can try as I did, but you will find out that in the end is useless. The combat system is a glorified combat viewer of the simulation. Once you realize that just skip combat. But wait, you want to control your ships, this system and game doesn't really allow for it to make a difference or change the outcome much at all. So sad, they could have done a really nice turn based or even a put in your moves and both sides move and fire same time type of setup and would have worked well for this game. As it stands this game "combat" just doesn't stand out from anything else in the 4x world of games and thus they missed their chance.\n\nThe races seem to be missing their big differences that existed in MOO and MOO2. I have played most and they all seem the same. You research the same, build the same, build same type of fleets, etc.  I would have preferred if each race really did well on one type of planet type, or you could take pros and cons like in MOO 2 where you can customize each race. I cannot nail it down but they all seem very generic with a different skin.\n\nThe ship builder looks nice and works well but again is really useless as the whole combat system really doesn't work. Since real time combat just isn't meant for this type of game the upgrades to weapons with fire arcs and such just won’t see the light of day when you can just cram on more weapons in same space without having to worry about such mundane details which made MOO 2 much better.\n\nThey need more areas of the map that affect game play like nebula, super large asteroid fields, etc that affect areas of the map differently. Adding those would add a lot of depth to the map and gameplay.\n\nAs mentioned on the discussion board AI is just awful. As much as I hear people say, "just play multiplayer and your problem is solved", have you tried to play and FINISH a 4x multiplayer game?  I have maybe finished 5 in my lifetime. Most games with 4 people, 1 will drop early, 1 will get run over for various reasons and drop out, thus leaving 2 people who then you hope have the time to play out the game over the next few days/weeks. But invariably 1 of the 2 will drop out making the game you vs. the AI in the end. So the single player game has to be somewhat resilient to keep me engaged between multiplayer matches. This game doesn't even come close, period. As AI programming is a bit of a hobby for me, this game makes me want to cry how someone is paid to create an AI and this is what they came up with.\n\nIf the game wasn't ready for beta, then delay, and delay again. Any sort of alpha test would have found or shown most of these issues.  AND IF the development team would listen to the outside alpha testers the game could be fixed. My guess is another development studio thought they knew best and missed the boat on this one. The best games I have played in the past many years are games that change and adapt to its core player base. Because if they are somewhat happy, they spread the word, others come and like the game and lo and behold you have a hit. This game seems to rest on the past IP glory and hope to make millions on people like me that paid and hoped for more but got a lot less.\n\nI would at this time NOT recommend this game unless combat, star lanes and AI are fixed which may take a more in depth rewrite than this publisher has time/money.\n\nI will change/update review after some major patches/final release comes out and things have changed, hopefully. :)\n\n","March 22","false","44.1"," 59 of 106 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","59","106","3","0"

The AI is lacking in a number of places (it has improved but has a long way to go) and the resource system is far to simple for a 4X style game.  I fear that this game will be pushed to a finished product far to early knowing Wargamings practices especially seeing how they pushed World of Warships out far before it was ready.

At best, this game is a MOO2 remake with some simplistic GalCiv2 elements.  MOO suffers from some severe gameplay imbalances:  1) random events can wreck your entire empire within a few turns, leaving you open and exposed to attack by AI; 2) Space Pirates can respawn on the same planet that you just nuked, one turn later; 3) AI will ask for/demand peace, then instantly attack the very next turn.  Lastly, like MOO2, the AI is predictable and a tech rush will always win the long game.\n\nWith the upcoming release of Stellaris at a $40US price tag, MOO is in deep deep trouble since it can not even compete with Paradox's newest 4x *grand* space strategy due out May 9.  This game is not worth the $50US for early access, and even when complete, will be little more than a modern remake of MOO2.

We have simulate (auto-battle) if you dont have time to do every combat, I Really hope they will change it into turn based. because the current option is CINEMATIC and SIMULATION, seriously i see 0 reason for tactical, because it have notihng to do with TACTICS. Positioning is tactics, zoning is tactics, turtling is also tactics  but the depth of itit was butchered by Real Time approach. its like turning Street Fighter 2d fighting style into Tekken.\n\nOther than that i have nothing to say because this an EA title, but thing that must be keep in check are\n- No Espionage (to be implemented)\n- Sometimes AI do some questionable action\n- Managing Economy is somewhat too easy, CIV V is 20 times harder\n- Theres is virtually 0 punishment for Aggresive Colonization other than constat bugging of pollution and/or pirates\n- Ship design deletion will also "delete" the actual ship, i think the should change the shup name to <type> obsolete instead of delete the ship.\n- Race leader is somewhat become MMO character that kept begging you to give them money CIV-style, please do something more interesting with diplomacy\n- Random Event like Supernova is interesting, hope you can do more random thing like that maybe like some event that will disconnect jump between stars\n- Make things that buildable via Planet factory to be upgradeable (like the military outpost), because they have very little use","March 1","false","11.1"," 38 of 68 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","38","68","0","0"

While the developers have done a decent job of recreating the economic system of MOO2, the combat system is shockingly uninteresting.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sairemik/recommended/298050/","sairemik","Remik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sairemik/","92 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have to agree with most of the reviews.  For me, there are several failings:\n\n1)  Tech Tree.  It's basic.  There's no differentiation.  You plough through basically the same way regardless of race, and ultimately you don't really "feel" like any of it is making a difference.  You're simply clicking buttons to progress along the tree.  Sure, you're getting better ship firepower, but that's about it.\n\n2)  Race differentialtion.  There isn't any.  Yes, there's some pluses/minuses at the beginning but there's no feel for one race versus another.  Ships look a bit different, but as far as technologies go; you all have the same stuff.  The devs could learn a lot from Sins of s Solar Empire on this one.\n\n3)  Opponent AI.  It's terrible.  I managed to get everyone friendly and then ally with me.  Yes, all races.  You would think the game would be over since we're all in one big alliance.  No.  Then suddenly, one of them leaves the alliance and goes straight to hostile.  Not one other race keeps their word on the alliance.  They all leave, and all declare war on me the very next turn.  So don't bother with diplomacy.\n\n4)  Specialization.  It would be nice to have the ability for planets to be more specialized.  But you can basically build all developments on all planets.  Since you can terraform and even convert gas giants to planets laster in the game, there's almost no point in aggessive expansion.  All your planets can be turned quite habitable.  So, grab enough planets so you have have a solid defensive fleet...and sit there.  Race through the tech tree on the econmic advancements and get enough money to buy the market and win the econmic victory.  Every other victory takes much longer, and there's frankly no point.  Wars happen because of resource shortages.  Since you're not fighting over resources, then what?  They need a complete rethink and take notes from Civ 5.  Not everyone gets iron, oil, or aluminum.  Either trade for it, of fight for it.  That creates politics.  Since no planet (except for Orion itself) has any unique value, then I could care less fighting over any of it.\n\n5)  Pirates.  Outright attotrious.  They randomly spawn on any uninhabitable world and start creating ships.  Then they randomly attack anything they see, even if they are completely outmatched.  Again, Sins of a Solar Empire had a better pirate concept.  They were almost a faction of their own, and could be manipulated to attack your enemies.  I feel like they tried to go the Civ 5 route, but that doesn't make any sense in space.\n\nThis game is just way to dumbed down.  No one is going to play this game for 8 hours for a single playthrough for this dull of a game.\n","June 2","false","29.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Doesn't matter that it's a rather large 500, it's there and I hate turn limits, feels like board game I'd play with my 9 year old "ok, we'll play 10 turns then back to homework". WHY is there a turn limit??? Just kills the whole feeling of.. something, I dunno.\n\n2) Small number of systems on "Large" which in itself is ok I guess, but unfortunately each system only hold 1 or 2 planets. The game feels teeny tiny already.\n\n3) The Pathways to each system. I honestly don't get why game designers would opt for this route (no pun intended). It works in only 1 game series that I know of, "Sins of a Solar Empire" and that's because that game is so freaking stressful and fast that you need choke points from paths otherwise you'd go insane. But in a turn based open space game, it's a flaw to me.\n\nAnd yes, people will argue that some of the earlier games we loved used paths to systems, still, today with current tech and the state of gaming and computer hardware an all that, it feels weak, like a crutch that the designers couldn't figure out how to overcome.\n\n4) Lack of rotating view (view angle, rotating clockwise/counterclockwise). Make it feels smallish again and rather outdated. If they at least let us alter the view a touch to get a sense on the galaxy from any direction or height level. A bit nitpicky, but I guess it irrites me a bit.\n\nPros:\n\n1) Runs smooth at max detail (there isn't much detail so this is to be expected)\n\n2) UI and gameplay is clean and jumps from location to location easily upon orders being needed in certain places.\n\n\nSummary: Feels like a highly scaled back Sins of Solar Empire remake but with turns and without the 3D view and all the cool 3D fleets and effects and much less planetary building options.\n\nIf you've never play another 4x space game before this will probably make you happy, but for someone who has played everything from MOO1 to Sins, to Stardrive1,2 to Distant Worlds universe, and a dozen or more recent titles that I can't even think of this second.\n\nAny game where I basically lose interest under and hour, doesn't bode well for me. I'm willing to stick it out until release, but I think the kicker and what set me off on writing this review is that dumb turn limit thing staring at me. Ugh.\n\nI hate turn limits in 4X games.","February 28","false","12.3"," 68 of 127 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","68","127","2","0"

I think it has captured some of the spirit of both MOO and MOO2.  Although it is early access, its playable and fun against the computer opponents, although they can be somewhat predictable.  Settle a colony near a computer opponent, when they ask you not too, and in my experience they almost always attack soon.\n\nThis is my opinion after playing a few EA2 games, and 2 EA3 games, one  I'm about 500 turns into.\n\nPros:\nVoiceovers - well done and I appreciate the celebrity choices to do the voice overs.\nShip graphics - I like the ship graphics.  Each alien race has a unique style which I like.  Watching combat between the ships in tactical combat is fun, especially when you have a Titan launch a bunch of Plasma torpedos at a Star Base or hit a ship with 10 Graviton beams at once, or watch point defense phasors wipe out a group of missiles coming towards your Battleship.  :)\nColony cutscenes - Well done and fun to watch, and the cutscene includes the colony ship that matches the ship style of the Alien race you are playing.\nGalaxy map and overview - I think its well done and I can usually follow what's going on and where everything is moving over a section of the galaxy.\nSounds and music - I like most of what has been done so far.\nColony view screen - shows most of the information I need to know and I like they way the build queue is setup.\nAlien Diplomacy screen - I think this is well done and I like the different backgrounds and animations for each leader.\nTech Tree - A lot of tech to research and most of the weapons from MOO/MOO2 seem to be in the tree.  Takes a while to research up to Doom Stars, stellar converters, mauler, sub-space teleport, etc, so it seems like the game is reasonably well balanced in this regard.\nIts addictive and fun - If I start a gaming session, its difficult to stop without playing at least a couple hours.\n\nCons:\nSome Bugs - The game is still early access and has some bugs.  Its very playable, but it has crashed or locked up on me a few times.  The new ship designer in EA3 caused one crash, and I've had the game lock up going into tactical combat on 2 occasions.\nAdvisor Voiceover repetition - For the research the advisor animations and voiceovers are fun for a bit, but since they pick from a limited set of dialog, it does start to get old in a long game.  Although I will call out that each alien's advisors say a different set of dialog and they can be a bit humorous at times.\nCombat - I have tried to take control of combat from the AI, but its not real intuitive how to control all the ships systems.  I did figure out there was a min-max range slider control and another control for ship speed.   That was EA2, I haven't figured out how to control combat in EA3.\nColony auto-build - the auto build doesn't always work that great.  It always seems to build a marine barracks first on a new planet, and then goes to missile base, starbase, etc.  It seems very defense/military biased even if you have the colony set on "balanced".  This can be a problem if the new planet needs food or production as a higher priority at the moment.\nBombing doesn't seem to work much better or differently after you upgrade to fusion bombs or anti-matter.  I was playing an EA3 game last night and had to bomb colonies 5 or more times with 2 cruisers and several destroyers and sometimes only a couple buildings or one population would get knocked out.\nAntarans aren't around as far as I can tell, and there is only the guardian at Orion and some space monsters.  I hated the Antarans in MOO2, but they did make the game more interesting and it was fun once you had enough ships and tech to beat them.  It might be nice to have Antarans attack as an game "option".\nLimited AI Opponents - I have played against up to 5 computer opponents, but the game won't support more than 5 as far as I can figure out.","April 25","true","69.0"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","0"

With that caveat out of the way, the game so far is great.\n\nAs someone who played a great deal of both MoO and MoO2, I had great expectations for this game, and so far it does not disappoint.  Obviously there's still a lot to go--spying, for instance, doesn't exist yet, and at least six more races are in development--but it's fairly faithful to the original games.  It is 'closer' to the MoO2 gameplay, which is no tragedy; while I did greatly enjoy the simplified colony management of the original game and the massive fleets of stacked ships, the gameplay in MoO2 is more 'interesting' being more hands-on and everything.\n\nInterestingly, and quite pleasing to me, the character models were more based on the original MoO races rather than the (sometimes greatly changed) MoO2 races.  The Psilons are like greys with 4 arms, the Mrrrshan is a cat-lady, and the Alkari are birds, not pterydactyls.  Nice shout-out to the original.\n\nThe voice-acting, particularly for your chosen advisor, can get repetitive, but it's a nice touch.  The narrator (Michael Dorn, Mister Work himself) rarely gets old, although the GNN is my least favorite VA collective (they can still be amusing, tho)\n\nAll-in-all, it's hard to recommend an unfinished game for $50, but if you are a die-hard MoO fan it might be worth it to leap into it now.  Otherwise, if you're interested, you might want to wait for the finished project or at least for it to be further along before picking it up; but in the latter case, you should keep an eye on it, because it is already looking to be as successful a go-back title as XCOM.","April 1","true","70.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Yes.  Even though it is not a finished product, everything seems to run very well.  The game is not hard to understand if you are a MOO veteran and doesn't seem like it would be too difficult for a newcomer.\n\nIs it a replacement for MOO?  Ummm....not quite.  It is by far better than MOO3, but that game was one of the worst games ever made.  It is not a replacement for MOO2.  If you currently own that game, then there isn't really any reason why you should want to switch to this game.  While this game is better graphically and has a great UI (in my opinion), it is a little bit of a step back from MOO2.  I don't mind the battles in this game, but MOO2 offers more in its turn based tactical combat.  This game does not feature leaders which I thought was a great and fun mechanic in MOO2.  I can't think of a reason why they wouldn't add leaders.  4X games are meant to be complex and I don't think that removing common features is the best route to take when doing a revisioning of a game.\n\nThe GNN cutscenes need to be sped up.  They are a nice little addition, but after a few views I prefer the way MOO2 portrayed them.  I now skip any GNN video that pops up.\n\nI still have yet to experience enough diplomacy to see how smart the AI is.  I do like the interface and the voice acting with interacting with the AI.  I like the interface when interacting with Planets.\n\nOverall, it does feel like a well polished game, but as I said, there are some features that were removed which make the game feel like a little step back when comaparing it to MOO2.  I don't think that the creators necessarily have to create and updated copy of MOO2, but this is an MOO game and going the 'less' route is just a bad idea.\n\nSo, in short, I don't recommend this if you own and play MOO2.  I do recommend it if you are a newcomer to 4X games and would prefer a more updated interface and better graphics.  The game just doesn't offer anything new.  There are plenty of other games out there that offer the same gameplay, but with more depth.  Give it a try if you have the money and no other 4X games under your belt.  Plus, you do get all of the MOO games with it.  JUST STAY AWAY FROM MOO3!!!!","March 5","false","6.3"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","23","41","0","0"

So there is that.\n\nHowever, im not going to spend the time writing a long review. I will however state that i suggest you go somewhere else for your fix of 4x. So why am i recommending that? It's rather simple. While the game is pretty, and alot of effort has been spent on making the game beautiful, this has been a zero sum game. The effort spent in making this game into a beautiful game has not been spent on making this a complex game. There is no tactical combat, ship design is a thing of the past, diplomacy doesn't function very well, and the galaxies are relatively small. Planet management is pretty great though. So if you're looking at building simplistic spaceships by clicking on predetermined modules, then building said space ships and spending 19 turns moving it across starlanes to attack an AI that's completely useless then this game is for you.

I think so.\n\nI would like to start with a little history. I have been a long time fan of the series. Master of Orion II is still my all time favorite game, and it's a large part of why I didn't like MOO3. I tell you this to set up exactly what I expect from Master of Orion. I was looking for a fun turn based 4X game (as a good 4X game is turn based, IMO), and I feel that Master of Orion: Conquer the Stars supplies that.\n\nThe AI races are a bit on the cartoonish side, but I feel that this is a nod to the original MOO. There is a lot of micro-management, and this is a nod to MOO2. The population cells and star lanes? That's all MOO3. What I am saying here, is that just about every design decision can be traced back in some way to a previous game in the series.\n\nThat said, the game isn't finished. The  AI  and  DIPLOMACY , especially, are rough, but then again these are the most dynamic of the features. If I had to guess, I would say that they're saving AI refiniements until last. You want to include all of your toys before you finalize how the AI will decide how to play with them. Right now, they're likely making sure that the components work, before getting them to work exactly how they want them to.\n\nESPIONAGE , certainly, needs more work. I keep stealing technology that I've stolen before (how many different Cloning Centers does one need?), but they'll iron all that out, I'm sure. Likewise,  COMBAT  still has a way to go, but again, this is entirely AI based. The AI is very basic right now, but I'm sure it will be improved.\n\nRESEARCH  needs work, but I'll be honest and say I don't know what it needs. A greater flexibility, maybe.  CUSTOM RACES  need more options, but it's still a new feature, give it time.\n\nCOLONY MANAGEMENT  is the biggest flaw right now. It's not broken by any means, but it could use work. There is no way to fine tune what your citizens prioritize without perosnally managing your populations. I'd like to see the ability to use sliders to control how my new citizens get assigned, and to save those presets as a custom set. But it's not a major negative at this point in time.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : if you're the type of person who likes beta projects, or can deal with a game in a yet-to-be-finished state, and you like 4X games (especially the MOO series), pick this up. If you are the type of person who thinks a turn based game is too slow, or you think an early-access game should be 100% playable and finished and just needing some polish, or you want a game you can beat in a few days and move on... this is not your game. I have individual games that last a dozen or more hours, but I like a game I can return to again and again. To this day I still open up MOO2 now and then... except I haven't felt the need since getting this.","May 13","true","174.2"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

So with 2-3 ships you wipe out the enemy spacefleet of 20-30 small ships in one battle and thats it for them.\nI played MOO and MOO2 just recently and there if someone declares war, on the next turn they turn up with a spacefleet on your doorstep.\n\n\nAlso it does not really seam to make a difference if you specialize your planets as over time you can build everything you have on every planet. And the planet overview is terrible there need to be a list what you have built and not only a planet you have to scroll around and search to find your installations, even if you can build all some buildings make it easier to build others so it would be nice to see that, because after you own 10-20 planets you just loose the overview what you are building.\nSame with the research tree, apart from the few times when you have to choose what to build after you complete a research there is no problem researching everything there is.\n\nDiplomacy is hardly implemented right now, and really is not needed as you can pound the AI into the ground as soon as you get cruisers, and the AI wont attack you anyway. Same for the councilmeetings, most of the time all the parties withhold their votes, and even if there is an alliance you are so strong that you have more votes then the 2 together. Not sure if it is intended or a bug, but the AI seems to lie on a few times I had 2 or 3 parties who vowed to vote for me and when the meeting came they either withheld or voted for the other candidate.\n\nThe worst of all are the GNN news updates, the robot does not only look annoying he also sounds like a C64 doing some text to voice. That is too bad as some of the ticker news are quite funny (if not relevant to the game itself).\n\nA bright spot is that the original MOO are included if you do not have them already.\n\nIf there were a neutral vote I would give it for now.\nBut considering the price and the dumbed down AI I will give it a thumbs down for now.\n","February 29","false","22.6"," 74 of 140 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","74","140","0","0"

I will happily recommend the game if it continues in that way. END OF EDIT\n\nThe game is definitely a good looking remake of Master of Orion 2. The graphics and sound are excellent. The details are very nice. The game is already very polished at the moment.\n\nThe issues of the current version as I see them are\n\n1. Star lanes\nSystems are connected by star lanes and you must travel through them between systems (unless you have built jump gates). In my first game I got coined in by AI blocking exactly 2 spots in the universe with a starbase. I could not go further unless I attacked him or sorted it out diplomacally accepting his ridiculous price. Well... it's supposed to be the 3D space modeled as 2D space...and it has been made a 1D space in fact. Why? The defense strategy is just to defend a few frontier points which does not require much of strategy really...\n\n2. System travel points\nIn a system, besides the travel points that are one end of a star lane, the ships can stay at each planet... when travelling from a system, they need to go to the travel points on the "edge" of the system...and then continue by the connected star lane...So basically in a system, they do not travel at full speed...why? That is one more feature of the freeness of space movement that is somehow diminished in the game...\n\n3. Battles\nYou can simulate a battle, that's fine. You can enter a 3D battle and ...well, watch it. There are some controls but you cannot really influence the battle much, or, have a feeling that you actually do something. I need to compare this to MoO2 now since there you saw how your ship designs perform. You could control every aspect of the battle and thus took care when designing ships. At this moment, the battle in Master of Orion (4) is just as bad as in MoO3...\n\n4. Minor issues\nThere are some minor issues that will hopefully get fixed. For instance, the UI of the ship design part needs a bit of work: once you have many components, the large icons are not very clear. There is a feature of MoO2 that has been copied: all troop transports get eaten when you invade a planet: I should be able to choose how many marines I want to invade the planet and after the battle how many of them should stay boarded to ships. (The ships of dead or garissoned marines will still be eaten .... )\n\nOnce more, I know the game is in early access and might change. And hopefully it will change and be the best MoO2 successor.","March 4","false","26.9"," 33 of 61 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","33","61","0","0"

There is no variance in the tech trees available from one race to the next; ship design is a simple numbers game, and combat is an uninspired affair.\n\nAs it stands, there is no replay value, and based on the way the game currently presents, it is highly unlikely that the game will develop any replay value before it is stamped as a "finished product".\n\nI recognize that this is an early access project, but at this time, the mechanics of the game are so simplistic that I doubt it will gain any weight between now and launch.\n\nUnless you're looking for a very simple 4X experience, one designed for kids, look elsewhere; the $49.99 price point is certainly not justified.","March 3","false","69.3"," 34 of 63 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","34","63","0","0"

The graphics are really stunning for a 4X strategy game and it feels very well optimized for a game still in early access.  The voice acting is really on point and the people they got to play the voice roles are very noticable for anyone that really loved sci-fi TV shows from the 80's though the early 2000's.  From where it started and to where it is now really has me feeling this is going to turn into a really outstanding game once its completely polished, tuned, and most importantly completed.  So below when I say some thing still need some work or are kind of bad right now take it with a grain of salt.  They have been working and fixing many of these things as early access as continued.  I sespect that to continue without a doubt.  But I am just tossing my opinion on those things as they are at this point and in my opinion (of course).\n\nMy warning to rose tinted glasses people:\nThe only warning I give to people about this game is that if you go into it expecting it to be MoO2 with a new engine you likely are going to be disappointed.  Certainly if you plan to kick, scream, and complain constatly about it not being other wise.  This game will not be that.  It will most certainly be its own stand alone title with differences and changes.\n\nHere is my quick breakdown as of NOW (early access - so subject to change)\nWhats good:\n-graphics\n-sounds\n-voice acting\n-"feel" of space and space battles\n-"direction" the alpha is heading feels good as well.\n-listening to fans that maintain reasonable character on the offical forums (respond often as well!)\n\nWhat needs some work still:\n-tech tree (feels dry so far, but getting better with patches!)\n-AI response and reactions (its very much in the angry teenager stage but has shown improvement)\n-diplomacy (its not in the game yet, so I put it here -- but for early access it makes a hole noticable in game)\n\nThe bad:\n-over time repeatitive voice calls can annoy you (bird tech guy anyone?).

Frankly, what made MoO2 a great game, was never the challenge and balance of the game.  The game was always super easy when you made a custom race.  What made MoO2 fun was how the elments of the game were presented.  Having all the choices to make a custom race was great (even though there were a select few optimal traits).  It was just fun to learn the game mechanics and create a glorious space empire.  Sure, MoO2 had things that we not so fun, like the fact that the Gaurdians were so tough that colonizing that sweet sweet planet known as Orion was almost pointless.  (unfortunately the reboot still makes that mistake),  but this game has almost all the building blocks that made MoO2 so much fun and I expect to see a great product by the time they get done with it.\n\nTo the developers I would recommend two things:  Please implement the governors and fleet captains from MoO2!  And don't overbalance the single player game too much, just implement a scoring system and "balance" that (giving bonuses to score for harder racial picks)\n\nI think the game was a little pricey at $50 (because it's not finished), but the $30 final price tag is definitely on target!  Pick it up early if you're a fan of the classic games and to have that MoO2 itch scratched right away :)","March 18","true","41.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I feel however that the management is much more streamlined and the technogy tree that is present also gives new players the chance to learn what plans they should make. The originals required a lot of reading to really get good. Here there will me a lot of hover messages that will explain not only what something does but why it is at that current value. What do you have +9 to food on a world with 1 farmer? Hover over it. Want to know why that race hates your guts? Hover over the colored bar that shows their attitude about you. Spying is not quite out yet, but I cant wait to see how that will be improved.

Tactical battles have had some work and certainly look better. I did not notice missiles hitting the seemingly omnipresent asteroids on the tactical map. The initial pirates are no longer a joke. The basic mechanics and style of tactical combat seem unchanged though.\n\nHowever, the game is still incredibly bland, visually and in gameplay. Check the simplistic ship models out which you can't even zoom in on. The gameplay is still a simplistic rush to build constructor ships and block off choke points while expanding your holdings.\n\nHonestly, this MOO reboot looks and plays like a tablet game. Doesn't it look like it?\n\nI'm so glad I bought Stellaris which gives me a visually gorgeous and immersive game with deep mechanics that give a feeling of running an interstellar empire. Try zooming in on the ship models in that game and watch in awe as the turrets track their targets and fire in visually glorious style during tactical combat. Stellaris needs some development work too and that is underway but it outclasses MOO by a long shot in my opinion.\n**********\nThis game is incredibly bland. It would need serious development and additional features to make it an engaging experience.\n\nThe game is a very simplistic remaking of the original MOO2 with some of the good parts of that earlier game currently missing.\n\nThere are few random events and creatures, and pirates are not a threat in any way as they are very easily defeated. These features are bland and almost irrelevant to your gameplay.\n\nThe models are cartoony and simplistic. I find the map overly bright too but its part of that cartoony style.\n\nWhile the leader models and voice acting are great, I find some of the advisors to jar with the tone set by the leader. E.g. the Psilon leader has a calm gravitas in his voice acting yet the advisor is a snivelling Golem-like creature.\n\nYet any character of a race is made irrelevant by their diplomacy AI which is simplistic and hostile to any player offerings. The language is quite hostile too with the AI rudely cutting off contact despite decent deals being offered.\n\nTactical combat needs so much work. I personally don't like asteroids on every tactical battle map. There is so much scope for varied maps. Currently, the AI will simply fire through asteroids causing shots to miss. The control and information available on the tactical map is so limited. It's a poor gameplay experience and it needs a lot of development work.\n\nColonisation and planet management are both very simplistic. They're simply copying the mechanics of Master of Orion 2. While it was a great game back in the day, the computer gaming world has moved on. More depth could've been achieved while maintaining the core atmosphere of a MOO game.\n\nEspionage is also a strange set of mechanics. You can't enter systems blocked off by military stations to find enemy colonies and without that location information, your spies have nothing to do except counter espionage on your worlds. But spies keep being recruited. Once all your colonies have an agent, the rest will just sit on Hold on your homeworld. So boring. Surely spies should be helping you find out information about other empires, aided by trade and other treaties as they infiltrate other empires?","May 5","false","23.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It has all the required features of a 4x space game: tech tree unlocks ship and planet upgrades that advance the economy and the military,  citizen mangement system, diplomatic interface that allows trading of resources and tech.\n\nMy gripe is that there's nothing new. Nothing to make this game any more interesting than any other entry in the 4x field. It looks nice, there's good voice acting, there's cute news reports, but it doesn't feel like a new game, just a reskin of the old ones.  It's fine, and if you're nostalgic for MoO, you'll enjoy it.  I'm hoping that a lot more fundamental features get added to the game before release.  Especially in the tactical side of combat, where it's pretty much 'watch the visualization' or 'don't watch the visualization'.\n\nThe one notable exception to the lack of innovation is that with some tech upgrades you have to choose which benefit you get instead of unlocking all the benefits of that tech level.

This is because that the fans and community of such a game will immediately set the bar ridiculously high for the developer.  I guarantee that the developer will never, ever meet those ridiculous expectations, but they can try really hard.\n\nThat said - I think this game is a perfect example of the above.\n\nThe Good --\nGraphics are good\nShip Scaling - Titans and Doomstars are actually Big, same goes for Space Monsters and the Guardian.\nI like the that the Races actually play up to their strengths and weaknesses.\nRaces are also fairly diverse in cultures.\nTactical Fleet Combat - Ok people like to bash this, but hear me out.  I actually like the fact that you need to balance big ships and small ships, and cannot just roflestomp everything with the biggest, baddest ships in the game.  You need to have your small ships take out the enemy small ships and soften up the big targets so your big ships can open up.\nStar Lanes (Really) - Ok, another favorite for folks to bash - not so with me.  So, basically I like the idea of the Star Lanes because it adds a tactical element to Stellar Navigation which you can use to your advantage, or be used against you if you aren't careful, such as dropping an Advances Military Outpost right in a major thoroughfare.  Star Navigation actually matters with this element, and is more than just how fast you can go from system to system.\nThe UI Interface is much more smooth than previous iterations of the game  and streamlined.\nNot a bad start to an Early Access Game - a good foundation has been built, even if it has to be developed more.\nThe Bad --\nTech Trees are not as developed as they could be.  (Why do I go from Class I Shield to a Class III, whatever happened to Class II?)\nDiplomacy is a joke.  The AI basically just takes advantage of you and doesn't do any give and take - just take take take, which also makes the "Diplomatic Victory" condition basically a joke.\nMinor Civilizations - Good in concept, but not playing well with the AI - all they do is plow through them and destroy them to get to your civilization.\nAscension Victory is waaaaaay too easy even for the most basic AI to do.  Basically unless you floor your Research, or are a complete warmonger, you will automatically lose every single game as long as you have this victory condition active.\nShip Design is good, but not robust enough.  I liked the flexibility of MoO2 on this one.  Give us more options.\nWould like to see more diverse ship designs within a race - 2 variants of hull design is a bit limiting.\nTactical Combat has asteroids and nebula, but they are small and easy to avoid, or sparse.\nGive me more Stars!  Even the Huge Galaxy is a bit on the small size.\nIn Conclusion, I believe that this is actually a good game, but an incomplete one.  You'd think it was early access or something. :)  I believe that honestly, people are a little too hard on this game because development is trying to continue the legacy of a well-loved and famous franchise, and even taking their name.  Give them a chance folks!\n\nI do agree however, that it's a bit overpriced for what you get right now.  However, I think that they have built a very good foundation with this game and hope they do more with it, and listen to their community.\n\nHopefully you find this useful, it's my first review ever, so I hope I made it a good one.\n\nSee you later, keep on gaming!","May 25","true","194.0"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","1"

To share some of the issues, I was playing Psilons and my neighbors were humans, I had completed the tech tree and holds 445 votes, enough to vote myself in to finish the game, they were number two and had 76 votes, their best ship was a crusier, I am fielding doom star, titan, battleships...etc, so what do they do? Hey Psilon, give us this system or else, I said...hell no, so they declare war!!  Really?\n\nSo why do I have 445 votes and am so much more advance compare to them?   Well, cause they wont expand.  There were 3 computer players left , human holds 5 systems, and the other two has 2 systems each...  We were playing on default mode, circular galaxy, so there were literally 30+ systems that were vacant, but they never bother to expand.  I was holding on to about 10 systems, the galaxy is a big place,  but if they wont expand and wont develop new tech, probably slow development due to not expanding in the first place, the only way I can see a player losing is to do exactly the same, and just send scout ships to map the universe and never expand beyond the first world.\n\nI know it is Early Access, but at this point I would say the game isn't really playable, at least not in a war game sense of playable.  I am not saying hey just make it impossible and auto spawn fleets for AI and ignore command points like Moo1 does, but tuning the AI a few notches just so that a NORMAL game would feel normal.\n\nAs it stands today, this is not something worthy to be call MOO, more like a dumb down version of Galatic Civilzation meets Ascendancy.","March 1","false","33.0"," 54 of 103 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","54","103","0","0"

It was like meeting back up with an old friend.  The map, ship creation, research, and overall feel is all there.  However there is a few things I wouldn't mind seeing:\n\n1.)   I would love to have an option to enabled turn based combat, even tho the tatical combat is nice with live action, I still feel your more in a rail cart ride then controlling it at a deep level like Master of Orion II.  However as I got near the end of my play through I started getting used to it but a 3rd option for FULL turn base would be nice\n\n2.)  I'm not sure if it just because of early access but I would like to be able to turn some of my weapons off while in tactical mode.  This would add a nice level of demension for when you take control of your ship.  Many times I didn't want to use a weapon and wanted to hold it off till I was in a more tatical situation but was unable to disable the weapons.  Hopefully they will add this prior to release\n\n3.)  Some of the effects on some of the weapons I wouldn't mind seeing enhanced along with the sounds being improved.  The death ray for instance I didn't even know my ship was shooting them until I zoomed in.  The same goes for the steller converter and some of the missels.  You should be able to tell the weapons clearly apart from each other while being a little more zoomed out on the battle field.  Also the sounds should give some indication as to what is being fired to help assist with this.\n\n4.)  I would like to be able to drill into my ships settings after they are built without having to dive into the ship design.  There was a few times with tech being updated so frequently I wasn't sure if something got updated or not on a current ship.  Maybe there is a way to tell and I just didn't find it in the GUI but it would be nice if you could see the load outs of current ships on the map.\n\n5.)   More Skins on the ship design, I know its early access so this is probably coming\n\n6.)  Would be nice if there was some other mechanic other then your allies getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off when you won't give them a tech that is 3 jumps up the tech tree from where they are sitting.\n\n7.)  Being able to tell what tech level your opponents are at in the diplomatic screen would be nice as well, just a general score or something.  This could even be locked behind a tech but would be nice to know.  The new network thing tells you every now and then but its not that frequent.\n\n\nAside from these small gripes its the best Master of Orion since Master of Orion II.  It will really bring home some good memories and some good times.  Looking forward to retail launch!\n\nConslusion (8/10) would recommend to friends, with a good possibliity some of these small things could get ironed out prior to release.\n\n\n\n\n","February 25","true","35.9"," 36 of 68 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","36","68","2","0"

While fans of the MoO series will easily be able to adapt, there are a number of changes that have been implemented (such as star lanes) that impact the gameplay by making it more similar to some modern space 4X games. Whether or not this is a Good Thing (TM) probably depends upon how old you are.\n\nIn its still unfinished state, most major features are implemented. Some features need some TLC: customizing star ship designs isn't as fun or friendly as it could be, switching between screens make an annoying sound, finding and selecting what to build in the selection menu is something of a chore, and pollution isn't the threat that it should be. I haven't experienced and thus don't review all races or spying in this review.\n\nI'd like to see pollution scale in severity to the planet type. Gaia worlds should be very sensitive to high levels of pollution and should provide a more clear benefit. There is little clarity as to what the planet "specials" do (Dark Quartz = ?) or why you want them and you don't get new tech for exploring or colonizing Artifacts planets. Tech research times are also much too rapid, you will find it difficult to keep your fleet up with your pace of technological development. Several of the techs have poor descriptions. I expect much of this to be cleaned up as the game moves towards production.\n\nTactical combat is no longer turn based and is now real time (also similar to other modern space 4X games). You can now control the speed ships move at and control the rate of time. I would personally prefer to see a return (or option for) turn based tactical combat. Battles also don't last very long, taking some of the fun out of them. The planet screen needs some more work; I don't like the rather "cartoonish" icons for workers/researchers/farmers.\n\nGood: Return to classic gameplay, modernized interface. Nothing like the soul crushing nightmare that was MoO 3. Less micromanagement and more fun overall.\nBad: Combat isn't as fun as it used to be, some adoptions of "modern" 4X games add questionable value to the game. Turn-based tactical combat was fun.\nUgly: The end game on large maps gets laggy and crashes more often. A "failed to create new game" bug causes the game to crash every 50 or so turns for me.","March 22","true","44.9"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","17","31","2","0"

This is a personal preference that some players may strongly object to.  I played both the original MOO and MOO2 and loved them both and find this version as fun as the originals.\n\nThere are other gameplay tuning aspects that anyone could make about the game in its current Early Release state.  These include number of playable races, diversity of the tech tree, quality of the AI, etc.  I would fully expect these to improve as the release date approaches.  Nonetheless, I am thoroughly enjoying the game across multiple replays even in its current state.","March 2","true","70.1"," 42 of 80 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","42","80","0","0"

Doomed to be just another of a number of uncountable Master of Orion 2 clones, this game offers nothing that Galciv 2 or even Stardrive hasn't done better already.  Putting this game out in early access is the same mistake Sword of the Stars 2 made years ago. It's so poorly optimized that you won't be able to enjoy the excellent visuals even with a beastly rig. Crashes are common and the interface, while intuitive, has basic difficulties with important aspects like saving your game.\n\nStay away from this for at least another year or two. They might save it with updates, but expect to pay through the nose for DLC. Attaching the old games to this one is just a slap in the face, when they could have just been offered seperately like Firaxis did with the older X-Com games.","March 9","false","10.4"," 27 of 51 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","27","51","3","0"

Even though there is still much work to be done on the game I love starting a fresh campaign and seeing how it turns out. I've completed serveral of the victory types now and it's got so much potential if they keep the work up on the project. My only negative on this game is that theres no one aspect I look at and think this is 100% finished. Diplomacy for example it seems solid and it's a hell of a lot better than recent Civ games. But still feels like its unifinished. Currently I beleive its impossible to offer counter deals to other races when they offer you a deal but they can counter yours? Either I'm blind and missed how you edit deals or thats missing. Combat only seems like its worth simulating as taking control myself didnt really feel like it was worth the time. Now I sound down on this game but actually I'm in love with it. I just keep wanting to play more but I'm also holding myself back a little cause I want to really dive in when its fully finished.

I have around 15 hours played on my first game, not because things took forever or the game was long but because I enjoy being able to have oversized galaxies and being able to watch TV or pet my cat or whatever while I am in the midst of a game. I can honestly say I was suprised that I found so few disappointments, and I believe that when this game is finished it will live up to the legacy of MoO.\n\nPros-\nExcellent audio and visuals.\nReal Time combat & Squads provide a fix for the old combat failures.\nGame feels like the old ones, but is very different at the same time. In a good way.\n\nCons-\nCombat combat combat. This is still a work in progress on the developer side.\nAI is pathetically weak.\nDiplomacy feels useless.\nShip design is confusing. Ship upgrade feature is horrendous.\nRandom events are lacking.\nAntarens? Plot? Orion system discovery?\nAll the races are the same. Custom races are weak.\nSpying - not implemented yet.\n\n\nOverall, it looks like this will be a well-rounded title but won't be the best it can unless the developers listen to input from early access players (with previous MoO experience.)\n\n\nAudio\n- I love the voice acting and the music is wonderful.\n- Add looping background music or more tracks\n- Add an option to disable the voices. I love Alan Tudyk but have you ever heard the same thing a thousand times? It's cool that you have known actors doing voices, but please for the love of my sanity add the option to turn them off.\n- Combat - I think I heard some lasers. Can we have different audio files for different weapons please? That would significantly add to customizeability and replayability. It gets old hearing the same weapon audio a few thousand times. Engines and specials could have their own audio too.\n\nVisuals\n- Everything looks fancy.\n- Then you see the same buildings on the same planets and all of a sudden you've got 30+ gaia planets with the same exact layout.  This is not important, but would be nice.\n- Ships - SHIP DESIGN IS HORRIBLE. PLEASE add many many many more ship designs. I love Psilons but why do I have flying saucers with purple paint or crop circles? That's ridiculous and is an immense turn-off. Have at least four designs for each ship or each race. Then add two designs for each ship into the research tree and allow access to them from every race. Add more options for customization, since the visuals are so nice everywhere else. If I'm going to get 3D real\ntime battles, I sure as ♥♥♥♥ want more than two ship designs to look at. Especially if I have a long range ship and a short range ship that look the same.\n- Seriously, everything else looks so cool. More constellations or nebulas or special things like that would be cool in the backgrounds.\n\nUI\n- If you've played MoO2 and other 4x space-strategy games, you're familiar with this UI.\n- Ship Design UI, Colony UI - Where the hell are the details? I've played so much MoO2 I knew what everything was but a new player won't have any idea. Descriptions don't provide actual details of what equipment/weapons/buildings do, which is extremely important for ships and helpful for colonies.\n- Combat UI - THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. That being said, I could figure out how to adjust speed of ships (which is very nice for protecting frigates from obliteration while my battleships cruise along to absorb all the damage.) I can not understand however, what the engagement range circles are for and how they work. And why can't I manually create squads? I want to set my frigates to escort my battleship, not zoom off to die. (Why build them if they're going to die you ask? They provide useful things like a battle scanner or warp dissipator instead of loading up bigger ships with those types of modules.) Also, having squads only exist if the same ship version is there is quite aggrivating. Why are my frigate 4 and my frigate 5 in squads by themselves instead of together? Combat needs attention, which I know the\ndevs are working on.\n- Ship Upgrade UI - WHY THE HELL WOULD I WANT THE DESIGN AUTO-UPGRADE TO CHANGE WEAPONS AND\nLOADOUTS!?!?!?!? WTF. It doesn't use sense or logic to upgrade loadouts, instead of screws everything over\nand uses whatever terrible default loadouts the devs created. I like that you tried, but you did horrible. I have had to manually upgrade ship designs just to change the engine without having to rebuild the entire design. Design auto-upgrades when new techs are aquired needs to be looked at and fixed.\n\nCombat\n- The AI thinks "run in and shoot" is intelligent. As such, creating specialized roles or a diverse fleet is useless if you don't manually fight every battle. A cruiser with nothing but missiles and torpedoes should not be rushing off to the front lines. Battleships with displacement devices should actually use them instead of lumbering along while everyone else dies in agony in the midst of the fray.\n- Pew pew, shoot the asteroids! Ohnoes, they shot the asteroid I ran into three times! Pathing AI could be more intelligent.\n- I can't say much more until I play more and pay close attention to battles. Combat is a work in progress for hopefully the next patch.\n- Bombing planets takes forever. Why would I invade and take over if my population has better bonuses? (Personal preference.) I don't get a better bomb till late game because it's the worst of the tech choices every time it comes up. So it takes three or four turns (more during early/mid game) to destroy one colony. This eats away at turns and forces you to either have a bombing ship or every ship have bombs.\n\nResearch\n- Tech tree is great.\n- Where is Creative race bonus? As a Psilon I should\n\nbe able to get all techs.\n- On that note, I love that there are several techs that force you to choose one or the other. However, this is annoying to me because I have no reliable way to get the ones I missed.\n\nDiplomacy\n- I don't use diplomacy much, so I can't say anything specific. It just isn't quite right, but I think the devs are still working on this.\n\nRandom Events\n- Few and far between. Please add more, and add a failsafe so that I don't get three or four negatives in a row while no one else gets anything.\n\nSpecials/Monsters\n- There were two on a large map; Orion, and a squid.\n\nAdd a lot more, and variety.\n- Add planet specials like natives or something other than the random gold/gem/etc stuff. On that note, I don't know what any of those do because there are no details listed. "Adds credits.."  Great, how many?\n- Anomalies are cool and a nice addition, but add more of them.\n\nAntarens\n- ...wait, there aren't any?\n\nOrion\n- I love getting all four techs, this is a wonderful change.\n\nAI\n- Where's the backstabbing? The aggressive expansion? Underhanded cheap tricks (otherwise known as common\nsense to the AI)?\n- The AI is capable of doing well on it's own, but makes few decisions in terms of other players. As it is now, the AI won't attack me while my forces are on the other side of my empire just because...well I don't know why.\n- AI needs to be significantly more aggressive in each races' respective ideology. I.E. expansionists need to expand instead of twiddle their thumbs because they were blocked in on one side. Humans should be diplomatic monstrosities and making treaties/friends/etc.\n\n...I ran out of room!!","April 5","true","99.2"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

If your a syfy geek this game is a must have however there are some pros and cons to this game that I will go over.\nPros:\n1. This game is exremelely easy to control and understand how to play.\n2.Plenty of story for all the races even if their is no campaign.\n3. There is a progression system for your technology research and what you decide to research will affect you later on in your mission.\n4.  Plenty of sizes for maps to choose from and you can enable or disable features such as Pirates,etc.\n5. Random events happen throughout the game to keep you interested and keep and playing.\n\nCons:\n1.  For those of you that dont like simple games this game may be too simple for you to play.\n2. The mouse is your only control function and you can hardly navigate during other player turns.\n3. The custom race option is not really made to well no matter how customized you make it you only get 100 points to play with but some perks require 30+ just to select and no matter which race you choose to be descended from your basically playing the origional race so no point in creating your own race.\n\nNow this is just a brief summery of some of the things that Ive come across so far and who knows it is in early access so maybe they will fix this changes early on.

The game had some interesting moments, but did get a touch boring as well. Building the 20 somethingth planet up got boring, but the auto-build seemed useless.\n\nThe AI basically left me alone. The cat people destroyed my main fleet and I madly build another one while waiting for an attack. There was one attack which I barely repulsed, but that was it. The AI could have taken much of my empire if they had tried. Or another race could have attacked me while I was weak and several did dislike me.\n\nIt looked very good if a bit cartoony. There were no crashes. It seemed quite a bit like MOO 1/2 re-skinned, which is good for me. The relations between me and other races seemed fine if a bit simplistic.\n\nI just auto fought the battles and didn't worry about the RTS, so I didn't count that as a negative. I didn't have a problem with the Civ style tech tree. You still have some techs that require you to pick one tech out of two or three options. Also spys and marine invasions seem to be coming later.\n\nWeak AI, some boredom and no custom races are my main negatives. Note that custom races are "coming soon".\n\nA few notes that could be fixed easily. A way to see and sort pollution percentage from the empire screen. A way to see which planets had repair ability for my ships. A way to tell a ship to stay at a planet until repaired. Custom lists of things for the planets to build when first colonized. I may have missed some of those already being in game and I just didn't see them.\n\nFrom a fair old-timer, it wasn't bad and might improve so a thumbs up.","February 26","true","36.6"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","19","36","0","0"

The realtime combat is not that bad but the need to actuallty control your ships needs to be included. Currently a "Disable AI" button is not functional so you ships just charge in and do what they want.\n\nWells thats my limited take on MOO so far. Hopefully improvnments will be made in before the full release. Should you buy it? Only if you go in not expected a MOO1 or MOO2. It tries but comes off as a generic 4x thus far.

Its way BETTER than 3!!! But way below master of orion 1 and 2. So with that out the way here are reasons why its not that great. its a lot...\n\nFor starters combat is basic.... too basic. you can only set formation and your special items like boost or jumping. all your guns and missiles are on auto. Ground combat.... what ground combat? there is none. yes its like 1 where you can bomb, biological attack or invade. but when your troop transports can only make like 1 and thats it. thats pointless. This game has star lanes and some can't let you go anywhere because its unstable unless you get the tech. I liked the 1+2 where it will tell you how far you can go depending on your fuel cell type. The 500 turn limit. yes 500 turns and thats it.... that needs to go. As usual everyone hates you so diplomacy is bad. For example i was part of an alliance and the lizard race demanded i gave him 6 systems for no reason. no negotiation for it. so its off to war with him.  You can't demand peace or peace with another race in an alliance so thats pointless.  voting for council is just bad. i literally cheated and had top tier stuff and everyone abstain their votes. so i gave them all tech just to see what will happen. and they still abstain their vote. Ship building is ok, but I do not understand why if you upgrade something like if you designed a carrier with crud load of fighters, and bombers it will throw your design to the curb to put 100 laser cannons.  Espionage.... what spies??? there is none. but you have to research it???? Speaking of research this I don't understand. Why would a fusion beam and fusion bomb be seperated? Does someone invent the fusion beam but can't make a bomb or visaversa??? just put them like rest of the research. ON top of that fusion beam does less damage than laser but its a higher tier??!?!?!?!   its nice to see the planet being active with your buildings and all, but it could be better if I was in a same system with multiple planet colonies and jump from planet to planet. not system to the next system and back. wouldn't it make more sense to go to next planet and not the next system with the buttons on the bottom\n\nThere are some good parts\n\nIts in early stage so there is a lot of room for improvement\n\nShips look a lot better and if they can put more ships in the ship design for certain classes. and if you just stick with high dps, at least upgrade gives you the best dps, with some tweeking...\n\nthe research is easier to follow on the tech tree, and can plan where you want to go with research. similar to endless space\n\nThe UI is better from 3 and similar to 2 with a more 2010 look.\n\nLanding of the colony ship is cool, sometimes buggy b/c it will say your systems on the side. othertimes... nothing. plus it has the same sound effect from 1 i believe.\n\nI wonder if they make an Imperium Galatica 2 with better graphics and steam workshop to put in different ship designs and whatever. that would be a killer game. hint hint","February 29","false","6.7"," 31 of 60 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","31","60","2","0"

Before, I could barely play an hour before getting bored. I'm still overall a "no" on the game but I hope it continues along the current path. If so, I expect to change this review to a "yes". But my criticism below still stand. Tactical combat is better now and actually is interesting and allows me more controls and choices. Before it really seemed rather arbitrary. Regardless, I STILL WANT FUEL RANGES. This would pace expansion and make it scale with research priorities.\n\n2/28/2016\n\nAt this point, I don't recommend MOO. The graphics and asthetic are great and go a LONG way to make me like this game. It's very lovingly crafted. But there are some things that keep me from really being interested beyond playing 1 hour.\n\nFirst, the game lacks the range limitation that came from fuel tank technology in MOO2. Apparently, as long as it doesn't get destroyed, your scout ship can move from one side of the galaxy to the other. Logistical range really added a great element of balance and decision making in MOO2. If you needed to prioritize expansion, you had to research it to reach new stars. If you needed to turtle, you'd postpone it. I'm really missing this element. Instead it has been replaced with "unstable warp points". That's ok, but it's definitely not the same.\n\nNext, I can't see any situation where you don't research all the lowest techs first before moving to the next teir. You would never want to ignore lesser research to go to higher research because if you do, the AI will outpace you militarily while you're saving up for something else. Anyway, especially in the early game, it feels pointless to skip a tier 1 tech to rush a teir 2. Later down the line maybe you can...\n\nThe research tree as it is now is also rather uninspiring. CIV:BE and Polaris Sector both innovated the CIV style research tree in a way that feels much more appropriate to a science fiction setting.\n\nI'm still waiting to see how alien assimilation and race bonuses work. I would like to see meaningful reasons for both purging an alien population and assimilating one depending on a player's overall global strategy. Enslavement (not killing but not allowing to reproduce) would also be a welcome option. And of course, the ability to change one's mind throughout the course of the game.\n\nThere are a few minor issues I won't mention because surely they will be fixed. The one I will mention is that you have different ship models you can use as well as patterns. That's great, but in the build queue they all look the same. In MOO2 you could see at a glance the different ship designs in the build menu. It's a minor thing, but it *always* throws me off.\n\nI really want to like this game. But *as of this moment* it's not very fun and definitely not worth the price.","February 28","false","20.3"," 32 of 62 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","32","62","0","0"

If you b-line your research towards cruisers and build a few of them, by the turn ~100, you can start demanding colonies from AI. Just pick the weakest rival, ask for their colonies one at the time. They will accept. After that, skip a turn and do the same for second weakest rival. After 10 or so turns, all AI opponents have 1 colony left and you own the rest. There is absolutely 0 challenge in the game at the current stage. AI is fully passive and does not really take advantage of their tech or position. You can win the game in 150 turns with glass cannon strategy.\n\nCapturing the planets is ridiculously stupid. You need to build troop transports which magically vanish after you take a planet. That seems just an arbitrary rule to limit the speed of conquest. That's why it's easier to just diplomatically annex your enemies and bombard the hell out of the last colony instead of conquering with troop transports.\n\nGame is so much dumbed down that for a player with years of experience in strategy games, there is nothing to be seen after you've heard all the voice acting. Even that the voice acting is done very well, it starts to repeat itself and you just skip all talking you can. There is no connection between you as a player, and the "empire" you're running. It is just another turn away from evident victory. Even if  you try to play "stupid", there is no challenge.\n\nHopefully they fix the game prior  to full release and add some challenge. I will be anxiously waiting for updates to see if this game turns out to be the 4x game which it should be.","February 28","false","7.8"," 33 of 64 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","33","64","0","0"

Put me back in the feeling of the old MoO games.\n\nDidn't run into any game breaking bugs, mostly a couple of minor ones, like planets created from asteroid fields stayed barren visually, even when terraformed to Gaia. Making custom ships with the alternative models would just make em revery to original model, and at one point i couldn't pan the view, but was fixed by alt-tabbing out and back in.\n\nOther than those, i had no problems, ran very smooth even on max settings no stuttering.\n\nThere are some balance issues that probably need looking into. Like early game its really hard to get going, but late game you have such an easy time. I was losing money in start of game, and by the end i was making over 3k per turn. For example, i had to raise taxes not to have a defeciet early game, but in the end game i could build buildings to make my minions so happy they didn't care i had max taxes. Maybe add some mechanic to promote smaller planet populations, and with getting higher populations you lose some happyness due to crowding? Kinda how they did it in Civilization games.\n\nIts kinda the same with Credits and Science, you struggle hard early on, but mid-late game it becomes so easy to manage.\n\nThat said, game still quite fun.

A worthy heir to Moo2\nI feel like many of the negative reviews on here are totally failing to account for the pre-release nature of this game. Are some systmes missing? Yes. Are a few systems still incomplete? Yes. Is the game still one of the best Space 4x games ever? YES!\nThe parts of this game that ARE done, show a ton of polish, and harken back to the glory days of Moo2. It offers a great balance of nostalgia with updated procedures. I think many of the more recent Space 4x titles have made things too "complicated" in a misguided effort at "realism" - Moo has wisely avoided that in favor of understandabilty. Because the choices are more clear, it's FAR easier to understand the consequences of your decisions... and therefore much more fun to play (Imho).\nThe game still has some rough edges, of course, but it's already the most fun I've had playing a space 4x (or really any strategy game) since Civ5.

I came into this one blind wrt to its lineage, just looking for a decent space 4x and for me, it ticks all the boxes. The asthetics and sound are superb, really catches that old style soft-SF theme without seeming out-of-date. The game play is simple but solid. If you're into micromanagement this might not be the game for you, it doesn't take much effort to manage an empire with twenty or so planets, although there is enough micro to make you have to think about how you're going to develop and use those planets.\n\nI've read some crticism and debate over the star lane FTL system: you can't travel anywhere but can only jump to nearby systems making the map a network. I find the system quite refreshing. It creates some good tactical scenarios like grabbing systems, even if they have bad planets, because they are choke points for travel. It can make it difficult to send ships out in the later game without open border treaties but overall I think it works.\n\nThe game is still in Early Access but it seems nearly finished.

Some balance issues.\n\n+ Real time combat, though it needs a lot of refinement. Ship scale needs to be increased so we can see what's going on.\n+ Variation of planets and biomes is pretty good. Perhaps it needs the equivalent of Precursor worlds from GalCiv 3 however. Uber planets are decent but they're just beefed up versions of regular planets with no unique bonuses.\n+ Voice acting is outstanding. Hearing "Q" from Star Trek: TNG voice the Human Republic leader is awesome. There isn't enough variation in the lines though; this needs to be expanded.\n+ Visual effects are good, and the interface design is excellent - minimalistic but very much functional.\n+ The potential of this game is immediately apparent- maybe not quite a plus point but in some early access games you know it's not going to become much better than it currently is. Not the case here. It could become THE definitive 4x game if some features are expanded and the game systems are refined further.\n\n- AI is quite poor. This is the make or break point for the game. If the AI is vastly improved for release, the game could be very successful. I don't claim to understand the game dev process in the slightest but if their current AI team can't do a good job I'd hire more experts. This game needs the equivalent of Sorian AI from Supreme Commander. Devs: If you need to hire more people to get this sorted then please do it. Giving the AI large bonuses on Hard/Very Hard is all well and good but if it doesn't have a clue about how to play effectively then it's wasted.\n- STAR LANES (think phase lanes from SoaSE): these need to be optional. We need a ship range system similar to GalCiv3 instead- star lanes are just a massive pain in the ♥♥♥. I've read the devs are considering making them optional; I sure hope they do. It'd make a hell of a difference.\n- Not enough ship templates.\n- Game balance is a bit messed up: missiles are way OP compared to torpedos for example. Some beam weapons are weaker than they should be.\n- UI could do a much better job of explaining ship weapon stats and characteristics.\n- Research is too fast. Early/mid game war is a pain due to this; ships become obsolete very quickly,\n- Related to the real time combat system: we need small/medium/large variations for ship weapons. Larger ships fire massive volleys of beam weapons (because we can fit so many onto the ships) which looks terrible.\n\nEven with these negative points, I'd say the game is still worth the money. The AI is the main problem in the game, along with the star lane system. Give it a go at least; it's no risk with Steam's refund system.","April 5","true","15.3"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Then a fellow forum mate told me that its a pretty fine MoO game... I LOVE the second game, so I wanted a good MoO game soo much. So I bought it...\n\nThis review is based on my first 10-12 hours of gameplay:\nMan this game is fun even in this stage. The graphics is beautiful, the races and the characters (leaders, advisors) are great, and the voiceover... They nailed it. The pollution has now an actual effect (I always ignored this in MoO2, i could win without dealing with it), you can build on gas giants, asteroids, etc. Its much more limited (but more logical) how you can pass people from one planet to another, the time when you could jumpstart a new colony with near-full population in a couple of rounds are over. The ship upgrades are more convenient, the tech matrix need some re-learning, but its ok... The space battles are quite spectacular (especially when you arrive), but a bit chaotic for me, at least now.\n\nOfc there is plenty of space for improvement. I would like to see more ship design per race (I like the Meklar race, but I dont like their ships), it would be great if you could choose your color, and ofc more custom race skills and talents... I can't decide about the AI yet, since I played just an easy and a normal game for checking my possibilities.\n\nNonetheless, I recommend this game for the 4X fans.\n\nEdit #1: With the EA3, we got 2 new races and spying. You can finally turn off the advisor talk and popup, so its definately an upgrade over EA2... And most importantly... It keeps sucking me back into game. I play a "round", after 10+ hours I'm done and I had enough from this game... But after 2-3 weeks, I just want to play again. And that is good.\n\n\nEdit: possibly more comments will come later on.","April 4","true","42.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

If you've ever played Endless Space, you will love the latest installment of Master of Orion. Very similar 4X gameplay, but with more options in terms of ship designs, scales, weaponry and special modules, also more terraforming options. Unlike other 4X games like Endless Space and Civ V, when you start a battle, you go opt into a very quick real time combat, sort of like real time combat in total war games but so much shorter, battles that last maybe two or three minutes maximum. It makes for a more interseting time, as sometimes you can push through better in real time, not often, but I have noticed that units that have a lot of missiles and not much else don't tend to have a very high auto resolve rating, but can crush in real time. In terms of bugs, I have encountered one game ending bug, but that has only happened once and is to be expected when it comes to an early access game, but the auto save feature saves every turn, so I reset the game and pressed continue and I was maybe 30 seconds behind where it crashed, and it didn't occur again. Also the cool little landing cinematic that happens when you first colonise a planet are such a small touch, but it honestly makes the game that much more stunning, I just wish that they would have varying intros rather than just the same angle and landing intro every time you land on a barren planet. I would also love to see a cinemativ when you land troops on a planet and successfully conquer it, that would be cool. Overall I would say this game is definitely worth a buy, even in early access, although I would warn about the addictiveness that comes with games like this, definitely a great way to bring back a franchise.\n\nTl;dr: Beautiful, fun to play, even in early access.","April 10","true","30.8"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

It is very streamlined and intuitive. All the strategy and empire management elements from MOO2 are still in place. The tech tree has many familiar technologies that function essentially the same, but the order in which techs unlock is different. You still have to prioritize carefully and try to balance Infrastructure and military technologies.\n\nThe main fundamental gameplay difference is on the galaxy map with the addition of starlanes. This is a point of contention for some.\nI didnt like the idea at first but it is not too much of a travel hindrance as most systems have 3 or 4 warp points. It helps with empire planning.\nIt enables you to shelter your research and economic inner systems by having systems with heavy military instillations on  your  outer borders.\n\n\nThough there are still some minor balance issues but the game devs have been active reading feedback and responding. Rest assured even in its current early access state this is the best 4x space game available.","March 28","true","39.0"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

A prayer that somone would come along and remake one of those classic 90's games you loved so much, without changing anything. (Almost) If you played Masters of Orion or Masters of Orion 2: Battle at Antares just buy the game, don't think, you'll thank me. If you've never played a game in the series before think of this as Civilization 2 or 3 in Space, or a more fun Galactic Civilizations (sorrynotsorry). The civilizations you can choose to play are all the classic sci-fi alien archetypes: Cat people, lizard people, greys, robots, and so on.\n\nOverall this game at the moment is an 8.5 out of 10, taking into account it is unfinished. I have spent probably hundreds of hours playing Masters of Orion 2: Battle at Antares, and this game replicates that experience almost perfectly.\n\nPROS: The races are all solid and familiar, but their abilities differ somewhat from previous versions of the game. This is more interesting than problematic, and it should be clear to the new player what race reflects their play style.\n\nThe tech tree is pulled right from Battle at Antares, as well as ship classes, weapons and upgrades.\n\nThe new voice acting and art for both the racial models and ships is much more immersive and brings the races to life.\n\nThe biggest change to the game from Battle at Antares is the way you can move between stars. One can no longer travel to any nearby star within range of your ships, but rather, follow pre-determined hyperspace lanes that only connect to certian other stars. At first this was a con to me but I've come around. Although this map setup can lead to the awkward situation where the nearest star to your homeworld can only be reached by passing through several other star systems. It creates a lot of interesting strategies to control star systems with a lot of cross traffic in order to control large sections of the map. Because you are able to build military outposts on each node that leads out of a system you control, you can "seal up" whole portions of the map from races you aren't allied with.\n\nCONS: These are all minor and non game breaking, but cons nonetheless. I also know some of these complaints are because this is based off MoO1 not 2\n\nMissing Races: Elerians, Trilarians, Gnolam\n\nGame is a bit unstable and I have lost progress due to game crashes, though this may be fixed by the final build\n\nThe hyperspace lanes thing still kinda irks me so a bit of a con\n\nThe GNN news robots sound like trash, though this may be fixed by the final build\n\nSometimes when you open the colony menus they don't pop up right and you have to escape out, and re open them.\n\n","April 12","true","12.3"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

The User interface is clunky and missing a lot of features to make gameplay efficient.  The AI is not very well developed at this point.

I suspect casual strategy gamers may like this game and play it a few times.   For more hardcore 4X gamers this game will probably be too simple and very easy to beat the AI, based on players' feedback from the hardest difficulty settings.  Based on that assessment one certainly doesn't want to pay full price for this game.\n\nAs of the EA 2 release the AI still has issues.","March 5","false","9.6"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

Artwork and general production values are extremely high, the voice acting is a nice touch.\nI am an avid fan of both MoO and its sequel and so far I am enjoying this game very much. It has a slightly different feel than the originals but it's definitely a strong 4x title.\n\nThe realtime combat may be unexpected in a game calling itself a Master of Orion remake/reboot, but works pretty well and is in my opinion superior to the turn-based combat in MoO 2 which could sometimes turn into a chore especially in the late game. Starlanes are also something which I usually don't like and which are new in a MoO game but it works surprisingly well and leads to a lot of interesting gaming choices and opportunities.\n\nPros:\n\n- Great visuals, awesome production values overall\n- Very stable for an early access title\n- Feels definitely like a MoO game\n- The UI is modern and very user friendly\n- The starlanes add a lot of strategic opportunities to the game\n\nCons:\n- 4 races and a couple of features (like spying, several victory conditions etc.) haven't been implemented yet\n- No tactical combat in multiplayer\n\nOverall I am enjoying the game a lot and at least in my opinion it's a worthy successor. If you expect a 100% copy of the older games with visual improvements you'll probably not like this title, but if you are open to the thought of a new interpretation of the source material you might be in for a treat.","February 26","true","16.3"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","16","31","0","0"

I'm happy to report that so far MOO has a great foundation.  The art style is spot on, the effects and graphics beautiful.  The sound is a great mix of old & new.  I'm definitely getting sucked in already and experiencing that great "just one more turn, just one more turn" feeling that a good strategy/4x game will give you.\n\nBugs - Nothing really noteworthy so far, just a bit of barely noticeable frame stutter on a large, well explored galaxy during AI turns.  There's some minor UI elements that could use some polishing/streamlining.\n\nSome work needed - Diplomacy is a bit shallow, it would be nice to have some more subtle ways to make friends or enemies.  It seems like all the AI will do right now is get progressively more angry with you even if you don't do anything to offend them, even buying them off doesn't really do much. The auto-build is way off base for what new colonies need.  Pretty surprised that this got a public release without a working tutorial.....but that's the only real "buyer beware" I encountered.  Even as a 4x vet, I always like to give the tutorial a whirl just to get a feel for the game and all its features.\n\nWishlist (not really a knock on the game) - I know its probably a tall order with all the art & voice work required but even more different races would be amazing.  Bigger galaxies.  More ship variants.  I'd also love to see some sort of Ship Design Testing Room feature that you could access from the main menu that would take you straight to ship design and let you really play around with the ship building and then perhaps test them against some basic enemies.  I love the ship design part of a good 4x but I'd love to see some sort of testing lab feature to really get to play with various ship classes and loadouts.  With so much else going going on during a full game, you might spend some time on a new ship design, and never actually get to really get a chance to see if it performs well in combat.  A ship lab/fight AI ship minigame that you can access directly from the main menu would be a lot of fun.\n\nSummary - great game, definitely recommend (even in early access), I'm having a lot of fun with it.  A few minor things to polish up and a few "above and beyond" things I'd like to see added.","February 26","true","29.0"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","17","33","0","0"

That said, MOO:CTS (?) is a nice Early Access game, so far.\n\nI think that it is a great 4X game that will disappoint some MOO fans, but I'm sure it is interesting to fans of MOO-clones such as Endless Space, Galactic Civilizations, Star Ruler etc., for perhaps the following reasons\n\n- At this stage, it is a full game with tons of features already\n- Nice art and sound, and (surprisingly) a decent AI with alliances and such\n- It is not ground-breaking, nor experimental though, so it's easy to learn\n- It is of a higher art and design quality than many other 4X games\n- Space combat is RTS with an option for auto-combat\n- Less micro management than old 4X games\n\nFor old MOO brats I'd say\n\n- It is quite a shiny Disney evolution of a dinosaur\n- Not so many fresh gameplay ideas so far\n- It's like CIV4 and 5 are its best friends, MOO2 is its dad, and MOO1 its grandpa\n- And quite some lack of depth, of story, due to Early Access, I guess\n\nEDIT: Now that Stellaris is coming, I think that this MOO shows its weakness.

I'm happy to report that so far MOO has a great foundation.  The art style is spot on, the effects and graphics beautiful.  The sound is a great mix of old & new.  I'm definitely getting sucked in already and experiencing that great "just one more turn, just one more turn" feeling that a good strategy/4x game will give you.\n\nBugs - Nothing really noteworthy so far, just a bit of barely noticeable frame stutter on a large, well explored galaxy during AI turns.  There's some minor UI elements that could use some polishing/streamlining.\n\nSome work needed - Diplomacy is a bit shallow, it would be nice to have some more subtle ways to make friends or enemies.  It seems like all the AI will do right now is get progressively more angry with you even if you don't do anything to offend them, even buying them off doesn't really do much. The auto-build is way off base for what new colonies need.  Pretty surprised that this got a public release without a working tutorial.....but that's the only real "buyer beware" I encountered.  Even as a 4x vet, I always like to give the tutorial a whirl just to get a feel for the game and all its features.\n\nWishlist (not really a knock on the game) - I know its probably a tall order with all the art & voice work required but even more different races would be amazing.  Bigger galaxies.  More ship variants.  I'd also love to see some sort of Ship Design Testing Room feature that you could access from the main menu that would take you straight to ship design and let you really play around with the ship building and then perhaps test them against some basic enemies.  I love the ship design part of a good 4x but I'd love to see some sort of testing lab feature to really get to play with various ship classes and loadouts.  With so much else going going on during a full game, you might spend some time on a new ship design, and never actually get to really get a chance to see if it performs well in combat.  A ship lab/fight AI ship minigame that you can access directly from the main menu would be a lot of fun.\n\nSummary - great game, definitely recommend (even in early access), I'm having a lot of fun with it.  A few minor things to polish up and a few "above and beyond" things I'd like to see added.","February 26","true","29.0"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","17","33","0","0"

That said, MOO:CTS (?) is a nice Early Access game, so far.\n\nI think that it is a great 4X game that will disappoint some MOO fans, but I'm sure it is interesting to fans of MOO-clones such as Endless Space, Galactic Civilizations, Star Ruler etc., for perhaps the following reasons\n\n- At this stage, it is a full game with tons of features already\n- Nice art and sound, and (surprisingly) a decent AI with alliances and such\n- It is not ground-breaking, nor experimental though, so it's easy to learn\n- It is of a higher art and design quality than many other 4X games\n- Space combat is RTS with an option for auto-combat\n- Less micro management than old 4X games\n\nFor old MOO brats I'd say\n\n- It is quite a shiny Disney evolution of a dinosaur\n- Not so many fresh gameplay ideas so far\n- It's like CIV4 and 5 are its best friends, MOO2 is its dad, and MOO1 its grandpa\n- And quite some lack of depth, of story, due to Early Access, I guess\n\nEDIT: Now that Stellaris is coming, I think that this MOO shows its weakness. Stellaris did show so far more fresh and interesting game mechanics, depth and even some story, while MOO:CTS seems to be rather a nice looking remake than anything that will push 4X forward.","February 26","true","8.7"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","17","33","0","0"

(its in early access EA4 as of this writing) I will do a longer one once it goes live.  I should state outright I am a huge Moo2 fan and have been looking for a game to take its place.\n\nBasically  this game feels like a spiritual successor to Moo2 I would even go as far as to say its Civ5 in space.. but better.\n\nThe building system,  ship design, research and races all feel reminiscent of Moo2 but with improvements, older players can just pick up the game with ease.\n\nIt takes the real time combat and star lanes from Moo3 and does them far better, judge that as you will some like starlanes, some dont, the debate over that will not be solved here as everyone has their own view. The realtime combat seems ok.. could use more depth but its better then turn based for a game this large.\n\nIt also adds some of its own twists, like actually having to watch your finances to avoid going broke.\n\nIts in early access 4 so there is still things coming but most has been added in the game now.\nMost of the crash problems have been fixed, the AI has started to build larger ships but is still not much of a threat due to poor ship design, it can actually hurt you now but not much.. more work to be done here.\n\nDiplomacy is ok, but could be better.. not enough options it feels and the AI's really seem to not work together leading to it feeling like a cluster of 1v1v1v1 with no cooperation between non player sides.\n\nReally enjoying the games take on Spying so far.. id like more options here or more effect from existing options.. stealing tech really seems to be the only decent option... would like to see a credit stealing  or the ability for sabo to destroy ships (it may do this and i just have not noticed it as of yet)\n\nEnd all be all,  for an early access game you can really feel where they are heading... and its good.  If moo2 was a comfy chair that needed to be replaced, and Moo3 was a recliner you decided may be a good replacement but wasn't..    then Moo4 (this game) is a comfy recliner you replaced both with to get the best of both worlds :)\n\nStrongly recommend for any old Orion fans.. and recommend for any 4x player looking for a lite version of Stellaris","April 13","true","102.5"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","17","33","0","0"

I liked the divided tree into different areas, etc. MOO2 is my fav tech tree.\n*Combat: defenses are pretty much useless against ships. The definition of tactical combat presently in the game is point, click, and they shoot, no real tactics to it. From what they say, this is a major work in progress.....I hope, otherwise it would be one of the most disappointing elements in the game.\n*No Elarians, one of my favs in MOO2\n*Diplomacy.....what diplomacy? I have found it better to ignore this aspect of the game until the computer acts more reasonably.\n*Ship design: I love that the ship design here is much like MOO and better than most of this game's piers, but I still find it too restrictive when compared to previous MOO games. Would love to have more choices about how many specials, etc to put on a ship. I should be able to have a titan dedicated to electronic warfare if I want to and have space available.\n*Tech comes too fast and ships too slowly, by the time they are built, they are obsolete.\n\nPros:\n*In my opinion the flow of the galaxy, production ques, etc. resembles MOO2 very well and is one of the best out of any recent space tbs game. Some people do not like the auto group, but the same people love MOO2 (which had auto group). It is as simple as selecting the ones you do not want in the group and moving on. As far as the galaxy, fleet movement, etc. goes I think it does well with some minor issues on path finding.\n*The bones of a good game, with the glitches of an EA (early access) game.\n*All in all it plays like MoO4, bringing some of the best of the first 2 games, and missing many of the problems of MOO3 (while keeping star lanes, which I personally like).\n\nOverall while my cons are more detailed and specific than my pros, I think for people like myself, who are buying this to be a true MOO game, it can be at least mostly pleasing.\nThere are issues but like I said, overall, it plays like a MOO game (with the exception of that darned tech tree....hate it).\nSo I recommend getting it because it plays a lot like MOO to me....differences, the the spirit is there and that is something I found lacking in games like Endless Space, Horizon, etc. They are all decent games, but have never had the spirit or held a candle to MOO. I hope that many of those issues above are fixed and improved on, but I at least recommend this game based on the fact that the collectors edition includes the 3 previous games plus the new MOO!","February 26","true","65.3"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","0"

Comparing it to Master of Orion 2, while a natural instinct, would not be fair at this time because the game is just far too new and unfinished.\n\nAnd the largest detraction I can currently label to this game is that it is very much unfinished.  At least four races are missing (possibly as much as eight depending on how far the developers intend to go), race customization is not yet an option and the racial traits thus far appear to be watered down, ship design and combat are not as intensive as they once were, and despite the wonderful narration and voice acting the story does not yet seem to be entirely in place.\n\nLet's double back and remember, though, that this game is hot off the Early Access presses.  There can and will be additional content to come, and even if the detail work from before is missing the foundation for a game as great as MoO1 or MoO2 appears to be there: the races we know and love are present (mostly), the gameplay absolutely feels like a Master of Orion game, and there has been some evolution in how things are managed.  Did I mention that now there's a beautiful voice cast narrating and interacting in the game?\n\nIf you're looking for a re-skinned version of Master of Orion 2, I would recommend going over to StarDrive 2 for the time being.  If you're looking for a game being built on the same blocks as its predecessors, this is the game you want.  It would be fair to say it's more worth it when it goes on sale, but one way or another any MoO-loving, 4X-playing gamer will sooner or want this in their library.","February 25","true","10.0"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","20","39","0","0"

Instead of a finished review, i'll write up a game synopsis so you know what to expect in game.\n\nALSO, if you want to have good diplomacy with other races (at least for this stage of Early access stage 2) you MUST REFRAIN FROM COLONIZING EVERYTHING. Just don't build every colony ship you can, and try to have as much colonies as the other races. No matter what you do, if you try to be an aggressive expansionist in this game, the AI will think that whatever you bring to the galaxy, it isn't benign. If you keep your colonization reasonable, you can befriend and improve relationships trough regular trade deals and other diplomatic stuff quite easily.\n\nThe other way around, i mean, colonizing everything builds a snowball that lowers your diplomatic standing with each new colony or conquered planet. THe following is a playtrough of how i managed to cope with the negative AI feedback. During the game, i used the premade ships, kept 90% of my systems on the balanced mode and kept my research to chosing the lowest cost tech every time. Nothing fancy.\n------\n\nStarted a game as the Klackon queen, and began expanding at top speeds.\n\nI made my entry into intergalactic affairs by blowing up two Bulrathi (angry russian bear people) colony ships north of my starting location with my initial frigate and claiming both of the planets they wanted. This degenerated into a war that (unsusrpisingly) i was better suited to win (since it was them who had to fight with two less colonies :) ).\n\nAfter dealing with the Bulrathi via old "bomb them and recolonize the ruins" strategy, my colonization to the south was cut short by the Ssakra (lizard people). Soon enough, i brought in my old ships from the Bulrathi war to deal with this new troublesome "empire" that also needed to be relocated.\n\nWhilte at it, noticed no one liked me. Not the Mrrshan (cat people) nor the Alkari (Bird people) wanted anything to do with me.  Entering a wormhole with one of my scouts, i contacted the distant Human empire (well spirited diplomatic humans) and the Terran Khanate (a more realistic depiction of humans in space, bringng war and destruction to everyone). Surprisingly, none of them disliked me! (Much) I managed to get alliances with both of them by trading tech, trade deals, showering them with gifts and tech, etc.\n\nHowever, as my expanding continued, my diplomacy went into the dismal lows and i was universally hated, even with my so called "Friends".\n\nFurther south from the Ssakra, were the Meklar, a race of sentient machines that had somehow scored N° 1 in population and tech, and nonsurprisingly, also hated me. Soon enough the Meklar made a sneak attack, and simultaneously both the Terran Khanate and Human Empire denounced their alliance treaties.\n\nI realized that the AI was taking "Agressive" expansionism as an act of agression, which it does (I had oblitterated the Bulrathi and was halfway of doing the same with the Ssakra when the Meklar made their move and both treaties went down the toilet).\n\nI fought back the Meklar  out of my space by reusing fleets from previous wars and capitalizing on my MANY colonies. However, I realized that my dominion of the galaxy was going to be one big uphill battle unless i switched strategies or soon i'd be at war with everyone.\n\nSo I was at peace with the Ssakra now but had a few of their colonies that shared boreders with the hostile Meklar. I GIFTED those colonies (colonized ruins  due to my own bombing) to the Terran Khanate and then proposed we both declare war on the Ssakra together. That got my diplomacy with them back into the positive because i got a BIG "Gave them a gift recently", and "fighting a common enemy" bonuses. I then  uppped that with a trade deal and gifts. Soon enough i had a working alliance once again, but this time i signed an open borders treaty with them. They sent fleets trough my space to attack the Ssakra which gave them a lot of strategic options.  Soon enough there was a buffer of freshly conquered Ssakra colonies owned by the Khanate which protected my borders with the Meklar and kept them busy. The Khanate wasn't at war with the Meklar so they couldn't attack me without going trough them except on my fortified worlds. Also, Khanate fleets where regularly passing trough my systems, and enemies where not keen on attacking a systems protected by two fleets.\n\nI kept expanding, and that kept deteriorating my relationship with the Khanate, HOWEVER, i kept it positive by convincing them of declaring war on a different race each week, and agreeing every time they wanted to buy or trade weapons tech from me (Actually got a lot of credits from that).  This approach kept me at the top of the Diplomatic meter, and kept the Khanate well armed.  From that point on the Khanate was my angry guardog ready to bite at whomever i threw them against. I'd simply send my fleet to crush the largest enemy fleet of the race i didn't like and then the Khanate would take care of the troublesome deal of bombing/conquering. I prioritized freshly colonized worlds.  Relationships with other races (that we werent at war with) kept deteriorating but i had the biggest fleet because (duh) i was the one with the most colonies to support them due to my aggresive expansionism.  Thus, their status to me was "Afraid", and laughing at their stupid demands had no consequence at all, since they wouldn't dare crossing me and the Khanate for reals. Used this time to create a web of Space jump gates that allowed me to bypass the Starlanes betwen my colonies. Each gate generated new starlanes only for me, which let my fleet always be on speed dial.\n\nDuring all of this, the Galactic council had been in sessions. Initially, candidates for galactic Chancellor had been the Ssakra and the Meklar, but the Ssakra where now out of the picture due to some indiscriminate bombardment (by me) and invasions (by the Khan). I had taken their place, and it was the Meklar vs me. My many colonies where growing but still underdeveloped tough. I realized i needed to keep the gig on the road long enough for the Khanate and I to have a clear population advantage, along with undercutting the competitors (The Khanate was regularly voting for me at every election by then, they agreed to it in a treaty in exchange for 2500 bcs). At this point i began sending construction ships into Khanate space to build the "Artificial planet" projects on their space to boost their council votes.\n\nAfter that we terrorized the the galaxy for over a hundred turns. By the end, the mrrshans were relegated to two systems tough they put up a good fight i'd say. Short, but good.\n\nThen Humans were  completely conquered by Khan unfifying all of humanity under him. He couldn't take sol without bombarding it to dust tough. I count that as a fail.\n\nThen Ssakra were relegated to a single system and the Alkari remained untouched, mainly because they were behind Meklar space.\n\ni finally had a serious fleet to take Orion, and then wage war with the Meklar. The Khanate wasn't strong enough to take on them, but they did move a ton of fleets to the borders which in turn forced the Meklar to keep fleets in defensive positions which made it super easy for me to strike at them in force.\n\nOnce the main Meklar fleet was dust, the Khanate poured in and started wrecking them, but by then my alliance had a clear advantage on the Galactic council. At some point during the war with the Meklars new elections came up, and it was  again me vs the meklar emperor. I won easily and got elected Galactic Chancellor with the aid of the Khan's votes and it was game over.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: I reloaded several times, specially after two disastrous battles against the Meklar in which my fleet was completely wiped. I didn't explore what would have happened if i had lost those battles.","March 27","true","85.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","5"

I don't care that you are called Bulrathi because you can research all tech from current technology benefits most of the time.".\nWell, it is also possible to make a postulate like that: "You are a Silicoid now... I don't care that you are called Bulrathi because you can colonize all planets except gas giants and asteroids now from the beginning".\nThe list may be continued. Simplified game mechanics leaves no room for visible race difference.\nIf you want some MOO, buy MOO 2 on gog.com, also you can find relativly fresh mods for it.Or buy Star drive 2 se4ctor zero, I am going to buy it soon.\nI also do not recommend to buy anything from NGD Studious or wargaming (WG Labs) from now on.\nThey are just impudent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s trying to get money for no work.\nThis guys, for example, didn't include a goverment system and leaders system in their pityfull byproduct!\nThey dare to say that just maybe they would make leader system in the future (maybe, in DLC?).\nFeatures, which there were in MOO 2 20 (yes, 20, Karl) years ago!\nImagine, I do not know, John Carmac releasing Doom 4 without armour and with decreased number of weapons in comparison with Doom 2! And tells you, that he have heard the wishes of community for armor in the game, and he is thinking that maybe somehow (DLC?) it would be implemented in some future!\nIf we would pay for such freaks, they would continue to degenerate the hole game industry.\nWell, there are also some "minor" issues for not buying this game - their game designer didn't play MOO 2 any visible amount of time and, while being cleanly identified as a civ-player (and not moo player) by MOO community, is considered to be a mediocre player in civilisation at best by some. So, while it is early access now, it is doubtfull that a good progress would be possible.\nWatching their forums, keep in mind that this freaks delete negative posts, threads, and ban unwelcomed users.\nSo, just stay away and wait for metacritic results, and compare the rating of the game with stardrive 2, stellaris, polaris sector, galactic civilisations 2-3, and think twice before supporting idiots who make a remake of 20 years old game cutting off many important features of it and adding about nothing but graphics, Well, this stupid creatures also boast that they hired a well-known artists for postcoring an advisors for this game, but periodically on the forum appear themes were people ask to shut down some of them because they are very annoying.","April 13","false","85.2"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","16","32","3","0"

I sat down just to give it a try and...well there went five hours! I highly enjoy the new incarnation of this game. It's simple to learn and control, but has enough depth to keep me interested. The Early Access is stable (no crashes at all in a 5 hour play session) and the game is surprisingly polished. There are a few features that will clearly be added later such as espionage, but I didn't feel like I was missing any major part of the game when playing it. At first I thought the real-time combat might not be as fun as the more traditional turn-based, but it's quick and easy and pretty to watch. The entire game is pretty gorgeous so far.

If you are fan of the Civilization franchise, or even the original MOO games, this game is great. If you have any experience with 4x turn based games you'll have no learning curve and will be comfortable jumping right in. I only have a bit over 10 hours at the time of this review but I can see that there will be many 10s, maybe even hundreds of hours in a year or two. At the time of this review the game is EA with changes and content planned down the road. Also, at this time the game would seem to be a little bit simplified if you were to compare it to some of the other 4x games out there. I expect this may change a little bit as they exit out of the EA period which is only 3 short months anyway but I'd be okay if it didn't. I like that it doesn't require an encyclopedic knowledge base of the game components or mechancis or that it doesn't take 20 hours of trial and error to get your stuff together. It is fun the way it is.\n\nI see there are quite a few negative reviews, all of which are from fans of the old MOO games making comparisons. My experience with MOO was not fanatical, I liked them and played them a bit but nothing outrageous. And in playing this game I wasn't expecting or wanting an exact continuation of the franchise. Besides, most people remember the games of old with some glorious nostalgic glitter that makes them all seem great, and they were but they really weren't.The good thing is that with the Collector's Edition you get all the old MOO games that you can play again and compare with older eyes and a wiser mind.","February 27","true","17.1"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

In terms of bugs I have noticed some spelling mistakes in the game and a few glitches but nothing game breaking at all.\n\nIf you are worried this game still has the stink left from MOO3 on it then you have nothing to worry about. It is far more like MOO2 than 3 although I personally still feel 2 is the better game at this point in development.","February 27","true","5.2"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

It is true sequel to MoO2. BTW I am a long time fan of MoO1 and 2 (3 sucks).\nI love the new system grid and warm holes. Great graphics for a strategy classic sequel.\nThe diplomacy is still broken, hope they improve until the launch.\nWhat they fixed is that on MoO2 you were dependant on the luck to find a suitable planet at range to colonize, now it is easier to colonize barren, radiated and other kinds of planet. Plus, the military starts early. It is very good to know the fleet and mosnter strenght before combat. It should have a flee option on the simulate option on combat.\nI finished the game twice by diplomatic victory. The late game was not that fun, an MoO2 problem too.\nThe AI should consider moving military ships to a system an hostile act and stop doing it unless it wants war, as it should ask if I want war when I do so.\nMoO2 had special characters, it would be good if they use this on this one too.\nRight now it is a great game, and every MoO1 and 2 should buy it.\nI hope they improve a lot this game, until it reaches a uncosntested position as the best 4x space game.\nAt last, I didn't try the multyplayer, and I hope thay playtest it a lot to deliver an outstanding competitive experience.","February 27","true","24.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I really enjoyed that game, and when I learned that the franchise was being brought back, I decided to give it a chance.  For what it's worth, I really like it.  It fulfilled my nostalgia, but also had enough meat on its bones to keep me playing after the fact.  The game should improve markedly once they reintroduce the remaining races and victory modes, as they have currently been trimmed down in order to provide a more streamlined approach in Early Access.\n\nSorry this review doesn't have more to it, but I stopped writing reviews a long time ago.

In fact I've never even heard about the game till I saw it on Steam and what caught my interest in it was, I love space games, and it has some pretty well known actors in this game. One of my favorites being John Delancey. So this review is based off as a completely new player. and in will no way be compared to the older games.\n\nLets first start off with the Menu and settings and whatnot:\nThe menu is very nice, very clean, easy to navigate, The tutorial sadly isn't available but I'll talk about that a bit later, the settings are pretty simple there's actually a very wide veriaty of graphic options but if you have a decent computer you should be able to run this just fine on highest settings as this game is not really that demanding. The game in fullscreen does not lock... meaning if you have 2 monitors your mouse cursor is gonna fly over to the other screen, Normally this would be a giant pet peeve for me... but the game moves at a slower rate so it actually doesn't bug me all that much.\n\nFirst game:\nSo starting my first game, everything is actually pretty easy to figure out. in fact I wonder if the tutorial is even really needed. after a few games I really learned how everything worked and its all downhill from there. the games can actually be very long but I don't mind that. some of the settings when making a game are kinda glitched like how many turns you want there to be in a game sadly that doesn't work. and one thing that it wont tell you if you don't figure it out like I didn't is that there's 500 turns in a game.\n\nA.I.:\nThe A.I. are actually very interesting. sadly the game settings have them locked on the diffulty of "Average" so sadly the most ships they're ever gonna get are cruisers. nothing more. so when you get battleships you've pretty much won the game. I think the A.I. do need a little more work as sometimes they will do things that don't really make a lot of sense, you'll see what I mean. and I don't know if its the game or just me. but the Cat people never like me...\n\nRaces:\nSo from what I was able to get is there's no point in picking a race... I mean play as who you like, but the tech tree for all races are pretty much the same so that being said there's not a whole lot of difference between each races. hopefully this will get fixed along the lines.\n\nRewarded:\nSo what I like the most about this game is if you put a lot of time and money into technology and ships you're more then likely to win a fight, there's really no cheap shots in this game.\n\nThe game right now: The game right now is actually very fun, umm the multiplayer aspect of the game is still kinda bleh, as it can suck waiting for other players, the game does lack a lot of features that should be there, but the game itself is actually quite playable. I've ran into little to no bugs, the game is actually very polished for being an early access, I have out of the 32 hours I've played so far I've only experienced the game freezing 2 times but thats okay because the game constantly saves so just exit the game, start back up where you were. Winning for diplomacy purposes I find rather boring. I'm more of a "I'm just gonna destroy you all" kind of guy. but I love the game so far.

Trying to make a peace treaty after taking over a few of their planets and wiping out there fleet and they demand like they are winning the war. Also the galactic council would be a lot better if there were things you could vote on other than the winner.

Exactly what most people probably would have wanted if they loved MOO2\n\nMost of the tech from MOO2 is there, but the tree is a bit harder to understand. The interface is improved in some ways and worse in others, but not painfully so, just weird and needs some polish.\n\nThe combat is in real time but it doesn't feel like that adds very much, or it's just me. I just kind of let the computer handle the fleet movement because at the start of each battle the ships are just placed based on some internal game logic, so you have little control there.\n\nThe ships are beautiful though and the first time you field a titan feels pretty awesome.\n\nNeeds  a little more variation in some of the dialogue or else it becomes annoying (The psilon guy's comment after EVERY SINGLE RESEARCH ITEM COMPLETION is the same annoying phrase, I stopped wanting to research new things!). But it's in early access so what are you gonna do?\n\nSeriously, it's every MOO game out there plus an early access beta that's decently playable for under $50.

All the familiar features are there; tech trees, colony ships, alien races, etc. However, what it does offer is streamlined play: everything that is implemented works smoothly, and a lot of the tedium of other 4X's seems swept away.  I actually liked it better than I liked GalCiv for the sheer scale of things it didn't make me manage. If you've got a friend you're trying to introduce gently to 4x's, this is the one: it's stable, brightly animated, and not as complex as most.\n\nThings I'm hoping they'll fix before taking it out of early access are:\n\nDiplomacy. Despite having spend full on effort in my second game trying to keep my diplomatic relationships positive (making treaties, giving in to demands, conducting myself in ways game lore might suggest would placate this species) my relationships with the AI's always ended up extremely negative. Also, once they went negative but I became mighty, there was no diplomatic option to bully them for specific planets or technologies as they had bullied me. Perhaps it's not implemented yet, but my one option to gain a concession from my enemies was to declare war and start stomping their worlds.\n\nPollution warnings. I kept getting these for the first world I colonized that got heavily polluted, even though that world wasn't polluted any longer. It was another world, but apparently because the pollution warning had locked on to the first polluted world, any pollution warnings anywhere got me a dialogue box that dragged me back to the first world. Annoying.\n\nCoherent AI response to overwhelming force. I had such a technological edge by the end of the game that I could steamroll any of the other races. But nonetheless, two of them declared war on me, one when I outmatched her 5:1 and another when I outmatched him 8:1. They also never formed alliances against me, possibly because relationships default to bad so quickly they all hated each other.\n\nDiverse voice messages. They hired good voice talent for the game, but unfortunately the diplomatic speeches don't vary much. They differ based on your relationship (usually very negative) but within a relationship level they repeat exactly over and over. If you're going to go the distance and hire voice, have them, you know, spice it up a bit.\n\n","February 27","true","44.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Brings back memories of MOO II.  If you were a fan of the old game, you'll love this one too.  I find the screen zooming out for event notifcation a little annoying and the large map isn't as large as MOO II, but besides that, it kept the spirit of the game to the core.  Loving every moment of this game.  In fact this is the only game I ever bothered putting in a comment.\n\nUPDATE APRIL 2016\n\nSo, after countless hours and phase 2 fo EA here's what I've found;\n\nCONS\n\n- Map starlanes take away from the MOO2 experience and make it too easy to defend or hold territory for later stages of the game.\n\n- Map sizes are too small\n\n- Want to win?  Custom race > bonus to Production and income = outpace all races in production and cash flow and science.  Rinse and repeat.\n\n- Custom race:  where did Creative/Uncreative go?  Where did gov't type like Unification go?\n\n- Want to win Part 2?:  Mass colonize.  You get to a point where eventually the races will hate you for colonizing too quickly, but the bonus' you get from all the planets you own snowball into an unstopable machine.\n\nDid I mention Starlanes?  Kind of puts a huge damper on the mechanics IMO\n\nFleet "battle points" make it too easy when sizing up oponents...remove please!\n\nCONS OVERALL:\n\n- Game is made too linear, especially with the starlanes forcing natural choke points.  Just send a few ships to guard starlanes in systems you want, and hold them until you are ready.\n\nNOTE:  Still missing mechanics such as espionage, and boardring parties, etc\n\nPROS:\n\n- Upgrading system is good and allows for quick and easy upgrades to ships\n\n- Planetary managment is good and heading in the right direction\n\n- Got a good chunk of the MOO2 feel, with the races and GNN\n\nOVERALL PROS:\n\nIt's getting there, slowly but surely.  I'm still optimistic that the Pro's outweigh the cons and seeing the progress from 1st stage release to 2nd gives me hopes they will reel in the line and keep it closer to the original instead of straying too far and making it a clone of some of the other more recent 4X games\n\n- Improvements from EA phase 1 to phase 2 are fantastic, keep up the great work, but please don't lose sight of MOO2","February 28","true","42.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

If you are fan of the Civilization franchise, or even the original MOO games, this game is great. If you have any experience with 4x turn based games you'll have no learning curve and will be comfortable jumping right in. I only have a bit over 10 hours at the time of this review but I can see that there will be many 10s, maybe even hundreds of hours in a year or two. At the time of this review the game is EA with changes and content planned down the road. Also, at this time the game would seem to be a little bit simplified if you were to compare it to some of the other 4x games out there. I expect this may change a little bit as they exit out of the EA period which is only 3 short months anyway but I'd be okay if it didn't. I like that it doesn't require an encyclopedic knowledge base of the game components or mechancis or that it doesn't take 20 hours of trial and error to get your stuff together. It is fun the way it is.\n\nI see there are quite a few negative reviews, all of which are from fans of the old MOO games making comparisons. My experience with MOO was not fanatical, I liked them and played them a bit but nothing outrageous. And in playing this game I wasn't expecting or wanting an exact continuation of the franchise. Besides, most people remember the games of old with some glorious nostalgic glitter that makes them all seem great, and they were but they really weren't.The good thing is that with the Collector's Edition you get all the old MOO games that you can play again and compare with older eyes and a wiser mind.","February 27","true","17.1"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Gets me just the way the original games did. Needs a bit of polish yet, I had it hang three times when it was working the other races turns (I am 350 turns into a huge galaxy). I am running the psilons (always my favorite race) and things are working almost exactly the way it used to in MOO1 and MOO2, they start slow and weak and by the end of the game if you squeek by they are a power house.\nStill needs some polish in ship customization and updates, not as many choices here as there used to be. The races are a little bland compared to the old way and no way to customize them at startup, which was always cool. I have seen several reviews that claim alliances are impossible, I would not know, when they ask me for money I said no, they went to war with me and that was always my signal to turn from peaceful expansion to warmonger, I have not needed the other races for allies as I am simply crushing them.\nCombat is missing something from the old games, perhaps have not explored it enough, in the older versions I always controlled the ships early on and then gave up when the fleets got so massive it was just no use and let the AI take the battles from there, so far have simply let the  AI run the battles, the graphics are beautiful in battles, kudos to the game team there!\nOn that note, graphics are very good thru the entire game, love the look of it! The voice overs are also fantastic! You can really tell they have some professionals for this.\n\nIts early on, but I do recomend this if your a MOO follower! I think its very solid start, and they have already said more to come, I will be playing this one for years to come, I can say that for sure right now!","February 27","true","21.2"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Many other reviews seem to forget this or unaware of the definition.\n\nYou are buying into a testing phase of the game. It is not finished. It is not polished. It is filled with bugs and placeholder art.\n\nBut the gameplay is good. Really good. It brings me back to the old games. They changed up the gameplay from the originals to have star lanes. These limit the direction you can travel to reach star systems, which means you can create choke-points for your territory. This adds an interesting element to it.\n\nI'm looking at this game to have pretty good multiplayer games. I'm also excited for each update of the game before release to see how it progresses. Overall, the game as it is now, is worth checking out, as long as you remember you're buying into the game before it's done and filled with problems that are obviously going to be corrected.","February 28","true","76.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Mixed reviews didn't bother me too much, I primarily purchased the package as the first two games were bundled in there as well as the third and latest one. I loaded up with a sense of cautious optimism - and I wasn't disappointed.\n\nFor an early access game I personally think it's very good. OK, some areas are a bit bare bones but it's more than fleshed out enough to pass as a decent entry, but with the continued development I'm confident this will mark a return to form for the series.\n\nIt is as addictive a game as I have played in ages - I still play MOO1 and MOO2 from time to time and get hooked, and I have a feeling this one will be no different. It harkens back to the early days, taking some of the best bits from the first two games particularly but with a much more updated feel.\n\nI won't go into too much detail on this review as I've only managed a few short hours with the game so far but I have to say it is progressing nicely, and with some of the new features we have been promised as well as all the creative ideas being put to the developers I've got a funny feeling this game could end up as fondly remembered as MOO2, if not potentially more so.","February 29","true","95.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Exactly what most people probably would have wanted if they loved MOO2\n\nMost of the tech from MOO2 is there, but the tree is a bit harder to understand. The interface is improved in some ways and worse in others, but not painfully so, just weird and needs some polish.\n\nThe combat is in real time but it doesn't feel like that adds very much, or it's just me. I just kind of let the computer handle the fleet movement because at the start of each battle the ships are just placed based on some internal game logic, so you have little control there.\n\nThe ships are beautiful though and the first time you field a titan feels pretty awesome.\n\nNeeds  a little more variation in some of the dialogue or else it becomes annoying (The psilon guy's comment after EVERY SINGLE RESEARCH ITEM COMPLETION is the same annoying phrase, I stopped wanting to research new things!). But it's in early access so what are you gonna do?\n\nSeriously, it's every MOO game out there plus an early access beta that's decently playable for under $50.

All the familiar features are there; tech trees, colony ships, alien races, etc. However, what it does offer is streamlined play: everything that is implemented works smoothly, and a lot of the tedium of other 4X's seems swept away.  I actually liked it better than I liked GalCiv for the sheer scale of things it didn't make me manage. If you've got a friend you're trying to introduce gently to 4x's, this is the one: it's stable, brightly animated, and not as complex as most.\n\nThings I'm hoping they'll fix before taking it out of early access are:\n\nDiplomacy. Despite having spend full on effort in my second game trying to keep my diplomatic relationships positive (making treaties, giving in to demands, conducting myself in ways game lore might suggest would placate this species) my relationships with the AI's always ended up extremely negative. Also, once they went negative but I became mighty, there was no diplomatic option to bully them for specific planets or technologies as they had bullied me. Perhaps it's not implemented yet, but my one option to gain a concession from my enemies was to declare war and start stomping their worlds.\n\nPollution warnings. I kept getting these for the first world I colonized that got heavily polluted, even though that world wasn't polluted any longer. It was another world, but apparently because the pollution warning had locked on to the first polluted world, any pollution warnings anywhere got me a dialogue box that dragged me back to the first world. Annoying.\n\nCoherent AI response to overwhelming force. I had such a technological edge by the end of the game that I could steamroll any of the other races. But nonetheless, two of them declared war on me, one when I outmatched her 5:1 and another when I outmatched him 8:1. They also never formed alliances against me, possibly because relationships default to bad so quickly they all hated each other.\n\nDiverse voice messages. They hired good voice talent for the game, but unfortunately the diplomatic speeches don't vary much. They differ based on your relationship (usually very negative) but within a relationship level they repeat exactly over and over. If you're going to go the distance and hire voice, have them, you know, spice it up a bit.\n\n","February 27","true","44.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Brings back memories of MOO II.  If you were a fan of the old game, you'll love this one too.  I find the screen zooming out for event notifcation a little annoying and the large map isn't as large as MOO II, but besides that, it kept the spirit of the game to the core.  Loving every moment of this game.  In fact this is the only game I ever bothered putting in a comment.\n\nUPDATE APRIL 2016\n\nSo, after countless hours and phase 2 fo EA here's what I've found;\n\nCONS\n\n- Map starlanes take away from the MOO2 experience and make it too easy to defend or hold territory for later stages of the game.\n\n- Map sizes are too small\n\n- Want to win?  Custom race > bonus to Production and income = outpace all races in production and cash flow and science.  Rinse and repeat.\n\n- Custom race:  where did Creative/Uncreative go?  Where did gov't type like Unification go?\n\n- Want to win Part 2?:  Mass colonize.  You get to a point where eventually the races will hate you for colonizing too quickly, but the bonus' you get from all the planets you own snowball into an unstopable machine.\n\nDid I mention Starlanes?  Kind of puts a huge damper on the mechanics IMO\n\nFleet "battle points" make it too easy when sizing up oponents...remove please!\n\nCONS OVERALL:\n\n- Game is made too linear, especially with the starlanes forcing natural choke points.  Just send a few ships to guard starlanes in systems you want, and hold them until you are ready.\n\nNOTE:  Still missing mechanics such as espionage, and boardring parties, etc\n\nPROS:\n\n- Upgrading system is good and allows for quick and easy upgrades to ships\n\n- Planetary managment is good and heading in the right direction\n\n- Got a good chunk of the MOO2 feel, with the races and GNN\n\nOVERALL PROS:\n\nIt's getting there, slowly but surely.  I'm still optimistic that the Pro's outweigh the cons and seeing the progress from 1st stage release to 2nd gives me hopes they will reel in the line and keep it closer to the original instead of straying too far and making it a clone of some of the other more recent 4X games\n\n- Improvements from EA phase 1 to phase 2 are fantastic, keep up the great work, but please don't lose sight of MOO2","February 28","true","42.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The Races are interesting and the voice acting and music are unique and enjoyable to listen to. The artwork is beatiful from the universe map to the colonizing video makes you have the extraterrestrial feel when colonizing a new planet (especially when you are the Psilons, I think that is how you spell them.)\n\nThe one thing I think a lot of people need to understand is this isn't a MOO2 remake. Do not buy this game thinking that they are simply going to remake that game with new graphics. You are going to be disappointed. I do get annoyed when people make a lot of assumptions about games and then get all upset when they find out it isn't the clone of what they expected or they have this nostalgic viewpoint of a game, I call that the spoiled brat syndrome.\n\nHowever I will say the game is simplified in comparison to the older installments and currently there is only 6 races to choose from. I am hoping that the AI is improved quite a bit and the races become more unique in the way they play in the game. I am hoping for more universe based events in the game.\n\nPros:\n- The game is stable I have not crashed once it plays really smoothly.\n- Great voice acting from famous Sci Fi actors.\n- Artwork music and general feel of the game is fantastic.\n- If you have played modern 4X games before you will easily be able to get right in and play this game.\n- Planets are unique, terraforming is a lot of fun especially making a gas giants into a huge livable terran world :)\n- The Tech tree is interesting and it is great that they have the option to auto upgrade your ship designs when new tech gets researched, allowing more casual players to enjoy the game.\n- I have never laughed so much in a space turn based game when the galactic news reported the end of my population growth event.\n\nCons:\n- AI needs work, the different race need to work in a more racial way. For example the military races should not be more technologically advanced than the scientific races etc.\n- Diplomacy needs work, I played the space bears and the only race I could form an alliance with was the humans. No matter what I did the other races viewpoint of my race wouldnt go up. (I may have just not be doing something right)\n- I think the Tech tree and ship design needs to be more complicated to make it interesting to experienced MOO fans.\n- More events and havestable areas for your builders (they can only build very few things, hopefully more options become available.)\n- The battle map needs work, ships phasing through asteroids just breaks the immersion for me and a little bit of control during battle would be nice.\n- Diplomatic victory is way to easy, all you have to do is have the majority of votes which you can pay off the other races which for me costs 1500 per race. I was actually shocked when the game ended. I thought you would have certain powers to manipulate the galactic community. :-/\n\nIn conclusion currently MOO is a very stable early access game! A great ground structure to build a interesting and modern installment to the MOO franchise. I can see a lot of place holders throughout the game and certain victory conditions have not been fully fleshed out. They do have a lot of work to do but even though the cost of the game is high I have enjoyed playing the game and supporting the developers. I have high hopes to see where they go with this one.","February 28","true","19.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

As a veteran MoO2 player, I was at first hesitant about this reboot, but as time went on WG showed that they were extremely passionate about this project, and it has now been proven in the gameplay of this game.\n\nSomething to note if you're also a veteran MoO2 player, the new tech tree is going to seem simplistic to you, because instead of researching individual techs, you research things a group at a time. At first I thought it was going to be lame, but honestly, it's a good way of modernizing the game flow and it speeds up the gameplay without taking the strategy out of teching - it's all still there, just a little bit quicker.\n\nThe UI is clean and gorgeous - there are some things I'd still like added, like being able to buy production from the colony overview screen to save me from having to go to each individual planet, but that's really a quality of life thing that isn't necessary right now.\n\nThe voice acting is stellar, the visuals are clear and concise, and the galaxy layout is different now using a "warp node" system - and what this means is that now you can predict where enemies can attack you from and defend them. This is another thing that I thought would be a far departure, but again, it really just modernizes the same gameplay style we all love, and actually keeps you from getting merc'd by tech rushes and such.\n\nThis game is just going to keep getting better as more content is added, and I'm so happy that WG decided to pick this us and do something with it.

Though at this early time of playing this game in Early Access I must repent and say there looks to be hope for this game and so far after 4 Hours play and Mhrssan have elemitaed me from the game! I'll be honest I started the war after killing everone of their scouts and then dening them consumpation payments for my acts of aggression. The War dragged on for a long time and it was kind of like a civil war but alas I was on the losing side 200 turns roughly later.\n\nSo far the game is good. It has potential to be outstanding! (Early Beta I give it 7/10)\n\nTactical Combat is only good once you get some ships ans then you have options of formations and targetting. I won a few battles I shouldn't have but because I pauses and did some strategy I eneded up turning the tide of the battle.\n\nTry the game for yourself and don't believe the negative reviews because they are being over crititcal of a game well polished for Early Access.

Secondly, this reinterpretation is done as faithful as can be (within reason). You'll  find lots of techs, buildings and modules that are basically the same in both games. At the time of this review, there are only 6 playable races, all of which have the flair of their counterparts of old. No, Psilons might not be creative any more, but their research boost is gargantuan if you tend to expand a lot like me.\n\nAll in all, this is the first game that might really be a successor to the heritage of Moo and Moo2.

I have to say I do prefer the art style of MOO2, this game is kind of cartoony the way the X-Com remake was compared to it's original. A lot of the functionality is still missing as this game is in early access, you can not make a custom race and about half of the races are still not playable.\n\nAs far as I can see there are currently no sign of the Antarans and I am not sure if they will make it into the game in any way. In terms of bugs I have noticed some spelling mistakes in the game and a few glitches but nothing game breaking at all.\n\nIf you are worried this game still has the stink left from MOO3 on it then you have nothing to worry about.

And on a side note the voices of Michael Dorn and John de Lancie really add a lot for me as I am a huge Star Trek fan.\n\nThe only issue that I have with this game is that the A.I. is not effective at building a large empire or even exploring the galaxy(I'm currently playing a large spiral galaxy), all AI species only have contact with 1 other race, and myself. Also the AI let me build a massive Empire and no one even declared war on me, they all despise me but are so afraid of me that they aren't willing to fight me.

I'm a huge fan and was very excited for this game. MOO2 was a good step up, and MOO3 was another fun step up - when it worked. Pretty much everything in this game is a throwback - in a good way - of the original game. Music, resources, tech trees, etc. They then added on some voice acting and replaced animations with better ones. So - same game, minor changes right?\n\nThey have changed tech trees. At two hours in I'm not sure how I feel. Psilon was always my race and I liked that one of their perks is that they got everything. That's not so here. You do have to choose. Combat is fun. There's some reviews coming in talking about now liking the new version. Eh. It's not finished yet and they might make tweaks. It would be nice if there was a 'turn by turn only' option. It is nice that you can just skip combat now because previously it could take SO LONG.\n\nSo far, day 1 of early access I'm shocked at how stable the game is. They have done a good job.

Other 4X games have a steep learning curve and have a lot of information thrown at you. This game has a great UI that was pretty intuitive and easy to figure out without constant tooltips. It also definitely gets you in the nostalgia if you played Master of Orion 2.\n\nThe major complaint about this game so far is that it is too easy.

There is currently no difficulty setting in the game and the computer seems to stop researching and expanding after reaching a certain point. I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be the beginner or easy difficulty.\n\nObviously it comes down to how the game looks like at release, but there's plenty of time for them to address this.

This is just another game dev company that lied about being fans of the IP and then said... lets redo the game to appeal to a broader and dumber audience.  Sort of a smack in the face to the hard core fans, but welcoming to others not that into the IP.\n\nBut this is a fun game anyways, well in my opinion.  You are not likely to play this game as long as MOO2 because all of the depth that Microprose put into their games have been removed in favor of an easier development cycle.  Dumbing games down is just short for cheaping out by the devs in my opinion and after playing this game for this long it really shows.\n\nThe only difference between a Human or a Psilon is that Psilon research faster, and that is just about it other than skins.  There is no quantafiable uniqueness to the races other than some basic race traits.  The tech tree is dumbed down.  Spying has yet to be implimented but to be honest I will have had my time with this game before it will be here.  I have played as Humans, Meklar, Psilon, Bulrathi and a custom race.  I can honestly say... they all feel the same during play through, and I crushed the living crap out of the AI on its most difficult setting easily.\n\nIt's a fun game for those that can appreciate a simple Turn based Sins of a Solar Empire in Space that does not require much thought.  Some of the old plaques of the Turn based 4x games is still there... management headache once you have 40 planets to manage getting nagged every turn that something happend.  The auto builder is pretty stupid and goes a wrote path that does not do very well explaining why the AI's are so darn weak most of the time.\n\nIf you are a die hard fan of MOO, you might want to skip this or wait till a good discount happens along to see if you can get comfy in its shoes.

It's MoO in name only: name of the game, the techs, the buildings, the races and so on. But there are a lot of differences, so you won't necessarily like this just because you liked original MoO or MoO2.\n\n2. For me, it's a thumbs up because this is the first game in ages that has really given me that 'just one more turn' feeling. In that respect it's pure MoO, and I love it.

The best way I can describe it is a mix of A Turn Based Sins of a Solar Empire and Endless Space. You start in a sector of the galaxy which itself is made up of a combination of planets, asteroids, and gas giants. Leading out of that in what I think are called warp points, they take you out of that sector and into a connecting sector. And so on and so forth. The game is beautiful and nicely detailed, the races are well animated and have great voice acting. I esp like the Terran Kahnate, I guess they are like the Klingons of the game but in human form. I was making the game harder than it had to be by just clicking through the turns waiting for this or that, but it's important to manage every planet, every turn, to maximize population effectiveness.\n\nMy only real complaint is the A.I. are very bold jerks and I don't like that you can't try to compromise on a deal they want you can only agree or disagree. They also seem to work in unison againest you, know where your ships are, and will come together if you are doing slightly better than everyone else, no matter how much they hate each other. I have been a faithful ally to the Humans in one game, went to war againest a common enemy with them, and they just decide to abandon me when someone declared war againest me. Then declared I was taking too many sectors for my own good. Oddly enough, I asked for an alligance again the next turn and we were buddy buddies again. Except I was in two wars and they were in one.\n\nGame features custom race option like MOO2 and I really enjoy it. I didn't like that the game didn't feature different government options but thats not a dealbreaker for me. But you can build a Doomstar and blow up planets so that's a relief, though I still haven't gotten that far in the game yet. Looking foward to how spying will be handled in this game, probably my least favorite part of MOO2, though I do love the Darloks.\n\nShips can be customized to suit any loadout you want, but I think you can only have 5 Custom loadouts at a time? Kind of a Bummer. Make that 8-10 slots and I think that issue wouldn't be a problem anymore. The other issue, though I guess it's not a plus or minus is the command point limit. I had twice as many planets as another empire and I still felt like I didn't have enough fleet strength to close off key sectors to keep them from expanding, and for every point over the limit, you lose about 10 or 20 BC a turn. It can add up quickly but it is managable as long as your constantly working on improving your command point limit by building more star bases.\n\nAll and all a very enjoyable experience, I'm glad they took the time to reboot a much loved series but I think most people are either going to really love this one or really hate it. But I'm looking forward to many more game time with this one.","March 30","true","20.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

If you are a gamer of the 80s and 90s and experienced the death of your social life due to MOO 1 or MOO 2 then you must pick this game up.  All of the pieces that make MOO 2 such a fantastic game of "...just one more turn." are in this game.  I've seen a lot of negative reviews on this game and I admit there is much to still be accomplished, but that's why it says it's an early access game.  That said, I played Master of Orion in the beginning of March 2016 and now at the end of March since the latest patch was released and the improvements are impressive!  The new races are a fantastic add.  The balance issues I saw before with the Psilons massively dominating with no negatives to those big brains of theirs have now been put in place.  Combat is much improved with the ability to set how fast your individual ship classes will rush into battle, and at what distance they will attempt to keep the enemy at bay.\n\nAt this time I will not create a pro/con list because it's just silly.  This game is not complete.  Spying, space combat, ground combat, diplomacy, and several other features are still being worked on.\n\nThe bottom line is this.  If you were one of the unfortunate few like myself who purchased and played MOO 3 and then cursed the sky for the game being so terrible look no further than this latest installment to restore your faith in the franchise.\n\nThat's it for now.  Time to return to Master of Orion and keep my social life at bay.","March 31","true","128.3"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

It reminds me a great deal of MoO 2, which was a phenomenal game that I played a lot. It has a lot of things going for it. The tech trees are interesting, the races are fun, and the voice acting is good. There are obviously problems. I'm not a fan of the way you have to move between systems, for one thing. The tactical combat is also not as much fun as it was in Master of Orion 2. I'm hoping that more racial customization and better tactical combat are on the way. I also hope that travel between systems gets changed a bit so that there's multiple options for how to do it. Honestly what the game is missing is more options for things.\n\nFor an Early Access version of the game, I am thrilled. I am incredibly happy that I purchased this game and do not regret it at all. If it does not get any better than it is now, I will be a little sad but I will still be happy with my purchase. Hopefully they will add more customization. Giving more racial customization as an option, better tactical combat, and allowing to choose how your game will allow you to move between systems.\n\nI have very high hopes for this game, and I do not think I will be disappointed.","April 2","true","2.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

It is clear on how to progress and upgrade both ships and planets. It is fun building up a empire and crushing a enemys with it. An this game does it well, with out all the head ache of a few other titles.\n\nMy previous complaint of the diplomat system has been vastly improved.  As were before the AI refused to back down from a war, even when there was no hope of winning is fixed.  Empires will often bow down and agree to vote for you if you are dominating them.  Tho they do tend to pick a fight over not giving them credits, even if you are the strongest military in the galaxy.\n\nI was able to maintain a few alliances since patch as well, which is a huge step in the right direction.  My only complaint about the allys is more often than not they don't support you if your attacked.  They break alliance and stay friendly with you, but avoid fighting other enemys.  Atleast until your serval times stronger than the enemy.  Thats when they fall back to the old logic of better not ♥♥♥♥ the player off our he may very will use my empire to wipe his ♥♥♥ with.\n\nAlso with the launch of the new races, I find the new races struggling to match the old races that get a science buff.  Sure you get manufacturing bonus, but its only helpful early on and late game.  Mid game any race with science bonus tends to be vastly supiour to you in tech, which makes your fleets hard press to beat them.  You literally have to friend them or kill them in the first 100 turns our your in for a painful time.\n\nOver all this latest patch has been great.  Diplomat system got a lot better and gameplay became more dynamic with the new races and the creat your own race option.  But game does need some mad race bonus tweaks.\n\nUpdate: 29 March 2016\n\nNoticed AI now builds ships to counter your designs.  I tend to love rocket boats, but since recent patch they seem to be less effective.  An noticed AI is guarding against missles a lot more with point defense builds.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCons:\n\nWould definitely be the AI.  Its actions could be improved, and  a better way to barter them down to a agreement would be nice.  Right now it feels like its their way or the highway if they ask for somthing.\n\nWould be nice to be able to make a race a slave race as well instead of just killing them off and loosing thier vote.\n\nAn the other problem would be balance of the classes.  I feel the races with science bonus diffently has the advanage past turn 100.\n\nAnyways thats my 2 cents on the game. Differently recommend it in its current state.  Especially if the improvements keep rolling out like this lastest patch.","March 25","true","64.0"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

But in the end, it seems to turn out pretty good. Even in its current state, I could smoothly play through my first match, without any crashes (minor bugs and glitches are still present, of course), and I have to say: This is fun! The interface is a lot more comfortable than in MoO2 (made possible by borrowing heavily from CiV). Starlanes change the progression of warfare alot, compared to the original, but I like the "move around inside the systems" aspect going along with them, and they have their own advantages gameplay-wise. Tactical combat is a lot more fun to watch (naturally) and a lot less tedious than in MoO2 (many combat options back then were pretty unnecessary in SP and bogged a somewhat slow combat routine only down more). Of course, combat AI needs some improvement.\n\nThe only thing I really don't like is ship editing and upgrading. The slot-system (compared to MoO2's free distribution of space) is okay and feasible, but the numbers during blueprint editing do not seem to add up correctly all the time. Often I also miss a little bit more information about how (or rather: how much) a certain weapon or subsystem effects the actual combat.\nAnd upgrading ships like in CiV does not really seem to work in a MoO. Sure, in MoO2 it could be tedious to upgrade all ships in a large fleet through production, but maybe you could add an "upgrade all"-button?).","April 2","true","13.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

There is still plenty to be implemented, and I generally agree with the direction the game is going in. From its earliest version, to the current, Master of Orion delivers an unparallelled experience. One, that I may add, was what I was hoping to see in Galacitic Civilizations III.

I don't care that you are called Bulrathi because you can research all tech from current technology benefits most of the time.".\nWell, it is also possible to make a postulate like that: "You are a Silicoid now... I don't care that you are called Bulrathi because you can colonize all planets except gas giants and asteroids now from the beginning".\nThe list may be continued. Simplified game mechanics leaves no room for visible race difference.\nIf you want some MOO, buy MOO 2 on gog.com, also you can find relativly fresh mods for it.Or buy Star drive 2 se4ctor zero, I am going to buy it soon.\nI also do not recommend to buy anything from NGD Studious or wargaming (WG Labs) from now on.\nThey are just impudent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s trying to get money for no work.\nThis guys, for example, didn't include a goverment system and leaders system in their pityfull byproduct!\nThey dare to say that just maybe they would make leader system in the future (maybe, in DLC?).\nFeatures, which there were in MOO 2 20 (yes, 20, Karl) years ago!\nImagine, I do not know, John Carmac releasing Doom 4 without armour and with decreased number of weapons in comparison with Doom 2! And tells you, that he have heard the wishes of community for armor in the game, and he is thinking that maybe somehow (DLC?) it would be implemented in some future!\nIf we would pay for such freaks, they would continue to degenerate the hole game industry.\nWell, there are also some "minor" issues for not buying this game - their game designer didn't play MOO 2 any visible amount of time and, while being cleanly identified as a civ-player (and not moo player) by MOO community, is considered to be a mediocre player in civilisation at best by some. So, while it is early access now, it is doubtfull that a good progress would be possible.\nWatching their forums, keep in mind that this freaks delete negative posts, threads, and ban unwelcomed users.\nSo, just stay away and wait for metacritic results, and compare the rating of the game with stardrive 2, stellaris, polaris sector, galactic civilisations 2-3, and think twice before supporting idiots who make a remake of 20 years old game cutting off many important features of it and adding about nothing but graphics, Well, this stupid creatures also boast that they hired a well-known artists for postcoring an advisors for this game, but periodically on the forum appear themes were people ask to shut down some of them because they are very annoying.","April 13","false","85.2"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","16","32","3","0"

I sat down just to give it a try and...well there went five hours! I highly enjoy the new incarnation of this game. It's simple to learn and control, but has enough depth to keep me interested. The Early Access is stable (no crashes at all in a 5 hour play session) and the game is surprisingly polished. There are a few features that will clearly be added later such as espionage, but I didn't feel like I was missing any major part of the game when playing it. At first I thought the real-time combat might not be as fun as the more traditional turn-based, but it's quick and easy and pretty to watch. The entire game is pretty gorgeous so far.

But in the end, it seems to turn out pretty good. Even in its current state, I could smoothly play through my first match, without any crashes (minor bugs and glitches are still present, of course), and I have to say: This is fun! The interface is a lot more comfortable than in MoO2 (made possible by borrowing heavily from CiV). Starlanes change the progression of warfare alot, compared to the original, but I like the "move around inside the systems" aspect going along with them, and they have their own advantages gameplay-wise. Tactical combat is a lot more fun to watch (naturally) and a lot less tedious than in MoO2 (many combat options back then were pretty unnecessary in SP and bogged a somewhat slow combat routine only down more). Of course, combat AI needs some improvement.\n\nThe only thing I really don't like is ship editing and upgrading. The slot-system (compared to MoO2's free distribution of space) is okay and feasible, but the numbers during blueprint editing do not seem to add up correctly all the time. Often I also miss a little bit more information about how (or rather: how much) a certain weapon or subsystem effects the actual combat.\nAnd upgrading ships like in CiV does not really seem to work in a MoO. Sure, in MoO2 it could be tedious to upgrade all ships in a large fleet through production, but maybe you could add an "upgrade all"-button?).","April 2","true","13.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

If you're frugal with your gaming dollar, you would be better off buying Endless Space, Stellaris, or one of the Galactic Civilizations. In fact, if your appetite for 4X goes past sci-fi, there are number of other products awaiting your purchase over this MOO instead, such as Warlock 2.\n\nI feel like this is a hard criticism to levy at a group of folks who are lovingly trying to reintroduce an old game to a new generation, but the simple fact is that this genre has advanced, and this MOO reboot ignores those advancements in favor of nostalgia.

Today, after playing the early access of Masters of Orion, the title has been taken by this Early Access.  This is my review after playing two full games as the Psilons and Humans.\n\nPROS:\n\n-They stayed true to the old Masters of Orion 2 secret sauce\n-Fantastic modernization of graphics and UI (Star Map is beautiflul!)\n-Races feel as they did in the previous game (and improved).\n-Game feels very polished and I did not encounter any issues other than some labels that need to be updated.\n\nRecommendations for Improvement:\n\n-Bring back ground combat that is visual like it was in Masters of Orion 2 (This may simply just not be implemented yet).\n-It's really hard to make an alliance, and keep one.  It's a little too punishing and I was not able to create one without giving them all my money plus monthly payments and giving them one of my best planets.

Also when I raised influence with other races, over the course of about 5 turns my influence would continue to reduce until it sat back at the middle neutral point.\n-The pollution mechanic is interesting, but causes more micromanagement of planets which I didn't find very enjoyable.\n-I would recommend making the icon of current population of a planet larger on the galaxy view.\n-Playing as humans (blue color) it was sometimes difficult to see where my planets were when I was zoomed out.\n\nExceeded my wildest expectations.\n15/10","February 26","true","30.1"," 22 of 45 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","22","45","0","0"

Granted, the majority of it was Master of Orion II back in the 90s. I did give Master of Orion I a shot around then as well... and I had pre-ordered Master of Orion III and gotten my disappointment just as quickly as I possibly could have.\n\nThat being said, as I see it, Master of Orion is a worthy successor to the franchise. The game-play feels almost nostalgic in a lot of ways. The updated graphics really lend to the overall universe and flesh it out even more than before. It feels like an immersive experience, just like Master of Orion II did. It will pull you in and hold you for the next turn... that turns to 100 turns...\n\nI have to say it has been more than what I had hoped. The Early Access was more than a fair deal for the price (and I really rarely do early access at all) and the features aren't as limited as other early access games I have seen.\n\nI look forward to posting on the community boards as the dev team said they would be interacting with players regularly for feedback and to possibly implement changes.\n\nThe few things I have found missing (I've got about 200+ turns and a boatload of tech research under my belt. I have found Orion and made first contact with half of the AI):\n1. Governors and specialists for hire to assign to colonies\n- I didn't think they were all that necessary until you don't have them... and sometimes they really gave an edge. Not    really central to the game, but a great mechanic.\n- Psilon research: At times, you have to choose what tech is granted with the research. This may have been a way to try to balance the races a bit. Classically, Psilons did not have to choose what advance to gain from a tech, no matter what the tech might be.\n\nThings implemented that were kinda neat:\n- Pirate colonies that had varying levels of ships coming at you (easy at first and getting harder as time goes on)\n- Unstable warp gates (impassable until you could research the appropriate tech)\n- Unique ship designs (thank you so much for Psilon Saucers)\n- Amazing voice acting\nand many more features...\n\nDefinitely get it. Try it. Make your loved ones miss you as you disappear into the galaxy. Victory is always just a few turns away...\n\nMay update the review as time goes on... I look forward to the rest of the game coming... and being Master of Orion.\n\nEdit 2/29/16:\nAfter a couple of play-throughs (one as Psilon and another as Sakkra), I wanted to amend the review I had put up.\n- The graphics are great. On my machine, the graphics detect did not work, so that feature may not yet be available.\n- Micromanagement AI could be a little better using auto-build/colony focus. I find it building some buildings that are odd at the time (ie. Marine Barracks while not even close to war-time or food buildings whenever there is a surplus instead of productivity buildings)\n- Combat is really nice. Real time combat vs Turn based was a surprise, but not bad. Managing combat can be tricky, however, if you do not make use of the pause button.\n- Some bugs are very apparent in the game. I have had to submit several bug reports in a single play session.\n- The beginning star system seems to have a planet and a gas giant. Always. Seems like a big bug to me...\n\nAll in all, even with the bugs, Master of Orion is a very awesome game and still worth the play time and the money. I look forward to the future of development and the bug fixes and to see where all of this leads to.","February 25","true","26.8"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","20","41","0","1"

But I have played my share of 4X and this one is really scratching the "just... one... more... turn..." itch.\nIt is a teensy bit on the easy side and diplomacy is a bit confusing (IA seems to make up their mind about me pretty much regardless of my behavior and negotiations with them), but those things might get fixed in the months to come... and it's already a great way to kill time.","February 26","true","33.8"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","18","37","0","0"

I would say on a scale of -10 to +10 it would fall around a 0 at this stage.)\n\nRight now, what we have is a reboot of MoO II, with not all the functionality implimented, but with the graphics updated and reimagined.\n\nUPDATE: If you are looking for a remake/update of MoO II, this is not it!  It is a reimagining of the franchise into a "beer and pretzils" game that can be completed in an hour or so, reguardless of size or complexity settings.  Not much strategy involved, just build and kill.  Die hard fans of MoO II will be disappointed.  If you're open to a simple, not very involved game, much like World of Tanks or World of Warships, then you might warm up to what WG is serving up here.\n\nGraphics are what you would expect from WG, fantastic.\nDepth of gameplay is minimal at this time, only 6 races are included at present. (Warning: The voiceovers have been processed to the point of being nearly unrecognizable.  Dorn sounds like Shultz.  Pity, Dorn has a great voice.  Only Hamill's and deLancie's voice are identifiable.)\nMap is way too small for 5 races.  There needs to be a readjustment as to the size ranges as even the largest map is only sutiable for 3  players.\nAI all play the same.  The only distinction I see is the Sakkra breed like rabibits (despite the Buthri being the first to get three planets) and being the most agressive, usually win.  Psilons never seem to get a good setup with other races running into them by turn 5 or 6, even with three players.\nLatest hotfix seems to be moving things in the wrong direction.  AI home systems will be within 5 systems of yours, causing you to be hemmed in between all of them before turn 20.  Talk about strangling the baby in the crib.\nDiplomatic choices consist of extort, gift and war if you go with the default 5 AI players.  Also be prepaired to fight after getting your first colony as this will trigger the neighbors to curb stomp your butt.  On the other hand, if you start with fewer than 4 AI opponents, and you have the luck of a good set-up, then you have a chance to actually negotiate with the AI... for a while.  Fail to agree with the AI once triggers a negitive slide in relations.  A second disagreement with the AI's attempts at extortion are met with war.\nResearch is pretty much "choose, wait, complete, refit, rinse repeat".  I presume this will improve, though it will be interesting to see how.  Also take note if the tech icons have a bar between them (the OR sign if you're a programmer) or not, if so, you only get one of the techs, which you get to choose after research is complete.\nAs I proceed further and WG adds features I will update this review.  The skinny on this "early access" (2/26/2016) is "Don't expect much right now."\n\nSide Note: The early access also includes MoO I, II and III.  I have to say the folks at WG did a smashing job of repackaging these games.  MoO I and II run under Dosbox, MoO I is a bit finicky though and will crash on start up unless you set Dosbox to the game's original resolution (800x600).  MoO II runs flawlessly.  What really amazes me is they managed to repackage MoO III to run without having to install all the crap that it required when it was relesed.  My psyche still bears the scars of making my system unstable just to "run" (using the term loosely) the darn thing and arguing with the developers that it was a stupid idea to have 4 external dependancies.

Just try it if you haven't.\n\nThis is just the beggining and there is much more content to come for sure. Key points of notice so far:\n\n1. Star lanes is a huge + to gameplay as it makes  for a much more strategic game. In MO2 without warp inhibitor it would be impossible to stop all e nemy invasions at once when they have good drives. I think that was MO2's weakest feature although still a great game.\n\n2. Missles were fairly useless in MO2 past mid tere. In this version they seem uber powerfull. I don't think they need  nerf just a study of the eefectiveness of counter measures. ECM seems uselesss so far.\n\n3. AI needs work. That is almost 100% certain for any new strategy game.\n\n4. A better outline of each races special attributes is needed. I think though the creators f the game are planning to release this when the full version comes out.\n\n5. Enabling tactical combat for multi-player is a must. I'm undecided if the game needs the old style tactical from MO2 back. It may make multi player games to dragged out.

Its nice to find that sweet goldilocks planet but thankfully you can eventually research planet terraforming minus the Xenomorphs....\n\nIts Early Access but apart from a single bug which just seemed like a graphical glitch this game feels complete even more so than a lot of other released games from certain publishing houses. Its got the full support from Wargaming so its not going to vanish and is certainly worth the money.\n\nIf you are looking for something that hits the sweet spot with being just the right mix of challenge and relaxation without ever feeling stressed or too challenged then this is it. I built the 'Titan' battleship and it got destroyed by six enemy cruisers so I built ten cruisers and carried on stomping the enemy into the ground without having to reload or pull hair out. Something goes bang.......just build another one.\n\nThere is a 'tactical' element to the game but at the minute it seems more just who has the biggest gun/guns wins. Its all relative to size and numbers as I mentioned earlier 5 cruisers can kill a Titan but it also depends on their tech level and you can use different abilities in battle but if you like you can just sit back and let the A.I do the work.\n\nThe game almost sits happily between the adult and child audience that it is no doubt targeted at but there are a notable few things that do seem more child friendly than adult and if you are looking for a hardcore space strategy simulation or even civiliazation in the stars then this will probably not quite be what you are hoping for but it is probably the closest thing to it and who knows where it might develop.\n\nWould i recommend you buy this game right now; Yes. It feels complete even though you know when playing through it that there are certain element missing none of it detracts from the game experience.\n\nRunning everything on max in 1080p with all civilizations and the largest galaxy I would guess that everytime I hit the end turn key it was my go again in less than 5 seconds and that was still almost the same after 300+ turns\n\nOne word of caution though; it does at times to me feel sometimes overly simple and not as indepth as it could be but then again by the time of the final release it may feel deep and complex.","February 26","true","41.8"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","0"

First impressions however are good. The game evokes the feel of it's predecessors right out of the gate. There are certainly differences though and I suspect purists are going to take issue with several of them. I myself have been playing Master of Orion and Master of Orion II off & on since they were released. Master of Orion II has been installed and played on every computer I've owned over the last two decades! So while I may not consider myself a "purist" in the manner I'm using it, I'm certainly a fan. And as a fan I can say that I like this game.\n\nThe "feel" of the game is just about right. The visuals, audio and the like are all well done and I find that barring a few missing options that the UI is well put together. The races are well done, though the racial traits have certainly been toned down from the previous titles. In some way I'm glad to see this, as traits like "creative" provided too great an advantage, but the flip side is that the races seem a bit less unique. One or two more traits per race would be nice to see.\n\nMuch ado has been made over features such as star lanes v free travel and real-time combat v turn-based tactical combat. In the case of the former I've found no real issues, star lanes simply don't change the gameplay in any negative way I've seen so far. The tactical combat is a bit of a let down as it stands right now though. Shield facings, careful use of weapons and specials are all more or less gone now. Even turning off the auto-AI and pausing combat to issue orders doesn't stack up to the older combat. Luckily for me I never played Master of Orion for the tactical combat. Some do though and it's a point to consider.\n\nOverall, as a sort of tldr, I find the gameplay engaging, fun and it reminds me of playing the games of my youth. So it's a win in my book so far.\n\nAnyway, as you can tell I'm not going to make pro-con list or anything of the sort, but I am going to recommend the game to those interested. Keep in mind though the game is still in development and a lot is subject to change I'm sure, so if your wary of the title because you don't think it can match up to the games of old or because you dislike WG (something I've run into as a reason to avoid the title) then keep your money for now and see how the game develops. No reason to part with your hard-earned cash if you're unsure. For me though? This was worth it.","February 27","true","11.7"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","0"

They've played it pretty safe,  you'll recognize the technologies, the alien species (based on Orion 1's style/look) being able to design ships and put them to good use.\nYou'll reckognize tiny little details like the Master of Orion 1 colonization theme when establishing new colonies.\nYou'll see creatures like giant "Space Eels" and many many other things you'll reckognize from the originals.\n\nThat said? There have been changes, there's now a space-lane system (that you might reckognize from other4x games) rather than the fee jump where you want (that's within range) , to me this works, though you'll have to play the game differently (fortify key systems to avoid the enemy pushing through)\nSo, if any enemy empire has hidden their weak/developing systems, behind an wall of fortified systems?

The game runs smoothly on my older system and looks fantastic. I'm not real happy with the combat mechanics yet and I'm a bit on the fence about the star lanes aspect. Need more stars on the map but this is really looking like they did a lot of things right. The game runs well and is playable as is. I haven't run into place holder text yet and it's clear they are putting in content updates when they are complete and ready for inclusion in the play of the game.\n\nI'd write a long review but I must get back to the game... It's finally here! :D\n\nUpdated for Early Access 2 release:\n\nUpdated combat is a LOT better than their first Early Access 1 release. Diplomacy still stinks badly. New additions and rebalances of the racial traits are showing they are making some progress towards a very playable release. Indicators are that the difficulty slider is just an economic boost. Would be nice if this were more impactful than just BC per turn.\n\nGame still runs very smoothly and looks quite nice. They did a rebalance on some audio and that makes the intro to the GNN clips a bit low volumed when they start out on my system.\n\nStill eager to see how they impliment the espionage aspect of the game.

It's fun and rewarding and the depth is there when you start playing multiplayer (as the AI isn't challenging atm, it's Early access after all).\n\nEarly Early Access review\nI've played through the game about 6 times now, 2 of those were multiplayer: I loved most things.  Since this is an early access review I won't be mentioning things like balance or tech-tree progression as things like that can be changed at a drop of a hat and I'm sure would be a utter waste of development time right now.\n\nThings that are in place: Galaxy overview & planetary control, tactical battles, ship design and diplomacy.\n\nThese are all in a very basic form apart from the galaxy overview.\n\nThe galaxy controls are pretty robust, you can move your ships around and most things already have useful tooltips.  You can see how long a planet's production has left to finish it's next item and stuff like that.  Even trading between planets in the same system can happen (including production points with the right setup!!!).\n\nThe planetary control gets a bit micro management heavy later in the game but I'm still processing turns in less than 30 seconds now I know what I'm doing even then.  Things like build order lists would be good for different types of planets but you can queue 5 things at once and if you don't mind thinking about which 5 to build when you first colonise then it's good.  It's fun to balance between growth, research and production.  It's easy to see where the points are coming from and to balance that one point of research/production to finish the next item.  Although when you don't have enough food and your planet's population starts dying, it can be confusing as to why the food from your empire isn't getting there.  Income and expenses can also be confusing.\n\nThe tactical battles look great, but you can tell it's just not finished yet.  It plays ok and I'm able to sway battles in my favour if I use it and don't simulate (I reloaded a battle that lost on simulate, but won without loss on tactical).  This is the same with planetary defense... how strong are they?  We don't know but I'm sure it's just a work in progress and will improve later in the EA before release.\n\nDiplomacy: I don't really care much for AI diplomacy on any 4x game and just declare war on everybody, so I'm not the man to ask about that stuff.\n\nIn conclusion\nSo if you don't mind playing a in-progress Early Access, then get it now and have fun!  If you want to wait until the complete experience is ready... well then wait.  I couldn't wait and I've already got my money's worth!","March 1","true","130.6"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","15","31","0","0"

Buy it and enjoy.\n\nIf you were a fan of the original moo2 game you might find it a little lacking.   It's not quite as indepth as the original.   Combat is simplified and and so is ship design.   Don't get me wrong, they did a good job on it, but they didn't make it better through depth.   They took out some of the annoying things from the original but did not make anything new that would let you explore new and interesting combat strategies.\n\nCombat just kinda happens.   You have some, but not much, control over it.  But unlike the original, you wont get bogged down microing.  I think this would have been better done through an updated UI.  Instead they just simplified the whole thing.\n\nBut at the end of the day I am having tons of fun playing it.  And that's what really matters.   So stop reading, click buy, then download, and then play.

Just in case you were wondering. I bet they'll be in the DLC, heaven knows you'll pay $20 for some space drow fanservice. Right?\n\nMOOX is basically a reskinned - and simplified - version of MOO2. Note that MOO2 was not at all a complex game to begin with. The AI is much more forgiving than in MOO2: it is less aggressive, less intelligent, and also gets a much smaller production handicap.\n\nThe diplomacy is an awkward mix of the rather outdated and opaque systems from MOO2 and Civ3: you can create deals a la carte, but it is difficult to predict whether the AI will accept them (and there is *always* a rep penalty for a failed proposal, even if your offer is only marginally less than what the AI would accept).\n\nThe game fails hardest at the strategic level. The basic problem with the game is lack of player choice, combined with pig-headed AI that sends out fleets to destroy everything in their path until they are ground down by attrition by the player. In sum, the AI has the level of intelligence and sophistication one would expect from a game written 25 years ago.\n\nThe game has a very low skillcap and basically plays like a piece of freeware or one of those no-name 4X games you can find in the bargain bin at Staples. These days, one could literally get a better game for free. This is not a game worth the same retail price as Starcraft II or Fallout 4.\n\nMOOX has the makings of a good game, but I think the dev team is overly cautious and uninspired - I get the feeling the devs are from B-game companies and the dev team leadership is really tepid and just copies features from other games, rather than innovating and doing internal testing - and the end result will fall far short of its potential, which is a shame because MOOX does, like I said, have a lot of unrealized potential. Maybe modders will play with it later. Frankly, I think the goal at the corporate level was just to make a low-budget, B-team $50 cash cow players would plop down money on for sheer nostalgia. From a financial standpoint, I have no doubt they succeeeded.\n\nAnyway, bottom line - in terms of game experience, this game just isn't worth it. Don't waste your money.\n\nGame elements in MOO2 gone from MMOX include:\n- Almost all tech implementation picks (a handful of techs have them on an individual basis)\n- Intra-system colony pods\n- Boarding parties and self-destruct\n- Freighters\n- Spies (apparently not yet implemented, although the overall structure of the game suggests this functionality will be very limited)\n\nCompared with MOO3:\n- Spacelanes, a really bad design element, are in evidence\n- System (sublight) ships, which were actually a cool idea, are not in evidence\n- Moon development does feature in the game but is very, very limited, offering only a few bonus points for a couple touch-and-go improvements\n\nSuggestions for devs:\n- Remove spacelanes\n- Buff AI intelligence and strength\n- Add more options overall\n- Make the game pacing more variable; differentiate short/long-game choices\n- Add system ships, the ship design system from MOO3 was basically good but poorly implemented\n- Reintroduce features from MOO3 without making them overwhelming or inconsequential\n- More terraforming / economic customization\n- More races\n- Less cliche in race design (hurr durr big tough guy / indigenous nation mystics)","April 3","false","84.7"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","15","31","3","4"

They game of course is in early access, and several races are not playable at this point as well as some features that are sure to come at a later date. That being said, the game is absolutely playable, no bugs that I have encountered, and is entertaining as it is engrossing.\n\nMOO and others like it are the sort of games that take up HOURS of your life in an eye blink. You are so enveloped in what your are doing that you are eagerly advancing turns to get that colony ship to that prime real estate planet before your neighbor, or rushing that ship to change the tide of war in a contested system.  That is what I want from a game, and so far I have not been disappointed.\n\nThe game's workings are fairly easy to understand, there is no tutorial match available (that I was able to access at least) but they game has an abundance of hints. Some things were a bit of a mystery, like worker strikes, but playing long enough provided the explanation needed. It's a straightforward game and unlike MOO3 (which was my favorite, don't judge) its streamlined things to a point where you aren't having to micromanage every aspect of gameplay. I am surprised with how well the game plays so far that it was put into Early Access. Stellaris may have a thing or two to do with that. We are still missing some races as I mentioned above, but other than expanding the map sizes, adding the races, beefing up the tech tree, I don't see much else that needs to be done.\n\nSpace combat is pretty much just like MOO3, over in 30 seconds. I don't think it has ever been MOO series strong point. The bombardment screen is really disappointing. I loved MOO3's planetary bombardment, It was visceral and made me feel like "This is genocide, the systematic extermination of all life on Arrakis!" Now it's "bloop" you dropped a bomb, there goes item A, B, or C. That's something I would like see fixed up before leaving Early Access.\n\nPlanet management is similar to other 4x titles, but like I said previously, you can fully automate planet management and no micro management required. I picked a large map and was a little miffed at first. It seemed so small, especially compared to MOO3. But as I played it became clear that just 4 or 5 planets is enough to keep you busy. Still, I want 200 plus star system maps like M003 in the future (Huge map size perhaps?)\n\nThe AI is fairly predictable, scooping up and taking every available world and stellar object available to them. I would have to play longer to say this isn't the case for all AI, but so far it seems to be. A little more variety would be nice to see, but with Early Access things are going to change. Some variation besides the rush, turtle, and other playstyles would be interesting. Maybe a randomized "arch enemy" that the AI will go after over all else, even if it's on the other side of the map.\n\nI've played Star Ruler, Endless Space, Distant Worlds, Space Empires, Galactic Civ, etc. For me, MOO is the most fun to play and the one game that I believe will manage to keep my interest for longer than a few hours. However, I am eagerly awaiting Stellaris, and that could change things up quite a bit. Masters of Orion has more than just an homage to look and lore of the games previously in the series, it is very much a game of its time. Smooth gameplay, nice graphics, an easy but useful UI, I'd venture to say this game is about as good as a successor to the Master of Orion series as there could be.\n\nTLDR: The game is a solid 8/10 even in Early Access. With the collector's Edition it's worth its 50 dollar price.\n\nUPDATE: Finished a playthrough. Dissappointed by the 500 turn limit, wanted to see more of the tech tree than I did. I only ever lost one battle, and its because I didn't simulate it when I probably should have. AI needs to up its game.

Everyone will have gripes about this portion or that portion, However overall, the pain of suffering through Independantly created MOO2 Clones is finally over!\n\nRather than trying to make the game into something new, They did what MOO needed done. They have (successfully) recreated the feel of MOO and MOO2.\n\nThe biggest complaint I've seen is in the combat system. And yes, It does feel a good bit simplistic at this stage, and Real Time Combat is a bit troublesome (Basically, its a nicely polished version of Sword of the Star's ShipVShip combat). Some have asked so I'll be sure to throw it in here, that combat IS pausable for a little bit of tactics, However I've not yet had a large enough fight between two fleets to need to use it often. On that note It still needs some polishing, but it IS an early release version. As an afterhought here, Having it real time does fix my biggest headache in MOO2, My fleet of 20 Heavy Ships VS the AI's 250 ship fleet and the 5 minute turns of combat....\n\nThe voice acting is FANTASTIC. I'm very impressed with it so far. The audio there does seem a bit rough with my 5.1 Logitech headset, however I'm not 100% sure if its on my end or not (enabling Surround sound actually seemed to fix the issue).\n\nOn the Planetary managment level, Its just slightly above the complexity of MOO2, But just as easy to understand after a short bit of play.\n\nGround combat is MOO2 style (Marines fighting it out), and I'd like to see a bit of an increase in it before the final version... At least more to watch than two counters batteling it out.\n\nA lot of people have also commented on the use of Star Lanes... Personally I'm a fan, however I do see how that could be a headache for Diehard MOO2 Fans. It could be an option towards the final release, not sure how deeply encoded it is into the game...\n\nIf I did have one complaint, Its actually in the research. (Research is VERY deep already in this game, Its not the system itself I'm mad at, Its almost right out of the MOO Handbook to be honest). Currently there doesn't seem to be a perk for being "Creative" over a standard race... Although a Few techs are Either-Or (Only played Human, Not sure if this holds true for the Psilons or not), Most techs are fully open. I'd love to see it go to the classic A-B-C style used in the previous games, as it adds a lot of strategic depth.... Deciding between titans/Battleoids and Starbases has always been one of my biggest dreads in MOO...\n\nSo, To summarize, I'm proud to say I no longer have to say "This is the best thing since MOO2".

That has been removed. The combat in this re-boot is pausable real-time, where you can only direct your ships what targets to attack.

While other games allready tried to claim that title, wargaming bought the whole frenchise and hired some of the old programmers to get best results.\n\nFirst of all, I do not mind getting battles real-time in this version. Some other successors allready did...and did well with this decission. You may take a look on Star Drive 2 about that. I really guess it wasn't an easy decission for wargaming, but by targeting multiplayer for final challenge, there simply wasn't any other choice. Just think about a single battle lasting 20min while 4-6 other players just sit and watch empty screen...then you'd more likely accept RT battle system. Well, if they deliver a turn-based system exclusively for singleplayer later, it would be perfect.\n\nGame is well made, no greater bugs or broken mechanics so far. It is still Early Access, which means, game and content will certainly undertake massive changes till release. As for my personal rating, it is ok. It is fun to play and explore the game, while I rate 45€ for an EA quite ambitious. ^^\nIf you could get it on sale or could grab you a key from other store price should be more balanced. Something near half the current price I'd give it a go.\n\nOnly thing I recognized to be a bit disturbing so far is steady ship-design upgrade after researching new tech. Quite nice automation, but that might switch your personal designs deeply, so be prepared to re-visit ship designer every now and then for control.\n\nStill not found all tech, but looking forward to get lot of fun till I reach my goal.\n\n**EA2 patch**\n\nNew update brought 2+1 new empires. Klackons, Mekklars and another human (Terran) for early access buyers. Also you could design your very own custom version of given empires.\n\nResearch is a bit delayed now, which is great as it was too easy to get through the whole research plan on the run. Single technical steps do get more weight and enhances gameplay.\n\nSome slight changes in options allows more customization...like starting battles on pause and else. AI seems to be enhanced...not yet tried on hard mode...looking forward.\n\nBest thing is plenty of written localizations, so everybody could play game in his favorite language. Advisors speaking still in english or russion of course.\n\nAll in all stable and fun. Still early access, but all things point in promising direction.","March 5","true","107.2"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

There is plently to do already, and I played through a full campaign with no crashes at all. As a 4X game it is most excellent. Having ploughed many hours into GalCiv 3 I can happily state that MOO is more fun. In it current state it is not, perhaps, quite as deep as Stardocks behemoth, but it is immensley enjoyable with a deep tech tree and endless options for customising your ships (which is something i have not really delved into). The voice acting is superb, as might be expected from a cast which includes Mark Hamill, John de Lancie and Alan Tudyk.\n\nYes there are still missing features, and it could possibly do with better documentation and a tutorial but the game already feels like a finished product. In terms of extra features, the only thing I would add would be an experience system for your fleets, and possibly the option of adding Admirals who level up with them.\n\nOverall, if you are looking to scratch the 4X itch, and GalCiv is a bit heavy (and graphically suspect) give this a whirl. I don't think you will be disappointed.","March 1","true","21.2"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

A very polished EA game that, from my understanding, is going to be fully released by the end of the year or early next year.

This is largly because it takes some of its content from a genuinely great 4X game, MOO2, that was so good that it is still excellent (in spite of some flaws) after 20+ years.\n\nThe research categories are taken from MOO2, but they are broken up into smaller pieces that are incremental. Where, for example, in MOO2 an Automated Factory would give +5 production and an additional +1 production per person, in this game the Automated factory merely gives +2 Production, making it an incremental change rather than a major strategical achievement.\n\nThe designers, in their words about design admitted openly (see Steam discussions)  that building an almost chess-like 4X game like MOO2 was beyond their programming capacity. In MOO2 the one who went first in major battles would depend upon something called initiative, based on speed and maneuvering capability. This worked very well and typically with two relatively equal human players in a large battle the best ship or two of each side would go first and then the other ships. It worked extremely well, while the developers of this game called it "unwarranted complexity" and claimed they just couldn't do it.\n\nPlease read some of the positive reviews for discussion of this new games virtues. There are all some and sadly it is better than many 4X attempts there because they did take a lot from MOO2... but not nearly enough. That is the reason this is very sad.\n\nHopefully, someday, a genuine reboot or sequel to MOO2 will be made. The tragic part is that the existance of this game might give potential backers the false impression that such a reboot/sequel has already been done, which it has not.\n\nI did pay my $50 and play this game to give it a shot. I could give a balanced look at the positive qualities, but instead, in this review I merely wish to share my deep feelings of heartbroken disappointment. It is frustrating when designers just cannot understand what is great about a game they are trying to reboot or give a sequel to.\n\nFor comparison there is a great colony building game called Outpost that was turn-based and genuinely great but rushed too quickly into production without completing it. When Outpost II came out it had been made by some clueless executive at Sierra into an action game. As an avid Outpost enthusiast waiting for a sequel/completion of the original, I was offered a free copy of Outpost II which I refused. I don't care about the $40 then or the $50 I paid now. I care because a great game like MOO2 has never been rebooted or done with current graphics, refinement of the random event/initiative systems, a better AI, etc. This game took from MOO2, but changed way too much of what made it great.","March 3","false","121.0"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Apparently, Wargamining has tried to be true to the original, while modernizing the looks and the interface and such (btw, interface is really almost perfect)\n\nAnd it is fun to play. That is the thing that matters most! The same old- building a death star and wiping off one planet after another is precious. That feeling alone makes the game worthwhile. Of course, there is still plenty of other things as well.\n\nNow, there is still plenty of things wrong with the game, but this is Early Access after all. So don't get too worried. I hope.  But to be fair, if this game was out now, i'd give it a thumbs down.\n\nThe issues:\n\n- Enemy AI is... well, calling it stupid would be insult to stupid everywhere. No use of terraforming, declaring wars and then not attacking, i've yet to see war between AI races end and so on and so on.\n- Tactical Battles is not. It's fancy cinematic watching your ships beat the crap out of enemy ships, space monsters and bases. And yes, beating the crap out of things is the usual result. Cause the AI is damn stupid. At least, it's satisfying.\n- Reseach is too fast.\n- The races are not different enough. Some bonuses, but otherwize, they all play the same. And humans are most pointless race ever.\n- Tech tree is a copy-pase from Civilization. Meaning, booring.\n- After achieving military victory and destroying half of the planets in the galaxy in the process (thank you very much, death stars), all you get is "Congratulations, you have won, click ok to continue" popup.

If you want that, this game will sorely disappoint you.  That said, I went into playing this game with that exact mentality.  I have had many systems over the years, and MOO2 was almost always among the first games to get installed on it.  I cannot even begin to imagine how many hours I've spent playing the game and inventing new ways to try and beat the game (Single Doomstar Antaran win, anyone?).  So, when I heard that a new MOO was out, I was excited to have my old MOO2 back with better graphics.\n\nWhat I got was a game that is far different than that.  For starters, star lanes and non-turn based combat was a huge turnoff.  In fact, those two items alone almost made me uninstall initially.  But I decided to give it another shot, and what I ound was that, even though those elements were different, they were ultimately changes for the best.  Gone are the days where a Darlok fleet randomly drops a giant fleet in the furthest backwater area of your empire out of nowhere, and that's fine.  Do I miss that sort of random thing?  Maybe.  But does it make for a better strategic framework for a human vs AI game?  Absolutely.\n\nIn regards to combat, a few things need tweaked, but it is quite playable in its current iteration.  If you are thinking the real-time combat is like that unspeakable mess of MOO3, it isn't.  It likely is an issue where you are misunderstanding the controls (like I did initially), but a sticky on the official forums will bring you up to speed and bring you around on it.\n\nNow, to the overwhelming good of the game.  The voice acting and research trees are great.  Are they great in the conventional sense?  Eh, it isn't Mass Effect or something, but as a huge sci-fi nerd, hearing familiar voices from my favorite actors is a fine bit of nostalgia.  Similarly, the tech tree creates many of the same feelings.  Researching jump gates, battle pods, and other techs from yesteryear are fun, and the more I play, some of the choices forced by the tech tree are genuinely meaningful.\n\nSome areas of the game, still in early access, are up in the air for me.  Diplomacy seems pointless right now, the AI is a little too pacifistic, tech research a bit too fast and a passive afterthought (think autolab x100), and the spy process seems promising, but under-defined currently.  Also, MOO2 races need to come back, and even some of the races from MOO3 would be nice (races is one of the few things that game did right).\n\nIn summary, if you loved MOO1 or MOO2, buy this game and give it a chance.  If you can't stand early access titles, wait a bit and get it on release.  While it isn't a re-skin, it is a genuinely good title, and one that makes up for the abomination that was MOO3.","June 3","true","27.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Despite being not finished, it has a lot of contens and the bugs don't retract from the overal positive experience. If you like 4X games, you'll like this one. If you want details, read the below.\nIt has been a long time since we have last seen a big player on the 4X market, and this time we get a new game in one of the legendary series. But most of us were worried, because Master of Orion haven't been well last time we've seen it. Is it a game we know and love this time?\n\nWell, it is and it is and it isn't. There's actually a very good reason to call it a Master of Orion, without any number at the end. It's not really a sequel, it's a remaster, a reinterpretation of the series that takes the good things we know from the first and the second one, and adds a lot of new ideas to keep the series fresh. And it's actualy a very good thing, who'd want to just get another MOO2 with better graphics? (probably a lot of people acutally...).\n\nSo what's good? The game looks awesome! The artstyle is charmful and very clean, everything looks neat and very well designed. Each race's ships are unique and feel like they belong, the races themselves still have their souls along with the new looks, and their voice actors are doing an excellent job. Actually I could recognize some of the voice actors, they are no small fishes. All the basic mechanics the 4X has to have are here as well, and they work as they should. Tech tree is expansive and interesting, ship building is advanced enough to be fun (if it's impactful that's another thing), we have our standard diplomacy, etc. The only thing that's not in the game yet is espionage, but from how everything else looks I am really positive it's going to be done at least decently.\n\nNow, it might look like the "Bad" paragraph is way bigger, but it's only because I want to go into detail. Okay then, time to talk about things that are not good. First and foremost, man don't I hate that combat system. This time around they tried to do RTS-like battles. You control your units in real time, and fly them on the 2d plane, while they shoot at the enemies. Sounds great, and It's pretty to look at the first couple of times, but then you get bored with it because you discover you don't really have much control over how the battle is going to go, whatever you do won't affect the outcome of the battle to a meaningful degree. Combat UI is the only one in the game that isn't intuative, your control over units is very limited and whatever active ability you have on your ship (there is a couple, yes) is not impactful enough to even care about using them. Weapons are also imbalanced, and there is no rock-paper-scissor system in the game which means there ALWAYS is the best ship build or the best weapons you can use, there is no strategizing there. The only way to counter your oponent is to have a bigger fleet with more guns. Speaking of the oponents, the game difficulty seems suprisingly easy. As my second game, I decided to play it on the highest difficulty, without any diplomacy and alliances, pure 1vAll conquest, and I was able to mostly keep up through the whole game with every AI and spiral out of control somewhere in the middle, while being at war with 3 of them. Maybe it's because the AI didn't feel like it was cheating at any point (faster population growth or building), or maybe because I'm a veteran of this genre. It'd be nice to be able to give the AI some unfair adventages so the game remains challenging.\n\nThe game is also full of bugs of all kind: interface feels unresponsive when you try to quickly navigate, sometimes scrolling on Empire screen breaks and goes all over the place, missaligned text that changes position when you cycle through ship options, game sometimes crashes completely when you design ships, battle result screen has trouble displaying correct information, "Null_underscore_humanpoints" text like this replacing... something else that should be there, mostly minor bugs that aren't game breaking and hopefuly will be fixed. Aside from problems, there are features that I expect to be there or that should be implemented soon, like espionage, more galaxy types and sizes, more race customization and map options, general quality of life improvements. Also I'd love to see some things change, like the god damn "Upgrade All Blueprints" button that ♥♥♥♥S UP all of your ship designes when you only wanted to upgrade all the shields to the next tier, or the inability to do anything when it's not your turn, at least let me check how my empire is doing so I don't have to search for things during my own time.\n\nDespite the game having a lot of problems at it's current state, I had a lot of fun playing it! I decided to wait until we get a more polished product for now, but I can safetly say that the new Master of Orion is a worthy succesor to the series, it ballances new and old well enough to still feel like it belongs but also brings some fresh air. I'll wait and see if theyl make the game better when it leaves early access, maybe I'll change my review then (hopefuly for the better!).","April 1","true","20.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This is definitely on the right track to relive the glory of the past MOO games.  It  should only get better.\n\nRight now as it stands it played smoothly except they do need to may find a way to speed up the council voting sessions.  There was the only spot it seemed to dog down a bit on me with some time in between each one stating their vote and moving to the next.  Maybe a few more phrases would be nice during the voting too since I was already repeating their lines in my head on abstainting by the end.\n\nThe graphics are looking good.  The different lokoing ship designs I saw througout for each race are great.  The interface is overall a pretty easy to manipulate around to what you want.\n\nDiplomacy is there, but definitely feels like it is still a work in progress.  It seemed pretty swingy at points for the way they got angry over things and was pretty hard to raise for me it seemed.  I do like how if you are friends with a race and you try to be friendly with their enemies they take notice.  There was always that aspect where wars and treaties were concerned, but just in general they appeared to pay attention to even the smallest trade of information.\n\nSpace pirates were kind of interesting, though never seemed much of an overall threat.  They did destroy a reasearch outpost on an asteroid field at one point on me when my ships were halfway across the galaxy hunting down the remanents of the humans.  Usually I hunted down where they were coming from, took out their base, and then found a planet in that system to settle to make sure they would not try coming back from there again.\n\nI wasn't sure if the Council voting was at set intervals/turn marks or if something else was triggering when those came up.  So was a bit annoying at the end when it was down to me, the Alkari, and Mrrshan and we were all just hanging around for the next vote.  I was pretty sure I could win the next vote on my own, but requested/bribed the Mrrshan to toss their vote in with mine to make sure it was sealed.\n\nThings not in yet, but are coming and will greatly improve the feel of MOO:\n\nSpying:  There are some techs related to spying in the game right now, but none do anything since there is no spy network option.\n\nRace options:  Currently not in are some of my favorites including the Klackons, Darloks (makes sense with no spying and that being their strength), Meklar, and Silicioids.  Also no cusotm race.  However, they are greyed on on the startup selection screen so you do know all of those are coming :)\n\nDifficulty levels:  Right now can only play on average difficulty, which overall for veteran MOO fans or those that play other similar games a lot is just a walk through the park and enjoying yourself as you do.\n\n\nWould like to see:\n\nPlanetary queue:  It'd be nice if I could queue up a few buildings/items at a time so I don't have to bounce back to the planets as often if everything is running well in the empire.  Obviously being able to modify/cancel the queued items will also be a plus in that situation.\n\nGalatic laws:  I could see this being a pretty cool addition if done right and let the council of races have something else to affect the state of the universe and of course relations depending on which side of the voting you go with.\n\nTechnology splits:  I liked how some of the techs you were making the choice of which you would learn specifically and then you had to trade or eventually steal with espionage what you ddin't already learn.  I would like to see some more of those decitions within the tech trees, if it is possible wihout convoluting things way too far.","February 26","true","24.1"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","0"

I've enjoyed many 4X space games, but all of them had something that made them not quite as engaging as the granddaddy of them all.  In that sense, it's nice to see the Psilons or the hapless Bulrathi back.\n\nUnfortunately, in its current state, nostalgia is what the MoO reboot primarily offers.  The game plays essentially like MoO2 with some relatively minor gameplay changes.  The tech tree will be instantly recognizable to a MoO2 player, as will most elements of planet management, ship design, and overall strategy.  Real-time pauseable combat is new, but not terribly engaging, since most battles involve no more strategy than "fly straight at the enemy and open fire".\n\nIn theory, I'd like to say there's nothing wrong with a new MoO2 updated to modern graphics.  But the reality is, as much as prior 4X games might not have unseated MoO2 as the best of the breed, they've each done interesting things.  Endless Space had neat unique planets plugged into a complex backstory, GalCiv III had complex ship design and a more strategic feel, and I was even a fan of MoO3's planet habitability and client species spontaneously colonizing your worlds.  You'd hope that the MoO reboot would incorporate some of the positive developments of the last 20 years without losing what made the original game great.  Unfortunately, at least in its current version, there's not much more game than we had in the 90s.  So at the moment I find myself hopeful that there's a lot more coming in Early Access than what we've seen right now.\n\nTL;DR: A gentle recommendation for nostalgia's sake; otherwise, wait to see how Early Access comes out.","March 1","true","5.5"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","9","20","0","0"

When you plan an attack or defense you don't have to do it through a space maze.

Too few star systems and too few planets. I had to get the online editor to fix the problem in MOO2. Sad to still see that this game limit is in this new game.\n\nShip design and building is another key feature. Will have to see how this is implimented.\n\nLike the new version over old MOO2 with technologies. Hated the limit of having to only chose one of three techs in a group. Really need to see that removed finally.\n\nFinally would love a tech adjustment filter. I downloaded a mod that allowed tech discoveries to take longer than MOO2 allowed.

I won't get into what features are missing, or suggestions for updates, that will be on the discussion boards. This is for those of you looking at this game and wondering, is it really MOO?\n\nThe answer is a resounding Yes.\n\nI have been playing MOO games since I got my hands on 1 back in 1993. A friend and I were just getting our of highschool and we played it on his old 386. It was glorious.\n\nI got my hands on MOO2 a few years later, and didn't play it much until 1999. Initially I was thrown off, the interface was more like Master of Magic, than the MOO I had come to be used to. In time I realized that MOO2 was a worthy successor to the title.\n\nI bought MOO3 when it came out. I really can't state my disappointment with that title.\n\nThis game, this game feels like MOO. The mechanics are balanced, much of the tech and the strategy of MOO2 is available here. I think they may even have lifted sections of the text from MOO2.\n\nThe original races are here, or soon will be.\n\nThe beauty of MOO was that it had enough micro management, without being too much. You have control, but you also don't need to babysit every planet constantly. The build queue is not as long as it was in MOO2 and some technologies with the same name now have different purposes. Biospheres is very different.\n\nThe combat is realtime, but the speed can be increased or decreased and ships can be controlled, there is also a cinematic camera for when you know you will win and want to savor some up close and personal views.\n\nThere are some changes I hope to see, but if you loved the origionals than you should enjoy this game. This is what MOO3 should have been, but is actually better. I never cared to take a screen shot in any of the previous games, my profile is getting filled with them here. The game is beautiful and amazingly fun.","March 19","true","222.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Although there are 5 ships models right now, you can create roles like support, bomber, long range, scanner, carrier, etc. with all the ship supplements that are available.\n+ The GNN to inform the state of the galaxy is a great addition.\n+ It’s visually ok, not mind blowing. Sounds on the other hand are great and it seems that a lot of effort was made with the voice acting that it has.\n+ Real time battles are great with the addition to pause and still be able to give orders like old MOO’s.\n- Diplomacy could have it fixes, I’m thinking of a robust, well-explained diplomacy interface like the Total War series. Diplomatic Victory also feels weirds.\n- Even at war with the AI, it didn’t seem too aggressive nor building a large fleet.\n- Racial traits are shallow right now but developers already said that they are working on fixing them to make them feel more unique.\n\nOverall it feels more like a demo than an Early Access due to the fact that feels and is a very stable version. It has its bugs and glitches but nothing game-breaking. Is it MOO2? No, modernization may have scarified some game elements to create a more fluid version of it.

But after playing this game, im definetly more into this game. Great graphics, great UI, and extremely interesting ship models. Although i would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys 4x strategy games for sure the only two cons i can think of at this moment is that the Newly released race Terran Kahnate (sorry if misspelled) has the exactly same ship model as the human race, and i know they are the same species but cmon that kinda seems lazy, they should have their own ship models, maybe they are a little more rebelious looking, think to star wars, like the rebels are to the empire. Then the second thing im not a fan of, is that it almost seems impossible to make the alien races happy when playing vs. AI. Even if you say yes to every little thing they ask for, they eventually will just ask for something so rediculous like giving them all your credits and a planet or two, and you say no obviously then they declare war. It seems like they want it to be a shooter vs AI instead of winning by deplomacy.","March 27","true","23.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I'm looking forward to more races getting added, and also how they design the espionage system.\nThe ships are neat, the buildings are neat.  The way you can block warp gates with military sations is really cool.\n\nMy only complaint is the thing that MOO2 does better than any other similar game out there (including this one):\nIn MOO2 you could go to the settings and turn off the end of turn wait.  This way you could essentially fast forward your long construction times and research times.  You can't do that in any modern game because your system has to process enemy turns.  In modern games, the enemy turns take a few seconds to process.  This really slows the pace down...  This game combats that by shortening build times and research times.  (Research now usually takes between 4-8 turns).\n\nAlso, I would much have preferred turn based ship combat...\n\nAll in all, though I won't put in the kind of hours on this game as I did MOO2, it's a solid buy (Though I would really put it's worth at $20 right now.  $49 is overpriced IMO).\n\nSo, that's my opinion...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loudent2/recommended/298050/","loudent2","loudent2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loudent2/","82 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've been a  long time fan of Moo2 and 4x  games in general. I really think they hit the nail on the head with this one.\n\nUsing star lanes  means you can actually set up a defensive perimeter around your area.  Ship design and  combat is good and the way it works has done away with the late game combat tedium that I used to dread.\n\nTech tree is pretty good  and it does hearken back to MOO2 where you sometimes have to choose between techs. (there's no creative trait). The only doenside of the tech tree is that it is too finely granulated. I think they should combine some and just make cost more tech.\n\nThe AI can use some work but it's still early release. I suspect they'll work on that. As it is I'm playing on the higest difficulty witht the largest galaxy with al the races  and, while it took me some time I've  managed to outpace every civilization pretty easily. I'm playing with a custom race so that might have something to do with it.\n\nRaces are fairly well balanced and I can see all of them being useful (still waiting on spying mechaism and some of the missing races) and they , sort of , off set the custom race advantage by giving pre-built race a 10-20 point bonus. Still custom races are very powerful (This game I'm using +50% production, +25% research and -20% ship cost and an disadvantage of -25% ground combat. Last game I swapped production and research).\n\nThe ship design is decent, you can't add or modify every flap or wing but you choose the load out (although there's no reason to not go for the best "systems" other than production time). Right now beams are at a high disadvantage, it's go missiles or go home (which also means that races with beam advantage aren't as  strong right now). Even at the later stages of the game there's a reason to build small frigates (I load them down with a couple of torpedoes and some engine mods  and they can basically take out strong opponents while keeping out of range). Best is to keep a mix of sizes...Also, you can only have one doomstar\n\nCombat is Real-Time-with-Pause (and speedup) which works beautifully. I know M002 purists will hate this but it really does work better. the turn base design of M002 worked for that game but was mostly a constraint of the systems it rain on. There's no more multiple hour slog through combat (literally the thing I remember most about moo2)\n\nThere's a couple of galaxy offerings: Ring which is just a collection of stars with connections to nearby stars and spiral. Spiral is interesting in tha tyou start in the arms of the galaxy with mostly awful planets (That play through I went through with the klackons which start out with a poor planet- mistake)) You have to research enough tech to get into the center of the galaxy where nearly every planet is awesome. This makes tech more important because if you can get in there and colonize before your neighbors they can never catch up.\n\nIt's still early release and it needs some polish and balancing. Also I'd like some abilities to set up some stuff automatically (e.g.when you reach max population build a civil transport and go do either pre-designated planet or the planet with the biggest need for population).\n\n","April 22","true","58.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It's not a lot, and I honestly haven't finished the game through, but I have played two complete games totalling these hours. I have to admit, it was more than what I was expecting. The shortcomings of the game can be summed mostly up as being in an constantly updated state. There's gonna be quirks, but the developers offer a nice way to extend your issues or problems to them: they included a "Report Bug" feature. I've used it plenty of times, and knowing this game is still be roughed out on its edges, I'm totally okay with that.\n\nThe things I love are a-plenty! I thoroughly enjoy how strategic, detailed, and animated the battle scenes are. It makes me feel like I'm watching a movie taking place. Speaking of that, whenever you colonize, you get some of these wonderful scenes too. Matter of fact, I'm going to go ahead and say it: The entire game plays like a movie you're making.\n\nPoint blank, the way I feel as a casual gamer, and as a person who has used games from wargaming, I know for a fact they're going to pay attention to the customer base. I further know that while these developers are a separate entity (sortof), they still have that same passion. You can see it in this game. From the voice-overs, to the way the game operates, every action and reaction feels like you're contributing to your own story. It's not entirely customizable, not yet, but as someone who enjoyes playing the Terran Kahnat (I recommend getting this addition while there's still time!), I am having one heck of a blast!\n\nConclusion:\nWhile still in the stages of roughing out the edges, you can feel the passion here. I really enjoy being a part of that, playing it, and feeling it for myself.

The first thing I noticed was that any race can colonise any planet, regardless of it's type. In MOO2 you had to research the technology to allow colonisation of different planet types. The lack of this requirement in MOO4 makes it too easy. It also removes any advantage of choosing Silicoid as your race.\n\n2. Star lanes are new but I don't mind this. Star lanes can be used for strategic effect so I'm happy with this change.\n\n3. Technology progression is too fast in MOO4. It's too easy to get the technology you want and it doesn't feel like an achievement.\n\n4. It's difficult to see the impact of new technology in MOO4 and some of the new technology seems to have been diluted in its value eg; Ground Batteries.\n\n5. The duplication of the voice hints in the technology screens is annoying.\n\n6. Diplomacy is still clunky in MOO4, It would be nice to be able to counter-offer proposals from other races rather than just accept/decline.\n\n7. Space combat isn't very interesting. I just use auto-resolve to save the time it takes to load the graphics.\n\n8. Space Pirates are just an annoyance really. It would be more interesting if  you could negotiate with them.\n\n9. Minor civilisations are an interesting feature in MOO4, though they seemed to get wiped out before you can interact with them. It would be better if you could somehow offer them protection from other races.\n\n10. The new GNN characters are funny. I'd like to see this further developed.\n\nAnyway, those are my initial comments. I'm looking forward to seeing how the game further develops.","April 24","true","187.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I don't recommend this game in its current state over AI issues. In my short time all factions went to war with me for not giving on faction a planet, another some credits, and the rest for being at war with thos 2 factions even tho one was at war with them. The only way to win as of right now it to destroy all other factions before you get obliterated by the 5 current factions. Other than the AI the game is good. I would recommend for multiplayer but was unable to find a game to play with someone to try out.\n\nPros:\n+options menu is on point in current state.\n+looks amazing with good little cut scenes with skip options\n+UI and managment tab are great\n+Voice acting is excelent\n+combat is somewhat enjoyable(needs work)\n+research tree above average\n+random events are well varied from my playtime\n\nCons:\n-Diplomacy is broken. AI demands for tech, credits, and planets even on the brink of being wiped out by the player. If a single AI goes to war with player all other AIs become hostile with you in 1 or 2 turns which soon leads to all factions against you.(if fixed will make huge difference in game)\n-Pirate faction too weak and only seem to target player currently\n-combat mode is real time with vary little tactics currently even though there is options for formations and designing your ships with directional weapons(currently has no effect in directional combat). If your fleet is stronger just by a small margin you win with almost no losses(sometime with none), if the AI is slightly stronger than your fleet its always wiped out.\n-needs more universe types other than circle or spiral\n-needs more ship classes(but do like that there is 2 models per class of ship)","March 3","true","11.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

For example, you will see things like "Cloning Centre INCREASES population growth by -25%" MINUS 25%?!? Simple math errors and typos. There is little diffrence so far between the actual game play of MOO2 and this version. The focus has been on graphics and UI. I will admit that the graphics are better and more in line with the current decade... however, the designers are still dopey computer programming types and not Computer Information consultants like myself ... ok, what do I mean by that? Well, they made a great looking build screen that pops up when you want to build a new building on your planet... HOWEVER the window covers up all the information about your planet that you MAY want to look at before making your decision! Does your planet need more food production? Who knows... it is under the build window and impossible to see! Got to close the build window to see the planet production THEN re-open your build window to make your choice .... ANNOYING as HELL.\nSurprisingly, diplomacy has not been altered. I am disappointed by that. MOO2 had very rudimentary diplomacy and the game could be WAY more interesting if they at LEAST added in some changes to be on parity with Civilization IV.\nI love the game and will continue to play - sending in lots of bug reports and hoping that they listen to a few of my suggestions.

MOO was great for the time, I loved MOO2, and hated MOO3 before the community patch.  There are multiple areas that need depth, but the outline of a very complex games is defintely in place.  It a gorgeous game that will make any further attempts of nostalgia playing MOO2 difficult.\n\nSo far the game seems really good for early access.  The game is playable and only crashed to desktop twice in the past 10 hours.\n\nPROS:\n+This game is beautiful and has that sense of discovery missing from GalCiv or SOTS\n+The additions to diplomacy and the diplomacy screens are awesome.\n+Voice acting is usually verry well done.\n+The RTS battles are pausable, and you can slow them down by 1/4ths to easily control you units and special abilities.\n+The research tree really makes you make some tough choices on what you want to specialize in.\n+The ship customization is easy to use, but still allows for a lot of variation.\n+Space Lanes, now you can have defensible systems and war fronts. Careful of those techs that let them get behind you.\n+Weapon Arcs, it's important to maneuver around to flank big powerful frontal attackers.\n+The AI reacts well to what you are using against them and pools their fleets for large powerful attacks to break through your defenses as well as going after undefended planets.\n\nCons:\n-A lot of techs aren't fully implemented (Alpha)\n-Weapon customization doesnt change the base stats so its difficult to determine if its worth it\n-Ship appearance custimization does not allow you to change colors making patterns difficult to see\n-Some of the voice work is annoying: Looking at you Psilon Science Guy\n-Auto save is only for the immediate turn.\n-Very little Game customization allowed currently. Not sure if more will be added.\n-Does not allow you set formation before battles and formations are very wonky.\n-Races have very minor variation (Hope this changes) Not sure if some get specific techs or not.\n\nThis is going to be a great year for the Space 4x.

I played on a Large, Old, Spiral Galaxy with no end date and won with absolute ease. Basically I started boxed in with one other faction by unstable warp points. After crushing them I pretty much colonized unopposed for 300-400 turns. By the time I met the remaining factions I was so powerful that I was able to bully them all to vote for me on the council and won the game WITHOUT EVEN BEING ABLE TO REACH THEM. While I think the game's a lot of fun, the ease with which I, a 4x neophyte, dominated kind of spoiled it all in the end. Unless they do a MASSIVE overhaul of the AI or the harder settings are lightyears more difficult than Normal, I won't play this game again.

I've been playing for more then 2 decades now and I loved MOO. I'm a casual gamer, a fan of the actors voice playing this game, but not a fanatic or a power monger. Keep this in mind as you read my review as you may or may not have the same playing style.\n\nSecond, this is Early Access and REALLY not suited for casual gamers.\n\nI do not recommand this game at the moment for gamers who are like me; casual, micro-managing and graphics oriented. To those, I say get the Endless equivalent for now if you must, cause the early access is more for passionate gamers who don't mind the "serious" lack of depth, dumb down everything, semi unpolished graphics, limited everything (again and always, only one leader per race, usually male). Don't beleive the vid about interstellar battles, they look nothing like that...for now. Just tiny ships moving about in RT and cheaply shooting at each other. That said, I've yet to encounter a bug.\n\nThings to do on this game:\n\n- Polish the leader, planets and buildings on planets graphics. They just look like meh spheres with badly drawn structures here and there, like warts added to the surface of the foggy planetary graphics. Honestly, I think MOO 3 looked better then this.\n- Make the tactical space battles MUCH nicer to look at, with command choices and either turn based and/or with a less pathetic flow to it.\n- I know that more leaders are coming, but so far they are soooo shallow! There's no...connection to the races and of course, you're limited to THAT leader (with no pics while playing), usually male, and his/her point of view.\n- Choice of empire color; I know it seems silly, but its a choice the gamer can make and it SHOULD be simple to add.\n-More, more, more 3D graphics! MOO is an old title, but a NEW game, yet it looks and feels cheap compared to others of its type.

As it stands, I don't think it is worth the price tag, however that is due to it missing a bunch of stuff that is being added like all the missing races. I would like a larger galaxy I think it is way too small, they should add a huge and insane size map where tech and builiding rates drop 2-4x. So in spite of my reservations I think this is fairly well done, some nostalgia and some changes but overall playable and enjoyable.\n\nThere is a noticable lack of depth in the tech tree which hopefully will change as a tech victory is enabled later on. There is a lack investment in the ship design, in Gal Civ3 & Star Drive 2 you  can spend lots of time in ship design and then cannot wait to try them out against an enemy, not so in this game.

There are many paths to victory in games like this, which include conquest, science, and diplomacy. I am not sure if Masters of Orion has wonder or quest victories as of yet, but I would not be surprised to see it patched in later into early access. So just a few things ot be said to have a proper review for you folks.\n\n\nThe Positives  Beautiful, simple, and non intrusive graphics allow you to enjoy the game for some of its finer details.\nThe races so far have history, they have culture, and they interact (albeit agressively] differently.\nShip design is simple and to the point, something I actually enjoy and endorse.\nDecisions matter. Making infratructure instead of ships? Well good luck early in, and mid, and late game... xD\nThe Negatives  Sometimes there are tooltips, and sometimes there are not. Little placeholders or blank text still exist but this is to be expected early access.\nThe lack of game pacing options such slow, medium, or fast is kinda saddening. Science pacing would be a nice feaure as well.\nThe lack of other game options such as minor races, galaxy markets, and anomaly quest is kinda saddening, but very bearable.\nGalaxy options! Give us more control with more sizes, more planets, more anomalies, more adventure. Make it a thing guys, you can do it!\nThis is a con for now but soon to be fixed. Lack of custom races.

Until today I consider that “the best in class”. This game is not MOO2 anyway. But I found the game good and promising enough, so make sense to buy. However also need to consider some aspects that are not so gentle.\n\nClose look of space map is looking like Galactic Civ with some StarDrive flavor. Or the opposite. Not bad, but nothing special.\n\nTactical space combat is realtime and somewhere between StarDrive and Endless Space. There are minor issues, like ship weapon firing arc is not working, ships are turning over and over (ship movement control is close to nothing), ships are shooting missiles and beam into asteroids, etc.\n\nThis tactical combat part of the game is really what have to be re-considered. I prefer turn based game with turn based tactical combat. Need to give control to the players instead of sit and watch what is happening on the screen.\nAnother area is the ground combat. Hope, the developers do not follow bad example of GalCiv III that was not ready with this aspect when released. StarDrive2-like ground combat would be good, with some fancy upgrade in the graphics and weapon/gadget selection. (Nobody is expecting XCOM2 type…)\n\nLeaders / governors are missing today, hope it will be in the scope. Also nice to have some special ship weapon or extra module to find / buy / manufacture. Or merchants selling goods, or mercenaries, or armies to hire, etc.\n\nI understand that some of the issues will be fixed after having early access feedback.\n\nI recommend the game anyway, it is fun, and the game is pretty.

In fact, it seems to have far more in common with Master of Orion 2 than the original.\n\nMY TAKE ON THE ORIGINAL GAMES\nI'm old enough to say that I played all the original Master of Orion games when they were new. I played MOO1 when I was in university and spent an obscene number of hours on it, sometimes missing classes after playing all night. I purchased MOO2 back when games came in a box with CD-ROMs and a printed manual. I did the same when MOO3 was released.\n\nMOO3 was pure crap, so I won't even discuss it. MOO2 was fun, but lost much of the 'epic' feel of the original. The UI in MOO2 was clearly worlds beyond what was in MOO1. The atmospheric background music in MOO2 was excellent. MOO1 is still my favourite though. It was released in the early 90's, and a PC from that era had less horsepower than a cheap smartphone of today, so the graphics, sounds and UI look horrible now. Despite that, MOO1 really captured the feeling of starting small in a big galaxy, expanding in all directions to stake your claim for more, and eventually fighting for it. One of the best things about MOO1 was how the tech 'tree' was different in each game. Each race was only able to research a random subset of all the available techs. The rest could only be obtained via trading, espionage, or conquest. That was brilliant. It made the game very replayable and unpredictable, and forced you to adapt if your preferred early-game techs were not open to be researched.\n\nMOO2 dumbed-down some core mechanics from MOO1. In MOO2, you were limited to a number of ships less than the overall 'Command Points' for your empire. The tiniest ship size cost 1 CP per ship, and the biggest cost 6 CP per ship. The number of CPs in the late game was often small, like low 100's. Late game MOO2 fleets were not very epic.\n\nThe new game closely resembles MOO2 in several ways. Most notable is the boring always-the-same tech tree (even tech names). They also kept the Command Points.\n\n\nBAD AND GOOD STUFF IN THE NEW GAME\nBad - Galaxy map and scale of the galaxy\nI really hate the way they implemented the galaxy map.\nThe scale of the galaxy vs individual star systems is just BAD! To compare with a modern 4X game that gets it right, look at Distant Worlds (also available on Steam). That game has it's own set of problems, but capturing the system vs galaxy scale is not one of them. You can zoom all the way in to individual planets, then way way way out to see the entire galaxy, and it feels right. Master of Orion feels totally wrong. For example, moving a ship from one side of a system to the other side often gives you vision of the adjacent system on that side. Isn't the size of a star system insignificant compared to the distance between stars? On the other hand, let's say the size of a star system is vast. Then why does any 'move' within any star system always take exactly one turn, regardless of the system size? This mechanic is goofy and really needs improvement. It makes the game feel cheesy.\nStar systems are connected by fixed 'warp paths' that are pre-determined at the start of the game. If there is no warp path between two systems, then it means you can't go there. It doesn't matter if those systems are right next to each other on the galaxy map. It makes the galaxy map seem like its just a nice graphic drawn over a simplistic graph of lines connecting points that I'm forced to follow. You may only enter and exit a star system via a 'warp point', which is one end of a 'warp path'. This mechanic isn't fun and makes the game seem like a low-quality app.\nBuilding a 'Military Outpost' (kind of a mini-starbase) on top of a warp point completely prevents opponents' ships from entering the star system at that warp point, unless they destroy it in battle. Come again? Space is pretty vast, right? Why not just go AROUND the outpost? Whenever you start a combat with one of them, you start out of range, so why not just fly around. These Military Outposts are available right at the start of the game. Lame.\nThere is no concept of 'ship range' or 'fuel'. Any ship can explore around in space indefinitely, and go anywhere that there are 'warp paths' to follow. This includes the scout ships you start with on the first turn of the game.\nMidway through the tech tree, you can get a tech called 'Warp Gates' that makes a joke of the whole 'warp paths' concept. Any system where you build a Warp Gate is now considered to have a 'warp path' to every other system you own that also has a Warp Gate. Why not just do away with both of these cheesy concepts, introduce fuel/range back into the game (like MOO1/MOO2), and allow fleets to travel anywhere that is within their range.\nBad - Boring tech tree\nThe new game has stuck with the terrible MOO2-style tech tree, even keeping many of the technology names. The tech path in MOO1 was possibly the best thing about that game. Each play-through gave you a different set of techs you were allowed to research, and there were more of them than in MOO2. If you've played and enjoyed MOO1, you'll know what I'm talking about. The new game should have kept this.\n\nGood Stuff\nThe new game does have some aspects that I like.\nThe fleet battles look good, even though this part of the game isn't finished yet. The options for controlling your own fleet are still somewhat limited. Ships in your fleet that are the same ship model are grouped together in combat when you issue orders. You can choose from different formations, each giving unique combat bonuses. The fleet combat looks great. Each type of weapon looks and sounds unique. When you hit a ship/starbase with shields, you'll see the shield impacts. When a ship/base starts to take a lot of hull damage, it will start to look like its on fire inside the hull. This part of the game is headed in the right direction.\nYou get diminishing returns when you assign many of a planet's population to Farming and/or Industry. Each planet also has a fixed number of production slots on each production type (Research, Farming, Industry), and the number of slots depends on the planet size. This usually prevents you from putting all of the population on either Farming or Industry. I like how that works.\nMore industrial production causes more pollution. If you allow the pollution to get out of control and it reaches 100% polluted, then that planet will be permanently reduced to the next lower category of 'biome' (like Terran downgraded to Swamp). Your three options to prevent this are: a) research tech that reduces generated pollution; b) spends turns on 'cleanup' (which is lost production time); c) build things more slowly, so production stays below the threshold where pollution accumulates. This game mechanic makes sense and is a good addition.\nProduction queues are a thing. Done better than MOO2.\nI'm mostly indifferent about the sci-fi celebrity voice actors. They recruited heavy hitters like Mark Hamill, half the cast of Star Trek TNG, and even the pilot from Serenity. I hope they didn't spend a lot of the development budget on this frivolous aspect of the game. I'm embarrassed for Michael Dorn, that he was forced to read some of the uber-crap dialogue (wait for the narration after you bomb a pirate base - /facepalm...) The exception to this is the funny Galactic News Network anchor robot that is voiced by Dwight Schultz (the actor who played Lt Barclay in Star Trek) - love it!","April 10","false","35.8"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

Even as an early access game, this 4X has far more depth than many recent games had at launch (cough GalCiv3).\n\nFor example:\n-Multiple ways of invading/destroying planets.  Drown them in chemical weapons to kill off the population while leaving the infrastructure intact (but taking a big diplo hit).  Spend years nuking them from orbit until the planet is a polluted, irraddiated mess, then move in to clean up and terraform things back to habitabal.  Launch a good old fashioned infantry invasion, involving marines of different levels, tanks and mechs.  Or for the galactic conquerer on the go, simply erase the planet from existence with late-game planet-exploding tech.\n\n-Customize your ships with more than just weapons and armour.  The biggest range of options comes not from the weapons, but from the utility/support modules that can be researched and fitted.  From active black-hole generators, SC2 Stalker-like blinks, missile retargetting and all kinds of countermeasures, your ship designs are just as much about your style of fighting as they are about how hard you hit.\n\n-Think the starlanes are lame?  You don't even need to get half way through the tech tree to unlock warpgates, allowing you to make your own starlanes between colonies.  Combined with late-game engine tech, and the appearance of wormholes in the galaxy, mobilizing your fleets really isn't the painful process some people think after a brief early-game play.\n\n- Someone complained that you can't transport food between planets?  Wrong.  Just need the tech unlocked (again, pre-mid game).  It'll also let you transport production, letting you focus late-game production at key planets (for when you want to start spamming those Titans or Death Stars).  Oh, and you can send population around from turn 1.  Did I mention population is tracked by race, and different races can be assimilated into your planets, complete with their racial perks?  What casual unfaithful nonsense!\n\nOn top of the depth that's already here, there's more promised to land before launch - and based on how much of this promised content is already heavily referred to across the game (such as in the tech tree), it seems pretty likely that these guys are on it.\n\nAnother thing I've seen people slate the game for: no ship bording.  Lemme quote an item off the tech tree called "Marine Pods" (under Advanced Tactics):\n"Marine Pods house additional detachments of space marines, increasing the number of Marines on board a ship.  The additional marines both defend the ship and can board enemy ships."\n\ndumbed down / 10","February 26","true","16.7"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

The combat system was boring. The tech tree was enormous and a lot of it pointless - this game does away with a lot of what made it hard to get into MoO2 for a new player.\n\nThe new MoO has virtually ignored Spreadsheets of Orion (MoO3) save for the starlanes (which is actually a pretty smart attempt to keep the map from being swarmed by one race through bottlenecks) and in simple speak this game is what it says it is on the cover.\n\nIt is a reimagining (NOT a reboot or a remake - notice the word) of the ORIGINAL (MoO1 folks - not 2 or 3) Masters of Orion that is on a level that most casual and new players can enjoy without having to get out a txt file a mile long or cover their walls in spreadsheets.","February 27","true","114.4"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

Blows out of the water every installment of Galactic Civilizations, honestly.\n- It does have an "Endless Space" vibe: it is extremely playable.\n- Some people have issues with tactical battles being real-time... I honestly have no interest in playing those marathon late-game MOO2 tactical battles. There was a time and place for that. Right now it is very barebones, but I had some tense battles against space eels and stuff. Enemy tactical AI isn't very clever at the moment.\n- They have taken the Civilization approach to Diplomacy... but it is the Civilization IV approach, which was the pinnacle of the series. The diplomatic AI even being incomplete, is going to interact with you more than in many other games which are supposedly complete (e.g. StarDrive 2, Distant Worlds, etc.)\n- They get the tech tree absolutely right. Again, taking a good idea - Civ IV tech tree - and improving onto it - integrating the MOOeseque "disjunctive" tech bonus (choose between A or B, etc.).\n\nSo probably not the most innovative of 4X games, but it is shaping up to be one of the best ever.","February 27","true","12.4"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","8","19","0","0"

A little history of me, I've played every MOO game, my favorite is MOO2, then MOO1 (never got into the new design and feel of MOO3). I got MOO1, played the hell out of it.. I then preorder MOO2 at a local radioshack, and waited and waited, till two months after the release date i still hadn't had MOO2 in my hands, canlced the preorder (now an order at this point). I found it at Walmart weeks later, and the rest was history.  Story there was never pre-order anythign at radioshack.. :)\n\nAnyhoo, Why am I talking about MOO2 so much, well this feels just like it with improvments that I've always wanted in the game.. I was worried they would take it a new direction, like I felt they did with MOO3, but they stuck to the roots of the game.\n\nStuff I like so far:\n- Nice UI layout, simple enough to decipher things as other MOO games\n- Technology Upgrades that effect ship building provides an option to upgrade the rest of the fleet (at a cost of course)\n- Build Queue's\n\nThat's it for now, still in EA I'll update when full release and more game time. So far, I'd say a solid buy for MOO fans out there.. Also nice perk of the Collectors pack is you get the old versions too, always good for some replay value, and I might give MOO3 another go..\n\n\n","February 26","true","99.5"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Agathos/recommended/298050/","Agathos","Agathos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Agathos/","459 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo many good things about this game so far.  It is definitely early access--reduced races, weak AI (only average is available at this point), typical diplomacy issues for civ games (not clear there's the threat of war if you don't accept an offer, etc.), and similar minor issues.  But the game plays well so far and is true to the genre.  It's GalCiv w/ better graphics and smoother gameplay--but warp points and paths instead of freeform movement.  It's a different approach.  You can certainly better limit access to your homeworlds--but, you don't have the constant feel of threat either.\n\nI haven't found a ship design feature--and that's good, b/c the game is more 4x, less tweaking your loadout on each vessel.  Again, it's a different approach, and this one I prefer b/c the races that exist and ship designs are very cool and just as I pictured from the MOO past.\n\nThe voice overs are fabulous.  The graphics are very nice.  Sound is nice.\n\nMy only real complaint at this point is an RTS approach to combat instead of Turnbased as in MOO2.  For me, this is a real disappointment.  It isn't a 'No' at this point--there is still hope they'll add it before release, or promise it as an expansion option or dlc.  But, it isn't MOO2.  It isn't even a good RTS--even w/ a pause feature.  I find myself auto-resolving all combats b/c of it (i.e., 'Simulate' instead of 'Tactical').  That really makes it a different take on GalCiv III instead of MOO.\n\nGood game so far.  But, wait for 3 months until it releases if Turn-based combat is a big deal to you.\n\nHope this is helpful!","February 28","true","18.9"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jdc0331/recommended/298050/","jdc0331","jdc0331","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jdc0331/","98 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSummary: A good space 4X at the moment, with potential for greatness as EA progresses.  It has its flaws, but my main points of contention are things that the developers have already stated are being worked on.\n\nFull Review:\n(Disclaimer: I barely played the original games, so this review will not compare this game to the previous entries in the series. It is being reviewed solely on its own merits.)\n\nI had been looking forward to this release for some time. I love 4X games (and strategy games in general), and several friends told me that the original Master of Orion games (1 & 2) were among the best there is. So when I saw a new entry in the series was being developed, I thought this would be my chance to get in join the action. And I immediately picked up the EA version, because I was interested in seeing how the game grew and evolved as it was developed (The game development process has always fascinated me).\n\nSo far I have not been disappointed. The graphics are beautiful, the sound design is excellant, and the voice acting is superb, as one would expect given the quality of the voice acting talent in the game. While these aesthetic qualities are nice, the gameplay itself is also quite good. I like the decison to limit space travel to star lanes, as I think it lead to some interesting strategic choices (for example: do I expand to this high quality planet that is easily accessible to all including potential invaders? Or do I expand elsewhere and stay behind this easily defended choke point?). The tech tree is what I've come to expect from a 4X game, though I liked that some of the advances made you choose what the advance gave you. Again, it was a mechanic that allowed for interesting decisions.\n\nThat being said, there are a few points of concern that I have. The tactical space battles themselves, while defintely cool looking, felt limited, and not all that tactical (I do like the real-time with pause approach though). However, the developers have stated that this is something they are working on improving. Also, the opponent AI, particularly in matters of diploamcy, seems bit off. They drop in to Guarded or Hostile status way too easily, often for reasons as simple as rejecting a trade deal. Also, they opponents as a whole aren't too smart, and hence not too difficult. Again, the AI is something the developers have stated is a work in progress, so I assume as more difficulty levels are added, and the AI in general is improved, these won't be much of an issue anymore.\n\nAs the game currently stands, I enjoy it, and am looking forward to the further additions as EA progresses. It's a fun game, and as long as the developers keep up what they're doing it has the potential to be one of the greats.\n\nSide note: Is it just me, or does it seem ironic that I won a diplomatic victory (as the Psilons) by buying votes from the leaders I wasn't at war with, while simultaneously blowing up Alkari planets (about 10 before the council session where I won) with my Doom Star?  Is it weird that there's no diplomatic penaly for this?","February 28","true","12.6"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

Although there are some good points I can not recommened the game and its 50 dollar price tag in its current state.\n\nThings I liked\n\n-Looks nice (ships, planets, races)\n-Voice acting is well done\n-Music and SFX are good\n-UI is easy to navigate\n\nThings I don't like\n-Combat is too fast and boring. You can try slowing it down by using the pause option but really it's pointless. You can win almost every battle simply with numbers and let it auto play while you watch. Faster to just simulate battles than go through the cinematic tactical fighting.\n-Customizing ships is pointless you can easily win with the default set ups the AI chooses for you\n-AI currently isn't implemented so diplomacy plays no part in a game (other than extorting money from the weak)\n-Tech tree choices don't feel like they mean anything. I can easily get through a game just randomly picking.\n\nConclusion\nDon't buy this game in early access. If it goes on sale maybe. I don't think it's worth more than $25 in its current state and that's only because it comes with MOO 1 and 2. It has potential I hope that the developers use the player's feed back to improve the battles and AI.","March 14","false","66.5"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

This new iteration of Master of Orion feels like a shallow example of a 4x game, with weak attempts at being a rts. To me it feels like a disaster of an addition to the Master of Orion series.\n\nMany of the core elements that made the originals great have been stripped away completely or deluded so much that they are almost unrecognizable. This is to the point where several aspects of the game that have been brought over from the previous iterations just don't seem to function as they should anymore. Several of the playable races seem ineffective and pointless in comparison to others. Weaponry and technologies have little logical uses and are therefore trumped by a handful of superior options. Combat has been reduced to what equates to tactless skirmishes with extremely limited control. The game has ship customization, however it seems like a mute point when all elements of strategy and tactics have been removed from combat.\nThe game is pretty to look at, but only to an extent. It seems as though there are a very limited number of well crafted objects in the game, but the small amount of them get redundant very quickly. The same ships fly past the same planets, while your advisor rambles off the same line of text he has said dozens and dozens of times before.\nThe game as a whole seems extremely skeletal in many ways without any real substance.","March 18","false","9.4"," 26 of 56 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","26","56","0","0"

First one was a bit before my time, and I picked the second one a few years after it was out, and was absolutely hooked. So much so that I gave Master of Orion 3 more than its share of tries, alas all ending in utter defeat at the hands of bugs and bad gameplay decisions.\n\nAnd..I am absolutely thrilled its descendent through the years is shaping out to be follow in MoO 2's footsteps! I don't know how, but even with this as of yet incomplete version they got the mixture right to keep up you clicking through the night (erm).\n\nNow, what many of the reviewers seem to lose sight of is that this is its earliest iteration of early access yet! Many things are obviously not implemented yet - Spying, for instance. Or all 10 races, and race customization. I don't know that Pollution works either. Some placeholders here and there - such as Ground Combat. Etc etc.\n\nTo my mind it's obvious that many of the things which are not really working right now - such as Diplomacy, or combat AI, or colony management AI - are still in their test phase and extremely likely to be improved upon.\n\nWhy such optimism? Well, for one, remarkably, the game is polished to look and feel as if it were a finished product. I've not crashed once in about 20 hours of play, and I only ran into a few bugs, fewer of which were important in any way (antimissile rockets module doesn't seem to work, for instance, or maybe it just seemed so to me).\n\nAnd it's good! Everything that looks firmly in place is amazingly good. Such as:\nColony management is perfect MoO. Classic, and superb. Research - Food - Production, and Credits. Small to Huge planets, Radiated to Gaia, Low to High gravity, Ultra poor to Abundant, and random resources (gold, fungus, etc)\n\nSpace expansion, tried and true formula. Worm holes serve as bottlenecks, some of them are unmanageable until high end tech. It does allow you to treck further from the getgo than most 4X games, which I find to be a good thing. Space monsters. Pirate fleets (and bases). "Anomalies". RNG events (plagues, population booms etc). Orion and its Guardian! :)\n\nThe Tech Tree is..wow. As an example, Beam weapons upgrades never go "+1 dmg", "+2 dmg" etc - each successive variant is different in some way making it a choice - do I go with higher dmg ye olde Neutron Blaster, or do I pack in newfangled lesser dmg overloading Ion Cannon (the Mass Driver does seem too obvious a choice though). Some techs don't yet work (all the Spying tech, for instance) but that's just upcoming :)\n\nShip customization is sweet, and strikes a good balance between complexity and streamlining. Modules with all sorts of variants, various types of weapon mounts (6 types of Beams, 5 for Missiles).. it's good.\n\nThe one and only thing that does have me worried is Combat. Mostly because I feel like it should already be further along than it is. I don't really have an issue with it not being TBS - in MoO 2 the side who attacked and had 1st turn had a HUGE advantage over the defender - but it's kind of lackluster. The modules and weapon mounts are mostly passive, the battlemap doesn't offer much (there are some formations, and asteroids which can shield from weapon fire) but it's far too little yet. It needs more. Waiting for more.\n\nIt also tried for a few new ideas here and there, and I find no fault with any of them. Asteroid fields as a planet type, which can house Mine/Research Stations, and be made into planets. By a Worker unit a la the Civ Settler, which can do all sorts of things (mostly space lane turtling though :)) ). Choices between research results (from this researched tech do I take Fusion Beam or Fusion Bomb?) which also give Diplomacy more importance (since you can get the Tech you didn't choose via diplomatic swapping). Pollution which ruin your planet biome type. Etc.\n\nOne thing I left for the end because it really isn't that important for a Master of Orion game - IT'S BEAUTIFUL! It really is! Diplomacy meetings, GNN, space, ships, combat, colony screen (which features the world on the right, all bustling with scifi activity and ever more sprawling urban complexes). The clips played when you colonize a world (one for each world type) are a balm to the soul :))\n\nTl, dr: it truly is Master of Orion, and while it has some things to implement before getting all the way there, it's far on the path to greatness.","February 28","true","71.5"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Honestly it is pretty far along for an Early Access game. There are a few bugs and some features are not programmed yet. Also, they need to do more work to differentiate it from MOO2 - it is very similar to MOO2 but with updated 3d graphics.

Its very playable as it is right now, and definately worth doing so!\n\nOne of the many  things I loved about MoO2 was the planet colonization sequence. Was a joy to see the colony craft landing on each new different type of planet, most of them so exotic and alien, at times made me wish i was was there. This newest edition takes the colonizing sequence to a new level. Beautifully rendered panoramic breathtaking cinimatic cut-scenes of your race's Colony ship descending from the atmosphere and camera pan flyby over mountains or into valleys, across lakes / oceans, through clouds, mist, or snow-storms to land in the perfect spot. Definately a "Whoa!" and pause to appreciate moment. I'm so glad they didn't skimp or cut-short this part of the game.\n\nGNN is back and tongue-in-cheek with comedy. The GNN sequences still seem a bit rough, but this is early-access after all.\n\nGalactic Council sequences has nicely been kept true to MoO 1 & 2, with a nice 3d facelift.\n\nLove the "Next Planet" button, mind you it cycles through in the order of planets colonized.\n\nThe Planet Screen this time around is an Orbital Space View, with the planet slowly rotating with the daytime on the left, median, and night-time on the right. As for the buildings - are 3d iconic representations placed randomly on the planet's surface (poping through the atmosphere and right ino space), larger than life much like you'd expect from the units representation in the Civilization game series. Kinda takes the realism away but gives you an idea what you have. The downside is for bulding management, you have to click and hold to rotate the planet and click on the structure to remove it (takes several tries to find the correct bulding if you can't recognize it). A quick fix to this could be added later - would also list the buildings you can scroll through.\n\nLove the new updated ship graphics. Ship edit screen gives you a selection of hull paint patterns (no colors though). Your able to view and rotate the 3d models.\n\nThe space combat is spectacular to watch. They added a new Cinematic Camera mode, lets you watch the combat much like it were a movie. Needs a little work, seems to randomly pick where to "point and shoot" including actual "Smart Missle Camera viewfinder" mode complete as you see in hollywood movies right up to the point of impact. Wish there were a few options to refine or pick / cycle / toggle the current camera selection.\n\nOnly thing missing is the true-tactical turn based fleet combat mode. Hope it gets implimented. To be fair, having seen the new 3d ships and graphics, it was fun to watch the automatic RTS mode, as the battle is over in a few minutes - fast, flashy, guns blazing and ships go "Boom!", litle star fighters zipping around in formation,  kinda watching a space battle sequence from Babylon 5. Still, would be nice to have the option to have the turn-based hands on combat again, control your fleet - movements and weapons.\n\nDoomstars!!! These are a sight to behold in space battle - quite massive and dwarfing most ships but at the same time they're not "Moon sized" planets either. Gone is the "rounded borg cube" type design. Instead, the pyramid design is a nice nod to Stargate SG-1 - Goa'uld warships, and dwarfs all the other ships. These bad-boys do give you the option to actually blow up the planet. Interestingly, there hasn't been any GNN newsbreaks about it either when a planet does get blown up (turns into asteroid field you can later reform into a new barren planet). There isn't any "Planet-busting" visual sequence either for now just a second attack button icon, maybe will be added later.\n\nThe voice acting and rendering of the species is really good.\n\nAll in all, for an early-access title release, with only a handful of species available its definately worth playing. Been fairly stable, Lots of features still to be added, such as the Espoinage Training Center (even states that in the description - "to be added later")","February 27","true","17.0"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Which it does. Mostly these are not performance invasive as for me, they are things like clicking on something and instead of opening up production options, it closes the planet view instead. Annoying but will be ironed out.\n\nThe overall gameplay is fast and immersive. Each turn you feel you have to see though the next turn, and its hard to put down. Very addictive.\n\nThe AI is improved since the last patch, and it wasn't too terrible before that.

I sat down and couldn't stop playing it.  A few differences that could be seen as detractors to some.  This is going to sound like a giant bash of the game, but I'm just putting the difference out there, I'm not going to stop playing it anytime soon.\n\nTactical combat is real time - however you can pause during it, so not sure why so many people don't like it.  There is less to do in combat, you can make your large ships go first, eat some shots and make your small ships move in to do more damage.  You can also position your ships behind asteroids and missles hit them (a really cool addition to the original).  I like the combat myself, but right now you can't disable weapons and select specific ones like you could in Moo2 (say to stop your missles shooting an asteroid).\n\nShip building is also fairly difficult because you cannot chose to refit specific ships in a specific manner, this ability to micro might be added later, but for now you have to change your base design, then either refit or build a battleship, if you go to upgrade it later because you got better armor or shield tech, you have to redo the schematic.  To refit or upgrade a ship there isn't a production option, the only way is to spend credits on it at a starbase or starlanebase.\n\nIt feels like food and population growth is too easy, you are able to farm "barren" planets, and with soil enrichment technologies, they provide alot.  I haven't yet settled on "toxic" or "volcanic" planets... so maybe barren just got an upgrade.\n\nThe Diplomatic victory is a misnomer - right now it's all about your current popluation (other races don't have to like you, you can be at war with them all).   If you can grow your empire enough, you win the game if you have over 66% of the galactic population.  That does seem like alot, but I've won 5 games by just expanding and maxing food growth - all vs the standard AI.  It seems like with the current setup you'd never win by pure combat - the vote would probably finish when you conqured 2/3 the galaxy.  Also, if you start to conqure the more numerous faction you are likely to win faster.  Obviously the AI is weak, and technology victory isn't in the game.  Actually I think I would have won all 5 games with tech victory faster then dipolmatic, so I guess it's a moot point, still strange there is no diplomacy involved.\n\nHeavy/Low gravity needs balance - Low gravity isn't a negitive at the moment, you can still settle on "normal planets" - actually Low grav is a bonus, I'm pretty sure if you have lowG you can settle low and normal with no penalty and HighG with -50%.  If you are normal low and highG get you -50%.   Moo2 was HighG = no penalty (maybe -25% on lowG it cost points to pick up), LowG -25% on normal and -50% on highG (it gave you points to spend).   Normal was -25% on Low and High\n\nOne of the biggest changes is there is no "creative" - you get all the techs, except a few where every race has to pick between two or three choices.  Some are really tough, you have to pick heavy armor OR reinforced hull, you can never have both.  This is a good balance option and hopefully the AI choses different things so you can either trade or steal it from them (spying not in game as of yet).\n\nOh another big change is "Starlanes".  I actually really like the stratical implication of this and is one of the best things.  Every star system has only a few ways to access it, and from only specific other systems.  This creates chokepoints, and makes it much easier to decide where to go. I have settled on farther planets with less physical value (poor/small etc), just because it protects 1 or 2 other systems that I want full control over later.  One game I settled pretty far out and close to an AI, and he got completly boxed in by myself and another AI and only had access to 3 systems...  It does make actually finding your way to Orion much harder though, there is an "open borders" option in diplomacy, so I guess you can spend a few credits or whatnot to get through someones terrian.\nIn Moo2, you kinda had to have your fleet centralized near important planets, then once you saw someone moving there, you'd have to respond.  I never really played multiplayer, but I think it would be impossible to defend anything, because once you got tech to tell your ships to change direction, you could tell them to go to somewhere nearby, and just instantly stop at a closer planet... there was a tech to help prevent that and increase movement to it, but seems kinda silly.\n\nOne thing I'd love to see in the game is ship and colony heroes, but they have some touching up and retweaking ship design and refits before a custom ship hero is going to do too much.  At first I was thinking of putting off my purchase until they got added, but after reading everyone elses review and the forums I decided that heroes are just kinda a garnish add-on that make the game fun to player longer.\n\nI have no idea how long this is, and I've probably skipped some changes (well there are no antarians... no ship to ship combat or boarding - one of the best things ever in moo2 was capturing an antarian ship and scrapping or using it with its really good tech)\n\nTLDR;\nA few changes - Still Moo IMO - I love the game.\n\n\n\n","March 10","true","45.5"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

This is unnecessary, time-consuming, and potentially damaging to the game experience if the player isn't diligent and doesn't correct the issue before more units are built.\n\n-On the bombing screen, the only bomb name shown is "nuclear" even if the ships contain "fusion" bombs. Is that aesthetic or a bug?\n\n-Diplomacy has (so far) been non-existent from the AI. The only time they contacted me was to threaten. MoO2 wasn't really any better, but I would presume game AI processing has improved significantly since then.\n\n-Tactical space combat isn't. I like the idea of more real-time combat, but the tactical combat is more like trying to guide balls of varying size and speed while they are rolling downhill. I can select ships, right-click to set priority targets, (sort of) set a formation, and alter course...but ultimately the ships just turn right back toward the enemy and go full-frontal attack.\nAnd speaking of full-frontal attack, the enemy ships just sit there until your ships get close...then they just head toward your ships without the slightest deviation. The obstacles are no more useful than as eye candy, which is really unfortunate.\nIf the devs can make the space combat into an actual real-time, flowing, tactical experience, this game would be amazing. It could garner YouTube videos galore.\n\n-Not sure why only so many slots are allocated for production or food, while research appears to have unlimited slots. In MoO2 I liked how one could specialize ultra-rich planets to crank out the ships by putting everything in production.\nAlso, the technology, separate building, and separate (mandatory) ongoing order to share resources intra-planatarily makes little sense. Think how the fictional conversation would go in the game:\nPlanet 1: Hey, do you have extra food sitting around?\nPlanet 2: Yup.\nPlanet 1: Think you could send that to us?\nPlanet 2: Yeah...let me just put *everything* we're building *on hold* and have *all* our production workers fly that extra food of ours over to you.\nI could accept the tech requirement, and the building (that requires 5BC maintenance), but a production-halting order is unnecessary and just plain dumb.\n\n-Not sure why the game has an arbitrary cutoff at 500 turns. Building a decked out titan-class ship can easily take 30 or more of those turns on some of the better planets thanks to the aformentioned limited slots for production.\n\nI'll leave it at that, for now.\n\nThank you for reading.","March 14","true","219.3"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","0"

Don't let the idea that things are changed or removed make you think that depth has been diminished.\nPeople's nostalgia for MoO2 will probably cause some negative feedback for this game, as they see any alteration as heresy.  However, this game is going in the right direction.  Things are being added, adjusted and reworked to get the correct balance of old and new.\n\nThere are numerous races, which are becoming increasingly distinct as the developers progress.  The tech tree is more akin to the Civilization series than the distinct and entirely seperate branches of pervious MoO games, but it works well.\nThe combat is real time, but the developers have been listening to the userbase and have added the ability to pause, and various options to make the game not feel like a click heavy rts.\n\nThe developers have been top notch, working with and listening to the community.  They clearly love the property and want to make a great game that will appeal to both the newcomer and to Master of Orion veterans.

Ive even gone way out of my way to get it to work multiplayer even after that aspect of the game went down. That being said, I have seen a lot of negative feedback about this new verson of MOO and I just wanted to address some of the unfavorable responses I have seen.  I understand there gripes, It is not a MOO clone exactly.  But to be honest, i didnt want a moo clone or i would just boot up moo 2.  Yes the trade lanes add a different feel to the game. But IMO they can be used to add a stragety element to the game.  I can colonize a planet in strategic places to block off entire sections of the galaxy to myself.  Some people claim that you can have every tech in the game. Well, when i first played i was given this impression myself.  but on closer inspection there are some techs that are one or the other.  An example would be I can choose to have either Fusion Beam or Fusion drive.  On the tech tree it appears as Fusion Beam | Fusion Drive.   I can CHOOSE to be faster in space faster, or have better beam weapons right now, if i choose one, it will be a while before i have something better in the other field i didnt choose.  This is not the only example on the tech tree.   Now for the battle system.   All together I think this game is a great addition to the moo franchise. It is AMAZINGLY better than MOO 3 at any rate and the best addition I have seen to the game in decades. We should be thanking NGD studios and WG Labs for taking a chance on a game that took a lot of hard work for a fan base that doesent seem to appreciate a gift.  If this game does well, they may attempt yet another version down the road.  And maby they will incorporate the things you dont like about this game.  As it is now, it is a well polished game, with a few bugs for them to work out. Its in early access, give it a break while it is a work in progress.","March 12","true","179.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

The nights until 3am - during school - I'd stay up because ONE MORE TURN.\n\nThat carried over to Master of Orion II.  ONE MORE TURN, and oh how my grades would suffer.  Chemical addiction had nothing on Moo2, and I regret nothing.\n\nSo then came Moo3 and I got deeply involved in the fan side of things and worked to make the game good.  While it is largely considered a failure, it still holds a warm place in my heart.\n\nThis Master of Orion is in absolutely no danger of challenging any of that.  In fact, this tripe feels more like a student project than a game worthy of a genre-defining classic.\n\nFirst, the good points:\nSlick graphics.  Lots of JJ-Abrams flare and a strong palette.\nMusic is nice and fitting.\nVoice acting is stellar.\nBeloved races from earlier incarnations are well realized.\nNow, my problems:\nAbyssmal diplomatic feedback.  Friendly, treatied neighbor attacked without there being any feedback to me that this was coming.  Straight out of the blue.\nDisastrous diplomatic design.  Really, friendly races suddenly attack?  No insults, no declining relations?  Just a roll of an invisible die and 'hey, lets shoot at the human.'\nPathetic star systems.  One or two planets might have been fine in the early 90s but today it feels like cut budget (or cut corners).  And those early 90s games at least benefited from the then-dominant threory that planets were rare.\nSpacelanes.  Can you say chokepoints?  First one to a few key systems wins whole regions of the map...no way out of that.\nBoring tech tree.  Anymore linear and y=mx+b could be used to plan your action.\nRaces don't feel special.  Everyone is just a rubber-suited alien.  60s Star Trek sported more attempted diversity.\nSo I wouldn't recommend this and struggle to see if it's salvagable.  The diplomacy engine needs to be gutted, completely, and rebuilt to perhaps make some effort to resemble interacting with real races.  Instead I'm left at the mercy of a random die roll and there's NOTHING a player can do to stop that.\n\nTake your money and go get Stellaris.  Or Distant Worlds.

With its transcendental music, lovely graphics and rich possibilities that may make each game unique, MOO2 is like the ultimate tool for meditation for me. The previous sequel, MOO3 (not this game!) was quite the contrary, I genuinely disliked it.\n\nSo, briefly I have been waiting for a good sequel for ages. It has finally arrived. I loved it.\n\nThis new implementation did a very good job on maintaining the original qualities that made MOO2 a cornerstone piece for 4X lovers. Even though the game is still in early access, it is engaging, doesn’t overwhelm with details even though they are there if you feel like micromanaging, same calm graphics and music, and is very playable. If you are looking for one, this game is a proper sequel to MOO2. It is definitely worth its price. If you love MOO series, go for it.\n\nI have some criticism for the early access as of May’16, though:\nIt is getting a bit too similar to Civ5 dynamics: City states, establishing embassies etc. While it gives a familiarity feeling for Civ players, I would expect more innovative diversions from the Sid’s path.\nDiplomacy is still a bit shaky, very frequently in a single turn you may become the common BFF of the galaxy and after a few turns suddenly they see their error and declare an all-out war on you. I am sure there will be a better AI diplomacy when the game is released.\nI like playing tactical battles, but they are still a bit confusing for me. With every new release I give it a try but I always end up auto-resolving the battles.

Related to this fact, the diplomacy backdrop screens are a blast.\n\nThe starmap is gorgeous and I was surprised at the amount of polish it got. In terms of interface, it feels like a hybrid between MOO1 and MOO2 in that it has systems and planets and moons and asteroids (like MOO2) but maintains a simple interface that allows me to easily see what's on the map without having to click through menus (like MOO1).\n\nSpaceships are neat looking and space combat looks pretty cool.\n\nFun races, overall a classically zany feeling to everything.\n\nI like the UI and think it was pretty well designed.\n\nBad points:\nThe technology tree is currently pretty messed up. You achieve a new technology like every 5 turns but most of them don't feel like they make a difference. Many just unlock a building type which has to be propagated over your empire for a million turns before you see the benefit, and in general I feel like the real bottleneck in getting to cool things is always production (making research pretty unattractive, since there's no point in unlocking another thing when you won't be able to capitalize it for 500 turns). There also doesn't really seem to be any reason to strategically cherrypick your way through the tech tree either; with a few exceptions the best approach is just to research everything in the current tier and then move on.\n\nThere are too many buildings, and the game encourages you to build all of them everywhere. What this results in is spending your midgame tediously making sure every one of your planets has a research lab and a biosphere and a hydroponics farm and a spaceport and a cloning facility and a marine barracks and a spaceport and a robotic miner and so on and you get the point so I'll stop listing all of the buildings in the game but believe me when I say that it keeps going on for quite some time. It all makes me wish that planets had a limited number of building slots so that I could just make a few smart choices per planet and move on.\n\nIt's not possible to make interesting diplomatic exchanges until you have convinced another empire to accept your embassy, which requires being friends with them. In an unfortunate catch-22, in order to become friends with an empire, you perform advanced diplomatic exchanges requiring an embassy. Some races even start with unfavorable relations with others and in these circumstances there's basically nothing to do except watch the AI refuse to let you establish an embassy until they ultimately declare war on you because you colonized a lot of planets. Obviously this is silly.\n\nThe real time tactical combat basically involves moving a big ball of ships at the enemy and hoping that you have more ships on your side.\n\nThere are a few other things but those are the big issues that come to mind right now, and I'm hopeful to see them ironed out before the release.","March 1","true","43.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

But one of the huge problems with MoO2 was the late game, having huge fleets and battles that took forever; it stopped being tactically fun and just a tedious and laborious inconvience. So with this new iteration, I'm glad to see they have tried to address that by adding in paused/realtime combat. It's too early to say they will have it spot on but the direction is quite exciting to see.\n\nI like the introduction of starlanes, I feel it adds in choke points and the ability to have a war front and not have surprise attacks on some odd random system miles from the rest of your fleet. I also think they have done really well in capturing the spirit of the original MoOs.\n\nReally looking forward to see how this evolves.","March 4","true","23.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It is a brilliant game that has stood the test of time.  Do not purchase or judge this game out of nostalgia or unrealistic hopes this game will be exactly like Master of Orion II.\n\nThis game, in its Early Access stage, is pretty good.  Yes, there are several mechanics that are not fully implemented, and yes diplomacy still need quite a bit of work.  However, if you are wanting to buy an Early Access product, you shouldn't really expect it to be completely polished.\n\nAs for myself, I already quite like this game as it is.  The design is pretty neat.  The learning curve isn't steep.  And it's really a game that I find myself drawn into.  I've owned the game for only a few days and have already put in over 20 hours.  I even experienced the "one more turn" syndrom... a pleasure that I haven't experienced in a good long while.\n\nI know this may not be a glowing recommendation; but, this game has actually got a lot of good going for it, if you give it the chance to mature into its own product: not a shadow of Master of Orion II.

I like the general direction the game is taking.  The AI is not very challangeing yet but still fairly enjoyable early on.  I like the idea of NPC minor civs but they dont seem to do much yet other than to give me 40 to 70 credits upon killing nearby pirate ships and bases.  They are yet to offer any mission/quest other than to ask for a single tech early on.  Combat seems to be a little better other than the occasional freeze or CTD following the combat after action report during transition to main screen.  The ship build/refit changes took some getting use to.  They are not very smooth and the way systems are presented in the new drop down menu is muddy and a pain to work with.  The previouse version of ship fitting was more intuitive and smoother.  You should link the ship slot with the systems capable of inhabiting them so the process would go a little more smooth.  By the late game the dropdown menu is way too populated and there is no rhyme or reason to the order they are listed even after choosing a single class of system. There was little gained from the refit changes and in several respects it is less efficient.  First do no harm...then...  Non-gated travel, going off the beaten path, should be an option for later propultion techs.  I liked this ability in other MOO games. I agree with some others, Antarans should be brought back as slap-back "regulators" focusing on mega civs that progress too quickly.  Someone else mentioned the late game economy, and yes I have a game going where I can buy titans every oher turn, not realistic.  Maybe consider a cap on purchasable construction points on capitol ships.  I mean really, the parts still have to be fabricated and assembled.  Maybe cap capitol ship purchase to 75% of total.  I still dont see anything about fighters and bombers that make me want to include them in design.  They really seem to be useless at this point.  They add nothing to overall combat points in practice. I want to build a carrier variuent but dont see the point yet.  Anyway, keep up the good work.  So stoked that MOO is reborn.","February 29","true","193.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

A nice addition would be racial tech specialities (technologies that can only developed by the race) but I migh also have overlooked them. And of course some additional planetary types... oh, and maybe trying to make some additional races ;-)\n\nNever mind I am just rambling. Great Game, if you like 4X games, you might as well try to get some money for this one.","March 10","true","10.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Imagine if Sins of a Solar Empire was turn-based. That pretty much nails it.\n\nLook, I've never played MOO before this, but I have played a ton of CIV, and various Space-faring games over the years, and here's my take, as a simple guy looking for a simple Space strategy game.\n\nThis game has held my interest like no other. EVERY SINGLE OTHER Space game I tried either bored me, the mechanics were too difficult to grasp properly and I gave up after 5 hours, or I just didn't like the way the game worked. Other than SoaSE, but that was real-time strategy, not so much Turn-based 4x.\n\nThis game is simple to grasp, fun to play, looks amazing and runs brilliantly, and is just a joy to breeze through. That being said, I have gotten to points where I just got bored and ended up clicking the "Next Turn" button repeatedly because I had pretty much done everything that there was to do at the time, and I then had ages to wait for the next big thing to happen, but I do get that this game is still EA and not all content is there yet. I mean, I'm hoping I'll see "more" things added to each race (I doubt it at this point though) and I am still looking forward to seeing the remaining races being added... However, managing planets is so far very basic, and trying to set up colonies on "bad" planets is an absolute nightmare.\n\nBut yeah, so far I've really enjoyed this game, and I'll reserve judgement until release. I do think it might get boring the longer a session goes on, but we'll see, I suppose it also depends on difficulty and number of races playing (last thing you want is to be overwhelmed and hate the game) and I will admit I was playing rather "light" games in systems mostly blocked off with unstable wormholes.\n\nMy score so far for EA: 7.0 / 10\n\nEdit: A few niggles I just noticed. One: In real-time space battles, your ships just charge the enemy, and while they are being pummeled by gunfire, they start CIRCLING AROUND the enemy and STOP SHOOTING while they do this!!! So I'm left with half my fleet flying around in circles doing nothing for up to 30 seconds at a time while they get hammered. WTH?? They will try to shoot through asteroids instead of waiting until they get clear line of sight (asteroids block shots) and it's impossible to position them tactically because they just beeline straight for the enemy every time. This is a big no-no.","March 12","true","3.3"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","9","22","0","0"

This is not a MOO remake. It is a MOO2 remake.\n\nAnd that is a BIG difference.\n\nThis game MIGHT turn out sort of fun, but I really dont understand why we need another Gal Civ clone, when you actually could remake MOO...\n\nIn my oppinion MOO has four MAJOR advantages over ANY other 4x Space game and very little flaws.\n\n1) Simplicity in the planet management - No buildings plz. Leave that to Civ and all the other space games. The ledger system was (and is still) quite unique.\n2) Random tech lists - Somtimes you just get stuck with no planetary shields or the right tech to colonize. Have a good laugh, cross your fingers and hope for a miracle to happen.\n3) Unique Fleets - We only needed room for more than 6 ship designs and a way to upgrade old ships to new designs.\n4) Gigantic turn based space battles - How many legendary fights have you had where your repulsor beam held back waves of enemy ships, while your planetary missles ripped the enemy apart.\n\nBut you are not going to find all of that in this game. So thumps down from me.\n\n","February 28","false","2.0"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

Changing from turnbased combat to RTS is interesting once they implement the facing of weapons (pro's / cons to doing it).  I disagree with the way they created tech tree to resemble the CIV 4/5 style of teching.  I loved the MOO2 version which made for harsh decisions when going up the tech tree.  There were a lot of critical decision making as far as tech is concerned in MOO2, not so much in this version of the game in which you can tech it all eventually (the choices for certain tech seemed inconsequential because one side of the tech is usually better than the other).  Overall i believe that wargaming could successfully make a decent game out of the bones that they have layed out in this iteration of a wonderful series (i mean MOO 1 & 2 because 3 is utter crap).","February 29","true","53.5"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","8","20","0","0"

I hope that in a few of the areas that the original MOO/MOO2 didn't do very well that the new development team can innovate enough to bring the game into what we should expect out of a 2016 release.\n\nI can't comment too much on things that still appear to be unfinished - for example, numerous reviews have been pretty critical of the current ship battle experience and I would agree that it is missing a lot of features, but based on its current state compared to how other elements are fleshed out I would say that it will probably get better before the developers are done.\n\nWhat I would say is that there are a few aspects of the original game that should be more significantly revisited in this version of the game. Two examples are the way that technology influences battle outcomes and how the tech tree implements the restrictive either/or choices from MOO2.\n\nIf you played MOO2 you know that a) a more technologically advanced ship pretty much always beats a lesser one and b) a bigger ship is pretty much always better than a smaller one. Because the current combat system is so close to the old one, that's still true, but that's really not the best way to balance gameplay in my opinion. The developers should probably try to evolve the game a bit more so that new tech isn't the automatic win that it is in the old game.\n\nOn the tech side, it's improved from the MOO2 system where you were generally given a choice between two or three useful technologies that didn't really make sense to be mutually exclusive; there's only a few times where you have to pick between two different options. However, the ones that are there don't make a lot of sense; for example, you can have either fusion bombs or fusion beams, but never both. It seems like it would make more sense to provide a more sensible system if they want to prevent full access to the entire tech tree. Maybe an affinity system that lets you do certain things better than others in the combat realm - for example, maybe some races can build better shields where others can build bigger ships.\n\nThe final comment I will make is that it costs a pretty hefty price and that there are a few things that they need to do to really make it worth that - the textures are currently pretty low resolution in a lot of cases and the art assets are limited in ship building.\n\nEven with the current flaws, I'd still give the game a thumbs up, and if you were waiting for a MOO/MOO2 remake, this is definitely it in my opinion.","March 6","true","77.9"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

The ship is way off in the distance and yet it is shown as if they are flying in front of the trees that are right in front of the camera (from your point of view). I am not a game programer by any means, but this is just lazy and shows either that they don't have much in the way of quality control or just have not gotten around to fixing it yet (I hope it is the later).\n2) Landing scenes part 2: No ship sounds...just music. I hope this gets changed. I have tried turning down the music, but the ships just float down without sound. Also, when the ships get ready to land...no landing struts? The scene just cuts out (and some of the designs don't look like the will land too well...with parts that will be buried deep into the ground and cause the ship to crash!)\n3) The Psilon AI (helper) voice is the MOST annoying voice in the game. No way to shut off the AI helper yet. Please get rid of the Psilon AI voice or change it's tone. Too shrill (IMO).\n4) Sol, the home system of the Humans usually only starts with 1 planet? I'm pretty sure our Solar System has more than one. Also, along that same note, I have yet to play a game where your starting system has more than one planet that you can use. Sure, late game tech lets you change gas giants and asteroid belts into planets, but that doesn't help you to start off.\n5) There needs to be more options under advanced options: Such as: Minimum planets per system and Max per system. I have had several games where I found yellow stars (which should generally hold the best planets) without any planets. Also, needed: 1) Distance between star systems, 2) A "Huge" galazy size, 3) Difficulty setting for each AI (some species are more aggressive than others). 4) The abiity to customize your ship types (the models shown. I love playing the Psilons, but hate their ship shapes). 5) The ability to choose your empire color and flag.\n6) Combat right now is a major sore point for many players. Some absolutely hate real time and want the turn based of the original MOO. Others are on the other side of the fence. I like both ways personally. However, The orders for the ships need to be fleshed out a great deal more. I don't want my long range missle armed ships to closed to point blank range. There also should be a chance to get some tech points or something from wreckage I think (maybe have to have a salvage drone on your ships?).\n7) Asteroid belts need to have a chance to have some kind of bonus (have rare metals (bonus production/research if a base is built) or artifacts or something. Right now, they can be explored...but I have yet to find anything special about them.\n8) Ship designer needs to have an option to edit your military bases and star bases. Right now the computer chooses what tech to place on your bases and it will upgrade it, but if you have choosen a missle heavy approach and beam weak...the beams on your station won't due you a whole lot of good will they?).\n9) Ship designer needs to have more stats about the weapons. When I am building my ship, I want to see the range of the weapon I am placing on the ship. I would also like to be able to test my ship (either against another design of mine or against known ships that are out there), before I start building a fleet of them.\n10) The tech tree is a bit limited. There are no race specific techs and some of the explanation for the techs are wrong. Example: Cloning centers should increase your growth by a certain percent. Yet for months they are listed (and any other structure that is supposed to give a bonus to growth as well) as -x%, not +x%.\n11) The game in general feels very watered down. No artifacts that you can discover on planets that give bonus tech, ships or credits (though there are some things floating around in space that you can pick up, rare though).\n12) The game stutters some (like all WG platforms I think). I have a 2.67Ghz i7, 24GB Ram, Geforce GTX-980 (not the crappy version).\n\nOkay, the pros:\n1) If you are a fan of 4x, you will like this game. Is it 100% ready? No. I would say it is about 70-80% there (I hope they are going to flesh it out a bit more).\n2) The graphics (when they get them right) are good.\n3) The special effects of battle are good (when you can zoom in and see them).\n4) The replay value is good, however, it can get boring since parts are still missing.\n\nOverall, I would rate this game a 6.5/10. It has the potential to be a 9. If future patches change my opinion, I will update the review. However, I am personally waiting for Stellaris to come out on May 9th. That game seems to be just fricking awesome. Disappointed on how WG seems to have dropped the ball on this game.\n\n","April 8","false","47.4"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","2"

If you go into this expecting a MoO2 clone, you're going to be disappointed!\n\nMajor Complaints:\n-- The races are cartoon-y.  All of them.  It's not TF2 endearing, it's not tasteful, it's not amusing. It's just embarrasing\n-- Currently a 500 turn cap, or so I'm told.  I haven't hit the counter yet.... but I have no desire to have one, ever, in any strategy game I play.\n\nMinor concerns:\n- Diplomacy is barely implimented, extremely rough\n- Tech tree is limited, with almost no branches\n- Ship customization is there, but also extremely rough\n- Your advisors are annoying as f*#!.  Not even kidding, I had other people in the room yelling at them to stop repeating the same lines over and over.\n- Sadly, the Galaxy News is the same.\n- Tactical battles functional, but bare.\n..... but you DID notice that it's Day 1, right?  And still early access..... so NONE of the above should suprise you!  If you're looking for this already out of development, play GalCiv 2/3.\n\nI, on the other hand, love where this game already is at Day 1, and as long as the developers keep in touch, I expect to see the Masters of Orion that never really was...\n\n+ Crisp galactic maps (I look forward to bigger maps and variety!)\n+ Natural barriers (advanced starlanes) to limit early game expansion.  No, you don't have to like it... but you're limited to your little corner until you grow up and can fly the big star lanes like all the other Big Kids.  No rushing for the enemy capitol and nuking them from orbit... not yet, at least.  Stop complaining.... if you remove it, the AI will nuke you ever time on turn 30 if given a chance.  It's there for a reason!\n+ Ship designs have all the basics for a well thought-out design program.  It's fundamental, but the basics are there.\n+ Building / Development trees for colonies are REMARKABLY well-fleshed.  If anything, they need to get a bit more restrictive of setting up colonies in horrible locations, like dumping all your giant cats on a giant aquatic infertile rock.\n+ While combat is rough, it seems extremely fair and grounded in a good place.  They need to add features, but there doesn't seem to be the need for overhaul.\n+ Graphics are smooth, with some intentional art-styling.  Hopefully they will move over to ALL art-styled or ALL crisp graphics, rather than a mix.\n+ Mechanics are more or less intuitive, with the need for some minor UI tweaks.  If you've played Endless Space, MoO2/3, or GalCiv, you'll feel right at home.\n\nNeutral Concerns:\nThere is a lot not fleshed out here, and we're going to optamistically cross fingers for further development.  If it was left in this state, it would NOT be a finished product... but I'm sure they know that.\n\nI'll re-visit this as time progresses, and update as features are implimented.  If they listen to even a quarter of what I've seen posted on the Steam Forums, this game will be a gem polished to a stunning luster.\n\nRight now it's a rough gem, with a little unpolished beauty poking out.  But I'm certainly smiling as I'm imagining what it's going to look like in 6 months.","February 28","true","13.7"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

I am a long-time fan of the Master of Orion IP and I must have played hundreds of MOO2 games.\n\nMOO is well polished considering it’s an early access title.  The game did not crash once and performance was excellent. There were no hiccups or glitches as far as I could tell.  There were some minor UI errors that caused some data to not display correctly and the game does not scale for various resolutions perfectly.  It’s a solid base for a game with excellent voice acting.  (Mark Hamill, John de Lancie, and Michael Dorn!)\n\nEarly access is missing a great deal of content including 5 races (6 if you count the missing custom race), two victory conditions, and certain game mechanics like spies and leaders.  Also you can currently only play on ‘average’ difficulty with a maximum of 6 total players and limited galaxy selections.  Games are quite easy to win if you’re a veteran 4x, turn-based player.\n\nAs expected, there are no dedicated multiplayer servers, but multiplayer players of this genre tend to only play with close friends anyways so I don’t see this as a negative.\n\nShip to ship combat is in real time and works well, but actions and choices are limited to fleet formation and movement.  Otherwise combat is quite automated.  This is a negative for those players that enjoyed the turn-based combat of MOO2.  Ground combat is very basic (well, non-existent) in the current build.\n\nConclusion:  If you are a fan of the Master of Orion franchise and certain that you will buy the game no matter what, by all means purchase the collector’s edition. For those of you looking for a challenging, complete-game experience, you will want to wait until release.  Also there will be a version of the game offered for around $30 so if you’re really on the fence, wait for that.  In its current condition the early access game is appropriate for nostalgic, die-hard fans and players that have already decided to buy the game no matter what.\n\nYou can check out the game on my stream at Twitch.tv/purplepoloplayer\n","February 28","true","34.1"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

The devs have taken some liberties and changed some of the core features of MoO 1/2, such as replacing the turn based combat with real-time. At first, I was a bit shocked with the change, but I have learned to like it. Short sum up of pros and cons:\n\n+ gfx are gorgeous and game is really smooth and good looking\n+ space lanes are welcome in MoO\n+ real time combat proves to be more interesting than the attacker-wins-all-battles advantage from turn based combat from MoO 1/2.\n+ holds to the best of MoO\n\n- some screens and fonts lack finishing\n- real combat is a step the right direction, but still lacks control to have some tactical meaning. Besides using asteroids as cover for beam/missile barrages, you can't do much. Also, combat should offer the choice to retreat.\n- colony management could be more intelligent\n- diplomacy is lackluster. I would like to see something closer to Civ4/5, with stronger alliances forming between races. As it is now, it looks every race is out there for themselves, just contacting you to demand stuff.\n- still missing features such as ship boarding or the Antareans.\n\nConclusion : all in all, happy to pay $50 to prove there is space in modern gaming for gems such as MoO. Great start as early access, and just hope the devs don't drop the ball and keep pushing the game in the right direction.","February 28","true","22.9"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

I enjoyed this beautiful MOO version very much.\n\nThe graphics looks awesome, the voice acting is excelent. The tech tree is very smooth even for Early Access. The balance of the game in general is really enjoyable although for true 4X fans like me you would probably find it too easy now, but hey it´s Early Access, so I´m sure it will have difficulty levels for the full release for more challenging sessions.\n\nIf you are a fan of the original MOO or even a big fan of Civilization like me, buy it right away, it´s really worth it. If you rather wait until they end up polishing the balance, difficulty levels, so on, you can probably wait until full release, but once again if you are a strategy games fan sooner or later this great game will end up in your library.,","February 28","true","6.2"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

MOO3 on the otherhand, was the greatest dissapointment of a game I have ever played, so my expectations for this game were low.\n\nAlot of people on the internet have had their say. They praise the presentation, the voice acting, the little touches of nostalga throughout but they also point out the negatives, which at this point are substantial. Realtime instead of turnbased space combat, the cheesiness, the general lack of polish and the lack of depth compared to other games in the genre (Distant Worlds, Stellaris). That being said, the real question is and remains, is this game worth your time and money?\n\nYou will have to decide that for yourself, but for me, sofar it is very promising. I got my code for the game from a third party at a discount, so like Charlie Sheen, I feel like I'm winning. The game itself ATM is pretty easy. The AI is hilarious in how glitched it is. It demands nearly every planet in my empire for peace while I'm ROFL stomping all over its fleets and bombing its planets into dust. It is clueless.\n\nYou may be thinking, "why would I spend my money for a glitched game that's still in development"? The answer, it's alot better now than MOO3 ever will be because they atleast got the mechanics right. I find it fun to play and am confident that it will get alot better in the coming months and I'am glad I purchased it. To me it's a diamond in the rough that needs to be cut and polished.","March 7","true","28.5"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

There are a few things I'm hoping get ironed out-\n\n1. A way to dedicate enough production to clean up that you eliminate waste build up (like you could by just clicking the arrow in the original?)\n2. I would like to be able to bypass warp points and cross pure space with large penalties later in the game\n3. Large planet or system wide construction projects that would require the resources of at least a half dozen planets for the small projects (halos, specialized planetoids), and even perhaps half a huge galaxy for the big ones (ring worlds, Dyson spheres) Production could easily be rerouted to such projects from an Interplanetary Administration.\n4. I would like to be able to negotiate exceptions to treaties to prevent conflict and make it easier to maintain relations by allowing you to do things they might not like, but needing to pay a large cost to mitigate their displeasure. An example of this would be offering tech or credit in order to settle a planet that's closer to them then they'd like.\n\nI like the flexibility of the diplomacy offer/counteroffer system letting you feel out what they want (and then negotiating for less). Looking forward to seeing espionage implemented and unlocking all the races again. I am very curious to see if mixing races of your empire by conquering planets populating other races will have any impact on espionage; and possibly eventually improving relations as your populaces get used to intermingling. This could be a way for both sides to bypass some of the planet wide DNA detectors whether your empire n captured a planet or had a planet taken.\n\n","March 13","true","151.7"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","0"

I feel bad that so many Steam users don't understand what that means and end up disgruntled. I hope they revisit the game when it's fully released.  Meanwhile I feel like we EAs have *some* influence over what the game will become.\n\nI bought MOO in 1993 and have been playing it since.  I was one of the many disappointed by MOO3.\n\nMOO4 (as I'm calling it) totally delivers.  Before I bought the CE I was super skeptical. I also told myself I was going to wait for it to go on sale.  But then I just couldn't wait... and I'm glad I got it.\n\nI am enjoying the new addition of space lanes and warp points, it totally adds another element of strategy. Never thought I would like something like that until I actually played it and see how it shapes the game. It is different.\n\nI was very worried about the well known names they got for voice acting... but ultimately it came out way better than I thought.  Although the GNN team isn't great, they are not really that noticeable and it's easy to SKIP or disable entirely.\n\nCombat was the thing I most worried about.  I want something tactical and something that delivered the same enjoyment from MOO1 battles.  So far in Early Access it's just the "bones" of what is to come and so far it's great.  I never thought RTS battle would work, since it didn't at all in MOO3.  But it totally works so far and it's a lot of fun - it is however in the early stages.\n\nThe ship building is the same, at least the outline of it. I just hope they give us more options for making unique looking ships.\n\nI love that the devs are reaching out to the community trying to make this the best game they can.  Overseeing the entire production is Chris Keeling.

For an EA game, it feels very good so far.  I can't wait for the features to be complete, and the actual game release.  I know people are upset over the combat (in some ways rightfully so, as it currently feels a bit hollow), but this still has the feel of MOO and MOO2 more than any other game in my library at the moment.\n\nDevs - please do take the time to listen to the community.  You have the start of a very good game, but the community suggestions will make it better.  There are some issues with the base game at the moment as far as balance, Tech trees, AI, and Combat, but these are all things that can easily be worked out over the EA period.\n\n9/10 for an EA release - the only real negative thing is that I wish a few more of the mechanics were complete, and I think the combat system and shipbuilder needs work to make it feel truly "tactical" when fighting - even if it stays real time (pausable).

Nice touch.\n\nAI has gotten a lot more aggressive but still needs some work, tactically it tends to chase rabbits and is easy to kite.

No one is ever going to surrender colonies unless they're losing a multi-front war and need to close a front, so demanding them as peace terms when the AI is getting wrecked is just silly.

For those who have played the MOO franchise (let's ignore MOO3), yes they have managed to imbue the game with some of the same kitschiness that its predecessors had.\n\nThe races offered with the initial release are humorous enough and offer some amusing gameplay via quality voice acting, and more races are to come.\n\nThe UI is largely functional, operable, logical and without much in the way of glitches. That might not sound like a ringing endorsement, but the fact it enables you to get on and play the game without really noticing its there, is a positive for me - it means nothing is wrong (the same can't be said for all 4x games).\n\nThe battle intro cutscenes are some of the best I've seen in any game, and seriously I want to get into battles just to see and hear my ships warp into the combat zone. These are some of the only cutscenes in any game that I don't want to Esc through after the first few times. Similarly, most of the graphical/audio content in the game is polished and of a high level. The ships are decently rendered and you have a choice between two models/designs for each race-based ship (as well as three basic ship artwork choices), which is a nice bonus.\n\nThe game hasn't paused, slowed, glitched, locked-up or crashed on me once. When you're in late-game, turn cycle calcs take the game a few seconds longer, but that's about it.\n\nIt's enjoyable to play, and has a lot of promise.\n\nSpecific Thoughts\n\nTechnology Tree.  Each race starts with its own 'advantage' in technology, but pretty much all end up with access to everything. It would have been nice to see a race-specific technology line, or even one specific mega-technology, that sets each race aside from the next. These would still be tradeable (or perhaps not?), but either way, some more tangible differentiation would be great here.\n\nThe technology tree itself has (rightly so) been compared with Civ5 and I find it, while functional, lacklustre and linear, without any means of manipulating to achieve markedly different ends. It is possible to min/max to a degree, - or to just flatline cruise through it - but there is neither any great jeopardy nor reward in the manner in which research is able to be conducted, and I think the tree could be reworked to provide sufficient scope for achieving more varied outcomes. Again, it would also be good to see some standout race-specific tech in there.\n\nStar lanes.  People are going to argue about Star Lanes. The jury is out for me at the moment; while I had a moment of consternation when I first saw them, I can see a practicality in their use and I'm not convinced its game-limiting. Ships can't enter battles if/when they cross each other heading different directions in a Star Lanes - but this isn't wildly different to previous games.\n\nCombat.  People will also argue ad-infinitum about turn-based v real time, individual weapons control v ship/fleet based, but for me there are no great highs and no great lows. You have control in terms of pausability, navigation/targeting, use of mega weapons - but at the end of the day, if you have bigger ships, with up to date tech, then you will *usually* win. In that way current combat could be seen as a little bland, with no opening for detailed strategy or even tactics - but then it is, in general, hard to argue with 'My ships are bigger and better-armed and outnumber yours'  - notwithstanding what Sun Tzu has to say. You can, however, still lose with a theoretically more powerful  force if you just let the battle roll out and have your ships do a frontal assault on the enemy - while at the same time, a 'weaker' force can take out a stronger enemy by flanking the enemy positions, circling 'behind' them and drawing the enemy ships away from the support structures (usually the enemy will start with its ships 'behind' the enemy starbase and missile platforms - if built), so as to attack and defeat the enemy ships outside the support of its defence structures, then pick the defence structures off separately.\n\nI don’t want to see the game devolve into a combat simulator, so this is more than enough for me at this stage. Combat is always a contentious area in 4x games, but I don't feel disappointed or slighted with it here at all.\n\nAI.  This remains my biggest beef with the game. The AI is completely and mind-numbingly linear. No matter what you do, or what style of gameplay you adopt, within 10-20 turns of meeting another race, it all ends up the same from there. First the alien contact will want to share Star Charts with you, followed shortly thereafter by your bank account codes, deeds to your house, script from your unpublished novel, husband/wife and first-born child. If you refuse, then the alien's attitude toward you is immediately 100% hostile, and remains that way for the rest of the game until you annihilate them in blinding fire.\n\nThey will become scared of you when you outpace them, but they'll still hate you and, even if they drop out of war with you temporarily due to other conflicts, they will always re-declare war with you in due course (even if you have no further direct interaction). In fact, they'll choose to remain at war with you even when you have obliterated every colony they possess and you are currently hanging over their home planet in a massive fleet with your finger poised on the 'exterminate' button - rather than yielding to the inevitable and grudgingly accepting a Peace Treaty.\n\nAll the races are the same in this respect and none of the native characteristics make any difference or show through in any manner other than in voice acting. E.g. the humans are intended to be diplomats and the Psilons explorers (generalising), yet they both (like all the races) become immediately upset if you decline to share charts and then, upon refusal of the next request (usually of cash, tech and conceding a system) become enraged and declare war. Is it possible to elicit any different relationship progression or behaviour from them? Yes, but only by playing such an absurdly exaggerated game style that it makes it not only ridiculous and unenjoyable, but completely self-defeating. There is no realistic possibility of diplomacy or subtlety. In summary, the AI is completely common to all races, with only the voice acting attempting to be a differentiator.\n\nMOO fans (of which I am one) are going to point out that divergent AI was never a strong suit of MOO races, or indeed any 4x game out there - and they'd be right - but this is a really obvious short-falling (or opportunity in waiting), particularly so because the way the races have been portrayed and brought to life by voice acting gives the expectation that they are actually going to be interestingly and amusingly different in game play. The devs have a great opportunity here to make this a stand-out aspect of the game.\n\nI will be mostly playing multiplayer, as PVP is really what I enjoy, but of all games, I want to enjoy the AI and distinct racial attributes, quirkiness and game play that MOO can offer. I am optimistic that this will be forthcoming, as I am pretty certain the team is determined to make this something special.I am still enjoying the game and will wait to see how things develop.\n\nCheers","March 4","true","138.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

There are plenty of reviews from folks giving this a thumbs down and I've read through most of them.   Nearly every negative comment is due to the game not being finished yet, I still don't understand the folks who buy an "Early Access" game and expect it to not have some issues with it......c'mon people you are basicaly play testing for them so they can have TONS of input on what to fix before the full launch!\n\nThings the Devs are working on that most have commented about.  The AI is crap, yup it's extremely easy right now and they did that for a reason.  If you make it too difficult, and we all have seen that, then folks will simply throw up their hands because it's frustrating playing against an AI that is basically getting inside information or has built it cheats that allow it to progress faster.  Having a true balanced AI is extremely difficult, but they are working on it.\n\nCombat can be improved upon but many of the comments I've seen are bunk.  You can control your ships to a degree, you can select which targets they shoot at, you can change formations, you can send them anywhere on the map you want (in groups or individual ships).  You cannot choose which weapons to shoot and you cannot target specific things on the enemy ships.  It's very simplistic combat that you can actually effect the outcome of the battle.....I know, I've tested it many times and have watched my fleet lose battels they would normally easily win by me making bold and too aggressive actions.  I've also won fights that I probably would have lost if I had not manipulated my ships properly around the map.\n\nDeplomacy is something that the Devs have said is a work in progress.  Not sure what these people are talking about that the AI players are forcing them to give up tech or they "get mad at you".  Um, yeah, that's kinda the way the world works presently so it's only fitting.   The AI will get upset if you don't share but it doesn't attack you, it doesnt do anything other then pout.   No matter what you do though it really doesnt matter, the AI is so easy to beat you can share all you want and you will still win.  Again, it's something they will ramp up later and then we'll hear all the crying about it being too difficult.\n\nThe game feels very old school, is a lot of fun to play, and will get better as they add more races and tweak the AI.   Any game that I can sit down and start playing and by the next time I look at the clock it's 5hrs later is a thumbs up!","March 5","true","80.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I am very impressed with the way the game handles. You do have to make sure that you do set the graphics for 1080p otherwise the graphic performance is very choppy.

They have a great base game the feels like the old masters of orion. The system is easy to follow, A lot of the old research technologies were there. I would have liked to see some more tech however. I felt it was a good start of a tech tree, however playing different races didn't feel different. Asside from the ships looking different, that was about it.  As of this writing I have only played psilon and humans.\n\nWhat I would like to see improve: Ship combat in this game is kinda weak. I didn't feel there was much strategy to it other than ship priority. The real time combat system made it feel like picking priority targets was pretty much all you could do. I miss the turn based combat myself. The models look amazing though!\n\nI haven't read what the developers are going to do yet, and what hasn't been implemented. Some things I never found like spying for example. I felt the diplomacy section was a bit lacking as I couldn't select some colonies or techs.\n\nThis game has great potential and I am looking forward to seeing what they do to improve it.

This was one of the first 4X games I ever played and enjoyed, and this reboot lives up to the original feel. The game play can be a little buggy at times, but it’s still in development.\nAll the original races are brought to life, they interact better with the new advances that AIs have made since the original MOO came out and it makes the game enjoyable by actually having challenges between the races.\n\n+The voice acting is an added benefit, not a something at I would say is the reason to play but a nice bonus.\n\n+The HUD is simple, yet detailed enough to understand and find the data you need.\n\n+Technology is broken down into trees that you have to make some choices to advance, and it allows a deeper level of strategy planning into the sciences.\n\n+Graphics are definitely better, and are still based on the core of the original game. The ships are better designed for racial visuals and they also allow for a more customized look at each race compared to original MOO.\n\n-Diplomacy is a little buggy, and could use work to balance it out.\n\n-The News is more annoying than in past games.\n\nOther than a few bugs here and there, the game is awesome. I would highly recommend that you buy and play if you are a fan of the original. This is a good re-boot of the original Master of Orion from nearly 20 years ago.","May 12","true","41.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

If the developers put some manhours into this thing it can be great, right now it's just good - and in alpha of course.\n\nThe gameplay right now is fine and I haven't noticed any bugs - This is a pleasant surprise. The galaxy map is set up to pen you in and make you wait for technologies or fight your way out, Read starlanes, dead ends, unstable / unusable starlanes and space bases that block passage unless you have open borders. Conversely you can use these features of the game to quickly pen an opponent in to a small area and keep them weak.\n\nThe tech tree and planetary screens are easy to understand and use, although there is a weird quirk in the tech tree: Some technologies you research have two different upgrades on them but by reasearching the tech you only get to pick one of the upgrades, the other is forever excluded from you. Perhaps they intend you to get them through espionage or maybe it's just supposed to make everybody's tech a little different. Either way it's weird but interesting and I'll have to see how I like it after a while.  Upgrading ships is easy, a single click upgrades the design with the latest goodies and a single click upgrades existing ships that are in orbit of a planet you own.\n\nBy far my biggest complaint is just the visual appeal of the game. It's absolutely awful. Everything is black and dark and two dimensional. Yes space is black but space is also amazingly colorful and beutiful. For god's sake wargaming, choose the colorful and beautiful, not the black; for example you can click on your planet to get an overall view of what it's doing, guess what, 4/5ths of your planet is covered in night (facepalm). And get rid of the two dimensional feel! For example, you can click on buildings on your planet, like a marine barracks and all that happens is a small tooltip comes up with a crappy two dimensional image of the barracks and a paragraph about what it does. How about bringing me to a 3 dimensional barracks with soldiers and tanks running around and letting me look inside multiple buildings and talk to advisors in those buildings? This game has too much potential to be so visually and auditorilly boring that people may not be able to sit through 100 turns.\n\nI still recommend the game but beware of the boredom if you like your games to give you a feast for your eyes and ears.","February 28","true","15.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Mission accomplished, team. I've played MoO and MoO2 for the same 20 years that I imagine most fans have played it. When GoG made it available, it is one of those moments when the clouds parted and a ray of sunshine definitely showed through. I think the best thing we can all say about MoO3 is to not talk about it, except for the lessons about detail and colony management that were probably taken into account with this edition.\n\nDie-hards already know alot of the changes: new in-depth and awesome backstories for each fo the races, updated visuals that are beyond words awesome, clean crisp interface that combines the simplicty of MoO with the needs of MoO2. But the new is also means starlanes, no turn by turn tactical combat (yet?), race characteristics tweakability not what we're used to and a few other limitations.\n\nIt's so clear that the team put so much love into this and that early access is where we the fans get to provide input now that if only we could have done with MoO3 could've changed our feelings from disdain to reverence. This MoO is beautiful, sounds like the original with updated music, and the visual RTS tactical combat made me swear up and down when I didn't do it in tactical when my major Psilon fleet went up again the Bulrathe (and lost of course).\n\nIt's not meant to be a clone of the originals. We can play those anytime we want now. But as a long-time fan, EA is worth it to see it, play it, and give suggestions on how to improve it.\n\nNew to the franchise, maybe you should wait for an even more polished copy at release.","February 28","true","74.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I was surprised to see this update materialize unheralded, and intrigued enough to purchase an Early Access game for the first time.  Watching the videos, one has to commend the studio on its selection of actors who give life to the various faction leaders.  "Worf" (Mr. Dorn) is back!  The animated characterizations of the leaders are a treat to behold, a huge step up from the caricatures of the original.  There is a subtle humour in the exchanges, as well as with the GNN commentators and news stream.  Granted, the variety is limited, but if the game continues to be developed, I hope dialogue and events will be increased.  This IS an early release, and the development team focused, sensibly, on getting the main mechanics right.  This game plays true to the original, except as already noted in other reviews, with warp lanes/points.  The technology tree has been streamlined, ship building is refreshingly easy and enjoyable.  Colony development will be familiar but with a few new twists.  Effort was made to make the star map attractive.  While not 3D, it is perfectly fine and gives the illusion of depth.  Ship models are distinct and detailed.  Battle animations are well done, basically a video to watch, but one cannot help admire the fighters, missiles and torpedoes streaking towards their target from your battleships and Titans.  Does it, as some have mentioned, get a bit repetitive?  Yes, but then so did the original.  This just looks far better.  For an early release game, I am impressed (and surprised) that it plays so well.  It is better than several supposedly "finished" games we could all name.  After two playthroughs, I had no crashes, glitches or lockups.  My hope is that the developer will continue to refine, expand and add to this game.  There are four more races that are suggested.  As well, at this time, there are only two map selections.  Steam offered a package which included the new update along with all three of the old series.  I already had them.

I experienced this several times before I finally noticed there is a bar between the icons in the research box. This needs to be clarified. I like the idea of having to branch research in some areas one way or another, but the choice should be when the research is beginning, not when it has concluded. ~see additional comments for furtherance.\n\nAdditional comments:\n~Cannot rename stars and planets!!!!! --This drove me crazy with MoO 3 until it was patched.\n~Cannot choose flag colour. --This also was an issue with MoO 3 before patching.\n~Run spellcheck, there are several spelling errors throughout the game.\n~Real time combat can  be nice, but MoO had very well balanced turn based combat before 3. Why not have a setting for turn based combat as well as real time?\n~It might also be nice to branch the techs out further with the choosing specific research areas. With Fusion, if you choose fusion beam, you should get later research for enhanced targeting computers, if you go with fusion bombs, you should have later research options for hardened colony structures, or another defencive area for planets.\n\n*Annoying, but it's early access, and these will be put in. I look forward to the full release!","February 28","true","37.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

It definitely feels like MOO2 and more what 3 should have been. The GNN screens are definitely a nice touch. A little cartoony with the Psilon personally, but from my brief encounters with other factions they are pretty spot on. Pollution is a nice addition to the game in how it is handled. If you liked the original and/or 2, then this game is definitely worth watching.","April 29","true","118.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

It's great but beware - it's being sold as a full price game and it isn't quite there yet. There are a few bugs, for example - spying, a new mechanic they recently implemented. It used to be one of my favourite mechanics about the Darlok race but it just doesn't really work at the moment (the game keeps saying I stole a Class I Shield, this has happened about 20 times .. yet I still didn't even get it - kinda defeated the point of the race xD).\n\nThat said, it is early access as it states above. This kind of stuff is to be expected and the game is still really fun even at this early kinda buggy stage - so long as you can work around the bugs ( No Darlok race for me just yet :( )","April 29","true","68.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

You can tell that this game was made by people who know and love the MoO franchise. Most changes made to gameplay (like starlanes) are minor in nature and, at least in my opinion, make sense. The ship designer in particular is still there and not too different from MoO 2  (You can still outfit you ships with tons of different weapons and specials, as well as modify the weapons themselves - missles, beam weapons, point defense, firing arcs, ecm jammers, fighter / bomber bays, you name it).\n\nThe only real big change is the - much discussed - replacement of the turn based space combat with a (pauseable) real time version. While I am not to stoked about this myself, I do not think this is the end world, and - if done right - might even a good thing. Unfortunately, given that the A.I. is very limted so far in Early Access (the A.I.  difficulty is set to average for now), I have not been able to experience any battle involving two large fleets so far, where you could truly test the depth of the real time combat system.\n\nJust to be clear (because I have seen wrong information about this), the combat is not merely a interactive movie, like (unfortuantely) in games like Endless Space. You have full control over the ships, i.e. you can designate targets, maneuver the ships and manually activate specials on the ships.\n\nAnyhow, whether you think that MoO is a worthy sequel or not, it at the very least looks to have the potential to be an excellent 4X game,","March 2","true","108.0"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

It has that feel to it of managing resources, income and maintenance that feels like a galactic based Civ game. And just like in Civ, I suck at this game aswell.\n\nBattles are fun, even while being Real-Time. The whole universe looks very cool and engaging. The game really makes you want to explore the universe.\n\nIt runs good, not excelent, not bad. Although for some reason, the graphics seem to be kinda lackluster and there is no real difference between the 3 best options, plus there isn't a custom graphic configuration.\n\nThe things I didn't like:\nThe fact that I'm restricted until well into the game to really explore the universe. I'm limited by those warp thingies that can't be crossed until a fairly advanced tech is researched.\n\nAI is SH¡T overly agressive, I colonized a planet that another race didn't even explore yet, they are mad and they declared war already. Minutes after starting the game.\n\nIt should be clear from the get go how does the planet's characteristics affect your race and your colonies, which makes for bad mistakes that can ruin a game.\n\nPlus, some VERY important info, such as a planet's gravity, can't be seen in uncolonized planets unless you close the overview and go to the full list of planets you discovered. Inconvinient at best.\n\nI guess my biggest issue with this game is the BLATANT LACK OF EXPLANATION. Nothing is clearly stated, which can mess up real bad a game. Just because you have to go the extra mile just to know something so basic as to how to establish a trading rout. Ships automatically jump straight to the enemy's face unless you're really quick and prevent them from doing. It kinda takes away my strategic skills if on RTS the ships automatically jump to their deaths.\n\nLand invations are ♥♥♥♥, no further question. That should need a MASSIVE rework.\n\nDespite all these issues, the game is really fun. I highly recommend this game. But it is true that the game is still kinda "green". There is a lot that needs to be implemented. But I have faith it will be very good as a final product.","March 2","true","2.9"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

I loved MOO and MOO2. Would not wipe a convicts ♥♥♥ with MOO3.  Ok that being said\n\nI want to love this. The game is getting a very nice polish after years ont he shelf. But LIke XCOM you CAN NOT TAKE THE SAME GAME and just update the Graphics. The Reason XCOM reboot worked is becuase they made it thier own. it brought the familiar and added enough new to make it great. I want the same thing here very bad.\n\nPros.\n1. Graphics and Sound are top notch. - the voice acting is spectautlar and if you are a geek like me most of the voices will be familer to you. (see things like Firefly and STNG). The graphics show real polish. the detail on the GUI and tactical maps are scary good.\n2. Stable--ish - some poeple are saying they did not have crash issues. I hit a few bugs in my playthorughs both single and multi-player. Forcing me to reload the turn ( thank god for Autosave). But other than that smooth.\n\nCons-\n\n1. Ok easy one first. Labels and discriptions.  Many times. the discriptions were not accurate enough.  For example. When you are resarching a beam weapon on the tech tree you get that weapons damage, size, and cost.  Then you get to the Ship design Screen... and all you get is an inaccurate DPS and a frustating 'fleet value' more on that later.   Another example, is the Jumpgate discription... all you get is "this helps you travel between your colonies faster..." that's it.. nothing else. It doesn't actually say that it will let you travel Directly between 2 colonies without using the warp lanes. A better discription here would have made me jump on the tech much sooner in my first time through ( I obviously did in subsiquent playthroughs)\n\n2. Ship Design in general- The ship design screen is problably my biggest headache. Small bugs like the "this ship is already being used.  to the 'Auto' update that actually overwrites your ship designs with less efficeint weapons and even older armors and computers.."\n\n3. Tactical Combat- And here we have it. the ONE thing that NO 4x game seems to get right except MOO and MOO2(and even they had some flaws). Real time combat in this game is point and click you have no control over most weapons.  This problem was solved in MOO2 by a simple "on"/"off" switch. The asteroids do offer a SMALL amount of stratagy. you can use them to hide ship and engage on close combat, but that is a crap shoot and most weapons seem to go around or over them, Honestly the only truly great 3D realtime space combat I have seen is Homeworld. Soo unless you can steel a game engine or two I would suggest a switch back to turnbased. (might not be possible.. but hey I can dream)\n\n4. ok lastly  Warp lanes- Lets get one thing straight I LIKE the idea of warp lanes they segment the galaxy and it makes empire building interesting. Especially because you cannot jump through all of them right away and there is tech (jumpgates) that negates the lanes somewhat. THIS IS A GOOD THING. you can build the defense stations to give your empire a true 'border' without having sentries at every single frikken one of your colonies.\n\nWhat I do not like about them is that they are BOTHnNot limiting enough and it takes to damn long to just use them. First you have to spend a whole turn to get to the point, Then you send X number of turns traveling through the lane then you Finnaly reach the destination and it starts all over.  In the early game I would expect this kind of limitation but I would also expect Techs to negate the flaws.\n\nFor example.. All ships no matter the tech are only able to move ONE spot in a system a turn.. Better engines/fuel cells should allow for more mobility..  And the final engine in previous games allowed for instantanious travel between systems. ( Warp Gates and Transwarp drives).\n\nOk that covers the time it takes to use them now the  "not limiting enough" you can LITERALY SCOUT the ENTIRE GALAXY no matter what tech lvl you are. As I said before there are some warp lanes you cannot travel through, but it just doesn't feel epic when you can see and speak to every single race in the first 50 turns... I miss the limiters that  pushed you to research better fuel Cells so you could get that xtra parsec.\n\nOn the whole I would say this game is a GREAT alpha. I hope beyond hope that some of the issues above will be solved before release and I am looking forward to seeing the final product.","March 4","true","46.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

This game however, is a reboot of the series. This game bears little resemblance to the older games, despite the title. I personally believe that you should not review a game based on your love for the previous games. With that in mind, I will be giving this game a full non-bias review.\n\nWhen I saw this game, it was an immediate buy. It is being made by WarGaming, the same creators of World of Tanks, World of Warplanes, and World of Warships. They have been working their behinds off on those games for years, so when I saw this, I knew they would have a short early access period for it. As of the time of this review, it has had no updates. The next update is scheduled to be very soon.\n\nThey have stated that they are going to change much of the game. They have listened to their community and are addressing issues that people have. They are adding new races, making races more unique, slowing the speed at which you get new ships, and various other things. I know that most of you are thinking. "WHAT ABOUT THE DARN STAR LANES?!!!!!" Well, they said they will never remove them. They have stated that if they didn't put star lanes in the game, the AI would be exploited far too easily. They have said that they may add an option to travel to a system without the use of star lanes through a late game technology, but the travel would be very slow. They are also working on difficulty levels for the AI. Espionage is missing at the moment.\n\nNow for the good stuff, the game itself. The game is very addicting. You get a similar feeling to playing Civilization 5. However I feel that this game's pacing is too fast. You are forced to colonize every planet as fast as possible or get left in the dust. Everyone expands far too quickly, as there is no penalty for doing so. Once you learn that, you are golden. A guarenteed win every game. The AI is as dumb as a sack of rocks. But, that's why it's early access. More difficulties coming soon!(Hopefully). The AI mass up their armies of low tier ships as I get my Doom Star and Titans fitted up for war. Then came the final battle. 5 Titans and 1 Doom Star against 50 destroyers and 28 Frigates. SERIOUSLY???? That's pathetic. At least build some bigger ships or something. That's like the US army versus an ancient African tribe.\n\nThe planets and seiging need lots of work. The planets need to look more different. Every planet of one type will look exactly the same. The sieging is just explosions. There needs to be ships surrounding the planet, and craters left from the bombs. The terraforming is amazing, but you can't terraform planets that already have a bad environment. You should at least be able to terraform any planet, but if the environment is bad it should just take longer. The pollution system is very cool, and makes you have to take some very hard decisions. Example: Do I want to finish the production of my Titan and permanently damage my planet's ecosystem, or stop production and do some pollution clean up?\n\nThe tactical battle lack depth. I feel like I'm just a spectator, rather than a commander that my army is relying on to win the battle. The ships just charge each other like a bunch of barbarians. The abilities are essentially useless. The only useful ability is the black hole generator, which sucks ships in and does massive amount of damage.\n\nThe races also lack depth. The only thing that really separates them is the look of their ships. They need specific traits and unique ships/buildings, like in Civ 5. I also feel a need for race specific technologies.\n\nSCORE: 6/10 - slightly above average. The game is missing depths and uniqueness, but is still very fun to play.","February 29","true","39.3"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

All the money wasted on voice acting should have went into making an actual game that isn't horrid.   This game is nowhere near as interesting or as well put together as Master of Orion 2.  Starlanes are horrible idea, there is no sense of exploration when your starting scouts can visit every single star system without comming back to refuel or anything.  Monsters guard individual planets, not systems, so you don't have to worry about anything at all and map the whole galaxy.  Diplomacy is a joke,  you have to spend money to make trade agreements that don't last more than 20 turns....WTF?  In Master of orion 2, if you could actually get a treaty going,  you were rewarded with that treaty until you Messed up, or got framed for stealing a Tech that you really didn't do, that's fine.... buy why spend hundreds of credits on a treaty that wont even give you the money back that it cost you to set up before it runs out?  Stupid and pointless.  Espionage is pointless because everyone gets every tech, what is the point in wasting time stealing something that you are going to get anyway?   In Master of Orion 2 you HAD to spy if you wanted to get some of the good stuff that you HAD to pass on to get something else that was Indespensable.  Diplomacy animations cannot be disabled at this time, you have to wade through listening to crap that is pointless, the best strategy I found was not ever research the tech that let you establish an embasy so you don't have to listen to drivel.  No Turned based Combat is a total deal breaker,  the real time tactical combat is so boring and pointless and such a small 2D arena, I really don't understand why the Master of Orion 2 model of combat can't be used, I mean, the combat arena in Orion 2 is bigger!  SAD.  Overall, if you liked Orion 2,  keep playing Orion 2.  This game isn't even as good as Master of Orion 3, which is just about the biggest insult I can give to any game.","April 1","false","12.9"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","0"

But i cant do that, i must assimilate them into my empire. The only way to get rid of the bugs is to completely destroy the klackon base, including all the structures, then build a new base with my colony ship.\nAlso, the space combat is really bad.\nAnd there is really no sense of exploration...it's very linear, you can only follow space-lanes to other planets.\nI played alot of master of orion 1 and 2, and i'm quite disappointed...this could have been awesome, but sadly it is mediocre at best.","April 1","false","138.2"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","9","24","0","0"

The devs withhold on tactical combat for a long time before they let us know it's going to be real time and it's going to be ready for Early Access to show off. It failed on every front at the moment. Compared to RTS like Homeworld or Sins of a Solar Empire, the combat has very little depth and any "tactics". Compared to Swords of the Stars, the combat has even less depth and strategy over all. It's very simple, click attack, your ship fire, done. In Homeworld position your ship is important, especially Capital ship, and flanking Capital ship is very important. There's nothing like that here. In Sins of a Solar Empire you have hundred of abilities and micro managing your ship in real time (like any other RTS) is the key to advantage. Right now this Tactical combat has less Depth than Dune 2 24 years ago.\n\n2. The Races has very little diversity, there's almost no different bar very minor bonus/penalty. Coming from MoO 2 you will find this a big disappointment. It's like MoO 2 but you take out half of the strength and weakness of the races.\n\n3. Tech tree. If you are expecting to make important decisions with the research path in MoO 2, forget it. Decisions are too far and few in between and has too little impact at the moment. Like after researching 20 techs you are only asked to make a decision to choose between Fusion Beam and Fusion Bomb once. The rest of tech everyone has the same thing.","February 26","false","1.0"," 14 of 35 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","14","35","0","0"

I saw "Mostly Positive" and read the reviews, because I felt burned by Master of Orion III and I didn't want to waste $50.  It scared the hell out of me that all the reviews were negative.  It gave me the impression that I shouldn't buy it, and I carried a bitter taste in my mouth for a couple hours.  Then I decided to do it.  I played MOO1 when it was a new release, and I keep the disks on my desktop.  (the only floppies I have that are not in the attic)  I'm a game developer, and this game has always been a personal inspiration.\n\nSo this review is coming from someone who knows and loves MOO.  I think this game is every step in the right direction.  I had so many concerns, and now I have none.  It looks to me like the designers went back to MOO1 and updated it.  I notice this isn't MOO4, it's MOO:CTS, right?  You could call it MOO4, if you wanted, but that sort of validates MOO2 and MOO3.  Now, I got MOO2 on release day, and I played the hell out of it and enjoyed myself very much.  I don't keep the CD on my desk, though.  I'll probably never play it again.  So I'm now happy to forget MOO2 and MOO3 existed, because these wonderful people have remastered a classic.\n\nEach part of the game stays true to the original, yet is reimagined using modern game development techniques.  Systems are fun to fly around, look great, and make good strategic choke points.  Ship Design and Tech Trees have familiar technologies.  Planetary economies are simple to manage.  Realtime combat is great.  I am very happy with the decisions that the designers have made.  It is a beautiful game, and lots of fun.\n\nWhen I reread the negative reviews now, they look like a bunch of people who don't understand the concept of Early Access, and that upset me enough to come on here and share.  I am a fan of the original MOO.  I enjoyed MOO2.  I thought MOO3 was horrible.  This game is MOO 2016, and it does justice to the original.","March 2","true","234.2"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

I love this type of game and am very happy to have it. If you enjoyed Endless Space you will like this game. Just keep in mind that this game is in early access so not everything will be implemented correctly or fully. I will keep my review to things that arent affected by EA.\nThe art style is very cool, and the tactical real time space battles are pretty awesome. would love to see real time land battles in an expansion pack eventually. The space lanes implementation is really fun and allows for strategic bottlenecking of enemies but I wouldn't be opposed to the possibiity to make them redundant with late or mid game tech research. I would most definately like to see an end to tutorial pop ups as they can get really annoying the more you play and learn the game. also i think a diplomatic feature that allows you to pressure another faction to make peace with a third party would be fantastic. Also alliances should have a similar feature so that you can make your allies, allies with each other.\nTLDNR\n\noverall I would recommend you buy this game only if you are patient enough to make it through the EA, as there are still many things that either need implementation or correction.","March 8","true","44.8"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

I am a Masters of Orion fan. This game and its copy cats I have played well for a long time.\n\nWhen I go to load MoO3 my graphics are messed up so can't play it. But I like and enjoy what it had in freatures that this one doesn't. For example the way you could control spending on the different screens. I would ask that the game developers get an old laptop or desktop and go back to MoO3 and look it over.  MoO always beat out all the copy cats because of thier freatures and how it was controlled. I like the auto build option and how you can apply it planet by planet, so far the AI builds wrogn for a brand new planet instead of focusing on building up population and then defense it spends all it valuable first development time focus on making defenses. But this is the same way the empires nuild no matter the races. I have not spent enough time in this new release to see how its changed. But the AI is much tougher.\n\nThe ship to ship combat is worthless, and you get a huge OP fleet lost bc the controls are counter-intuitive. But the Auto is fun to watch. I only will do the ship to ship if I have a smaller fleet and know how to kill the other ships better than the AI. But in later parts I just do OP and let computer do it whiling focusing on overall big picture, and logistics of resupplying my fleets.\n\nHaving said that I enjoy this game AI and balancing that be tweeked but overall it is a good game for one of the copy cats But not worthy of the Masters of Orion name yet.","May 25","true","46.4"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

Even MOO3 was startling for its excellence - its problems were early release and play style that encouraged excellent players but put off lesser players.  The current MOO version is an obvious attempt to bring forward the excellence of MOO2 and MOO3, perhaps wreitten smaller with less innovation in the technology tree, fewer races, less tidbits of detail, and and smaller horizons.\n\nRight now it is pay for beta grade.  I never suggest player pay to play a game that is in essence a late alpha or early beta.  The game has serious flaws that prevent carry through an entire contest, and is essence a rough draft.  The rough draft though shows extreme promise.  Double the number of races, double the number of techs, work out the vario bugs in visual style and in combat, and get the combat rules to work (which of course, MOO3 never really did) and you have a game that would be one of the best of its type.  Add to that MacOS support - a game killer for many who have friends from the Mac side, and this could be the new standard for MOO>\n\nThat said, there are rumbles on the horizon.  The forums are filled with people who want the game to be a RTS or a nerfed experience.  Most of them never played MOO before.  If the DEVs listen to the very loud rapid fire posting of their minority, the game will die a death and be a waste of 30 bucks.\n\nI would say revisit this in six months.","April 2","false","40.3"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","8","23","0","0"

Frankly they are quite push-over.\nAlso combat is a little bit dull, its not engaging like the classic moo2 where you got to play your fleet.\nHere it is real time combat and you have little control over whats happening. You can activate modules manually.\nAlso i miss being able to recruit ship officers and colony administrators for increased bonuses.\nWould like to see this implemented, and perhaps with an xp system for the officers and administrators.\n\nSome things that need adjusting and improving are Tool tips, Correct and updated stats on ship modules, Research,\nDifficulty level, Sorting out misc bugs and strangely enough.. savegame size. My savegame folder now almost takes up 1gb of space.. with the largest save being 150mb.\n\nThere are also some bugs here and there, but nothing major, and a save and relog usualy resolves the issue.\nIf this is only on my client i do not know, my friend who purchased the game at the same time does not experience the same bugs as i do.\n\nBut i think the graphics looks great, races are pehaps a bit cartoony but i dont mind. Individual voice acting for each race, nice models and nice textures, nice cinematics. Engaging gameplay and it is easy to spend alot of time ingame.\n\nTo sum it up, the game as it stands right now has its flaws.. but it is an early access so what did you expect ?\nAre the flaws game breaking ? no, not at all. The game is fully playable and quite enjoyable.\nBut i expect the game to become even greater with polishing and the correct tweaks.\nAlso i look forwards to more races and ingame content being implemented like higher difficulty and custom races.\n\n• Should you buy it ? If you are a fan of the series i would say this is a must have. And buying into it right now you can give the developers feedback and help influence the game into becoming something great.\n• Would i buy the game again ? Yes most deffinatly i would, even in early access.\n","March 1","true","42.1"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

But as of the latest EA release, they are saying that "there were no problems reported with the UI".  This is a bald-face lie since I have complained numerous times  on the feedback discussions along with quite a few other gamers who have mid range monitors and video cards.\n\nNow, mind you, I'm not some guy trying to play this game on his 8 inch RCA tablet.  I got a Maingear custom machine this last summer and I'm running a 21'5 inch widescreen off a NV970 GTX with 4 Gs.\n\nThe font only comes close to readable when I set my monitor res to 1900 and THEN start the game from there.  Otherwise, everytime I try to play it I end up straining both my eyes and back.\n\nFor 50$ the devs really need to get off their cans and fix the Ui problem.  In fact, I recommended to them at one point that they go for a nice retro cartoonish interface in order to capture the spirit of the original MOO games, but at this point I'd settle for something that was comfortable to read.\n\nAlso - they look like they dont want to address the planet and ship "leader" feature that helped give MOO2 its own unique character, even though counless people on the "feedback" have recommended it.  In short, I don't feel like this company cares about the legend of MOO2.  The devs probably haven't even played it.\n\nPut it this way GC 2 is a far superior and more thoughtful game to this in its current state.  When I see something other than proof that the company just wants to just make money off the MOO franchise, I might change my opinion.  But right now, I feel like I've been bamboozled out of 50$.","April 2","false","3.7"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","5","17","0","0"

Because I'm on the fence about this game and my review. There are many things I like and many I don't. Overall, though, I feel like it's a pretty decent game and if you like 4X games you should check it out - just be prepared for some of the cheese.\n\nPros: Really polished graphics and effects, transitions, user interface, artwork - they spent a good amount of time making a refined, professional game that looks and feels good. The voice-over cast is amazing and they did a great job breathing life and character into the game. The gameplay is smooth and intuitive and allows simple management and stats without overloading you with information and details and micromanagement. Overall the FEEL of the game is excellent - one of the best-looking 4X games made to date. To summarize - the game is very pretty and gets a lot of geek cred for the voice actor fame. ♥♥♥♥in' space bears man!\n\nCons: Beauty is only skin deep. While there are some interestingly new minor elements to this game, it's pretty instantly recognizable with (and almost identical to) it's genre brethren like GalCiv3 and Endless Space. In fact, if anything, MoO:CtS is a more simplified version of the two other games with fewer options and a scaled-back depth of gameplay and management. What's especially bothersome is that the tech tree FEELS completely ripped-off from GalCiv3, down to the names of the techs themselves and the weapon systems (not to mention the cheesy newscasters announcing empire/galactic events of note). After all that, they added space bears with cheesy Russian accents - I love space bears but giving them a stupid name like "Bulrathi" and giving them Russian accents... Oy 9.9\n\nSumming it up: Despite its cons, I still enjoy playing the game and it's very pretty to look at. The lack of depth also means you can play through it faster than its 4X brethren. It's also a lot easier without FEELING like it is - you still feel like you're about to be overwhelmed at any moment by the opponents ganging up on you even if they never have the teeth to back it up. Is it worth $50? Well, since you get all of the other MoO games bundled in with that and you can still get a refreshing, new 4X gameplay experience for a good 20-30 hours, I'd say yes. YMMV!","May 5","true","21.9"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

It's not complete by any standards. I have not played the older games, so I am able to come at this with fresh eyes. If you like the newer Civilization games, than this is Civilization in space. Combat is alright, I personally enjoy watching my ships battle against others. Ship customization is fine as it is, but I can say I would like to see maybe some more design choices and color choices. Diplomacy in all games is hard to balance, so expect the A.I. to make stupid requests (Oh? You're kicking out butt in this war? Alright, we'll go easy on you if you give us 1,000 credits and two colonies. No? Guess you'll have to conitnue to kill us!). Wish the A.I. was a bit more....aggresive, a bit more of a threat. Maybe it's the difficulty I'm playing under. Heroes would be a cool addition, but maybe in an expansion.

I feel like in the original moo1 and moo2 that the races were completely diffrendt and you go punished for growing too fast or too low. I still feel its a good game but with alittle more work it could be great, its moo so it should be great.","May 29","true","124.5"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","1"

Though master of Orion it prettier than the other games in the series the way space travel, exploration, and combat work in this versiont takes out all the strategic depth and fun. Instead of only being limited by your ships fuel, this game only allows to travel from system to system through a handfull of warp tunnels that link to their neighboring stars. I sound like a small change (and it is) but it changes the game entirely. It has more in common with "Sins of a Solar empire" than the previous titles of Master of Orion.","February 26","false","1.3"," 18 of 46 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","18","46","0","0"

No, it's not a clone of MOO2.  I have friends that enjoy this game that were MOO2 fanatics.  We all love the game and it's progressing nicely.  Tactical combat is getting better, you can always pause the game and issue orders as well.  Don't expect this game to be MOO2, it's an introduction for a wider audience with beautiful graphics, full voice overs and a pretty amazing amount of work already done.\n\nI loathe reading the negative posts out here.  The game is STILL BEING DEVELOPED AND IS EVER CHANGING.  It's in an early enough stage for hundreds if not thousands of changes to happen.  The DEVS listen to their fan base!  The game is going to rock at some point, have no doubt.  It's already pretty damn good now.\n\nYou can scroll through all the other technical posts out there to your hearts content, so I'm just giving my impressions of the state and future of the game.\n\nMost of the haters out there are MOO2 purists.  Nothing wrong with that, but this game isn't MOO2.  If you don't like it, don't bash it, attempt to appreciate the fact that it is a very good game and getting better all the time.  Take it for what it is.  Aside from that, check out Stellaris, launcing Monday May 9th.  It looks amazing, just in a more text driven and less polished way.  Galaxies have 1,000 stars to explore and it might just kill lesser computer systems (even though the engine is old and runs on DX9).  If it's not buggy as ♥♥♥♥, I will pick that one up too.  Then I will have two amazing games in my library.\n\nPeace out people","May 6","true","73.4"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

In that this game looks spot on. I do not see vast innovations in gameplay either, but this is better than changing what obviously worked so well.\n\nI have but one real complaint thus far, and because this is early access I won't get too upset about it just yet.\nI am playing on my MacBook Pro Retina on OS X Yosemite. It runs great, until for no discernable reason the game crashes. It crashes in a way that won't let me window out to Force Quit. I can move my mouse but not select anything, so I have to do an Emergency cold reboot. I was enjoying the game very much, until this issue.\n\nI have a request. Although I love the races in this game. I hope users will be able to use mods one day to load in new names for races, upload new alien race pictures, perhaps even upload new ship models into the races in play, if they feel like playing  private games with other well established science fiction milieus. Flexibility will make the game even more popular in certain circles.\n\nAnyways keep up the good work. I am going to be positive  and trust that the Mac crash problem will be resolved soon.\n\nNow someone please make a new version of Masters of Magic!","May 7","true","54.0"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

I spend most of my time playing Space games and the few that truly keep my interest over the ages have been Endless Space and Master of Orion 2. The flaws that made Master of Orion 3 boring, dull, and overly time consuming effort spent in the micro managing department are gone. I was skeptical over the introduction of space lanes but after playing the game for a bit I feel that the space lanes do nothing to hamper the gameplay and the ability to construct Military stations at the entrance of these lanes that you control give me a feeling of security. No longer can random races travel my territory if I do not have an Open border policy with them. The space battles are solid and for what it is( Alpha ) I am overly pleased.

Moo 3 had some good ideas but it failed on refinement... horribly.\nthis game so far needs more refinement aswell but thats why its in early access but i also dont care for some of the changes from moo 2 to here...\nstar lanes for instance, aswell as "unstable star lanes" that box you in untill you get half way through the tech tree, i for one liked the fact that you had could bypass an empires outer planets and attack their inner worlds it added a chance to bypass the enemy fleet if they didnt pay close enough attention and now we have no ship distance restrictions as long as you can get through those red star lanes\n\nnow the combat system..... combat..... personally i think its terrible as of current build\nall fleets have a combat strength rating which is visible to all.... so you can see exactly what your opponents have which boils engadgments down to a very basic if you have a higher number than the enemy you attack, if not retreat and build up/upgrade your ships, repeat untill you win... even the guardian of orion you can see its combat raiting plain as day.... of all the ships which should have their strength hidden it should be the guardian\nfor those who claim theres a stratagy element to it because its real time combat.... no there really isnt other than keep your small ships back for a bit because they move alot faster than the larger ones and will die like the cannon fodder they are too early... but then they refuse to sit still so you end up having to micro manage your smaller ships moving back and forth untill the right time to bring them up closer to your larger ships for the attack to start\n\nshurly the races are being done well? ..... nope\ngranted i havent played matches with them all yet but so far its a definate nope. the psylons i remember being an awesome race.... so what did they do to them in this game?  in the animations they made their advisor into the stereotypical highschool geek whos afraid to speak. and with that in mind in the game play they have a tendancy to rule their corner of the galaxy with ease, crushing any race unlucky enough to be stuck in the same boxed in star lane segment as them\n\nthe diplomacy.... needs to be implemented still... aside from the ai making demands of you and then declairing war when you refuse, there is none but they have announced that its going to be worked on (thank god, if i hear the murshan hiss at me for refusing to give them money ill snap and declare war on them first)\n\nso long story short i prefered playing moo 3 to this stage of its progress... wait until its out of early access to buy and keep an eye on it because it does have potential to be great..... great flop or great success is yet to be seen\n\n\n***Update***\n\nso after a couple of patches the game is comming together nicely and im changing my recommendation to a yes\n\nyou do need to understand its still a work in progress, like the diplomacy while it has been worked on, still needs more work done such as: it would be nice to throw out a counter offer (within reason) to avoid the "refused to trade with us" penalty to rep because an offer of 60 credits/bc/gc/whatever they call the currency is too low for technology that requires multiple turns to research\n\nthe only other part of the game i dislike is their choice for voice actors for some of the leaders/advisors such as the silicoid advisor.... for those who dont know, the silicoids are a race of rock people (essentally) and their advisor is a soft voiced person it just dosnt seem to fit, but i gotta say they did a good job on most of the leaders voices\n\nnow you may be noticing im only saying what i dont like about the game... thats mainly because the rest is either in the awesome catagory or at least the acceptable because its early access\n\nand i guess now that ive said that i should give some examples.... this game is the most stable early access ive seen and i have gotten into several... a few that i regret too... not this one though\n\nthe real time ship combat has been greatly improved you can set individual ships engadgement distances so you can customise your ships to have specializations such as long range missile support or a close range brawler. you can also set all ships movement speeds so your frigates and destroyers no longer rush way ahead of the titans that they are cannon fodder for.\n\ni cant confirm it but the unstable star lanes seem to be less frequent than before\n\nTLDR: was ok, got better, getting better with each patch..... EDIT: except the diplomacy..... that team needs to get their ♥♥♥♥ together\n\n**Update #2**\n\nlatest patch increased the ai's value of starcharts.... mix this with the screwed up diplomacy and i have just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off another race because they think that their starcharts and 3 credits a turn is worth an entire planet.... thats right they wanted me to give them one of my first planets for their star charts","March 18","true","70.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is just like playing the original Orion, with a few changes here and there to update it. The original races are there, with a promise of more to come, but I do wish one could customize a race like Orion 2. Seeing this is an early release, there are surprisingly few issues with it, A few things that need work is that I've not been able to terraform a volcanic planet yet, I hope this comes in future updates. Also, the Guardian is too weak, I beat it with just 4 battleships, losing only one. The guardian should be a lot more powerful. Another thing that would add to the game (and be true to the original if I remember correctly, if that wasn't MoO2) is that once you grow more powerful Orion may launch surprise attacks at any race unbalancing the universe too much. But I really miss the turn-based combats, I hope they will be next to be included.\n\nAs of the latest update, if you choose a larger planet than normal you get the gravity penalty to all production, halving food, production and science. The penalty is too big to compensate for the late game profit of having a large or huge planet. This is reason enough to change the rating from positive to negative, since the starting planet (even by biologial reasoning) should always be considered normal gravity, with no exceptions; after all that is the gravity the race you choose is used to.\n\nAnother update is that custom races are available, but cannot be saved, still a miss from the developers. And finally, older games cannot be replayed or continued, so there's no backward compatibility between game versions.\n\nWith the laterst updates I'm starting to question de competence of the game designers, and whether they should be replaced... after all the last updates made the game so much worse that the rating changed from positive to negative, and I'm considering a refund. In any case, I will change my review on other sites to "do not buy" now.","March 5","false","28.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very logical and new, a like it a lot\n+ Research tree is pretty long and nice. I also Like the fact that at somepoint you have to choose between 2 or 3 of the real applications of a certain theory. Much better designed than choosing from two fields imho.\n+ Colony screen looks good, I would however like to have the pollution shown in the empire screen. There are couple of bugs there with the notifications of pollution, it tells you you have a polluted planed and it jumps to another planet, I guess it will be fixed.\n+espionage... nice concept\n+ trade treaties... good way to make some extra money if you have the capital\n\n- I would like to have a trade concept where you can transport food. There is an export / import system but It's minimalistic\n- Something that a lot of 4xgames do not understand. Food is not the main driver of reproduction in a colony. Food is only a show stopper (law of the minimum), if you don't have it, but lots of food does not mean more people. Look at Europe... lots of food, but stagnation.\n- Ground battles suck, building ground military sucks, I want to be able to control the pace of building my ground forces\n- Cannot transport people from the empire screen... hello? MACRO much?\n- AI may still need some improvement, but they already did a big step","March 1","true","29.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","13"

The game is not ideal , but far better and comes much closser to prediscessors. I still lucks some UI tooltips explanations and the combat engine is far frm perfect, but it's not started to "produce" this undefinable substance called "fun".\nI leave the original review bellow for comperason:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReally disapointing.\nCan't pinpoint on exact reason, the game have "all the right elements" , but this is small things, the game is just "too flat" , no depth , no real interest. All too simple .\nAnd , yes, I aware that the game is not finished yet, I am sure a lot of content will be added later on, but my problem is with descissions already taken by the game designers, the game just does not have any "taste", any "spice".\nAs from UI point of view I miss the tooltips thet were everywhere in original MoOs , even on disabled buttons.\nTech tree is doll, GNN videos annoying but you better not skip them as they have usefull infrmation. The advisers, especially Alkari and Psilon are really annoying... voices... their lines...\nBattles are boring, personally I preffered turn based, but the RTS could be ok if done properly, here they are not.\nIn general - looks better then failed MoO 3, but this is not a game I wanted, just another mediocre 4X game, not MoO successor.","March 11","true","38.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
