Your headset feels like your helmet and everything controls well, no noticable lag. This game has incredible potential. The only downside is that the rounds are too short at the moment.\n\nEDIT: Devs said they fixed the short round time now. See you on the battlefield!","May 2","true","1.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Like being in mount and blade but with motion controls. Real fun taking people out. Its the best VR multiplayer game for me. I have no microphone but fun listening to your enemies as you take them out. Highly recommended","May 3","true","4.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The helmet and the position of the horse's head makes for a very immersive experience.  This is one of those few games where the sides of the headset and fov actually ADD to the immersion because you are looking through the vizor of a helmet.  Yet, your view remains unobstructed.  It allows for both a comfort mode and a regular mode.  I haven't tried the comfort mode yet, but I heard other players say it is still a lot of fun while reducing motion sickness.\n\nThe hand controls are spot on.  There is just something about wielding a sword while riding a horse that is absolutely thrilling.  You can control the speed of the horse based on how far you pull the trigger.  It is easy to steer as well.  The directional and throttle controls of the horse are identical to Hover Junkers.  I didn't have any real problems with motion sickness either.\n\nThe only drawbacks:  The length of the matches is too short.  The VOIP is not separated out so the other team can hear your conversations with your teammates.  Right now, this is not too big of a deal because you can still joke around with the other team and the matches are not so intense that they demand real strategy.  Although I hope that they do get more intense with more players in each match and more complex objectives.\n\nRight now, it's a blast to play and I can't wait for more content.","May 2","true","4.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

The game isnt perfect yet, but once some kinks get fixed I'm sure itll be a solid game. I dont experience any motion sickness and think the controls are pretty solid unlike some others.

The feel of riding the horse and power of swinging your massive sword really put you into the middle of a medieval skirmish. Currently there's not too much to do other than repeat the same short battle but because it's online multiplayer once you get some real people in the game it becomes a social experience as well because of how easy it is to talk to each other.","May 6","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Turning and acceleration could use a lot of honing.\nDepth of gameplay isn't so much of a problem as server capability--I played on the US west server with pretty solid network but the frequent freeze made the experience quite confusing at times.\nI can see the game becoming enjoyable with maybe more players and VOIP after the above problems are resolved.

Biggest issues are:\n\n1.  No depth to the combat.  You just sort of charge at each other.  No parrying, no blocking.\n\n2.  Difficult to control - hard to notch arrows or throw axes - they often don't show up.\n\n3.  Makes me feel sick.\n\nWhen it comes to multiplayer I had a lot more fun with Hover Junkers.  There I'd be moving around my room, frantically reloading while crouched.  Here I just sort of stand still.","May 2","false","0.5"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","1"

Not a lot of content at the moment and you will mostly be playing against AI since no one really has the game, but it is still dumb fun. Couldn't play for very long because just the motion of being on a horse made me sick. Only VR game to do this to me so far so I don't get sick easily but this game did it for me somehow. Probably not a problem for everyone though. Game is definitely worth a shot though for sure.","May 21","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
