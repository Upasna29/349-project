The core of the game in terms of the action gameplay for a 5 dollar game is solid: the flying mechanics and change up between fast/slow gameplay brings back feelings of the old NES games of days past. It's very good with level design and game design around the core of the game. But there's little things that annoy that start to add up, like the pausing of the game actually not pausing the game, and staying too committed to an NES like setup (with only using two buttons on the controller). But in the end, it's definitely worth the price of admission with solid gameplay and a good aesthetic even for a pixel platformer (that makes it stand out a tiny bit).\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nSolid gameplay. Controls are fluid, sword swinging is responsive, and while there's some things to get use to in movement, rules are consistent.\nFlying mechanic adds a good unique mechanic that those who want to can really take advantage of in precision.\nKnew when to use typical platformer convention, and when not to, and that's hard with mechanics that you introduce. Very well done here.\nGood pixel art in terms of a style. Even though pixel platformers are a dime a dozen, the styles of the pixel artwork for enemies and your character work very well.\nFaithful NES recreation in style and gameplay. Sound feels like it came from an NES game.\n-:\nPausing the game actually doesn't pause the game.\nCan't rebind controls. In particular, using down and x instead of another button for magic was annoying. This would be less problematic if the aerial element wasn't there: you have to use the dpad for a controller, and the stick would have made a LOT more sense..\nUm, exiting the game should be something that should be in the menu options. Even on the main menu. That's silly that it isn't.","July 23, 2015","true","11.5"," 39 of 53 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","39","53","5","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/295910/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Olympia Rising’s an indie platforming game from the relatively new studio, Paleozoic. A nod to the platforming games of old Olympia Rising retains the old school charm and adds its own fresh ideas and mechanics into the gameplay. The game takes place in Ancient Greece where you play as Iola, a heroine who was killed, but has now been reawakened in the underworld, and she doesn’t know why. You have to make your way through the underworld in order to get to Mount Olympus and find out why you were revived from Zeus himself. To do that, you have to collect coins to pay the ferryman of the river Styx, Charon, so that he’ll let you pass to the next area.\n\nThe controls are simple enough; emulating old-style 2 button controls, you have one button being jump and the other your sword, as well as your directional buttons. This might at first seem to make the game simple, but the complexity comes with the different mechanics that have been added to the game. One of the most prominent features of Olympia Rising is the ability to chain kills together in to multiply the amount of coins you receive. Not only does this give you more coins, but it also resets your double jump.\n\nThis makes sections where you have to climb become a whole lot easier and a lot of fun as you chain enemy kills together to continue moving upwards. Getting hit resets your multiplier and makes you lose your extra jumps so being careful and making sure you don’t get hit is important. I wish that you had the ability to look down though since you will be faced with instances where you need to descend and you can’t see below you. This makes descending a hazard as you can run into a lot of enemies suddenly.\n\nYour life’s represented with hearts, a la Zelda, and you also have a magic meter which can be used for different powerups or to give yourself additional jumps, which becomes critical if you want to keep your kill multiplier going. All the powerups are useful for different things; fire magic lets you hit enemies from far away, the water shield makes you invulnerable to projectiles, and the lightning blade lets you easily defeat enemies that take multiple hits. They all serve their own functions and no power-up really feels useless, although you do need certain powerups more than others in specific areas.\n\nThe game divides its levels into 3 different types of areas: There are the acid levels, where you must progress upward as fast as possible in order to avoid the acid that fills up from the bottom of the level. This is where killing enemies to reset your jump comes in handy, as you can use them as kind of stepping stones to move yourself upwards. There’s then also what I like to call exploration/coin collecting levels, where you have to collect a large amount of coins in order to progress and there are a ton of enemies and treasure drops to pick up. These rooms seem to always have enough coins to progress whether you chain kills or not, so retaining your life becomes crucial.\n\nEven if you do die, you start back at the beginning of the current area – you don’t have to worry about lives and can just have fun, which is one of the games strengths. Finally, there are the boss rooms. Every area has a boss that you have to beat and all of them are cleverly made, requiring you to memorize their patterns to succeed. They feel just like platformer bosses should. Anytime you get hit, it’s your mistake for not knowing the pattern.\n\nThe game’s graphics are artfully crafted in pixel style and lends to the game very well, with animations looking awesome and very smooth, while still retaining that old school charm that they are going for. I’m a sucker for pixel art, and while this art style was simplistic, it looks well polished. Everything about the smooth animation’s well-made and it’s one of my favorite things about the game.\n\nThe sound’s fantastic, with 8-bit style sound and music tracks that make me wish that the soundtrack was purchasable so I could listen to it all the time. The tracks are fantastic, and never did they once get old. The sound effects are great as well – although I did have a problem with how similarly the sound of killing an enemy and the sound of getting hit were, as I wouldn’t realize I was getting hit at times until I was down to one heart.\n\nThe game itself will probably take you around six hours to beat the first time through and while I wish it had some more replay ability, the game’s only $5 on Steam, so you’re getting incredible value for what you are paying. The game has a lot of heart and soul poured into it from the developers and I can’t honestly wait to see what Paleozoic makes next.\n\nOlympia Rising is a love letter to the platformers of old, while also adding its own unique touches, like the combo system and the use of magic jumps. The art and music are incredible, and the game has really tight controls. You’re getting more than your money’s worth with this title, and any fan of old school platformers or platformers in general should try it out. It’s easy enough that anyone can enjoy it, but difficult enough that it feels like a challenge. Olympia Rising‘s a fantastic game that I can say I would wholeheartedly recommend to any fan of the genre, and I look forward to any of Iola’s adventures in the future.","December 13, 2015","true","5.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","0"

Backtracking wouldn't be so bad, but you can't pan the camera. I've taken many unnecessary hits as a result of this. I think a timer system (one that ticks down per level and one that ticks up throughtout the game for speed runs) would be a much better system for this game. I beat it in about 2 hours. It's enjoyable enough, but the faults will keep me from returning to it. Don't let the first boss get you down -- difficulty wise, it should've been the final boss. The bosses would even be a ton of fun if not for the rediculous hit boxes. Between enemies having too large of a damaging hitbox and the protagonist having floaty controls, I died more times than was reasonable to what I feel is poor design. Level design, sound, and music are really great. The art style is pleasant and unique. Try to pick this game up in a sale if you're on the fence. I think it's worth $5, but the cons truely are frustrating. I may sound overly negative, but I hope the dev will be watching the comments and improve. Maybe I'll come back to it one day in the hopes this is the case.

The enemy chaining mechanic is fun (even if I initially have a hard time getting used to it), the art is great, and it's got some good replay value.  I've seen a lot of people complain that the controls are wonky or that there's no button mapping, but it's easy to get used to and honestly not even an issue after the first level or so.  Since it's pretty short, it's easy to go through multiple times after you've gotten better (that's what I have the most fun with) plus there are a lot of different paths to take throughout the levels.  My only real beef is that the enemy placement in the fire levels is far too frequent and you can hardly move without running into a baddie or an environmental, which can be especially frustrating when you're not great at the game.\n\nBASICALLY I played this game who knows how many times in the stages where it was awful and buggy and headache-inducing into the wee hours of the morning and I still find a lot of enjoyment in it.  It's really well balanced and I think it shows that a lot of thought and care went into the design and programming.  It's a pretty quick play with great art, fun gameplay, and it's enjoyable the second or third or whatever time around.  For 5 bucks you really can't go wrong.","August 12, 2015","true","3.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

The animations and art are beautiful and feel fluid. The best part is when you chain enemy kills together and just continue to rise up fast, it is really satisfying. Sadly, the good things about this game end there.\n\nThe music was nice at first but then it got annoying when I had to replay the same level, repeatedly when I died. It is not too hard, but you are going to have trouble in some parts. This would be fine if the levels were not all pretty much the same but reskinned. The formula: normal level where you collect a specific amount of coins to beat it and then a similar level but just climbing up while acid is rising. Occasionally there is a boss fight, which I would describe as an endurance test. They are not hard since the boss patterns are predictable, but take too much time. The worst part about some levels is that money is scarce, so you better kill everything you see and try not to die before reaching the exit.\n\nStill after all these flaws I was enjoying the game until, after like 6 times doing the same level again, the game glitched on me at the very end. I had just enough money and just rushed to the exit before something could kill me. Right there at the exit was a medusa enemy so I just jumped over her to get to the door but that somehow didn’t trigger the exit and I just fell through the door and the floor, leaving me trapped and unable to finish the level. Here is a screenshot of what happened http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=513761231\n\nI honestly can’t recommend this game like this, but if you get it somehow, it is at least worth a try. I recommend using a PS3/PS4 controller since you are forced to use the D pad, and the Xbox controller one is unusable for most things; keyboard is also fine.","September 6, 2015","false","10.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Extravagaunte_and_Luphos/recommended/295910/","Extravagaunte_and_Luphos","ExtraMan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Extravagaunte_and_Luphos/","70 products in account","There are some things that I really, really liked about Olympia Rising, and some things that really, really frustrated me.\nFirst off, the good things.\n\nChaining together combos feels great, it makes you feel like a mighty warrior and bonus coins make the entire thing an incredible joy when the combo is over and you are rich.\n\nThe exspansive, well put together levels that I loved to explore, running around and grabbing coins, fighting things, finding treasure rooms, all of that was great. If the whole game was just these levels, I would have so much fun with them.\n\nKeeping your extra coins when you finish a level. A small thing, but it still felt really good. The game rewarded me for taking my time with a level, exploring all the nooks and crannies, and finding all the hidden treasure. It also created hope that eventually I would get so many coins that I could skip a level entirely because I can already pay the next fee. If I ever did this, it would have been amazing.\n\nNow, the not so good things.\n\nEnemies That Take More Than One Hit. Now, I realize that eventually, there has to be an enemy that takes more than one hit, but this breaks the pacing of the game. Before you find an enemy, you're jumping around and racking up a huge combo, after you find the enemy the combo is over. Everytime I saw minotaur/ice warrior/lamia/wizard/turret head/thing that I couldn't kill in one hit I knew that the combo, which was the fun part, had ended. A nice work around for this would be if the higher a combo the player had, the more damage they deal. This would mean that the game rewards the player for working an Enemy That They Can't Kill In One Hit into their combo, instead of punishing them for finding it.\n\nTerrain That Looks Like The Background. This was something I kept finding, and everytime I did it was confusing. Normally, the background is dark and what you can walk on is bright. This game has dark background, bright terrain, and darkish other terrain that you cannot jump up through. This becomes such a hassle, trying to check where you can and can't go, in moments when I'm trying to hurry because lava death is flooding the level.\n\nLevels That Flood With Lava Death. These things were a massive cause of frustration, because of what these levels try to be. They are expansive, well put together that I would love to explore and collect all the coins, but they are on a timer. This means I cannot explore the level or I risk death, I cannot collect coins or I risk death, I cannot search for hidden treasure or I risk death, and I cannot blindly jump combo through the level just trying to finish it as fast as I can or I might not have enough coins by the end. One of two things needs to be removed from the rising levels, either the coin number or the timer. Having both turns the level into a stressful, memory game. The first run of a rising level, I told myself "I am going to lose all my bonus coins." I knew that I would win eventually, but only when I had run the level so many times that I knew exactly which way to go and where enough coins were.\n\nSlippery, Slidey Shoes. This was a problem on two occasions, when I was pushing through a rising level, and when I was trying to avoid the next issue.\n\nTouch Damage. I know that touch damage is a staple in videogames, that enemies are not things I should be getting near. However, I mostly only have melee and there are some enemies that don't make sense to deal touch damage, like birds that are trapped in them sized cages. The other place this becomes a problem is with bosses, because bosses can suddenly change the size and shape of their hitbox. This doesn't feel like taking damage, this feels like being robbed of a health point.\n\nYou Cannot Use Magic After A Double Jump. This sounds minor, and it is, but the thunder magic is the only way to increase melee damage and reset jump combos. When I find an enemy with two health in a jump combo, I use the thunder magic to kill it and continue the combo, unless I need to double jump to get to it in which case the combo ends.\n\nThat's mostly it, there's a few more things. The water magic felt worthless because you had to stop moving, the jumping attack was so much better than the standing attack that the standing attack felt worthless, exploring downward didn't feel good because I couldn't see what was under me and would frequently take damage because of that.\n\nSo now, the final verdict, would I recommend this game?\nNO. Don't get me wrong, there's some great ideas here, the game looks nice, parts of the game feel great, but there's so many little things that just wear on the player until the game becomes unfun. I can enjoy games that are challenging, when you win then that victory felt earned, not given, but this isn't challenging. It's frustrating. If the game was challenging, the player, if they are skilled and focus, be able to beat a level on their first try. They probably won't, but the possibility should still be there. With this, there's so many death that just came from things I couldn't see, or because I got stuck on terrain when trying to jump up, or because I took damage when I turned around to attack a stationary enemy. There is good in this game, but it does not outway the game's flaws.","April 8","false","2.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/295910/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","This is a pretty neat little 2D action-platformer game! The main focus here is definitely the combat, but it's designed in a way that feels pretty platformer-y as well. Killing an enemy gives you your two jumps back (reminds me of Dustforce in a way) and chaining enemies together using these extra jumps nets you more coins per enemy. The goal of each stage is to make it to the end with a certain amount of coins in tow, and the further the game progresses, the higher this number goes, and the longer the stages get. The end result is, unfortuntaely, a difficulty curve based mainly around level length, though each new world gives you an extra heart so you can survive a bit longer. Health pickups are more than sufficient, and tend to be very useful, as avoiding damage in this game is no easy feat. I never found myself having trouble getting enough coins either, if I searched around the level a little bit I ended up having more than enough. Coins can carry into the next level, too, but are lost if you die - I can see this making for some interesting speedrunning strats, certainly. I feel like this could be a pretty good speedrunning game, really, it's fast-paced and pretty challenging though never unfair. If I had to lodge a few other minor complaints, it *is* a bit short, but the game's not particularly expensive anyways. The wall jump also feels a little wonky at times (primarily around thinner platforms). I also found the music to not really fit, it's pretty forgettable and pretty minimal most of the time. Nothing huge though and I did enjoy my time with this game, as brief as it was.

This is not a metroidvania; the levels are vertical like Metroid, but they are very open, and the object of every stage is to accrue enough coins to pay the fare to the next.  There are multiple paths, allowing you some freedom in your harvest of Hades' booty.  You can double jump, and every time you kill an enemy in midair, you get two more jumps, so you can potentially spend a lot of air time.  It starts off pretty easy but gets really tricky at the end.  It's classic arcade goodness with slick, modernish acrobatics.\n\nOlympia Rising is a fine morning tea game that is fun for multiple playthroughs despite the lack of unlockables or achievements.  It's a great pity that it did not get the attention it deserved!  I was hoping for better fullscreen support and pad support (you cannot natively use the stick, only the D-pad), but I suppose the developers lost heart because of poor sales.  Fortunately, these two issues can easily be subverted with Windows Magnifier and Joy-2-Key (just set up a profile in which only the stick is defined, and that at a threshold of 30).  Trust me, the game is well worth the price and the tweaking!\n\n(If you beat the game, make sure to pay attention to the drawings at the end, as they reveal a lot of the hidden story.)","April 21","true","14.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Zero button configuration and by extension being forced to use the D-Pad on an Xbox 360 controller. Camera swivel being so overdone to the point this game is one of the few that actually struck me with motion sickness. The inability to move the camera below you when you need to descend, resulting in numerous blind jumps and making the already annoying enemy placement all the more grating when exploring. The game effectively only using two buttons on the controller yet insisting to employ down + X for special abilities, which is cumbersome for quickly moving about and simultaneously dispatching more durable enemies. Progression being gated by having to collect a specific amount of coins, only to be met with a unbearably sassy skeleton ridiculing you with unwitty remarks for every level. Inconsistent hitboxes, no health bars for bosses, shrill audio cues, ...\n\nIt's a genuine shame too, because Olympia Rising isn't terrible and the majority of these shortcomings could've been resolved through (relatively) minor tweaks.","October 16, 2015","false","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If I face the player left then right camera repositions immediately regardless of whether I'm moving or not.\n- After you kill enemies coins don't always make their way to you which make the coin collection aspect in the air a pain.\n- Bumping on the sides of platforms ruin your jumps.\n- There's no option to exit the game in the menu.You either manually close the window or [Alt] + [F4].\n- Awkward controls, you have to press down and attack to use magic...why not use another button?\n\nVerdictI had too many problems with my small play through of this game and I can't really recommend as a result. I'm not saying it's a bad game but I'm not willing to put up the problems I encountered. Ended up requesting a refund as I found myself not enjoying the game at all.

She meets Charon, a greedy ferryman who agrees to help Iola get to Olympus, as long as she collects enough money every level.\n\nPros:\n-Great Music\nI love the music in this game. The main theme is really catchy, and gets me excited for playing the next level.\n-Funny Characters\nWhile I've only met Iola and Charon, I think some of Charon's dialogue is really funny. Sometimes I'd find myself throwing Iola into the next boss to hear Charon's next death joke.\n-Fun Bosses\nThe bosses in this game are original and great, and while they can be hard at times, you understand why you died and you learn from it. The deaths are almost always fair and the ones that aren't are few and far between. I can't decide which boss is my favorite.\n-Combo System\nWith each level concentrating on gathering money, the combos reward you with more money. The combos are fun to pull off.\n\nCons:\n-Overpowered enemies\nSome of the enemies, your main source of money, are incapable of being part of combos, certain enemies take 3-5 hits before you can kill them. This means you either finish your combos for the money, or ignore them.\n-The Magic\nThe magic abilities are pretty much useless. The fire enchantment is ok for enemies you want to deal with from the distance, but the others do diddly-squat. I'd much rather use the magic for the double jumps.\n\nWhile this game isn't perfect, the easy to learn gameplay, the music, and character(s?) have me coming back to play it every once in a while.\nI give this game an 8.5 out of 10. Would recommend.","March 13","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
