My only real complaints are the bugs at the moment with achievements and some other stuff.  I liked the older leaderboard stle they had in previous versions, and the soundtrack could be a lot better and perfect the experience.  Overall, great game and I'd highly recommend it if you're into this sort of thing.  Has great level editing tools as well as what will be a great user-created level portal.  I'm not a fan of "luck-based" procedural generated levels but hopefully that can be eliminated by user-created levels at some point.  I'd also like a static leaderboard alongside the daily leaderboard, for best players overall.  And hopefully in time all of this can be worked out in some way.\n\nBut yeah, go buy it, one of the best indie titles to release on Steam recently and worth the time and money.","December 10, 2013","true","5.9"," 155 of 173 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","155","173","0","15"

How addicitive you ask? So addictive that you will keep saying "one more go" after smashing against a wall.\n\nRace The Sun reminds me of an old flash game that I used to play in College years ago, it was called Tunnel Maze Game and your objective was to dodge and jump obstacles that popped up at you, giving you a split second to react while your character surfed within a tunnel. If you know the game I am talking about then you will enjoy this game.\n\nGameplay wise, not every retry will be the same, meaning you could initially learn a portion of a region and then next try find yourself going a completely different way or into another area. The great thing about this game though is that the world will change every 24 hours, meaning it is forever changing. Not only that but it is user content friendly, meaning you can create and publish your own worlds for others to try.\n\nOverall, if you are into games that test your reflexes or you have that determination to try and get a better score or do better than the last try.

Before the sun disappears, your solar craft must make it as far as possible without hitting anything. At the same time, trying to stay in the light & grab as many power-ups, tris or wormholes across the landscape, to boost you along as fast as possible. There's a fantastic sense of speed building up the longer you survive, often flying past objects so close you could touch it (and sometimes mistakenly do lol!).\n\nLighting effects of the sun streaming rays of light through the various shapes of the artifically inspired worlds looks awesome, while also being a key mechanic functionally in the game design!\n\nThe world is randomly regenerated every 24hrs to provide new challenging combinations, plus in-between there is plenty of community maps to try on the Workshop. There are also specific challenges to level-up & upgrade your default craft to work towards longer term.  Some of these are really hard!\n\nGreat to play on the big screen (in your lounge room), for a brief daily distraction (since games can be very quick indeed sometimes) :) or even a longer session where you reach for the clouds & conquer your (or friends) high scores! There are some tough achievements & a game plus mode for the hardcore out there.\n\nRace the Sun is easy to pick up but hard to put down... while always striving for that elusive 'high score' just over the horizon!\n\nMenus are a bit strange to navigate with a controller & the bright white tones can overwhelm, but other than these minor factors, this is a top quality & very addictive little indie title!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","August 26, 2014","true","12.4"," 63 of 66 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","63","66","0","6"

You have to get as far as you can along the map, while avoiding deadly obstacals, before the sun goes down. While trying to get the highest score you can, you can pick up boosters that will temporarily stop the sun's slow descent.\n\nThere are four different maps that you can play on. You start with the first one and can unlock the second and third ones by leveling up. If you want the fourth, you have to buy it. I have played and enjoyed the first three, but I haven't tried out the last one. All of the maps randomize every 24 hours, so the layout is slightly different each day.\n\nI play my own music when gaming, but the soundtrack for Race the Sun is something I wouldn't mind listening to. And if you don't enjoy it, there is always the mute button.\n\nIn the end, I would recommend it to anybody who is thinking about buying it.\n","October 27, 2015","true","18.0"," 34 of 34 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","34","34","3","0"

The premise is that your ship is solar powered, thus staying in the sunlight keeps you going. The sun slowly goes down creating more shadows.  Powerups can extend your time.\n\n+ Every 24 hours the course is reset. Everything is randomized to a degree forcing you to rely more on skill and luck rather than memorization\n\n+ The game gives you a multiple objectives to complete. After completing them your ship gets upgraded.\n\n+VERY addicting, the game has the "just one more time" feeling to it.\n\n+Steamworkshop is intregrated very nicely with a variety of different maps to try out.\n\n+The game has a unique and simplistic artstyle to it. As the sun sets it creates a really nice setting. After playing some of the user generated maps you really see some of the verstatily of the engine and graphics despite how simple it is.\n\n+Hard mode to really test you to the limit....if you find the main game to easy.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-  You will get frustrated....a lot.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a really fun and simple game was a simple premise and works wonderfully due to the randomness of the world.

Gameplay.\n☺ Good controls.\n☺ A new level to race on every day!\n\n☹ Visually and Audibly Repetitive.\n☹ No access to previous levels.\n\nRecommended for fans of arcade racers, twitch or avoidance games.\n\nRace the Sun is a minimalist racing game that puts you in charge of an agile solar powered craft and its your job to keep rushing onwards, avoiding obstacles and the shade as you hurtle towards the horizon as the Sun that provides your power, steadily does the same.\n\nYou'll crash, often, but not because of sloppy controls or unfair difficulty - most likely a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time or because you reacted a little too slowly. A simple tap of a button and you'll be back to racing almost instantly, providing a very arcadey experience without the need to carry a bag full of coins.\n\nAn interesting feature of Race the Sun is the level you play on changes each day (unfortunately, you can't replay levels from previous days). This provides a fair amount of content as long as you revisit the game often, although the visuals and audio does begin to get a little repetitive.\n\nIf things aren't hard enough for you, there is a brutal Apocalypse mode that throws more obstacles at you at a faster pace and there is Steam Workshop integration allowing you easy access to some great player made levels.\n\nWhile the game suits quick play sessions, you'll have to keep an eye on the Sun outside as well as ingame as it instils a feeling of "Just one more run..." as you zip around, picking up power ups and score multipliers and attempting to beat your last run or achieve some of the challenges (such as completing a region while only turning left) to level up and unlock a few abilities to help you do even better.\n\nA great arcade racer!","July 26, 2014","true","5.5"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","32","35","0","2"

The whoosh as you soar past objects, the intensity as the sun threatens to disappear past the horizon, and the unbelievable moments of triumph when you make it through in one piece are but small bits of what makes for an extremely exhilarating experience.\n\nYour goal is simple: pilot a futuristic solar powered flying-craft at breakneck speeds, dodging obstacles and attempting to get as far as you can before the sun inevitably sets. What turns RtS from a simple detraction into an addiction is the execution. Every aspect has an unprecedented level of refinement, from the effortless maneuvering of your vehicle to the expertly placed obstructions which become increasingly complex and challenging the further you progress, show a clear attention to detail and an superb sense of direction by the developers.\n\nAside from chasing the leaderboards, there are also 25 levels of skill based objectives for you to complete, which unlock upgrades and details to outfit your craft with. It took me about five hours to clear them all, at which point you truly begin your climb up the leaderboards. Although the game does lose a bit of its drive without these challenges to complete, having a newly remixed world every day (complete with daily leaderboards) still gives a reason to keep coming back for more, which is made even easier by how well RtS works as a pickup and play game, while still providing enough depth to make longer sessions just as enjoyable (those looking for an extra challenge will definitely find it in the ultra-hard Apocalypse mode).\n\nLastly I can't stress enough how unexpectedly amazing the presentation is. The textures themselves might be basic, but there is an elegance in RtS's barren landscape that works amazingly well with how fast you will be soaring through it. The sparse use of color becomes even more important, outlining oncoming obstacles and highlighting power-ups in your peripheral vision that might otherwise be lost to more robust graphical effects. The stark contrast between light and shadow plays a key role in creating a sense of dread whenever you cross into one, letting you know the end is nigh if you don't get out of there fast. A great score and excellent sound effects round out the package, which words really can't do any justice to.\n\nIt only took one round for me to get hooked to Race the Sun. Developer Flippfly absolutely nailed it and created something that truly astounded me, perhaps more so than any other game the year it released. I'm just going to end this by saying you need to play this for yourself! It's a breathtaking game that I desperately want to share with others, and one that deserves to be played by a far larger crowd than those who have managed to discover it.\n\nDon't let it slip by you, the sun is already setting.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 18, 2014","true","12.2"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/qcxv/recommended/253030/","qcxv","Glypha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/qcxv/","982 products in account","A peaceful runner-style game where you guide a solar powered craft through an ever more shadowy obstacle course.\n\nFrom experience of driving towards the sun, you wouldn't think much of a game that focuses on flying towards the sun. Why would I want to do that? The sun is bright and makes my eyes hurt. This game is a fun way to use our imagination, and enjoy ourselves in a solar powered aircraft. If it helps, presume that you are wearing sunglasses, perhaps even fashionable ones. Do you feel cool? Are you prepared to look directly at bright lights? Fantastic.\n\nI imagine this takes place in a sad, dystopic future devoid of fine art or literature, where fossil fuels and other natural resources have been exhausted. All that remains are a few mostly abandoned cities, the wilds between, and due to the political turmoil of resource starvation, the world is on the eve of annihilation.\n\nEnter our protagonist, a strong silent individual. You're transporting yourself and a motley crew of rogues, miscreants, and iconoclast scientists aboard a solar-powered plane last-ditch effort to survive the imminent nuclear annihilation and attempt to prolong the death of a dying world much as a doctor extends the lives of those with chronic diseases. Specifically, you have a technology, a solar powered technology that is also built into your very aircraft. This technology opens portals to new worlds, and any one of them could be the paradise awaiting the future of humanity. Occasionally a bird approaches to aid you on your quest, as if nature itself is encouraging you in  your quest.\n\nEvery once in a while you find structure capable of powering these warp gates and moving through them transports you to strange, fanciful, wonderful, and potentially terrible lands. Are any of these places inhabitable? It is unlikely, but any leap into the unknown could eventually show you the future of our species. There is such limited time though. This is certainly the last day before the missiles launch, and that means that when your plane falls to the ground at dusk, the world is lost.\n\nControls are simple. You turn left, you turn right, you jump when you've got the right power up, and there's also a powerup which allows you to accidentally crash into a wall without dying. Throughout you pick up stars that increase your speed. You may note that speed will keep the sun higher on the horizon for longer periods of time.  You can do a barrel roll as well.\n\nIf the sun sets you run out of power and die. If you collide with sufficient force, you die. The difficulty ramps up nicely as well, so that death, which comes to us all, may always be delayed a bit longer. There's a couple of starting levels of differing difficulty, and a workshop with extras, as well as an expansion that I have not tried as of yet.\n\nYou level up by doing things like not turning left for a while, or being good at not hitting stuff, or collecting a lot of stuff in the air. These levels give you things like a magnet that makes it so you pick up stuff easier, or a battery that lets you survive in the shadows better. You can also put stickers on your plane, which alone with the portals is the closest thing to visual texture in the game.\n\nThis game is grey scale polygons everywhere. Grey pyramids? Probably trees or mountains depending on scale? Grey rectangular prisms I imagine are buildings. There are some that look like shrubbery or boulders. The aesthetic is minimalist and produced a light feeling of ennui. There is quality lighting and shadow, which is fantastic as these are actually used as gameplay mechanics. Different modes have differing color schemes, and the apocalyptic mode is especially pleasant to view.\n\nThe sounds are quite nice. The music is of limited quantity, but the quality is apparent and it elicits an appropriate response.\n\nIf you have an imagination, or just want something of variable relaxation and pace, something of an original concept, then this could be quite an enjoyable original addition for you. Personally I gave it my full attention for several relaxing enjoyable hours.\n\nThis review has been produced in accordance with green technologies, specifically the aeronautical technologies behind solar powered propulsion.

Along the way you find many obstacle here and there to give the game some challenge.\n\nTo be honest i didn't know this game is exist before i bought it from humble bundle, and i actually glad that i bought it. This game mechanic along with the graphic and the sound effect is really good and simple. It give you the sense of peace and you rarely get that feeling when you try to play this type of game where your objective is to go as far as you can before dying and the high speed vehicle that you are trying to control feels very epic and futuristic and thats a good thing. The game also give you some simple objective for you to complete like avoid hitting anything in 2 stage or collect this amount of point or jump 5 time in one run or something along those line. In my opinion that objective is really refreshing and it will makes you try the game with a different tactics than usual. If you complete the objective you will level up and you will get many new upgrade for your ship like a magnet to catch all the point near you and all of the other stuff.\n\nSoo the conclusion is this game is really fun and enjoyable to play in your spare time when you are bored, its a good game and the price is not that expensive either. :3 But if you looking for a game with alot of feature sadly this game is not for you, but if you looking for a cool and fun casual game this game is for you !\nRecommended ! :3","September 29, 2014","true","3.8"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Race the Sun is not only a fun little addiction but hopefully also a harbinger of the return of boutique developers.If Race The Sun’s tracks remain as consistently well-paced and tiered as the raft of stages we’ve experienced to date, then it can be considered a success rather than an experiment: a confident genre hybrid worthy of your time and patience because who knows, today could be your day.Race the Sun is very close to a perfect pick-up-and-play game, except for the bit where it’s very hard not to keep playing once you’ve started. A quick break easily turns into one more attempt, trying to plot a different course over the cluttered plains, maximizing Tri collection while minimizing the risk of turning into a cloud of debris.An original take on the arcade time-trial formula.Race the Sun is an elegant endeavor, pairing slick action and stiff challenge with systems that make you want to come back day after day.","June 23, 2014","true","12.0"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","0"

And it pretty much applies here because this game is quite simple with minimalistic design. But just because it is that way doesn't mean that you will be able to complete it in few hours or feel that there's something missing. Let me tell you more about it.\n\nLet's start with the story. There is not other way  to put it but to say that there isn't one. Yep, it is simple as that. Basically you are piloting a spacecraft fueled by solar energy and the sun is your death timer. And for this game it couldn't have been better. On the bright side you don't need to worry about the story being to complex, bad or uninteresting. This game is more about highest scores and tense gameplay.\n\nBut let's talk about those simplistic graphics. When I launched the game for the first time it looked boring for few seconds but not much more than that because simple graphics can be good in its own right. In my opinion the game should be fun and engaging first and only then it should be an eye candy. There are of course games that are an eye candy first but we're not talking them right now. The beauty of the game in the arrangement of the obstacles, it's in clouds, in shapes and in the variety of all those things. But we'll talk about those in detail later on.\n\nFor now let's talk gameplay. This being basically a racing game where you, uh... race the sun and trying not to let it set involves high speed. You need to be as fast as you can and there are things that make you go faster like boosts and you will have to find those boosts if you don't want to run out of energy. There are other bonuses in the game as well. Jumping for example that can help you avoid certain death. Or the one that is basically an extra life that can be crucial in the later stages of the game. And there are 'tris' that increase your points multiplier. Although you can complete first few stages without too much maneuvering you will have to change your course if you want to find any of these.\nThere are many challenges and achievements too that will push your comprehension of what is possible in this game.\nThe game does no have difficulty settings but it definitely gets harder and harder as you move further from region to region. And the obstacles change too. Ranging for rocks to mountains, windmills, falling skyscrapers and more.\n\nAnd there is one more thing that made all of the components into one hell of a symphony - music. It amazingly matches the game. It's also simplistic and changes based on where you are in the game and the surroundings. I can't say that there's too much variety with music but for me it glues everything together quite nicely.\n\nSo should you buy it? Well, I got mine for free during some promotion but it was on my wishlist so I would have bought it anyway and had my money worth. You should buy this game if you don't really give a crab about the story and you don't mind spending countless hours trying to complete the next region or you're into high scores and online leaderboards.\n\nMore reviews from Gameaways Curator","January 14","true","25.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

When was the last time you really remember doing the old "sega" lean?  (seriously if you're too young to remember that, don't even ask) In my case, before Race the Sun, I'd have had to say, "I don't remember" - seriously, it really had been that long since any game was immersive enough to make me lean in time to my movements on the screen, like that was going to have any effect on my ability to steer.\n\nRace the Sun had me doing it within seconds of trying it out, and does so with the kind of regularity which is as refreshing as it is tragic, lol.\n\nUnder the hood, it's a basic time trial racer... but it feels more open than that.  Graphically it's an awesome kick back into retro gaming, whilst in itself being pretty smooth and well done.\n\nLevels are a mix of custom creations, both by the devs and other players, and proceedurally generated goodness, and the maps change on a daily basis (at the time of writing) keeping things fresh and meaning that no one player can grind their way to an unbeatable position on the leaderboard for a given map.\n\nLike your first hit of a Class A substance, Race the Sun is incredibly easy to pick up and start, but very hard to put down for any significant period of time, and for me at least, has become one of my go-to games for when I want a nice, enjoyable game to chill out playing without needing to become stupidly focused or remember whole codices of ingame stats and background info.\n\nAs a final thought, all I can add is that I've gotten far more bang for my buck with this game than I have with way too many other titles in the past, and unlike a lot of them, I know I'll be back to play it from time to time.","December 10, 2013","true","3.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

First up, and I'm not gonna lie to you here, this game is addictive.  And when I say it's addictive I don't mean, "oh what a nice little game, I'll play for a few minutes then get on with my day..."  No, it's more like the kind of addiction that grabs you instantly and never lets go.  I'd say it's impossible to play, "just one round."  No no.... you'll be like oh man I gotta do that again, I know I can do it better.  Wait wait... I know where I screwed up just one more round.  Oh man, I can't let that stop me.

What the game lacks in graphics it more than double makes up for in gameplay.  It's a racing game that gives you just as much thrills and spills as any racing game out there.  It's a game of dodging stuff that will leave you holding your breath as you narrowly miss that wall with a feeling of relief when you do.  It's a game to challenge you to beat your friends high scores that's just as enjoyable to achieve as the best competitive multiplayer game out there.  It's a game about change as each new day brings a new map to challenge your friends to.  It's a creators paradise where you can create maps and challenges for all your friends and community.  Belive me when I say, this game is a whole lot more than it looks.\n\nYou honestly can't go wrong adding this gem of a game to your game library.

But we've rarely seen one appear on Steam. It's because Race The Sun is stylish, fun and addictive, and not necessarily in that order.\n\nYou basically steer a ship across a randomly generated world with tons of objects to avoid and power-ups to collect.\n\nIt's fast paced and objective based. Well, it's not required, really, but it helps you upgrade your ship later on and might make your life a little easier. There are always 3 random objectives to complete, and with each objective you complete you'll earn 1 (easy objective) to 3 (harder objective) upgrade points. Upgrades can be a higher multiplier right from the start or the ability to store 2 power-ups instead of 1.\n\nWhile racing you have to collect yellow power-ups to keep raising the sun. Your ship is energy powered and staying in the shadows for too long will slow you down, resulting in a lower score (because, obviously, you can't collect items as quickly anymore). And if the sun goes down it's game over, too.\n\nIn the end I was pleasantly surprised by Race The Sun. I grew tired of endless runners a long time ago, but the combination of random worlds, power-ups and objectives make this game feel fresh somehow. Praise the sun !\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","December 12, 2013","true","7.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

The music is pleasing to the ear and does not irritate, sounds collected bonuses also are ok. The graphics, it's a matter of taste, I like to such minimalism and it speaks to me. To all of this there is very a honey flight model. The plane responds very well to control. The game starts off easy and gradually increasing challenge while giving a lot of laughter and a little bit of gymnastics (some people will curse). To fly millimeters of obstacles, spin bypass two obstacles, or the slipping through narrow gaps will make shout of victory, and in a moment dispersed we pitch on the next object.

Your ship is solar powered and going too far into shadows will slow you down and with the sun setting in the horizon itself, that turns the sun into a timer. Slamming into an object is failure, but you can graze an edge of your ship and be fine for a while.\n\nOn the surface, there's nothing wrong with the game, its easy to play, left and right to steer and well left and right to steer. It takes a moment for your ship to shift. The controls are simple and work well with a keyboard or 360 controller. You can do things like barrel rolls if you steer too far one way then hard turn it the other way. You can even unlock a single jump and other upgrades for your ship like a magnet that draws in orbs.\n\nThe game is shallow and even worse it relies on only one level for the most part. This single level resets itself each day. New day, new level. Other than that, you can unlock two additional levels and even play a credits level that has you flying under the credits in what feels like a flat open space with no challenge rather than an actual level.\n\nBecause its just one level, and the game never modifies itself, it makes the game feel like its more about memory than skill. Sure it takes skill to move between two falling blocks, but it takes memory to remember that you can just drive around the wall to a much easier path.\n\nEach level consists of different regions and each region seems to be a loop of itself twice. Well loop with some extras thrown in. As if someone copied and pasted then added some extra fluff. Between each region a white bird will zig-zag and drop four orbs one direction and four orbs another direction. Then it will drop a sun orb which surges your ship to its top speed. You'll find several blue orbs, sun orbs and green jump orbs throughout each level. There are ramps here and there that let you catch big air, falling blocks and shadows to slow you down. The funny thing is you can jump off a ramp high over orbs and it will still collect them if you touch the beam of light over them. Perhaps that's an unlocked feature. Its about as bare bones as it comes to runners.\n\nYou'll find portal gates that for whatever reason send you into space where you have a view from the cockpit. The game plays much slower and everything is black. You get to see a galactic space battle in black and white as you fly through it dodging lesser vessels as they zoom by. It feels out of place at best and only makes the game feel a lot easier going so slow. If we're still piloting the same ship when we're in the portal, am I still powered by the sun? Where is the sun in space? I sure can't see the sun.\n\nIn the main game itself you can change the camera view from a behind chase cam to a bumper view. Inside the galactic space battle, you're stuck in the cockpit, pressing the camera view button shifts the view by a few pixels. its odd that the game shifts at all when its that small of a difference.\n\nThere's a leveling up mechanic that has you accomplishing three goals to get to the next level. Getting to level eleven and twenty-five unlock new levels, but to get there you'll need to do things like jump ten times and do twenty barrel rolls in a single play. The further you go, the more challenging these goals become. Its definitely a way to add some longevity to a shallow game that feels like little to no effort was put in. The entire game feels like no effort was put in and its really the players that need to put time into the game. I want to play here, not work here.\n\nTo the game's credit, it looks great. The minimalist approach enhances the game and my enjoyment of it. It makes good use of a dynamic lighting system. The sun casts shadows, although some of the shadows seem to be painted on hazards to hurt your time. Even with a sun, some levels are just gray. Yes indeed, two-hundred and fifty-five shades of gray monochromatic action. Of course a level can be any color, I just seem find gray levels.\n\nRace the Sun has a level editor and Steam workshop integration, so you can always find new levels. I took one look at the level editor, saw how deep it is and then closed it. I've learned so many other level editors that its tough to justify putting time into this one. The real problem is why is that our job as players to make new levels? Sure its fun to create levels, publish them and rate them, but as a developer why are we stuck with one level per day on the computer version of what is essentially a mobile game? That sort of mechanic is what keeps people coming back and sitting through ads day after day and not people that paid money.\n\nSpeaking of paying money and mobile ports, on the start screen, they have DLC, the soundtrack and the mobile version to buy. That's understandable, a lot of bigger games, non indie games with shareholders often use this tactic right front and center and fans let them know it. Race the Sun is immune to this and people still manage to love the game for its brief and addictive gameplay. For a game that sells a soundtrack, why is there only one song? This whole game seems like a big cash grab.\n\nThere's so little here that its a starvation and so the game keeps you coming back for more with daily courses. You keep coming back to get your moneys worth, to get that quick shallow fix and move on with life knowing that level you spent an hour memorizing and mastering will never appear again. Your work, effort and bragging rights are replaced by tomorrow's level. A chance to wake up and do it all over again.\n\nWhile I hate to judge a game for everything but the game, there's just not much game here. you go left, you go right, take a ramp. remember what you did wrong.

Pick it up if you are interested, but be wary of the difficulty.","October 26, 2014","true","14.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

No seriously; if you like "endless running" games, then this is an excellent choice.\n\nThe minimalistic visuals are beautiful on their own, managing to create some wonderful vistas. The main interest you'll have in this game, though, is the gameplay. While seemingly simple and repetitive, if you're into games like these, then you'll probably not end up bored.\n\nIt does one thing, and it does it really, really well. You're a solar craft that travels the landscape, avoiding objects and shadows in your way. The sun is, almost in the literal sense of the word, your death timer, as your solar craft will quickly drain battery if the sun goes down, or if you spend too much time in shadows (damn you clouds! *shakes fist angrily toward the sky*).\n\nRace The Sun features a daily challenge, in the form of a randomly generated map, leaderboards, a pretty nice soundtrack, and some basic customization of the craft. Customization includes various wing decals, as well as the more important attachments that enhance your solar craft in many different ways. These are unlocked throughout the 25 levels, that you in turn gain through more or less difficult objectives given to you while playing.\n\nIt's great when you don't know what to do with yourself, when you're coming home tired from work or school, or when you just want to relax. For me personally, it works great as both an exciter and a relaxer, depending on my mood and the situation.\n\nIf you'd rather play your own music, instead of the in game one, I'll have you know it works well with almost anything from death metal to drum and bass.","April 23","true","10.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unlocking new things with each level that I gained kept me involved and wanting to keep ♥♥♥♥♥ing those missions done. The level creator is exceedingly thorough but with no real way to share levels yet, I eagerly await Steam Workshop, in the mean time the editor is simply a nice gesture. The visual style is simple yet pleasing and I loved visiting new worlds just to see what was in store for me. At the end of the day, if you loved Jetpack Joyride or are looking for a great game to play while waiting for friends to go play multiplayer with then this is for you and, heck, even if you don't fit those catagories you should still check the game out.","December 28, 2013","true","6.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's basically an infinite runner, as long as you don't run out of solar power. Your speed is constant to the amount of solar power you have. You dodge stuff, jump if you find power ups, collect tris's (diamonds) and try to get as far as possible without crashing... all to the sway of a great soundtrack. If you crash you start all over again. There's only one track (if you don't count what you can found in the Steam Workshop) but it's regenerated every 24 hrs so you can always come back for more.\n\nAt the same time there's a level up system. Every five rewardpoints you collect you'll get a level up which gives you minor bonuses. You collect rewardpoints by completing tasks. At any point you have three tasks; a one pointer, a two pointer and a three pointer. These can range anywhere from "collectively travel X amount of distance" to "clear two stages without ever turning left". Once you complete a task it is swapped for a new one... and this system gives the game some more depth. Instead of always just trying to get as far as possible, you start trying to complete tasks... kinda like achievement hunting, but you're actually rewarded for completing them ... other than a small icon that pops up.\n\nAwesome game - recommended fullheartedly!","September 29, 2014","true","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Along the way you'll need to pick up scattered energy bursts to help fend off the impending darkness, at which point your solar-powered ship will begin to slow down considerably before finally stopping all together. The racing itself feels very slick and there's a terrific sense of tension that hits once you advance beyond the first couple regions and reach some truly heinous areas. The blocky and minimalistic visual style is surprisingly good-looking in motion, thanks largely to some really nice lighting effects. There isn't a whole lot of variety to the soundtrack but what's there is still quite solid. New tracks are procedurally-generated every 24 hours, and the use of leaderboards help make high-score chasing a reason to keep coming back.\n\nThe control scheme is very simplistic (analog stick to move, action button to jump when available) but I couldn't help but notice a slight yet noticeable amount of lag while playing that is directly tied to v-sync. There's no in-game option to turn it off, but I was able to force it off using RadeonPro for my AMD card. Being limited to a single track each day can also make runs a bit repetitive, a feeling that's enhanced by the limited soundtrack and oft-repeated backgrounds. Thankfully there is Steam Workshop integration so that players can create their own tracks for others to enjoy.\n\n(EDIT: In regards to runs becoming repetitive - After playing a bit more, I now feel like it isn't as big a concern as I initially thought. Each track/region is loaded with branching paths in addition to portals that temporarily take you to bizarre alternate regions. This helps make each run feel a little more unique if you to decide to mix it up and take different routes each time.)\n\nDespite a couple small issues, Race The Sun is a beautiful and simple yet thrilling endless runner. Runs may only last for a few minutes at a time, but it makes for some exciting bursts of racing that will test your concentration and timing.","September 23, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its like having an arcade cabinet in your computer,   I wish i could take a dollar to the bar and get quarters to play this game with a beer on the stool beside me.  The most astonishing thing about race the sun is that the world changes, sometimes subtly and sometimes radically, every 24 hours.  I have no idea how this is accomplished, but it somehow heightens the old school nature of the game, and would have been an incredible feature in an arcade in the late eighties.  For some reason it also reminds me of pinball.  It is Adams Family good.","March 12, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is no story, no dialogue: just the simple objective of don't die. That includes getting as far as you can while the sun is still up, as you are a solar powered aircraft (hence the title, Race the Sun). So pretty much it's a time trial, except instead of numbers on a timer, it's a natural time limit. Controls are intuitive and simple, like many other platformers. As you progress in the game you'll get more abilites and things to collect while dodging huge rotating boxes and manoeuvring through narrow tunnels. There is also a level designer, although that was too complex for me to figure out how to use, and I decided just racing would be a better use of my time.\nOverall, this is a fun, action packed platformer with beautiful minimalist graphics that brings a new dynamic of racing the Sun until it sets. Highly recommended, but not for its price. I bought it for $2 while it was on sale, and for that it is more than worth it. However, $10 might be a little on the pricey side for a game with its amount of content.\nRegardless of the price, I rate it 8/10 for what it is.","December 14, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Your goal is to stay alive as long as possible to earn a high score. The course is divided into regions, which start off fairly relaxed as you fly through wide open spaces and around static objects, but gets progressively more intense as you squeeze through narrow gaps and make split second reactions to avoid moving objects. The race ends either when you crash, or run out of sunlight.\n\nAlong the way you can collect various pickups. Blues increase your score, greens let you jump over obstacles, yellows give a speed boost and increase remaining sun time and purples allow you to respawn one time after a crash.\n\nDuring a race you can also work towards completing challenges such as collecting x number of pickups or earning a specific score. Every few challenges completed will grant you a level up and unlock a new pickup, or an item to equip on your craft. These items grant useful abilities, for example, the magnet will attract nearby pickups, and the jump storage lets you carry two jump pickups instead of one. But you have limited item slots, so your choice can influence your playing style.\n\nThe map is procedurally generated every 24 hours, which means success depends more on skill than memorising the map. It also helps to keep the game fresh. Graphics are minimal, but that's actually a good thing. When you're flying at such high speeds, more detail would be distracting. Controls work well with either keyboard or 360 pad.

The graphics are very Starfox-esque and the content is mild. The could even be a game that they would enjoy playing with you, though there is no multiplayer outside of the leader-boards.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?:\n\nAn endless runner really doesn’t end and that is the point. I enjoyed playing it for short bursts and imagine I will continue to do so during the times when I’m taking a break from a larger experience.\n\nRecommended Purchase Price:\n\nThe game is a blast and can be enjoyed by anyone. Flying your ship down a vast and infinite world is exciting and fun. The fact that the worlds change every day is a huge bonus and the progression system keeps you coming back to play “one more round”. Though the game may lose your interest down the road, the content and design are well worth the asking price. The developers will be a team to watch going forward, as well:\n\n$9.99\n\nor\n\n100% of current retail value of $9.99\n\nhttp://www.gamersglance.com\nA Quick Look at Those Games You Might Buy","February 22, 2014","true","7.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I don't want to say that this game is horrible, but even without my hopes and expectations I had when seing the screens of this game, I am sure that I still wouldn't recommend it. It is just not my cup of tea and I'm going to tell you why...\n\nI like racing games, especially the fast and highly unrealistic ones I played in old times. Obviously this game is nothing like that. To be honest, I expected it to be somewhat like StarWing (SNES, 1993), because it almost looks like it. I bought this game, because its "fast" gameplay and interesting look seemed promising. Well, this game did not meet my expectation in any way. Please do not get fooled by the screenshots that imply that there is a variety of space themed or interesting levels. Those are temporary warp zones and not even fun ones to play either.\nAt some point this game can be fast, but is it any good when you cannot manouver fast enough to react to certain objects (not even with the steering upgrade)? The controls are extremely limited. You are only able to steer left and right, a button to activate your power-up and that's IT. NO turning your vehicle upside down or sideways to fly through narrow spaces. Actually, you are able to perform an aileron roll (commonly refered to as barrel roll), but it does absolutely nothing besides reminding you of how awesome it would be to quit the game and play a different one. You are not even able to steer your vehicle up or down, while in midair. Even the rare and short space zones cannot be navigated 3Dimensionally. The control settings say that you can map "up" and "down", but it's only for the menu (what a freakin' joke). You can only jump, which is one of three power-ups. In this game nothing spectacular or exciting will happen, due to limited gameplay features..\nTo be fair, the normal game mode is very easy and to a certain extend fun to play, but if you wanted to go deeper into what the game holds in store for you, you have to play its Apocalypse mode, which except for the beginning of each level is absolutely random and requiers 50% of pure luck and 50% of skill. Besides I really don't want to get started about what's wrong with that game mode and I only want to say that it is frustrating NOT because it's difficult, but because UNPREDICTABLE level elements can ruin a good run instantly with cheap deaths. I mean, of course you get better and learn certein patterns that might repeat and yet still a high share of luck remains. Not even trial and error will get you further, but rather plain patience and multiple runs. For all those achievement hunters out there: obtaining the hardest achievement in the game is not too hard, but it can be so boring that it makes you actually wish for a breath of fresh air outside, watching a real sunset for over an hour, rather than playing this monotonous game. Really, there's not much variety to be discovered in this game. It's just a game with unused potential. I like its cover picture though...","June 16, 2014","false","19.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The trailer really shows the ideas and speed of the game, if you think it's too fast or repetitive then you won't like the game. But I've found it very enjoyable. A slower-speed option could help newer players through the awkward progression system, but the game is still solid.\n\nI've never really been a fan of the runner genre, but this game cleans up the issues and polished the best parts. Still, the amount of content is fair, but I don't think the game is incredibly replayable. Most reviewers are around 5 hours or less, with very few above 10. I consider myself nearly "done" with the game, seeing most of what the game offers in a reasonable time. It's very good content, but only something I'd come back to play occassionally.

Worlds regenerate every day, so it's fresh when you go back to it and it has Steam Workshop support so there should be plenty of new content coming out. The only (inevitable) problem with this type of game is once you level up all the way and the 'challenges' end, it's not quite as fun/addicting to play. Still great for going for high scores, but the replayability does drop off some. Still an excellent game to get for a few bucks.","May 22, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a very simple design and concept but is very satisfying to play. It's easy to jump in and play for a shot time but can be very difficult. You pilot a solar glider over an abstract landscape toward the sun, You need to avoid the various obstacles and you need to avoid shadows, otherwise you glider will eventually lose power. Get through each area before the sun sets or it's "game over." Collecting blue pyramids increases your multiplier to increase the points you get for the distance you travel without crashing and dying, or bumping into obstacles, which decrements your multiplier. The game really gives you a sense of speed and you can get to feeling like the obstacles are starting to box you in, which creates a nice tension at times.

SO I figure it's time to give my two cents.\n\nRace the Sun is a simplistic speed game with the objective of not crashing and staying alive in front of the suns rays and not always in the shadows. (You are a solar craft after all.) The game is really calming or super intense with the music supplemented for the regions. The artwork is so clean and minimalistic, you don't get distracted by specfic textures or colors. The specfic terrain changes: change with ship level, day to day, and also how far into the regions you take your craft.\n\nIf you're good you can fly through the map banking and barrel rolling the entire time left or right, or slalom style. The game feels to have specific lanes that if you were to be inbetween two lanes, you would feel safe but not challenged by the obstacles. Eventually, this would be met with a dead end of terrain somewhere along the lines if you were to continue really any path just straight forward. It's designed to make you keep looking for openings and to take risks to find the powerups you need and sometimes there are several ways to approach the old (and new) areas you needed more help with. There's Jumps, Emergency lives that spit you out at high altitudes, turning jets eventually to make you more like Starfox. The boosts are probably your bread and butter if you cn figure out the maps because getting high scores on this game requires as much distance as it does the Tris that add to your score.\n\nThis game is very addicting, will keep you playing to explore and try to pull off insane moves to get where you want to be.","December 26, 2013","true","31.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

SO I figure it's time to give my two cents.\n\nRace the Sun is a simplistic speed game with the objective of not crashing and staying alive in front of the suns rays and not always in the shadows. (You are a solar craft after all.) The game is really calming or super intense with the music supplemented for the regions. The artwork is so clean and minimalistic, you don't get distracted by specfic textures or colors. The specfic terrain changes: change with ship level, day to day, and also how far into the regions you take your craft.\n\nIf you're good you can fly through the map banking and barrel rolling the entire time left or right, or slalom style. The game feels to have specific lanes that if you were to be inbetween two lanes, you would feel safe but not challenged by the obstacles. Eventually, this would be met with a dead end of terrain somewhere along the lines if you were to continue really any path just straight forward. It's designed to make you keep looking for openings and to take risks to find the powerups you need and sometimes there are several ways to approach the old (and new) areas you needed more help with. There's Jumps, Emergency lives that spit you out at high altitudes, turning jets eventually to make you more like Starfox. The boosts are probably your bread and butter if you cn figure out the maps because getting high scores on this game requires as much distance as it does the Tris that add to your score.\n\nThis game is very addicting, will keep you playing to explore and try to pull off insane moves to get where you want to be.","December 26, 2013","true","31.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(It did get ported to mobile devices later on, though.)\n\nThe game is mostly solid, looks beautiful and clean, and controls pretty well. With the exception of the one user world I tried. I like how you can traverse to actual 'worlds' that other players have created while you're running through the game, but the one I tried was white on black and all the ground obstacles were white and hidden by the landscape, and I was irritated when I hit a white car while driving over a white foreground and died, because I couldn't ♥♥♥♥ing see what killed me! I pin the blame on the designer on that level, though.\n\nThe game advertises a really neat co-op 'clan' premise where your friends can pick up after you've died in your game, but since I'm a Forever Alone and I think co-op is more gimmick than feature at this point, I didn't get the chance to try that out.\n\nThere's not much going on in solo-play, other than 'endless running' and 'obligatory RPG mechanics' and 'RPG challenges with no choice to skip over the boring ones'. However, if you're here to chase scores and chew bubblegum, that gum is going to fall out of your mouth while you figure out the best path to get all the points so you can try in vain to beat the guy who hacked himself into the #1 spot on the leaderboards. Much like you're trying to beat the sun, you'll never beat the #1 guy on the leaderboards, because leaderboards in video games in 2015 are invitations for hackers to 'beat the system' and 'vote for Ron Paul'.\n\nSo I don't feel much love or hate for Race the Sun. If you're looking for an endless runner, though, you could get this one?","October 31, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I take a small dose of this game with breakfast.  Its controls are simple... so much so that it can played with one hand, leaving your other to shove your breakfast burrito into your face.  But don't let that fool you.  RTS is a game that demands your attention and reflexes, but with great reward.\n\nNot very graphically intense, but it's better this way.  Your objective is simple, your controls are simple, and your environment should match, especially given that this is a a fast reflex and short-term planning game.  Complexity would only create more problems in the way of hitbox management and identification.  Immersion, as a result, is minimal yet engaging.\n\nProgression can be a bit slow through the ship levels, but if you focus, you can achieve even some of the goals that seem more difficult than the others, resulting in a bigger jump through the leveling process.\n\nAnd then... the unlocked mode.

Or you can just turn it off and use your own music of choice which is always a plus for games.\n\n[Graphics - good]: It's simple and smooth which is a plus when reflexes are important to playing at high speeds and any framerate drop or stuttering could spell death. I hate graphic dependant games since they're too much for my older computer, luckily there's no issue at all with this game so just about anyone can play it.\n\n[Content - average]: As I said at the top, there isn't much to do in this game and that's mainly because it's all hidden behind unlock requirements which can take awhile to actually unlock. You can only have one ship attachment at the beginning and I have no idea how long it takes to actually get to the point where you can have multiple ones equipped. I'm still at the point where I have 2 choices for levels, the base mode that has a set level that changes every 24 hours or Apocalypse mode which is the base mode with more explosions. Credits mode doesn't count because you can literally afk while doing it because all you do is fly straight and wait for it to end. (Why they didn't have you interact with them by having you dodge falling credits seems like a huge waste). It does have a map editor which adds some feeling of community to it but again you have no choices for level selection beyond what is randomly generated each day.\nThen you have the Sunrise DLC which is a freestyle zen mode from what I understand of the description. (Why on earth that wasn't included in the basic game which was already lacking in stuff to do is also beyond me).\n\n[Overall - good]: Despite the complaints I have for the content, this game is a good time-killer. The built-in games a computer OS comes with (think Solitaire, Minesweeper, or Pinball) are probably the most played games just because you don't always have the time or motivation to commit to a whole game that could take hours to complete.  This game fits into that category of games very well. However it is simply not worth the $12 price tag for it and the Sunrise DLC, between $5 and $8 is closer to what this game should be at.","October 9, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/recommended/253030/","lovinglife139","lovinglife139","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/","1123 products in account","I purchased this game not long ago during a sale, and on a whim. I'm not a huge arcade game fan, nor have I ever spent any decent amount of time in any "flying racing" game. What attracted me to this was its simplistic design. It's an absolutely beautiful game even though it took about a minute to download in full (seriously!). I also thought it was an original idea, and the procedural world thing also pulled at me.\n\nSo, despite never having been a fan of this type of game in the past, I have to say, I'm loving this. The music is top notch, the worlds are beautiful and change daily, and it truly makes you feel like you're on a mission (a mission to what? RACE THE SUN! **Crickets**). I picked this game out of my Steam backlog because I felt like something simple and relaxing, and oddly enough, this game does that for me. This game is what you allow it to be, really. You can play it just to waste time and relax, or you can try beating your top scores and accomplishing certain tasks the game consistently updates for you to do that help you level (much like the awesometacular game Jetpack Joyride for the PS Vita does).\n\nRace the Sun has a seriously high "just one more level" aspect, and the way it presents itself in terms of leveling, tasks to do, etc., open it up for a wider audience than just the "arcade racing" crowd. 90% of the time, I don't want to feel stressed or on edge when I'm gaming, which is what most arcade games do to me. In Race the Sun, I'm not on edge, because even if I have a run that sucks, I still have fun, can laugh at my mistakes, and may even accomplish some progress on my level.\n\nOn a final note, there is massive replay value here. The game worlds change daily, and it allows you to even mess with its editor to create content for yourself. You can also customize your ship and unlock upgrades, which will take a while to get all of. I highly recommend this game to those who already like the genres it inhabits, but also to those looking for a great game that is fun to jump in and out of, to relax or challenge yourself. Race the Sun is a great game, and gets everything it does right.","June 1, 2014","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I take a small dose of this game with breakfast.  Its controls are simple... so much so that it can played with one hand, leaving your other to shove your breakfast burrito into your face.  But don't let that fool you.  RTS is a game that demands your attention and reflexes, but with great reward.\n\nNot very graphically intense, but it's better this way.  Your objective is simple, your controls are simple, and your environment should match, especially given that this is a a fast reflex and short-term planning game.  Complexity would only create more problems in the way of hitbox management and identification.  Immersion, as a result, is minimal yet engaging.\n\nProgression can be a bit slow through the ship levels, but if you focus, you can achieve even some of the goals that seem more difficult than the others, resulting in a bigger jump through the leveling process.\n\nAnd then... the unlocked mode.

(It did get ported to mobile devices later on, though.)\n\nThe game is mostly solid, looks beautiful and clean, and controls pretty well. With the exception of the one user world I tried. I like how you can traverse to actual 'worlds' that other players have created while you're running through the game, but the one I tried was white on black and all the ground obstacles were white and hidden by the landscape, and I was irritated when I hit a white car while driving over a white foreground and died, because I couldn't ♥♥♥♥ing see what killed me! I pin the blame on the designer on that level, though.\n\nThe game advertises a really neat co-op 'clan' premise where your friends can pick up after you've died in your game, but since I'm a Forever Alone and I think co-op is more gimmick than feature at this point, I didn't get the chance to try that out.\n\nThere's not much going on in solo-play, other than 'endless running' and 'obligatory RPG mechanics' and 'RPG challenges with no choice to skip over the boring ones'. However, if you're here to chase scores and chew bubblegum, that gum is going to fall out of your mouth while you figure out the best path to get all the points so you can try in vain to beat the guy who hacked himself into the #1 spot on the leaderboards. Much like you're trying to beat the sun, you'll never beat the #1 guy on the leaderboards, because leaderboards in video games in 2015 are invitations for hackers to 'beat the system' and 'vote for Ron Paul'.\n\nSo I don't feel much love or hate for Race the Sun. If you're looking for an endless runner, though, you could get this one?","October 31, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Or you can just turn it off and use your own music of choice which is always a plus for games.\n\n[Graphics - good]: It's simple and smooth which is a plus when reflexes are important to playing at high speeds and any framerate drop or stuttering could spell death. I hate graphic dependant games since they're too much for my older computer, luckily there's no issue at all with this game so just about anyone can play it.\n\n[Content - average]: As I said at the top, there isn't much to do in this game and that's mainly because it's all hidden behind unlock requirements which can take awhile to actually unlock. You can only have one ship attachment at the beginning and I have no idea how long it takes to actually get to the point where you can have multiple ones equipped. I'm still at the point where I have 2 choices for levels, the base mode that has a set level that changes every 24 hours or Apocalypse mode which is the base mode with more explosions. Credits mode doesn't count because you can literally afk while doing it because all you do is fly straight and wait for it to end. (Why they didn't have you interact with them by having you dodge falling credits seems like a huge waste). It does have a map editor which adds some feeling of community to it but again you have no choices for level selection beyond what is randomly generated each day.\nThen you have the Sunrise DLC which is a freestyle zen mode from what I understand of the description. (Why on earth that wasn't included in the basic game which was already lacking in stuff to do is also beyond me).\n\n[Overall - good]: Despite the complaints I have for the content, this game is a good time-killer. The built-in games a computer OS comes with (think Solitaire, Minesweeper, or Pinball) are probably the most played games just because you don't always have the time or motivation to commit to a whole game that could take hours to complete.  This game fits into that category of games very well. However it is simply not worth the $12 price tag for it and the Sunrise DLC, between $5 and $8 is closer to what this game should be at.","October 9, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is beyond a good thing because the maps have so much substance, changing it up with each new region you fly through.\n\nGraphics are quite attractive and with steam workshop being enabled, people's wonderful imaginations run wild and make maps even prettier, also deadlier.

But now i'm on 20th and i'm confident i can reach more. This is a simple game to play with your nerves. Flying on a high velocity trying to avoid obstacles. At first it seems you can't make it. But it has nice difficulty curve. There are always 3 objectives to complete and you can complete them ALL, just might need some time to upgrade for some of them. And you get better at controlling the plane as time goes (playing with keyboard though, gamepad lags a bit). Another big plus, that every day it looks differently (don't know if they do it manually or levels generate procedururally). They have similarities and are composed of same objects, but still have some unique spots, so you want to check it out next day.

You pilot a solar powered craft trying to catch the setting sun. You can only try to but you cannot win as the sun will eventually set and you will run out of power.\n\nYou race in a world that is randomly generated daily so the game offers a lot of replayability. While you can only move towards the sun the map is basically endless in every direction giving you a lot of room to manouver. Completing specific tasks in the game earns powerups that can make you last longer like shield against collisions, jump to avoid obstacles and ability to warp levels. At times the gameplay can be hectic and fast but still i’d say that Race the Sun is most of all a meditative experience. It’s a game that you might play for 10 minutes at a time or so but not much longer.\n\nNo matter how hard you try the sun will eventually set.

But, if you hate games that have no story behind them what so ever (Like Minecraft) and hate games where you do the same thing over and over again (Again, Like Minecraft) Then you might not like this game, I suggest you give it a try, if you fall in love with it why not support the devs and get the 50 cent Dlc? However if you didn't like the game then you can just refund it, simple! I love this game and the dlc was good too. Yes I'm being a little biased because this is probably the first game for one of the devs.\nOk so now that I have told you what you wanted to know here is what this game is about\nYou have a solar powered car/plane/veichle that must complete a set of challenges and regions by not running into the f*cking wall, and you also must collect powerups like the "Jump" powerup or the "Extended period of sun" powerup and also there are those blue things that are found commonly everywhere, that boost your score, You also have to watch out not to get covered by the shadow of walls because that slows your veichle down, we are talking about a solar powered veichle duh, There are also challenges that you must complete if you want to level up (I have not reached level 11 yet =P) Overall I love this game! You should deffinetely give this a try!","February 9","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Upon booting up the game I was greeted with a simple options screen, which I was pretty impressed about, as this game is only in its early stages, yet the developers still took the time to add some configuration choices, e.g. resolution, graphics quality, controls, etc…\n\nNow, I’m in the game, & immediately some extremely intense music starts rolling, I’m feeling pumped and then my solar plane just shoots out of nowhere, the controls are displayed, (Left & Right keys to steer), and I’m straight into the action!, dodging pyramids, trees, spheres and various other low-polygon 3D shapes. If I were to sum this game up in a sentence, it would go something like this, “Fast-paced, Side-scrolling, action, thriller”. I was having an absolute blast! I often found myself on the edge of my chair, biting my teeth, and swearing just as clipped a tiny tree.\n\nAll in all, the game’s pace is incredible, not to fast, not to slow. The ascending music at the beginning of each round really sets the intense mood. The graphics aren’t exactly crisp, but it wasn’t really something I took too much notice of while my solar plane was speeding around. Something that the developers need to work on in my opinion, is the Sun, as the games is based around it, I thought it would get more attention, but after you unlock the ability to send the sun back up, you never really take notice of it.\n\nThat’s all for this review, I hope you enjoyed this quick (or rather long) insight on Race The Sun.\nRegards, Paul\n","March 9, 2014","true","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Simple, well-honed controls that are tight and responsive, fully rebindable, clear aesthetic design and that sense of speed at 90fps (+) just has to be seen to be believed...\n\nIt's beautiful, simple and elegant. It doesn't pretend to do anything more than one thing - to get as far as you can before the sun sets. And, with a number of well-planned unlocks and boosts available as you sink more time in, it keeps on giving you another reason to play more.\n\nCan't recommend it enough for what it does. And I'm just hoping it gets the praise it deserves!","December 15, 2013","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'd get so far, just to crash right into a block that wasn't there a second ago. This only fueled my desire to try again, and again, and again, making this game fairly addictive.\n\nRace the Sun's objective is to simply "Race the Sun", as the title states. You're placed in control of what appears to be some sort of futuristic spaceship and tasked with riding towards the sun, just visible above the horizon directly ahead of the ship. The problem is, there are many obstacles in-between the ship and the sun. The obstacles become more obtrusive as time goes on, starting with the transition from static to dynamic objects. Upon crashing into any object, you're done, unless you happen to have a multiplier active, in which case, your multiplier disappears, but you remain alive.\n\nDuring this time, you're introduced to the various "challenges" that can be completed, and, upon completion, the challenge is replaced with a completely new challenge, among a variety of different challenges. These challenges reminded me of the goals included in that mobile game, Jetpack Joyride. The game also featured user-created worlds. Steam Workshop support is planned (according to the in-game menu), so we'll have to wait to unleash the full potential of the world builder.\n\nThe game has a major flaw, that being the lack of diversity offered out of the box. Race the Sun is probably going to end up relying on user creations to keep its value over time, but the pre-packaged worlds did not satisfy the amount that I had expected from the game. Still looking forward to more worlds offered by the community.\n\nThe game's graphics were set in grayscale, with a few very bright whites also present. This was a great style overall and I thought it fit well with the type of gameplay provided. The game also includes some great atmospheric sounds and music to it, although it was difficult to pay attention to while concentrating so hard on avoiding objects flying at you going hyperspeed.\n\nRace the Sun progressively built up my frustration when I played it for long periods of time. The gameplay works best when experienced in small bursts. Warning: Playing for extended periods of time may result in a broken controller. Race the Sun's purchase can be justified if you're the type of gamer who can't sit through a game for more than 30 minutes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eNV5-3jH2Q","December 18, 2013","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kallenevans/recommended/253030/","kallenevans","OrcaForce (TachyonTail)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kallenevans/","216 products in account","Race the Sun reminds me in many ways of the Java-based title flood runner -- another endless runner that would see you piloting a hovercraft of sorts through procedurally generated terrain, populated by increasingly dense simple shapes. flood runner was a game that proved so instantly accessible and absurdly addictive that our school at the time had to ban every site that carried it, just to make sure we did some work.\n\nRace the Sun also falls into that mould. Ostensibly an endless runner with two simple rules -- always move forward, and never crash -- players are free to roam about the minimalist landscapes in lateral fashion via a solar-powered vehicle. Indeed, you'll need to in order to avoid the rush of oncoming shapes and structures. The turning circle of your ship is sluggish to begin with, and decisive flying is of paramount importance.\n\nThe game begins with languid sojourns through open, spacious environments, the sun atop the horizon constantly threatening to set and bring your journey to an end. There are pickups strewn liberally across the maps: blue ones (Tris) add to your score multiplier, green ones earn you the ability to make a single jump, the white ones enshrined in soft pillars of light prolong the day and speed up your craft, and then there's the rare pink object which gives you one free pass when it comes to the crunch.\n\nDiverting from the easy, straight course to risk ruin amidst the denser pockets of each level in order to chase down pickups seems needless at the very start But the first time the sun sets and leaves your craft without power, stranded ignobly and with a lamentable score, you begin to realise the importance of chasing them down.\n\nThere's some progression in there too, with Jetpack Joyride-esque objectives in 1-star, 2-star, and 3-star difficulty flavourings, the completion of which will help to boost your pilot ranking. Some of these missions see you accumulating Tris or travelling a certain distance, others might have you performing a certain number of barrel rolls (thereby forcing you to move laterally a lot more than you would) within the space of a single run, or only turning left. There's a pleasant sense of accomplishment that follow the completion of some of these things\n\nOne of the best things about the whole experience is the relay system. If you're finding the game too tricky, you can make use of the little option at the end of each run that allows you to share a relay point via email or across social networks like Twitter and Facebook. Basically, another player can then start from where you finished, and then when they crash or run out of solar power, the chain can be continued. Buddy up with a friend, and you can leapfrog one another to maximise points and distance, helping to unlock more of the fiendish 3-star accomplishments. You can only create a four-stage relay, but it works very nicely indeed.\n\nSo race the sun great game if you have a pc you need this even on the lowest graphical settings this game is a thrill to play\n\nAnother well deserved 10/10","December 25, 2013","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Buy it for an easy-going experience that will keep you coming back day after day.\n\nRace The Sun is a simple game at heart, and as such I just don't think it's realistic to expect to get hours of gameplay out of it in one sitting. I don't think that's what the game sets out to do, either. What it does do wonderfully is provide a great pick-up-and-play title that can easily become a daily routine.\n\nWatch the trailer or some other videos of it, and you'll get the basic premise. Yep, you just dodge stuff. There is no throttle and there is no brake, you're simply flying as fast and as far as you can before the sun - your source of energy - sets on the horizon. There are various pickups which make the gameplay more varied as you progress, such as an essential item that makes the sun rise in the sky for that much needed extended time. It's almost reminiscent of an old arcade-style racer, where when you ran out of time you had to insert more quarters, only without the quarters.\n\nThe key aspect of this game is the changing worlds. Every day they release a new world for you to race in, so the challenge won't be the same as the last time you played it. And each world, at that, can be pleasantly varied as you fly farther and farther, progressing through the world's "stages." Add in custom user-made worlds (the game comes with a world editor) and Steam Workshop integration incoming, and you've got a whole lot of replayability.","January 1, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So I say yes to most but to some I would have to say no, but you can never tell what side you are on till you try the game\n\n-First- Find out what time the world resets for you (i.e. My world resets at 10pm) once you have found out the time minus 2 hours and add 2 hours from that number. (i.e. My case it would be 8pm and 12am)\n\n-Second- Play the game only during these time zones. (One note since the world resets during this time don't try for challenges it might get difficult)\n\nThis is how i can play this game for a long period of time without wanting to punch my computer screen. I do recommend this tip for anyone who doesn't like to play the game for more than 2 hours because of repetition.","March 21, 2014","true","908.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Upon booting up the game I was greeted with a simple options screen, which I was pretty impressed about, as this game is only in its early stages, yet the developers still took the time to add some configuration choices, e.g. resolution, graphics quality, controls, etc…\n\nNow, I’m in the game, & immediately some extremely intense music starts rolling, I’m feeling pumped and then my solar plane just shoots out of nowhere, the controls are displayed, (Left & Right keys to steer), and I’m straight into the action!, dodging pyramids, trees, spheres and various other low-polygon 3D shapes. If I were to sum this game up in a sentence, it would go something like this, “Fast-paced, Side-scrolling, action, thriller”. I was having an absolute blast! I often found myself on the edge of my chair, biting my teeth, and swearing just as clipped a tiny tree.\n\nAll in all, the game’s pace is incredible, not to fast, not to slow. The ascending music at the beginning of each round really sets the intense mood. The graphics aren’t exactly crisp, but it wasn’t really something I took too much notice of while my solar plane was speeding around. Something that the developers need to work on in my opinion, is the Sun, as the games is based around it, I thought it would get more attention, but after you unlock the ability to send the sun back up, you never really take notice of it.\n\nThat’s all for this review, I hope you enjoyed this quick (or rather long) insight on Race The Sun.\nRegards, Paul\n","March 9, 2014","true","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now that I think about it, I feel like that is a really rare combo to find in a game, at least for me it is...\n\nWhat is it about? / Gameplay\nIt's a pretty basic endless runner with an interesting twist. You are controlling an aircraft through obstacle-littered world at high velocity. Being solar-powered, shadows and sunset are your main concern. You must keep going fast enough to delay the inevitable end of your futile race for as long as possible…\n\nThe gameplay is very simplistic. Fly, dodge, jump, and collect stuff along the way. That's all I've been doing, because that's all there is to do in this game. Yet, strangely enough, I still find myself craving for more of the same…\nThe world you're flying through is divided into a regions, each being more difficult, due to rising ammount and variety of obstacles. The whole map is re-generated daily, offering a slightly different experience every day. I say slightly, because some elements always start to appear in the same regions, which I feel is fair. Anyway, the ever changing world keeps the game fresh, and if that's not enough for you, there are another two (unlockable) game modes and a level editor with Steam Workshop support.\nThe game sets various different challenges -  something like "collect XY points in one run" for example. Completing these challenges unlocks new ship upgrades, pick-ups and bunch of other stuff. There are also leaderboards and achievements to make your effort less pointless.\n\n\nNotes\nI love how smooth, fluid and responsive the whole game feels. I haven't had a single problem with it. No lag, no framerate drops or bugs. In a fast-paced game, where blinking an eye can get you killed, I certainly do appreciate that.\nThe sense of speed in this game is insane. I have only played it for 4 hours as I'm writing this, but I know I will be coming back for more of that addictive, exhilarating and extremely immersive experience. I can only imagine how crazy it must be with Oculus Rift on your head. I'd be happy to try it, even if it meant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants (I'm dead serious here).\nAlso, generating new world every 24 hours is a brilliant move in a game like this. It gives you chance to get used to a new world and try your best in a leaderboard, while still keeping the game fresh and encouraging you to come back. Steam Workshop support is just a cherry on top. There's definitely a lot of replayability here.\nThe aesthetic is quite minimalistic, but it works and I like it. Also I'm sure it helps to avoid performance issues. There's no point in having complex, textured enviroments when moving at insane speed anyway… But like I said, I like it as it is. It gives the world this desolated-postapocalyptic-dystopian-wasteland-kind-of-feel. Soundtrack, although not very long, also helps with that representation. The individual tracks are pretty different in their atmosphere, but work very nicely together.\n\nConclusion\nIf you're looking for a way to forget about the world around you for a while, test your reflexes and get your adrenaline and endorphine levels fixed in the process, this is the game you need. It's addictive, extremely rewarding and fun, with a great replay value. I labsolutely love it.\n\nHowever, consider that this game is very minimalistic in it's design. I don't want to say it's lacking content, but I know some people may have trouble justifying the price tag because of it…so consider that, and maybe wait for a sale if that's what bothers you.\nNeedless to say, I don't recommend it to people who don't like very fast-paced racing games / endless runners, or those who are not very good at making split-second decision.","May 6, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In Race the Sun, you race through courses that vary every day. While the courses are not identical to the previous day's course, they will contain similar parts for each round, the varying being where the parts are pieced together.\n\nI have found this game to be rather addictive at times, partially due to the achievements and leaderboard.

The game controls well and often relies on how precise you can be with your car movement.

A lot of them now have levels to earn and missions to do and unlocks to... unlock, and Race the Sun is no different. But even after unlocking everything, I still go back to it now and then because of how solid the basic gameplay is.\n\nYou're the pilot of a solar-powered hovercraft, speeding towards the setting sun in an attempt to stay in daylight. Shadows cast by mountains, structures, and clouds will all slow you down, and when the sun sets, you're done. To keep up with the sun you'll need to dodge the many obstacles in your wide-open path, as well as pick up booster items to thrust you forward at even higher speed. I wasn't kidding about speeding towards the sun, because even your regular pace feels like hundreds of miles per hour. Dodging obstacles and steering into pickups is thrilling and harrowing, and pulling off tight maneuvers is always satisfying.\n\nThere are all manner of items to pick up across the levels like point multipliers, jumps, shields, and more. Completing tasks like clearing 3 levels without bumping anything or jumping 5 times earns you XP towards new ranks, which unlock upgrades and decals for your ship. There are 25 ranks to earn, giving you a goal for at least a few hours. Even beyond that there are reasons to keep flying, though. The main levels change every day, giving you new layouts to tackle. There's also a hard mode and a maze mode to unlock, and user-created levels to try, including one user-created level hidden in the regular game each day!\n\nThe presentation is a unique blend of stark, clean visuals, soothing soundtrack, and a strangely casual tone to the text. All the elements are there for a game that you can load up for 5 or 10 minutes for a quick run, or turn on for an hour and work at, or start the free-flight mode and just chill. There's no fighting so it won't properly scratch that Starfox itch you might get from the screenshots, but it's well worth a few hours of your time to explore and enjoy.","December 31, 2015","true","3.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I made a world for a contest of theirs and had to redo my level 3 times due to one major bug of it.  The final time, I put so many hours of work into making my objects for this and when I went to make patterns, the pattern editor broke.  I tried everything short of backing up and reinstalling the game, but without files for it, I cannot back it up. I deleted the world and the game itself due to this, since I cannot even look at the game anymore.  I will recommend the game for playing, but if you want to use the editor, give it a year longer.  They shouldn't have made a contest on such a buggy editor, even though they warned us it is buggy, that just tells me that they are not professional with editors.","March 23, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game feels like a game similar to the likes of F-Zero, Wipeout, and Extreme-G only there are no other racers, just you and the setting sun. Which you can't ever catch. As soon as the game is started you're doomed to either collide with something or watch the sun set despite your best efforts, but it's very compelling to try again and see if you can get further. I highly recommend this game if you're even slightly interested, it's very easy to pick up and play. Combined with worlds that regenerate every day, a hard-mode world that lives up to the name Apocolypse, leaderboards, and player-built worlds, Race The Sun is a remarkable game that's perfect for those that want to go fast with a real sense of speed!","December 13, 2013","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I got it for free, (which was great) and I'm pretty satisfied. It's a nice relaxing game game, with no clear objective or storyline. The plot is that you are a solar-powered craft flying and the sun, which powers your craft, is setting. You can collect energy boosts that, for a split second, stop the sun from setting. The endless concept is not something new (at all), but this game is. Good graphics and ambience, and it kind of reminds me of an iPad game I have called Forever Drive (https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/forever-drive/id442923846?mt=8) which had futuristic graphics with an endless concept AND a map editor- a perfect replica, only race-themed.\n\nSo, conclusion: I'd recommend it, but not for it's full price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacetank/recommended/253030/","spacetank","SpaceTank","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacetank/","181 products in account","Race The Sun is a good game, and you can probably tell whether you'll like it by the screenshots and videos on the Steam page, but, in case you're not sure, allow me to elaborate.\n\nI think the goal of the game is fairly obvious, you need to race the sun with a solar-powered spacecraft. The theme is not just a gimmick though: since some obstacles in the game project shadows, you will sometimes not be able to see the sun, and that will slow you down, meaning that the sun will set faster in the horizon. Basically, every mistake you make has an immediate and tangible effect on the game.\n\nThe controls are tight and responsive, and the hitboxes seem logical and fair most of the time (if you die, it's most likely your fault and not the game's). Plus, the view distance is not infinite, but good enough for you to be able to spot obstacles and react to them in time.\n\nThe "real" goal of the game is to get as high of a score as possible by collecting "tris", which are basically score multipliers. For every five tris you get, your multiplier will go up by one, but if you bump sideways into something you lose one. You lose the game when you crash into an obstacle or if your craft's battery is depleted due to lack of exposure to direct sunlight.\n\nThere are some collectible items you can find as well, which can increase your speed temporarily, allow you to jump, skip the level or save you if you crash into something.\nA final thing to keep in mind is that there are some mini challenges that you need to complete in order to level up, which will, in turn, unlock collectibles, give you ship upgrades, a better starting multiplier, decals for your ship or make your existing upgrades better. I got to the maximum level in about 8 hours, but that's not where the game exhausts its content.\n\nIf you wish to keep playing, there are plenty of things to keep you occupied: first off, the main game's world is reset every 24 hours, which means you have some time to learn the various obstacles during the day, but you will get a new challenge after you're done with it.\n\nSecondly, there are two other modes, one that is a considerably more difficult version of the standard world and another one that is actually a beatable maze, which I found to be a really cool alternative take on the core gameplay.\n\nAnd, last but not least, you can find some special portals on the levels, and those portals will lead you to an "alternate universe", which is basically a user-created level. And yes, there is an editor, of course.\n\nThat's quite a bit of stuff for an indie game, right? Now, when it comes to the audiovisual aspects of the game, the graphics are really simple and streamlined (and, let's face it, somewhat outdated) but they have their charm, especially if you enjoy a "zen" sci-fi aesthetic.\nWhile the basic colors are gray, orange and white, the alternate worlds are much more varied and explosive in their visuals and can range from dying planets blowing up in front of you to star wars-esque space battles.\n\nThe game's music begins as a calm but focused tune which slowly ramps up in intensity as the sun goes down, finishing in a downright violent manner in the later levels. It might get a little tiring after a while, but I find it to be pleasant to listen to either way.\n\nI think that's it, if you like racing, obstacle courses or simply want a new indie game to kill a few minutes every day with, this is definitely a good and cost-efficient choice.","May 8, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

James is stranded because his son (from an inter-species relationship I guess??) got into a fight with his racing rival, and with a cry of "FALCOOOOON PUUUUUUNCH!" his starship was destroyed.\n\nFortunately, James finds a replacement very quickly thanks to the help of an eco-friendly scientist that has created a very fast spaceship, which McCloud needs in order to survive the harsh nights of this world because he hasn't had the chance to adapt to this new atmophere. The ship is fast, but its weakness is that it relies on solar energy. Further complicating matters, James McCloud has yet to completely adapt to the planet's atmosphere, thus he must Race The Sun if he has any chance of surviving for long enough to be transported to the next stage of the F-Zero Grand Prix.\n\nThe ship can be customized with several decals and augmentations. The augmentations allow James to Drive Faster, Jump, Obtain power-ups from further away, Warp several meters directly upward to avoid a collision, and store more instances of the jumping / collision-deterring power-ups. The decals are cosmetic, but you can pretend they make you go faster. There are also portals into worlds unknown on this planet: some lead to space, others lead to Underland, computer motherboards, or other trippy places for a mushroom samba experience like no other.\n\nJust watch out for crumbling buildings, mutant caterpillars and combat frogs, and drone airstrikes from the black queen's empire.\n\n<Vee's Rating> This is the best crossover of Star Fox, F-Zero, and Battletoads that I have ever played <3","February 7","true","9.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

I bought this game to enjoy some high-speed flying in an open world, but in farther regions of it I actually don't get that much enjoyment because of dense, hazardous, and unforgiving landscape that keeps me crashing into something. The landscape has patterns, of course, and those patterns can be more or less efficiently learned after several runs (thus allowing you to improve your performance), but even a slightest mistake imminently turns out to be fatal. The aircraft's ability to steer left and right does not really match its acceleration; sometimes I feel like I could use a bit more agility.\n\nThe gameplay itself is relatively simple; if you watched videos on the game's page in Steam store, then you've actually seen most of what it has to offer.\n\nIf you are happy to exercise your quick reaction and fast reflexes, then you will probably find this game involving and worthy of your money.

A Bit Slow Paced for A Fast Endless Runner.Genre: Minimalist Endless Racer\nDeveloped & Published by: Flippfly LLC\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux and iOS.\nBusiness Model: Cheaper Base Game + Single Optional DLC\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nAs it says on the store page, Race the Sun has you driving a solar craft across a vast, endless space filled with obstacles galore. Your only timer is a constantly setting sun that you must race towards. If the sun sets or you get caught in a long shadow for too long, the craft will run out of power and the race is over. Each world is separated by regions that get progressively harder as more objects and obstacles are thrown into your path. Within certain districts are portals to optional levels to change the pace up. Workshop support allows you to try out community created worlds though I found these got a little too difficult for my taste. There’s also a leveling system where you need to complete goals (given to you in a set of three) every time you race. Some are pretty generic with completing a certain amount of score or reaching a certain district while others can be overly difficult (do a barrel roll 20 times in a single try, yeah, still can’t accomplish that task). Additionally, your solar craft can be configured with different attachments and badges. These are unlocked as you level up and seem to be quality of life changes to your craft, not real game changers.\n\nIt’s a simplistic game where all you do is steer around objects and hit as many power ups (speed boosters and jump boosters are the most common) as you can. The high speed action takes some skill and split second decision making in order to be successful. Even then, you can easily get plastered against a wall for not reacting fast enough and that can get old fast. If there was a main complaint I’d have, it's that unlocks take way too long to get. Even after a couple of hours, I still haven’t gotten a single badge and there’s still more than half of the attachments left to unlock. There’s a constant sense of frustration at not getting much reward for making even the slightest amount of progress. I often got tired of doing the first region over and over again because I crashed on a simple rock at the beginning of the second region. I feel like there could be a better way of handling it but I have yet to see an endless runner do anything about it. Race the Sun does have procedurally generated levels but the structure is largely the same and all that really changes is what objects are in each district. RtS used to have daily challenges but they seem to have been patched out.\n\nPC Settings and Sunrise DLC\nA fairly decent set of options can be found in Race the Sun. There’s a large amount of resolutions to choose from with fullscreen on/off. A quality slider that vaguely goes from fantastic to fastest. Vsync can be enabled/disabled. There’s two audio sliders for effects and music. Both a keyboard and a controller can be used and both work equally well. The keys can be rebound with optional secondaries. The Linux version seems to work quite well too. Anti-aliasing seems tied into the quality slider. I never had any performance problems or crashing. Video and audio work well together in this game too.\n\nThe Sunrise DLC is for an optional world where there's no leaderboards, setting sun or optional objectives. It's ok but I kind of feel like its superfluous with multiple Workshop levels having the same rules. It at least looks quite pretty but I don't think $2 is worth pretty.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nRace the Sun has a good visual/audio design and it's one of the few endless runners I’ve run into that doesn’t try to waste your time with some nonsense business model. It's also a decently skillful runner too and has a good sense of speed, not dependent upon gimmicky controls or QTEs to slow you down. However, I find that the pacing is a little too long between unlocks. They can take far too long and too many runs to obtain and what you end up getting doesn't really change the game for the next hundred races. So, it can be a little too boring. If you’re ok with a repetitive endless run that isn’t looking to suck the money out of your wallet, Race the Sun is something to consider. Just don’t expect too much excitement and a lot of re-racing the first region.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","November 20, 2015","false","2.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","7"

Ill tell you why.\n\nPros:\nThe gameplay is very satisfying and the map is updated every day to provide a somewhat unique expirence.\n\nController support (Not a great game with keyboard)\n\n.....errr yeah...\n\nCons.\nFor some mind boggling reason they locked a lot of the mechanics behind some arbitrary achivement like challenges. The power ups and collectables and upgrades for your ship are all locked behind this. I almost quit the game after 10 minutes until I realized this as the game was very boring.\n\nThe whole Idea behind this is you have until the sun sets to get as far as you can. The only way to gain more time is by randomly placed yellow boost power ups. I dont like this. It means your runs are more luck based than skill. I would have prefered the blue 'score' pickups to have gained you more time instead.\n\nThat being said. There is only one game mode and one map. There is no story and no tutorial. It feels the game is lacking a large amount of content. There is a mod support but I cant be bothered to sort through all the mods to find some more maps to play. If the devs dont want to put in the effort then why should I?\n\nThe do update the map everyday to change it but the same assets are used... just moved around. So even though it is techniqually different, it feels the same.\n\nFinal thought\nThe gameplay that is there is very satisfying and fun. It's just a shame that that is all there is to it. I would love to see some actual content added here. If you see it on a sale go ahead and pick it up.","September 20, 2014","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The actual gameplay is a different factor, it can be VERY challenging in terms of actually making it far at least for me.\n\nThe obstacles you'll be facing start off very easy but then turn extremely challenging and a lot of the times very cheap. Especially playing through it the first time, you will not be able to predict how to dodge the objects which means this game forces you into death until you learn the patterns. This was a little bit of a let down only because I was looking forward to reaction time playing a role here not just guess and check.\n\nTo put it simple, you will die, you will die a lot. You will also try to avoid dieing but most of the time you'll have to do that in your second try.\n\nDoes this put a damper on the game play? To an extend yes, but it doesn't hurt the over all game. The game looks great, plays great and frankly has some awesome moments that remind me of Journey. I'm sure there will be quite a few people that will enjoy playing this game on and off between classes, work or on lazy days.\n\n8.0/10 if you pick up during a sale and 7.5/10 if you purchase it at full price. Although the game is fun either way I feel that it didn't quite live up to the initial hype, but we did get a solid product!","March 26, 2014","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It also has some interesting mechanics such as your ship's power comes from solar energy, meaning if you spend too long in the dark you won't even need to worry about crashing, you will come to a complete halt. There are also pickups that extend the time it takes for the sun to set helping you keep your sun energy high and I enjoyed this teeter-totter style play where I frequently shift my eyes all around the screen hunting for pickups while trying to concentrate on my ship and the obstacles ahead. The maps are also generated daily and this keeps the replayability levels quite high whether you play for a few runs a day or hours at a time.\n\nIn short: I'd rate it around a 7. The graphics are simplistic but quite plain at the beginning which doesn't really appeal to me.","January 25, 2015","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sound familiar?\n\nRace The Sun is a cute little pickup-and-play game where you're basically an Arwing solar powered polygon ship thing trying to see how long you can survive. The scoring is kind of like Space Harrier, where the points increase at a fast rate as you go on and pickups give you a bonus, but with multipliers. The visuals are nice to look at, you'll want a "watch" mode just to watch the ship fly around the area. The music is... "okay". It's forgettable but it's catchy and has a beat to it while you're playing. The game is simple. You avoid obstacles, pick up "Tris" which are little rings with triangular shapes in them, and picking up a set of them gives you x1 multiplier. The multiplier stacks up as you collect more sets. There's also other pickups but you unlock them as you level up. I like this approach. It's slow, easy and gives you a bit of an idea what the game is as you casually learn about the powerups instead of throwing them all at you with no explanation. The game has little tasks for you to fill out each play, in which you level up and unlock pickups and more stages as you complete them. Which is also nice. I only have a couple of problems with this game.\n\nFirst of all, I'm not sure but I think the game's trying to mock you. Saying how your "death was inevitable" and just discourages you through the game. I. ♥♥♥♥ing. Hate. This cliche. Remember in Portal, where the robotic voice of GLaDOS taunts you throughout the game? Remember how charming and hilarious she was? Well the charm wore off quickly. After this game released, I've seen way too many games try to do this and sound "cool", "edgy" or "funny." Both full retail games, indie games and flash games. It's getting annoying and it lacks originality. Second; (this one's minor) There's a lack of mod compatibility. Come on. I understand the game probably didn't have as high a budget as say, Team Fortress 2 or Skyrim, but for a game like this; Mods would be great. There's a section in the Steam Workshop for this game so why not? Custom music, at least?The game's files you can't read under normal circumstances and some of them being "File" types. I might be stupid but I've modded before. I can't be the only one who think's the Corneria theme from Star Fox on the SNES would fit perfectly.\n\nOverall the game is... okay. It's fun to pick up and play but after a short while you'll get bored of it quickly. I can see myself coming back every now and then but after a few deaths there's nothing else to see. For $10, you can get the original Half-Life. I'd wait for this game to go on sale before you pick it up. It's the same problem Nidhogg has.","September 1, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You race through a world that changes daily, dodging various obstacles: some that move, some that fall, some that tip over, some that race around, some that go over or under you, etc. The objective is to get as far as you can before the sun goes down or before you crash. The more challenges that you complete in game, the more upgrades you get that allow you to go further and further.\n\nDefinitely, a game worth trying; especially for a few bucks and to support inide development.\n9/10","April 18, 2014","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Don't go in for much more. Buuuuuuuuuut... It has a few things going for it that set it apart from its legion of competitors.\n\nFirstly, I love the visual style of this game. While they really could improve the pop-in at times, this game overall is incredibly striking and with the world being remixed every 24 hours you'll always have something new to see.\n\nSecondly, as I mentioned the world is refreshed every 24 hours. This gives variety and keeps you seeing new stuff in the same way most "runner" games do but having it refresh every 24 hours as opposed to after each death has a lot of appeal for me. It makes the leaderboards an even playing field with no-one reaching the top because they got a lucky world seed. It  also gives you a chance to learn the world a little without it being the same EVERY time you play. So every day you get a new chance to compete on an even playing field with new content which for me has been incredibly appealing.\n\nThe only issues I've run into are some pop-in problems at times with shadows propagating in front of objects that are yet to be visible. It's also very overpriced for a game of this type in my opinion. I got it on sale from GOG.com (the devs kindly provide a Steam key) and I would recommend waiting for a sale to purchase.\n\nThis is the first game that's ever gotten me to pay attention to leaderboards and try to be competitive (and the first time I've ever gotten into the top 1000 of a game, nevermind the heady heights of double digits I reached today). This game is head and shoulders above the others in it's genre and at the right price well worth a look.\n","December 14, 2013","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love games like that), but quickly upgrades, achievements, accelerated movement, compounding level complexity, and ever approaching impending doom (the setting sun) escalate and elevate things beyond the competition.\n\nThe game runs, as expected, incredibly smoothly on my i7 980x and GTX 680 at maximum settings and resolution. I suspect more modest systems would run it quite happily as well.\n\nThe graphics are a bit retro, but very clean and adequately appealing. Most importantly, it effectively conveys a sense of speed.\n\nIf you've never played any games in this genre (or happen to be a fan of them), Race The Sun is most akin to the Android game "SpeedX 3D", or the flash games "3D Missile Game" and its newer sibling "Accelerator".\n\nLinks to the mentioned games:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamelion.speedx3d\nhttp://missile-game.bwhmather.com/\nhttp://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/627313\n\nBottom line: If you like "infinite run" games, RTS is a winner even at full price, and a steal with the current Steam discount.\n","December 11, 2013","true","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It does well with its sun system, that will keep your vehicle moving if you go fast enough and keep the sun upgrades nearby at all times. It has some decent challenges, but the FOV at times can really make dodging things in an instant a bit heckling. It's a decent game, however I can't say if it's worth the price, since I got it for free on Day 1 launch. That's up to you to decide.\nThings to consider:\n-Do I want a game with replay value?\n-Do I want a game to boot up and play instantly when bored?\n-Do I not mind the price?\n-Does the workshop hold interest in me?\n\nIf you answered "Yes" to at least two of these, go ahead.\nOverall?: 8/10.

It does well with its sun system, that will keep your vehicle moving if you go fast enough and keep the sun upgrades nearby at all times. It has some decent challenges, but the FOV at times can really make dodging things in an instant a bit heckling. It's a decent game, however I can't say if it's worth the price, since I got it for free on Day 1 launch. That's up to you to decide.\nThings to consider:\n-Do I want a game with replay value?\n-Do I want a game to boot up and play instantly when bored?\n-Do I not mind the price?\n-Does the workshop hold interest in me?\n\nIf you answered "Yes" to at least two of these, go ahead.\nOverall?: 8/10.

There's also a leaderboard if you're in to that kind of thing. My biggest problem with the game is that I love the missions, and there aren't that many of them. I was able to do all the missions in about 2-3 hours. They have added three new offical maps since the release of the game, and none of them have changed the game too much.

Sound familiar?\n\nRace The Sun is a cute little pickup-and-play game where you're basically an Arwing solar powered polygon ship thing trying to see how long you can survive. The scoring is kind of like Space Harrier, where the points increase at a fast rate as you go on and pickups give you a bonus, but with multipliers. The visuals are nice to look at, you'll want a "watch" mode just to watch the ship fly around the area. The music is... "okay". It's forgettable but it's catchy and has a beat to it while you're playing. The game is simple. You avoid obstacles, pick up "Tris" which are little rings with triangular shapes in them, and picking up a set of them gives you x1 multiplier. The multiplier stacks up as you collect more sets. There's also other pickups but you unlock them as you level up. I like this approach. It's slow, easy and gives you a bit of an idea what the game is as you casually learn about the powerups instead of throwing them all at you with no explanation. The game has little tasks for you to fill out each play, in which you level up and unlock pickups and more stages as you complete them. Which is also nice. I only have a couple of problems with this game.\n\nFirst of all, I'm not sure but I think the game's trying to mock you. Saying how your "death was inevitable" and just discourages you through the game. I. ♥♥♥♥ing. Hate. This cliche. Remember in Portal, where the robotic voice of GLaDOS taunts you throughout the game? Remember how charming and hilarious she was? Well the charm wore off quickly. After this game released, I've seen way too many games try to do this and sound "cool", "edgy" or "funny." Both full retail games, indie games and flash games. It's getting annoying and it lacks originality. Second; (this one's minor) There's a lack of mod compatibility. Come on. I understand the game probably didn't have as high a budget as say, Team Fortress 2 or Skyrim, but for a game like this; Mods would be great. There's a section in the Steam Workshop for this game so why not? Custom music, at least?The game's files you can't read under normal circumstances and some of them being "File" types. I might be stupid but I've modded before. I can't be the only one who think's the Corneria theme from Star Fox on the SNES would fit perfectly.\n\nOverall the game is... okay. It's fun to pick up and play but after a short while you'll get bored of it quickly. I can see myself coming back every now and then but after a few deaths there's nothing else to see. For $10, you can get the original Half-Life. I'd wait for this game to go on sale before you pick it up. It's the same problem Nidhogg has.","September 1, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DazAttack/recommended/253030/","DazAttack","DazAttack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DazAttack/","421 products in account","Reminds me of the old 3D vector racing games, you simply have to continue on chasing that sun in the distance without hitting obstacles. It also has some interesting mechanics such as your ship's power comes from solar energy, meaning if you spend too long in the dark you won't even need to worry about crashing, you will come to a complete halt. There are also pickups that extend the time it takes for the sun to set helping you keep your sun energy high and I enjoyed this teeter-totter style play where I frequently shift my eyes all around the screen hunting for pickups while trying to concentrate on my ship and the obstacles ahead. The maps are also generated daily and this keeps the replayability levels quite high whether you play for a few runs a day or hours at a time.\n\nIn short: I'd rate it around a 7. The graphics are simplistic but quite plain at the beginning which doesn't really appeal to me.","January 25, 2015","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The "tasks" system is neat, I enjoyed doing them, but it's not enough to keep me playing the same section of map over and over. Maybe I'm approaching it the wrong way but a waypoint sytem, some alternate game modes (I guess there are some I can unlock that are fun but I'm not going to frustrate myself to get them), and a more responsive plane would do wonders for my enjoyment.

You always start at the beginning of the level (resets after 24 hours) so after a while you know where to go and to pick up your powerups. The races are fairly short but that makes you try it over and over again. Levelling up is also pretty ok as you get 3 goals to achieve and you have to get 4 goals to get to the next level. You then get additional stuff like the ability to jump or double jump, better multipliers and enhancements to your ship like magnets to pick up powerups. Pretty decently done and I definitely recommend the game to all!\n\nSo get it and race!","December 16, 2013","true","2.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/recommended/253030/","bahderb","Bah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/","2492 products in account","Very interesting concept and execution. The game is as described in its blurb on its store page. You're a spacecraft racing the sun. The game mechanics are similar to the now classic Bit.Trip.Runner, however this has more of a "rogue" element. When you die, you go right back to the beginning of the "run", so even if you've cleared 3 stages, you go back to the start. I've not logged a lot of time into this game yet, but I am finding it quite enjoyable and is definitely something I see myself coming back to for short bursts. The graphics and music are minimalist, but pleasing to the eye and ears.  It's already causing rage quits and if you're like me and enjoy torturing yourself with games like this, its definitely a worthwhile play. I can't suggest it at it's current $9.99 pricepoint, but if it appears in a bundle or goes on sale, its something you should consider if you enjoy these type of games. Another aspect that sets this apart is that the worlds are procedurally generated so the game changes all the time. Unlike the aforementioned Bit.Trip.Runner, memorization does not help you, you have to be quick and on your toes. I played with a 360 controller and found it to be the best way to control the ship.","July 8, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Although this game is technically a racing game, it barely fits the criteria for being in the genre. I've typically disliked most racing games, but this one is super fun. This game is very addictive and will make you tell yourself "just one more time, then I'm done" more times than you can count. In this game, you are, literally, racing the sun - when you stay in the dark for too long, you die. As the sun goes down, the shadows cast by the various objects become your worst enemy, making things increasingly difficult to survive. The developers implemented a leveling system, giving you access to several powerups and decals for your plane for completing various objectives - namely things like "score X amount of points" or "don't turn left through 1 region". Although basic, the leveling system adds a fun incentive for replayability. This game has been well-designed and I recommend buying it, even at full price. If you manage to find it on sale, then it is a steal.","December 27, 2013","true","17.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It gets tedious and boring after couple of hours. Music is bland, forgettable with no variation. Graphics are too simplistic. Controls have a heavy input lag (slightly gets better with an upgrade).\n\nThe way upgrades are given out is not really rewarding despite needing to complete challenges.

I'll be the first to say that my computer has a bunch of issues going on right now so it shouldn't be considered a standard, but I'm able to play Skyrim on low settings at an FPS of at least 30. That being said, I put the settings of this game to "fastest" (because even the MENU was laggy!) and I still couldn't play it because it kept freezing up like a rusty roller coaster. REALLY FAST FOR A SEC-- stop... OND THEN IT GOES AN-- stop... D STOPS.\nThis game has absolutely no business lagging the way it does. If it was a graphically intensive game I could understand that, but this game doesn't even have any textures, and some of it is in fact wire-frame. Duke Nukem 3D is more pleasing to look at and it's probably the most optimised game I own on this computer.\nI'm sure this game probably runs well for a lot of people, but I think it should run well for everyone considering how simplistic everything is. That IS the goal of this style, right? I understand a lot of people think this looks good, but for it to look like this AND play terribly makes it feel incredibly lazy. I'm glad I got this game for free; I would consider paying even just a couple cents too much.\nThis game is not recommended. Just play Star Fox for the Super Nintendo if you're in it for the style, or F-Zero if you're in it for the speed. Everything looks about the same, it feels better, and you'll actually be able to play it instead of trying to reverse engineer the damn thing to try to get it to function.","July 30, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Then you\'ll love this game! I was bored to tears within 15 minutes, and I\'ve tried the game a couple of times since then, but there simply isn\'t any content. Or rather, there is, but it\'s hidden behind a wall of perfection you will never see. Let me explain:\n\nRace The Sun is an infinite runner in the most vanilla sense of the genre. Press start > move left and right > get as many score multipliers as you can > run in to something or go too slow > repeat from the beginning. The problem with this model is that there is no progression; in a little over an hour of gameplay I\'ve seen Region 3 twice and, of course, Region 1 every single time I\'ve died (which must have been 60+ times). You will be bored to tears by Region 1, but you\'ll be forced to play it over, and over, and over again.\n\nThere is a levelling system, but it takes a ridiculously long time to level up, as they require events during the level that are down to pure luck as to whether you can pull them off. The levels may be \"procedurally generated\" to some degree, but you will the same chunks of obsticles over and over, and while the location may be different, the order is the same. The moment you make some progress and feel curiosity for the first time in a while, you\'ll die and get sent back to Repetition Land.

But the upside is that a new version of the level is procedurally generated every day.  This is refreshing feature that can make me come back to the game to test my reflex skills.\n\nI like the minimalist art style and that the level is broken down into several regions with increasing difficulty. What I don’t like is the simplicity of the gameplay; there needs to be more pick-ups, ship abilities and controller buttons to press.\n\nWith the Steam Workshop there might be some cool user levels to add variety.  But most people will get bored of this game quick, including me.  If you want to play this game you should wait for a bargain sale because you will probably only get a couple hours of fun.\n\nRace the Sun is a good game, but it’s one of those PC games best served on a tablet to pass the time.

On top of that, the text upon reaching an achievement is a nihilistic "meh, achievements suck anyway and you're stupid for caring about points" type of "humorous" text.\n\nI unlocked a harder game mode that has repeated the same ~20 seconds of level over and over. I believe it would repeat endlessly. Not appealing.\n\nSo it's still very beautiful and the controls feel nice, but there's not a lot of game behind it.","April 26, 2015","false","1.5"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","6","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epolekoff/recommended/253030/","epolekoff","Polar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epolekoff/","226 products in account","I wanted to like this game. I really did. It just feels lacking in too many areas for me to recommend.\n\nMy first complaint is how slow the game feels. Right off the bat you might think I'm crazy as the game seems to make you think it's all about speed. However, the slow, drifty turning, the painful wait times between regions and the floatiness in the air seems to slow the game down dramatically. Try playing something like Super Hexagon, which has very snappy, precise controls and you'll see what I mean. The worst contributor to the pace of the game, though, is the time it takes between dying and starting a new game. Everything about this game tells me it's trying to be a fast, addictive game that players can lose themselves in for hours on end. When I die, I should immediately be playing again in less than 1 second. The way it is now, the game shows a death animation for a second, then shows the score screen with some achievements for another second, then goes to an intro screen with a quote that is displayed long enough to read, the player swoops in, then there is still a few seconds before the player reaches any obstacles they need to avoid. Most of this could be cut out and the game would be so much more playable!\n\nThe game doesn't have many new interestng mechanics, either. Tiny Wings (another achievement-based arcade game with a near-identical plot) had it's physics-based jumping mechanic. Time Surfers added to the Tiny Wings formula by adding the time-reversing mechanic. This just feels like a driftier, slower, blander version of cubefield, a flash game made 4 years ago. The only new idea I haven't seen anywhere else is the mechanic where flying in shadows slows you down, which is essentially adding extra danger to the already-existing obstacles instead of introducing something new for the player to actively do. Everything else in the game seems to be following the achievement-based mobile game formula.\n\nI'm typically a gameplay-focused guy who doesn't care about visuals or sound, but I found them getting in the way of my enjoyment of this game. I understand the developers were going for a minimalist look, only using colors for pickups, but the environment just comes off as bland and unattractive. It just looks like default diffuse Unity shaders. The lighting effects where the shadows grow longer as the sun goes down is a neat mechanic that combines the art/environment with the gameplay, but it also highlights another problem: the draw distance. I often ran into situations where large objects would pop into view way later than I should have been able to see them, especially after the sun was starting to set. Again, I understand that the game is supposed to become more challenging as the sun is setting, making it harder for the player to see and making the game more tense as a result. However, I only felt cheated as I couldn't tell the distance between an unavoidable horizontal object that popped in too late and a shadow. Adding color to the environment would probably have helped this immensely, but instead the gray of the objects and the gray of the shadows just blend together too much.\n\nMoving into sound, I was turned off by the music after only a few playthroughs. Every game plays the exact same song! The little jingle that plays when you beat a region is, in my opinion, very annoying and even now I hear it ringing in my ears. Looking at Super Hexagon again, there were 2 songs for each of the "3" difficulties and the starting point in each song was moved around so they sounded different each time you played. It sounded like there was a lot more variation then there was, adding extra life to the already amazing soundtrack. This game's song started off kind of flat and its repetition only made worse over time.\n\nGoing back to mechanics, I want to discuss the procedural generation. I think part of the pitch for this game was to have a new procedurally generated level every day so players can compete for the top score on that specific level. When the next day comes around, the winner of the top score for the previous day will remain the victor for eternity and everyone gets to compete again on a new level from a clean slate. This concept sounds very interesting and I commend the developers for trying it, but I don't think it worked in practice. If this is a skill/reflex based game, the level layout doesn't really have all that much to do with the score. Sure, if the level was the same every time, professionals would quickly figure out the optimal path and only minute changes would allow a player to come out on top, setting the new best path. Supposedly, having a new level each day is setting up a similar scenario without giving players enough time to memorize the difinitive best path. Furthermore, since the games can become very long, stretching up to 10+ regions in a row, the number of paths increases exponentially to a ridiculous number as the game goes on. Does memorizing the optimal path in the first region really give the player an edge after surviving 10 regions in a row? Is it even possible to memorize the optimal path through the first 5 regions and remember your score after each one to see if that path was really optimal? Is there a point in doing so if the game is going to reset in a day anyway? What I'm getting at here that I don't see the point in keeping the level the same each day. I would rather have  each level procedurally generated every time I start a new game. It's supposed to be skill based anyway, right? The players who are most skilled will probably be at the top of the leaderboard each day anyway, so why not just procedurally generate each run and reset the scores every day. The chance of generating an "easier" level and giving a player an easier chance of getting a high score isn't very likely with all of the possible variation and it would all be balanced out over multiple plays anyway. At my low skill level where I'm dying consistently in Region 3, I get very sick of seeing the same starting point of Region 1 over and over. I have very little interest in improving my skills when the game starts off the same way every single time. It's like starting over at World 1-1 of Mario every time you die; it's so easy but I have to sit through the same thing to get to the interesting parts.\n\nI didn't get through enough of the game to get more customization options than the magnet, so there is probably a LOT more depth to the game I am missing. Unfortunately the game has not held my interest to get me up to that point. It's such a shame; I was very excited for this game as an avid fan of fast, level/achievement-based arcade games (Time Surfers, Tiny Wings, Super Hexagon to a degree, Temple Run, Jetpack Joyride, etc). I'll try it for a bit longer, but as of right now I can't recommend this game.","September 22, 2014","false","1.4"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"
