"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/376770/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Big Thinkers 1st Grade is a game for kids of 6-7 years old. In it, you have a brother and a sister that can tranform themselves in many things and that are explaining the games and encouraging kids. Ben and Becky are searching for Smart Stars around their house. And these can be obtained by playing minigames.\n\nEach minigame is covering a field: for example, in the living room, kids can express themselves through an art activity while in the library, they can practice their geography without forgetting the time telling in the kitchen. Each activity met with success will be rewarded with Smart Stars that can be used for a challenge. Some minigames, like the time telling, have different difficulties: it can be more objects or thougher questions.\n\nThe games are really varied and use mechanics that you still find today in educational applications. So, yeah, I do think that Big Thinkers 1st Grade can be still in use nowadays. However, what may be a little hard to get past at is the graphics. What will follow is pasted from my review of Big Thinkers Kindergarten.\n\nNot that I mind old graphics, as you know. After all, I began playing with Super Mario Bros and Doom II triggered a real passion. But some of them aren't aging well. Big Thinkers is among them. It's like seeing an old cartoon. True, back then, these were frequent in the adventure genre. However, today, it seems not at all clear. There are many information on the screen that it's nearly making you scream that it's not user-friendly. I understand that the education behind is probably the main reason but I don't care about words like Pantry or Rightly, though I suppose that for the kids, it's showing them something that is obvious for the adult.\n\nAnyway, you can interact with nearly everything, as far as your cursor is a white arrow. As an adult, it can seem to be too much but for a kid, it's amusing. Myself, I got intrigued by what can happen.\n\nIf I have to say something for the soundtrack, it's correct. It's more the voice acting that is a pain in my ears, mainly Ben's voice. I'm always under the impression that he tries to be louder than Becky.\n\nBig Thinkers is in English. Total English. I don't know if there were any translated version because it would have been interesting for the other languages. If as a teacher or a parent, you have no problem in English as second language, you can guide your kid in the game. If some activities can be easy to understand, like the art or music activity, self-explanatory or like the money one where you can guess that you need to pay items, others require knowledge of English vocabulary - it's nicer to understand the stories that the kid is imagining or the questions in geography. Anyway, 10 activities can be played by non-English speaking children.\n\nBig Thinkers 1st Grade is a good educational game, whether for the classroom or for home. The graphics may have aged not so well but the rest is still "modern".\n\nAh and if you don't manage to find how to exit the game, put your mouse at the bottom of the screen, the menu should appear. It's sad that there is nothing to indicate it though.","March 1","true","2.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

He absolutely loved it, Very fun and stimulating for children at that age with small in game rewards for completing assignments/objectives to keep them motivated.\nI have pretty low end-medium laptop as its not even a gaming laptop and it runs the game with no problem.\nI got it on sale for $4-5, But after having played it myself and with my brother i would recommend buying it even at full retail which was $7.\nHumongous Entertainment if you are reading this I  wish you would come out with more of these games for higher grade levels. at least until 5th grade.\n\nOne of the best parts of this experience is seeing the little ones get so excited to play this game and go for more smart stars.","April 5","true","9.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

Never has acquiring "smart stars" been a more thrilling experience. Graphics: off the charts good, this is straight up pixel magic people. Gameplay: outstanding, mechanics are super solid and allow for really intense moments of puzzle solving. Its almost better than the first one, but i couldnt figure out how to change color on the painting game so i was forced to rate it slightly lower. Buy this game and play it with everyone you know.","November 6, 2015","true","0.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","67","8","12","13","0"

The concept and scenario are the same except the mini games are different. But since the game takes place at the same location it can easily be mistaken for the first game. So in other words there is nothing new to provide in this installment. All of the other Humongous Games did different scenarios for their sequals so it makes you wonder why this one didn't do the same. Originally there was meant to be a second grade level sequal, but it was scrapped when these games proved to be too ambitous for what they're worth. Which is fine cause I didn't expect there to be anymore than a fourth level game. Overall the game isn't bad to play but I'd rather play the Pajama Sam games instead.","March 25","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
