Then there's pointless movie sequences which are falsely advertised in the screenhots and video to look like in-game graphics, which are also by the way not skippable. The storyline is boring, pointless and interrupts the little gameplay the game actually has.\n\nAs for gameplay, you begin with a SMUP with more mechanics that are less obvious than a standard Bullet Hell game. Each time I played it, I discovered a new button or mechanic for a level that takes about 30 seconds to complete.\n\nOnce you beat it, you are put straight into the most boring and confusing tree game. I have no understanding for the ratios on the right, what the lightning is or coming from, when the fruit will spawn if i must avoid the fire sprites or the are. Before you have even discovered the mechanics, you're into the next level.\n\nAnd before you know it you're back into the same SMUP Bullet Hell game again with and even easier boss than the first one because the Graze mechanic is too easy to use....\n\nThen you get back to the tree level and angrily will quit the game. You try to give the game another go later on, but when you see the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing 10 second intro and refund the game.\n\nThe bongo-man can eat my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.","February 23","false","0.3"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","37","41","6","0"

That say 'The Bibble'.  YOU QUESTION THE WORDS OF THE MIGHTY JIMMY?!?!")\n\n(This game was provided by Indiegala.  Thanks, guys...but stop sending me crap!)\n\nI was wondering why most negative reviews weren't really talking about the game...well, that's kinda' what I set out to find.  The negative score is there for a reason and it's not just the bible-thumping.   The intermissions between stages are really ugly, too.  Whether it's CD-I pictures or SEGA CD videos that serve no purpose... Of course, let's  not forget the weird bongo-drumming, fedora-wearing neckbeard.  (Seriously, they put that in...)\n\nYou have 4 phases of gameplay, but I've only seen 2.  On Boss 4 and 5 I end up losing and I've pretty much given up.  There's apparently some puzzle phase and some R-Type gameplay phase, but I haven't gotten to them myself.\n\n\nPROS:\n+ Well, the graphics seem decent...\n+ If you got this game for free, then you can grind for cards\n\nCONS:\n- Bible-thumping on Steam\n- Difficult Danmaku sequences\n- What's with this game's obsession with fruits?!\n- No continue button  (You MUST OCC it or it's gameover)\n\n\nOverall?  Bad game.  Another one for the sh*t pile.  Because I can't beat it, I can't really call this "fun".  The only thing "interesting" about this title is the trailer.
