It basically plays as a Bioware game (Mass Effect, Dragon Age, etc.) without the combat and item management elements.  You walk around an enviroment talking to people, picking up quests, and making decisions.  You switch to playing various characters thoughout the story, which allows you to see the complicated state of affairs from different sides as the story unfolds.\n\nThe story is pretty good, and I liked how it constantly pits you up against morally ambiguous dilemmas.  More than once I actually found myself questioning the principles I had chosen to stand by.  I was engaged in the dialogue pretty much the whole time, even when speaking to side characters who didn't contribute much to the story.\n\nI think, in the end, I just expected more from the game.  There's a lot of build up with not a lot of payoff, and a lot of things that I expected to matter just didn't matter at all in the end.  Most of the choices you make don't come back to you, longterm, in any way.  I doubt that this would be different with a different playthrough, the game is just too short.  Characters will aquire traits based on the decisions you make, but these don't seem to have any effect on subsequent dialogue or decisions.  They're badges, basically.  The opinion, admiration, and fear you get with characters through dialogue doesn't seem to affect dialogue or decisions either, and it doesn't come back to haunt you or help you later on.  Most characters don't get more than one playthough, so you don't get to follow up on their story.  As it stands, I can only get but so emotionally invested in them.\n\nFor what it is, this game can still be fun for the right kind of person, and I'm happy to support games like this as they have so much potential.  I can see myself recommending it to a few people I know, but knowing what I know now, I doubt I would have bought it for myself.","July 27, 2014","false","4.9"," 150 of 172 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","150","172","0","0"

The game is heavily text-based, so be wary of that before purchasing, it's not your typical modern RPG.\n\nThe closest thing I can compare it to is Heavy Rain. And that's a good thing. You have a lot of freedom within the choices you make and all of those choices can have heavy consequences. You play as multiple characters, and you can see the effects your choices from one character has on another, albeit never directly interacting.\n\nThe main game took a good 2 or so hours to complete, however with the amount of branching dialogue choices and I imagine endings too, that's pretty impressive. There's a lot of replayability here, especially with the mod support.\n\nClosing words would just be to try the demo, it's there for a reason. If you like what you see, then the game will deliver!","July 23, 2014","true","1.7"," 83 of 100 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","83","100","0","1"

You have a priest which has to decide between idealism and beiing a father to his kids/ a daughter between following the path her parents choose for her or striving for freedom and so on.\n\n\nIt´s hard to categorize the game.. maybe a mix of adventure and visual novel, for an rpg, there is a bit too few interaction imo. You have an inventory but rarely use it, the same for the characteristics your actual character develops.. they are more for story than doing anything.\n\nAs a warning for everyone, Unrest has no remarkeable graphics, and the sounds/music are, while quite nice, not that various.\nAlso as mentioned you have to read through the whole game and just choose how your actual character will response. This may be too boring for many people, but i enjoyed the storyline and the concept.\nAlso the writing is good enough to carry you through the story.\n\nLast but not least the game is not very long.. you can complete it in about three hours and while the end is a bit sudden, you get enough disclosure.\n\nSo maybe check the demo first or wait for a sale, but i liked it and would glady see more from the developers.","July 30, 2014","true","3.9"," 64 of 75 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","64","75","0","2"

Doesn't hurt to know that before, because half an hour into the game you'll just forget that fact.\n\nI went in without much of an expectation and ended up absolutely loving every minute of it. Great story, beautiful writing, a LOT of freedom to shape the characters personalities and their fate. Best of all: the ambiguity and inherent realism of this fantasy. Do not expect a conventional good vs evil epic. Or even better: expect it ;)\n\nIf you're infuriated by the rather unsatisfying end, do a little research about what the developers had in mind artistically and judge then. It is a matter for debate still and seems much less thought through than the rest of the game, but I get their idea. Unfortunately it reduces the motivation to replay a little. Also on the downside: Ingame movement could be a lot faster, I came to loathe staircases, because they slow you down like you're wading through a swamp. Having to stand in certain spots before being able to talk to someone got on my nerves too. But these are minor issues.\n\nClear recommendation to buy.

You can also move around the map outside of dialogue. This is how the game plays and some people may not find that fun. I, personally, did enjoy this system. I didn't want fancy mechanics, I wanted a story and this system was a brilliant way of doing that.\n\nThrough the duration of the game you will play a handful of different characters at different sections in the story. The story is broken up into several scenes and you will play one character until it is finished at which point both the scene and the character you play will change. And, unless the character is Asha (the princess of the human kingdom), you will never play as them again.\nThe way you end the scene, and the things you do during it, will effect future scenes in what characters appear (I have only noticed one instance of this but there are probably more) and characters will reffer to what your character did. For example you can run away from your marriage as a peasant girl in a farm village and the owner of the farm will mention that she has had trouble with a peasant running away in a later scene.\nThere are alot of examples of this that I could give which is wonderful. I love feeling that my choices mattered.\n\nHowever I didn't get that feeling. I once tried to refuse to do something as one of the characters and the game pretty much said, "It is plot essential that you don't refuse so you did it anyway." In a game like this having control taken away from your character is pretty much the worse thing you could do.\nThe core selling point of this game is that the choices you do matter and if the moment you try to do something that will significantly alter the narrative of the story the game takes away your choices and forces you down a path then something has gone wrong.\nThe amount that your actions affected the world would be sufficient for a more combat-oriented game (in fact I would love it there) as the subtle strokes are so nice sometimes. But for this game it doesn't cut it.\n\nBut perhaps the worst feature of this game, the one that made me hate this game, was the lack of a suitable ending. In fact I thought I was still playing the game (the ending is done through dialogue between your character and another) and then it cut to credits. In this ending I learnt almost nothing about anything but the fact there is still tension between the humans and the naga; in every 'ending' that I got. (Even in my most naga-friendly playthrough it said, "The naga army may march on the humans." or something similar)\n\nTo summarize:\nIt was a neat idea about civil unrest and allowing you to play as characters who influence the story but I felt as though I had little impact on the narrative.\nThere was no closure on the stories of any of the characters (except for maybe Asha; but even then it is still weak) and I felt punished for being invested in them.\nAnd the 'ending' was poorly executed and uninformative.","October 16, 2014","false","3.1"," 50 of 59 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","50","59","0","1"

The storyline seems to be pretty fluid, changing in the most subtle nuances depending on your choices - definitely warranting at least a few playthroughs. After playing the extreme let-down known as Postmortem, Unrest really, really satisfied my consequence-based gameplay hunger. The music and sounds are very good, and I left the audio on for the entirety of my playthrough.\n\nThe controls are very simple, you mostly walk around and converse with different people. There are maybe one or two combat instances, which are also easy to play through. There isn't really a tutorial, however, learning the mechanics of the game is not challenging; the learning curve is minimal to moderate. Understanding and realizing the consequences of your actions, however, may take some time (and even one or two playthroughs).\n\nSomething that really interested me was the pacing of the game - as you develop a connection with your character (I am a very immersion-oriented gamer), you will find yourself put into the perspective of a new person as the story progresses to critical moments. As a psychology research assistant, one theme my lab likes to look at is bias - and something very, very interesting is experiencing the biases as you jump from character to character. I try to play RPGs as true to how I believe I would act (meaning I usually go for evil playthroughs first), but as I jumped to different perspectives, making decisions became very difficult, knowing that the consequences would most likely affect the very first character I played as. When I realized playing this way would be difficult if I did it for each playable character, I decided to take a different approach - I made a backstory for each character and played them using those stories as references. This made the experience much more enjoyable. Eventually, I also had to pick which characters were my "main" or favorite characters. This game made me better appreciate how George R. R. Martin, the author of A Song of Ice and Fire series (Game of Thrones), must feel when deciding which characters to kill/make miserable.\n\nThe different character POVs allows you to really get a more complete scope of the overarching story, and the presentation of everything is refreshing and well-done. Overall, a satisfying experience if you are the least bit interested in this type of gameplay.\n\nIf you enjoy consequence/decision trees and story-driven games, you must give this game a try.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","November 12, 2014","true","3.2"," 49 of 58 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","49","58","0","0"

You play vignettes in the lives of multiple characters, from a member of the royal family to a mercenary leader to a young peasant girl. Each story is short but interconnected with the others, and things that you've done as one character may come back to bite you while you're playing as another character. All of the characters feel like individuals, even the ones with only a few lines of dialogue, and the problems that these people are having don't have any easy solutions. Your characters gain "traits" based on how you play them. I don't think these traits actually do anything, but it was interesting to see them pop up because I felt like I was shaping who that this character was going to be from then on.\n\nA full playthrough is relatively short (my first playthrough took two hours) though dependent on your reading speed, but there are so many choices to make that you'll want to replay it to see what you could have done differently.\n\nThe only complaints I have are small ones. I wish there was a tutorial or practice mode for the combat, I had a character die because I couldn't figure out how to turn him to face his assailant until it was too late. I also felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. It just cuts right from the final conversation to the credits and I was expecting a bit more. At the same time, I'm satisfied with how the playthrough turned out and I feel like the story had resolution, so it's not a huge complaint.","July 24, 2014","true","10.2"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","37","44","0","0"

There's no real white and black morality here, even the bad guys have sympathetic reasons or personalities that are completely disarming compared to what the game sneakily builds upon. Choices are impactful, some have consequences that are visable, others do not and are left for the player to think about. There's a wide variety of colourful characters, and the world here is bleak and despondant.\n\nThat said, it is a short game (2 hours) and very dialog heavy. Those who hate roleplaying and dialog/story, should probably avoid picking this up at all.

Really, it's little more than a choose your own adventure game with an overworld in each of the individual sections. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it is definitely NOT an rpg by most modern standards.\n\nBeyond that personal peeve of mine, the dialogue and the story itself, at least at the start, are fairly interesting and captivating, painting a unique picture about the current state of the world and the troubles it's going through.

Only very small details can be changed, but the overall story will remain the same no matter what choices are made.\n\nDespite its flaws, the game's choices are still good to have, because they cause the player to question their morals a bit. There are people who want to help others and there are those who don't. The former have the more taxing decisions to make, because sometimes it isn't clear how to help people  most efficiently.\n\nBecause the story changes perceptions from one character to the next, the player gets to see various different sides to the story, not just one character's point of view. The player could hate the sound of a character they've heard about, then later end up liking them because new information has come to light.

While the story itself is no longer than ~3 hours I have to say it was worth every cent I paid for it. On today's standards the graphics are dated, that goes without a question for an indie game, but they are well presented and give good atmosphere to the game. Honestly thought I do think thanks to how they are presented to a player they are able to stand test of time better than the most of 3D games.\n\nWhile this game is labeled as an RPG this game is quite different from what people these days associate with the term which is honestly quite refreshing change. This game is not combat centrict and instead relies on dialogue and story to grap the player's interest. This said this game is not for everybody, even among RPG fans, since this game holds very little action within it and is more thought provoking than the most grind-fest action RPGs these days offer. Just as the game's description said; you are not some proficied hero to bring peace over the land. While you take role of different people over course of the game that doesn't change. You are a mortal whom can die and in combat death is very realistic outcome.\n\nThrough my playthough I only had one game halting bug occur to me and it was easily fixed by editing the save game file, and the game dev supplied me with necessary information to do the fix. Also this bug should have been fixed with the patch.\n\nOnly thing I would have wished from the game was to be a bit longer but if it was longer I wonder if it would have outstayed its welcome.

Unrest is not just "another one", I'll even go as far as to compare this to the Walking Dead game from Telltale. If you're looking for a real RPG that focus on narrative instead of combat you should just get this one right away.\n\nUnlike most RPGs Unrest doesn't let you create a character to your liking, instead it lets you play as multiple ones such as a peasant girl, a priest, a slum inhabitant, an ambassador from a mighty empire and a mercenary captain. You play all these characters in Bimhra, which to my understanding is a city located in a fictional ancient India.\n\nLike I've mentioned previously, Unrest focuses on a narrative driven experience based around dialogue with NPCs. The dialogue is what makes the game in this case, the writing is fairly good however I felt like the English translation was abit off and I noticed some letters missing every here and there but nothing that really stops you from understanding what the game is trying to tell you. The dialogue basicly works like most RPGs such as Mass Effect and likewise, each NPC you encounter in the game will react different from another depending on which dialogue options you choose. The choices are presented in a single sentece and each one of them has like a "title" or an indicator, if you prefer, that helps you better understand if you're being "hard" or "naive" or "sarcastic", things like that.\n\nYou can pretty much be who you want with any of the characters, when playing as peasant girl you can be harsh on people or caring and nice, it's up to you, the game lets you play as you wish. However, playing in a certain way will have it's consequences. I'm pretty sure I can't explain to you how it works by giving you an exact example because that will spoil the story. Just think like this "If I do X with one character it will have X effect later on." and this creates room for some replayability if you wish to go back after beating the game and take other choices other than the ones you took on your first playthrough. It's also worth noting that some of these playable characters know each other and sometimes saying something with another character will affect another one. Usually, between the transition from one character to another some time passes by, if I recall correctly it's usually a few months so very often things in the world will be abit different from the time you played with the last character.\n\nIn other words the game lets you roleplay by choosing what your character says to someone and different choices will lead to different outcomes that can completely change the plot.\n\nUpon talking with different people you'll unlock lore in your Journal which contains various types of information ranging from the story behind a certain location or information about someone vital to your quest.\n\nVisually the environments look absolutely gorgeous but I really don't like the way the character models look and how the walking animations look. It's also worth noting that the music in the game does a really great job, right when the music kicked in I could feel myself lost somewhere in India.\n\nIf you're not really sure about this one just download the demo and give it a try. There's no way I can't possibly not recommend Unrest, if you're into narrative driven games or RPGs that focus on storytelling rather than combat or customization, Unrest is a game you should get your hands on!\n\nIf you're looking for good reviews, consider joining Good Games Giveaways & Reviews group.

This is strictly made for people who like to read an immerse themselves into the plot of a story.\n\nThe music is incredible and fits the scenarios very well. My one gripe with this game is your choices affect how the character you happen to be playing at any given time is perceived... but it does not really affect the plot overall. Hell, even if you murder the evil snake hating priest guy, the story ends up exactly the same. There are no different endings, only different ways to complete each chapter.

There is a LOT in this game that is unpolished, and much of what makes the game interesting involves multiple playthroughs, or some save-slot shenaniganery to see how your choices actually change the story. Play through it only once, start to finish, and there will be a lot of questions left unanswered.\n\nParticularly jarring are the transitions between game sections. When you finish a part, usually you'll get a text box to pop up that sums up what effects your actions have before moving on to the next scene, and often a new character, which is not unexpected. This is a text-based adventure game. But there's nothing else at the moment. At the very least I was expecting the background to fade to black, and the music to change to reflect the action that's now happening, even if we can't see it. But there's none of that, which felt extremely strange.\n\nOn a positive note, the setting is gorgeous for such a simple adventure game, the music (while a bit repetitive) is very atmospheric, and the characters are all well written and realized. If you can get into the game, it offers you some gut-wrenching choices to make.\n\nWhether its worth $15 to you is completely subjective. But if it looks interesting to you, give it a look. Hopefully the folks at Pyrodactyl keep working and adding things to it, and I can give it a whole-hearted recommendation in the future.\n\nEdit: I have run through the game again since they updated it, and the transitions are handled better. Consider that complaint solved.","July 26, 2014","true","4.0"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDigitalGamer/recommended/292400/","TheDigitalGamer","TheDigitalGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDigitalGamer/","54 products in account","Set in India in a fictional universe you follow the struggle of a selection of characters all trying to make their way in a world that is crumbling around them.\n\nAs soon as the game begins you feel a sense of importance that other games can only dream of recreating. Full of the sensation that every decision, no matter how trivial it may first appear, could bring dire consequences. Whilst playing the game you take control of a diverse cast of characters from the highest of royals down to the lowest of peasants. From the off you have decisions to make, each of which can affect how the person you are speaking to, or even the entire city will view you. You are very conscious of this and it quickly becomes something that weighs down on your mind whilst conversing with the ensemble of NPCs in the universe.\n\nI approached this game with the thought that I wouldn't get sucked in, I would be rational and logical and beat the game easily, uncovering all of the "best" outcomes for my characters. I soon learned how foolish I was. I ended up with quite a few VERY bad outcomes from what appeared to be good decisions at the time due to my lack of consideration of effects it may have even though at the time I had thought I considered all of my options. Just as an example of how these decisions can really affect you, here are some of the things that happened to me from some trivial decisions, don't worry I'll refrain from spoilers. I got mugged, I nearly got killed for going on a walk (I mean come on, it's a walk!), I nearly got murdered by my own family (how lovely of them) and I murdered someone out of the blue! Yeah exactly, crazy right?\n\nWhen conversing with people, unlike other games you aren't just skipping through text to try and get to the end as quickly as possible so you can continue to run around, you are analysing everything about the situation, is this person a threat to you? Do they have a weapon? Are they as loyal as they say they are? Would it be worth standing up to them now or biding your time? One thing that makes this more difficult is how every person seems to have an individual personality and will react differently to situations, so you can't just walk through the game by being "nice". Some people are political and will walk rings around you unless you choose your words carefully and consider hidden subtext behind what is being said, others are more upfront and prefer you to be honest and direct, a difficult line to walk when you don't know which people fall into which category! As I found out they don't have to be noble to be silver tongued.\n\nGraphically this game has a simple but beautiful art style, it's a very pleasant place to explore with continuity throughout. Generally the game flows nicely and environments represent the areas that they are designed to depict.\n\nThe music on this game is actually one of my favourite things, although it follows the same style throughout the game, it never gets tedious and is actually really nice to listen to whilst you are playing. It's light and happy when it needs to be but it is equally tense and suspenseful when required, providing the perfect backdrop for the emotional rollercoaster that you are riding. My only small negative however is there seems to be a large lack of sound effects and I couldn't help but feel that a lot of scenarios and situations would have benefited much more with a little bit more audio work.\n\nIn summary Unrest is a truly outstanding game, holding a huge appeal with its depth and emotional attachment it doesn't suck you in with cheap gimmicks it has true substance. You feel as though you are truly part of your characters lives by forcing you to sit back and consider your options at every turn. If you want to run around spraying at 12 year olds online then this game isn't for you, however if you want play a real game that can only be described as an artful then I would download this immediately. You will be amazed at how quickly you will be absorbed into this diverse world, full of substance and insecurities. Just remember this, decide wisely!\n\nThe Digital Gamer\n","July 29, 2014","true","2.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Play through a rebellion in a vaguely Indian medieval kingdom, having to deal with famine, racial tensions with the neighboring Naga empire, and plenty of corruption and backstabbing.  It's all neatly broken up into short segments, so you won't spend a lot of time backtracking, and most segments have different viewpoint characters, so you see the chaos from all sides and it's pretty easy to put down and pick back up again.\n\nAs far as cons go, though...  I wish the interface was programmed a little more smoothly, and that the walk speed was a bit higher and didn't slow down on stairs or at strange angles.   I also wish you didn't have to be standing on top of an NPC to talk to them -- having a larger radius for that, or a "auto-walk to within range and immediately start up the conversation"  option would be a blessing.\n\nOverall, the implementation is a little bit rough, but I'll be playing it through a few times to see what other endings are like.  I also find it to be a pleasant surprise when a fantasy game reasonably portrays/imitates a culture other than medieval Europe or Japan.","July 6, 2015","true","3.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","3"

With such a low budget, I think the aesthetic was still surprisingly consistent and I think the game looked quite pretty. As a lot of people pointed out the ending was a bummer: the real worth of this game lies in exploring the world and forming opinions and not in following a linear story but even then it was sort of disappointing. If these people had a bigger budget they could make some truly amazing narrative-focused games.\n\nThis is definitely something worth checking out if you're like me and play BioWare games solely for the story.

The game is set in a fantasy Indian kingdom and that is something not seen very often in entertainment (at least not what enters the western world). The choices you make are very heavy handed and change how the game plays out. Users who play adventure games regularly will likely know what to expect from your typical adventure game.\n\nThis is not that adventure game. From the beginning you get given tough choices. Not everything ends well and sometimes there are no winners. It is worth going in knowing this, that sometimes problems don't have easy solutions and there is no hero that will rise to save the day. The game is fairly text heavy, in that the story is told through character dialog, and background information provided by the in game index, but if you enjoy fantasy games you will likely tolerate the text. The art is colourful and charming in a low-budget way.  While the narrative is broadly contiguous it is told in chunks, through individual characters and is best played through in a timely manner so no details are forgotten between "chapters".\n\nPros:\n\n+ A unique fantasy setting.\n+ Excellent art direction.\n+ Thought provoking narrative.\n\nCons:\n\n- Text heavy.\n- Short, expect 4-7 hours.","August 24, 2015","true","96.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

It cleverly has you playing a variety of characters on different sides of the unrest, making what appear at first to be black and white issues to be complicated dilemmas.\n\nGames are usually about feeling powerful. The characters you play in Unrest are often powerless, or struggling to make a difference. It's taken me just over 3 hours to complete, and in that time I've felt helpless, I've made decisions I've regretted, and I've done things against my will for the sake of others.\n\nIt did end suddenly, but in a way it fits with the game that there's no definitive conclusion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/veryfewnuts/recommended/292400/","veryfewnuts","VeryFewNuts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/veryfewnuts/","107 products in account","As of now, I have yet to decide whether Unrest is overly-ambitious and underfunded or just a poorly executed concept. The game suffers from superficiality in every aspest of not only the story, but also the game mechanics and setting. To better explain this, I will go through the Key Features listed on the store page.\n\nDiverse Characters - Right off the bat, the game begins throwing you from character to character, offering a short few paragraphs to tell the character's backstory up until that point. At your leisure you might also be interested in reading the single sentence traits which the game labels each playable character with. This, however, is where character development grinds to a halt. Traits have no actual impact on how the story progresses, are more descriptors than anything else, and are only given out to remind you what superficial choices you have made in the development of the character (four at most, as far as I have seen). Again, the game does very little to actually flesh out the characters, and it is really up to your imagination to determine who these people are.\n\nFurthermore, the way the game switches the playable character around so flippantly makes me wish for less diverse characters, not more. There is only one character in the game who the player is able to control more than once, and each session with a character is little more than a 15 minute walk around the village, or pretend intrigue session with nobles and merchants. The biggest insult which comes of this is the lack of any actual ending to the plot or any closure as to how any characters end up. It really is a shame to see the ideas these characters represent so quickly squandered by limited screentime and a failure to empathise with the characters and their ideals (or, rather, lack there-of).\n\nReactive Storyline - If there is one thing I can say to this, it is "You are technically correct. The best kind of correct." While yes, there are some aspects of the story which change due to your actions, they are almost entirely relegated to the superficial story represented in the paragraphs at the beginning of each mission. Even when characters who are supposably the main characters die, they merely get a short dialogue mention and are then never heard about again. The game is really in the dead zone where it is both on rails and doesn't actually develop the plot in any way. I can see that the developers were trying to go for something deep and in-depth, but really a Mass Effect-esque on rails storyline would have been better than this. At least then we would get to see how the developers wanted the characters to be fleshed out.\n\nNo Right Answers - This is the most true claim the game makes. There is no good or bad, at least according to the game. There are just dialogue option after dialogue option presenting supposed moral dilemas which don't actually affect anything at all. In reality, there are no answers at all, as the game fails to come together at the end to provide an actual moral or even a theme. The only thing the game has in common throughout is that people will be people, and even then it fails to acknowledge the importance of the people themselves.\n\nComplex Conversations - This claim I believe to be a misnomer. What they are really going for here is "Long Conversations" or "Conversations with many Options". Complex would be in reference to the superficial attitude bars which are included for every character you interact with in the game. While these sometimes change the reactions of characters, they never actually change how the story progresses, and don't really provide character development for the playable character or the non player characters. Again, you can certainly play the character and the conversation however you like, you just have to realize that whatever you say or whatever supposed enlightenment you bring the character to will have no effect on the bland and jagged outcomes to any situation.\n\nViolence is Rarely the Answer - Violence serves about as much a point as any other dialogue options in the game. It only progresses the story line as far as it is meant to, isn't particularly deep or meaningful, and fails to get the player to empathize with the character on a personal level.\n\nLush art and Music - The art and music are interesting for a short Greenlight video before you realize how repetitive the music is and how roughly the art fits with the controls of the game. Very little of the environment is interactive and the only thing which moves in the game is the player character. NPCs will suddenly disappear during dialogue as you find out they leave a few dialogue options down the tree. While the art is certainly smooth, especially on the character, there are many times where pieces will not blend correctly, or the indoor art will be covered slightly by outdoor art, or the character will move through a wall or doorframe, et cetera, et cetera. If you are looking for a game with beautiful art and more tense, empathetic, and meaningful decision making, look to other games like Gods will be Watching and the like.","July 28, 2014","false","2.7"," 22 of 38 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","22","38","0","0"

The protagonist of the game, if there is one, is the city of Bhimra. As a player you follow the lives of several humans and one naga, making decisions that impact their own lives and also the future of the city and all who live in it. The frequent changes in POV serve to refocus the player's perspective. The personal matters of individual characters, as important as they may be to them, are only the backdrop for the city's history.\n\nTo put it another way: there are quite a few games that use histories of war, famine, and civil unrest as the backdrop for the personal dramas of the protagonist. Unrest does the opposite.\n\nSo far I've only played through the whole game once. I'm sure I'll have a lot more to say once I've explored more of the options and their consequences. The trait system, in particular, is very interesting. I don't think I've unlocked nearly half of the possible traits for the five different POV characters. The use of three different "approval" meters for character interactions (friendship, respect and fear) is also something I'd like to explore more.\n\nThere's a bit of a bait-and-switch embedded in the game's assumptions. If you go in expecting one thing and get something totally different, you're apt to be disappointed. But if you keep an open mind and adjust your expectations to the game's story feedback, I'm convinced you'll find it just as interesting as I did.","August 9, 2014","true","6.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It's been mis-characterized as a RPG. It's more of a point n click visual novel with choices. The story is very engrossing and touches on a lot of socio-economic and political issues with modern day parallels. It's game that goes out of the way to de-glamorize various roles you end up playing during the game, be it a ruler, mercenary, priest or bride-to-be. It throws a range of gloomy choices at you and there's little escapism in sight.\nIt's a low budget title and that hampers it from achieving true greatness. While some choices do have irreversible consequences, it could have been done a bit better. The art style is folksy in a way that fits the story, as is the music which does get a little repetitive. However, the graphics, path finding, character models and animations are merely okay.\nOverall, this is a neat little game with a big heart which tackles serious issues.\nSometime, I debate whether I should read a book or play a game. When I succumb to my laziness and end up playing a game, I invariably regret the decision. This game was so worth the 5 short hours I put into it.

However, what Unrest does is pushing our understading of Role Play to a whole new level. As part of a single, epic narrative, we take control of several diferent characters throughout the game and play their role in the fate of a city on the verge of colapse. We decide the way in which to solve problems, what kind of responses to give to NPCs (harsh, polite, etc.), who to help or not... Simply building a personality for each different character and playing according to that can be a lot of fun.\nGraphically, Unrest boasts simple but beautifull hand-drawn environments that evoke an Indian setting. Combined with an eastern inspired (although sometimes repeitive) soundtrack, Unrest really sucks you into its surprisingly deep universe full of luxury, famine and complex moral choices. You will have plenty of time to enjoy these aspects, as the slow walking pace of the characters can make traversing the sometimes expansive maps a chore.\nOne last note: the game is heavily text-oriented, although it is surprisingly well written and interesting. So get into the world of Unrest expecting more of a dignified visual novel, and less of a traditional point-and-click RPG.","April 3","true","10.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

They are avatars providing framework for the politics of Bhimra, which is the central subject of the game.\n\nThe game functions like a tabletop RPG where a writer prepares a scenario in which the player acts out a character. Circulating the paradox of Bhimra, the player views it from different vantage points. The dialogue lacks a true unique voice, but with a terse diction the game delves into a full palette of social complexities: class, racism, famine and so on.\n\nThe developers show us, to an extent, how to have your cake and eat it too. Achieving the thematic goal has come with a cost of elegance in art and audio; tailored animations and looping music would have elevated the game. Nonetheless, I laud the developers for realizing their vision in a package that delivers just what it needs to, and nothing more.","May 20","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

All in all, I'd be ready to recommend it wholeheartedly, despite it's slightly home-made production qualities. However, it crashes constantly. Every game session I've played of it so far has ended with the game crashing, sometimes after not a lot of gameplay.\n\nWithout the bugs, I'd say to check it out. It's a unique setting, the art and music are lovely within the confines of what the developer could manage, and an RPG set around a set of vignettes wherein the only real factor is conversation is a pretty unique idea.

Although I wasn't aware of the game during its Kickstarter phase, I was excited when I stumbled across it in the store. Although the art style isn't my taste, it was refreshing to see a lineup of female characters who were not sexualized in any way. I especially appreciated that the Naga were not given the Michael Bay treatment (ie. giving females of a species breasts when they shouldn't have them because sexism). The plot was as interesting as promised, and I enjoyed the opportunity to play as different characters in the world. The worldbuilding was excellent and because of that I felt very immersed in the world and invested in the struggles of Bhimra.\n\nSo why am I not recommending it? Simply put: the game mechanics were VERY poorly done. The lack of distinct endings (both in the way that they play out as a normal chapter and how there is not a lot of difference between the "bad", "good", and "best" endings) not only took away my desire to replay the game, but also made me feel like none of my choices really mattered. In a game where dialogue choices are the prime game mechanic, there needs to be clarity regarding the impact that certain choices have. While talking with people could change their individual feelings for you (as represented by three bars: friendliness, respect/fear, and approachability), since you rarely interacted with the same person twice I felt that my relationships with people were not properly connected to the world around me. I understand that the devs didn't want obvious game mechanics to break immersion, but there is such a thing as TOO much ambiguity in a game. I much rather would have seen them cut back on the scale of the game (eg. cut down on the number of characters and make the relationships between characters both more clear and matter more) than had the overambitious content that didn't live up to my expectations.\n\nI definitely am going to keep an eye out for future games by Pyrodactyl (especially if they keep featuring women as main protagonists), but until I see an improvement in the game mechanics I am going to stick to buying their products when they're on sale.","November 2, 2014","false","3.4"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

Plots aren't very interesting to me. What is interesting, however, is giving you a setting, with questions and different approaches. Then, you can make choices and see how the world reacts.\nI can't be bothered to remember a plot. Knowing the world I was "living" in, however, is something that sticks with me.\n\nThis game makes you stick with your decisions (although there's also a saving system, if you so wish to use), but it's not perfect in that regard. There were many occasions when the game blocked me some paths that seemed available... it's not very consistent with the doors it closes. One mis-interpretation of the dialogue and you'll have to play the rest of the game with a choice you didn't intend to make. Oh well.\n\n\n\n\nBut I'm giving it a thumbs down. Why is that?\n\nWell, above all else, because you play many different characters, several of them in opposing sides of the conflict. It's really hard to "role-play" in this manner.\nAlso, with the amount of character switching that goes on in the game, it's really hard to keep track who's who.\nRegardless, the characters you play aren't all that well defined before you start, and will often be in conflict with your previous character.\nIt's... awkward, honestly. I'd rather play one character and commit to a certain persona, and then have a friend play another character, with a different persona, and see how the world developed.\n\nI don't know, role-playing this many characters in quick succession just feels wrong, especially with the lack of previous characterization. I couldn't really "defend a point", since the next character might defend the complete opposite.\n\n\nThe game itself isn't bad. The "game" part is a bit amateur, with animations not really matching the background's perspectives and some clunky systems... but I think it's worth a shot. It's trying something different, and definitely something I'd like to see more of. However, after playing this, I've got to admit that it was completely immersion breaking to be constantly switching characters, often with conflicting views of the world. I just couldn't play all of those roles at once.\nWould be really cool to see a multiplayer version -- Each person chooses a character and makes their own choices. It would probably have me much more invested!\n\nStill, looking forward to their other games!","May 29, 2015","false","4.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It reads more like a novella than the fully formed novel it aspires to be. This was the first kickstarter game I backed and played, and it is definitely disappointing. As others have mentioned, the ending doesn't really resolve any plot points*, and as much as you want to connect with the main characters (or even understand their motives) you're given about 10 minutes of game time per character, so there really aren't many connections you can make.\n\nIt also should be noted that this game is much more of a visual novel than a typical "adventure/RPG" game.\n\nAs an aside, I would also like to say that during the communication throughout development, the developers sounded narcissistic and immature. I even asked a few questions and they responded with snide and rude remarks, almost as though they were offended I couldn't be bothered to attend every live stream of the game or blog post. Had I known the sort of people they were, I would not have supported this game from the beginning. This hasn't effected my ultimate recommendation, but some gamers may want to know.\n\n*it seems obvious that the developers hope to create a sequel, which is why the game isn't "complete", however, I will not be purchasing it.","July 28, 2014","false","4.8"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","0"

There is nothing interesting in the world and animations could have been done better even in a flash game. Does not deserve even 5$ (what I paid for it).\n\nI was looking forward to play this but got seriously disappointed. Just because you're an "indie" developer, does not mean you can shove games on Steam which is no way superior than a flash game, except for it's story.\n\nI wonder what happens next in the story even though I uninstalled the game. This makes me think that the game could have been a lot better if it was an retro text-adventure.","November 6, 2014","false","1.1"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

It was difficult to tell how choices would effect things which is somewhat realistic. Resulted in my reloading a couple times, but not frustratingly so.\nBiggest complaint is how unsatisfying the ending was. It ended and I immediately thought, "So this is episodic right?" I'm a fan of open endings in general, but an open ending for a game where your choices effect the ending is a bit frustrating. Also how things turned out for some characters was not stated. I get that I don't need to be spoon fed everything, but in an ending summary I want my theories confirmed and laid to rest. Maybe other endings are better, but I couldn't bring myself to go back and play again.\n","January 15","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is all dialogue-driven, and the choices you make have consequences that affect how the rest of the game plays out.  The dialogue in this game, in and of itself, is some of the best and most realistic that I have seen.  The character scores that each choice affects are, however, not intuitive and seem to have no bearing on the final state.  The game is also quite short and anti-climactic, with an abrupt ending.  Considering its length, it would probably have been better if it had fewer character arcs so that you would be given a chance to play each individual character more and bond with them.  Regardless, these are small flaws, and the it is generally quite good, especially if you've gotten bored with thousands of pointless small battles and going back and forth between shops and corpses to liquidate loot.","May 27","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
