I finished the game with 300k wihout anything to spend on. If that's what you're looking for and if you're willing to pay about â‚¬ 16,- for 3 hours of gameplay go on and take it, otherwise I would not recommend to buy it.","December 27, 2015","false","3.3"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","42","49","0","0"

This is a tech demo. You should be able to "lose" a game. Even if not lose, you should at least be aware that you're doing it wrong. If you are inclined to try this anyway, take a careful note of your play time to not exceed two-hour refund barrier.

Essentially, it's a mix of the old and the new. Flying around the hub areas can be surprisingly serene, with impressive background aesthetics and a soothing sci-fi soundtrack. When it comes to blasting asteroids, playing around with the various weapons as you unlock them can be a satisfying experience, and the visual effects combine with the audio to create an oddly calming atmosphere. It's like comfort food.\n\nThe only cons I can think of right now are that the interior spaces are quite small, the lore, while intriguing, is not fully explored, and there could be more to spend well-earned cash on. All of which would be great to see expanded upon in a future update. Apart from that, the game is fun! If you're looking for an arcade-style space shooter, I say give it a try.","December 22, 2015","true","9.0"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

What it's supposed to be is a space game where you pilot a ship, gather resources, craft, and better your ship. So far so good. In reality,  Our Nation's Miner a good attempt at a good idea, but it falls short.\n\nIf you are about to add Our Nation's Miner to your cart, here's what you're getting yourself into:\n\n.Story/Premise.\nThere's not much of one. Basically shoot stuff to make stuff so that you get the clearance to shoot more stuff and make more stuff.\n\n.Controls.\nSloppy and slippery. In some situations, this can be a good thing (heh)... Just not when you're trying to pilot your super cool space ship all over an admittedly beautiful universe in order to shoot at asteroids or sell materials. They feel entirely unresponsive and, even if you aren't moving your ship using the wasd keys (you use the mouse to aim your lazers), it tends to drift all on its own until it hits something and is forced to stop. It's unnecessarily difficult to manuever into the ports that\n\nThe firing is also unsatisfactory. It sounds nothing like a lazer and the feedback when blasting an asteroid to smithereens is lacking.\n\n.Loading screens.\nPersonally, an automatic red flag. There's one of these babies (not too long, but still) every time you move between areas.\n.Soundtrack.\nThe best part of the game. It's chill and pleasant.\n\n.Graphics.\nThe space theme is well done with metal structures and glowing bits. It's pretty, but I prefer funtional any day.\n\n.Bottom line.\nI can't with a good conscience recommend this game--and especially not for 15.99. It feels more like an alpha than the finished product.","February 15","false","3.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

It has a lot of potential. The graphics are amazing. You can tell that there was some time taken to make the game look good. However, I am not as impressed with the controls of the game. You can only move by using the "W" key and to turn, you have to use your mouse. Hopefully it is given more content and improved controls.","January 1","true","0.5"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

That's about all that can be said for it. There is no story to speak of, and honestly no gameplay to speak of either. I've seen more elaborate game design from first year programming students. You shoot asteroids until they blow up. That's it. Shoot enough asteroids and you can move to another area to shoot asteroids that look different, and get better ways to shoot asteroids.\n\nWhile you technically can die if you get hit enough by asteroids and debris, there is no consequences. You respawn immediately in the same place, you lose no resources or progress. Half the times I died I barely noticed. I suspect there were times I didn't notice at all.\n\nIf it were an early access game, I'd say it's a pretty start but needs a lot of content added. Since this is apparently final release, it's just disappointing. Like another review said, this is a tech demo, not a game.\n\nTL:DR, not worth the time or the money.","February 20","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're better off playing Asteroids because at least that game has an actual consequence to losing rather than losing collected resources and thus making the game taking longer to complete.","February 20","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
