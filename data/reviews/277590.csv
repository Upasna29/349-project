He even gets his own murder hood.\n\nMuch of the in game assets were from ACIV:BF so the graphics are more or less the same. Gameplay wise as well, but again more action than stealth really. And his attack animations, though not as fluid or graceful as i expected assassins would be, he has a sort of brutal flair that really defines him as an assassin. Not just Edward Kenway reskinned to be Adewale.\n\nWeapons in Freedom Cry are different as they got rid of swords and daggers. You get machetes for Adewale instead. (This does not prevent you from picking up and using a sword from a slain enemy.)\nNo flintlock pistols, just a blunderbuss for you, Ade.\nYou still have your own pair of Hidden Blades of course.\n\nThe whole campaign itself is short and sweet. It left me wanting more from it, more of what happens to Adewale, more of what becomes of the liberated slaves and their resistance and more of what happened to the Assassins after Black Flag.\nFor a DLC turned standalone game, it has a lot more content than one would expect.\nHonestly i thought it was just gonna be a bunch of uninspired self contained missions, but this totally blew me away.\n\n\nI dare say Adewale was more fun to play with than Connor. But of course, that is my opinion.\n\n\nGet it on sale if you feel that $15 is still too much. Get it however you can as it is a very good game and you won't really regret playing it.","August 27, 2014","true","10.9"," 159 of 169 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","159","169","3","0"

Since Assassin’s Creed IV’s story led Edward back to England, though, in order to maintain the Caribbean setting, Freedom Cry tells a tale of Edward’s charismatic quartermaster, Adéwalé, instead. Adéwalé is captain of his own ship now, and he’s a high-ranking member of the Brotherhood as he continues to fight the war against the Templars. Freedom Cry is, quite honestly, the most powerful tale the franchise has told. The Assassin-Templar war is nothing but set dressing that’s promptly shoved into the background to make way for a story about human perseverance, all while cleverly tying the Assassin’s Creed universe into the start of a movement that led to the largest slave revolt in history.The evils of racism and slavery are prevalent throughout and handled far better here than they were in Liberation or their all-too-brief mention in Assassin’s Creed III. Nearly everyone who isn’t a slave sees Adéwalé as an enemy, making even a casual walk through Port-au-Prince a nightmare—and quickly forcing him into combat should he attempt anything suspicious.This makes Freedom Cry surprisingly difficult at times, since almost the entire city is against you. The game subtly makes you aware that you’re having a harder time of things simply because of the color of your skin, and it feels wrong on so many levels. It’s a risky venture for the developers, but I think the message is clear. Besides the stellar storytelling, the game features the same great action for which the series is known, as well as twists on some Black Flag side missions that now revolve around the slavery theme. Instead of recruiting pirates for your crew, you free runaways, liberate slaves from the auction block, or break others out of prison cages.Freedom Cry does have some limitations that put a crimp on its value, though. The exploration and sheer scope of the world seen in the main game are completely gone, leaving you to race through the nine story missions with little incentive to wander from the predetermined path. And, sure, you can still go out to sea, but there’s really no point beyond a couple of mission parameters, since 90 percent of the action takes place within Port-au-Prince.Freedom Cry clearly takes a technical step backward from the accomplishment that was the world of Black Flag. Adéwalé steps brilliantly into the lead role, though. His story, short as it is, helps make up for the smaller world, and it’s enough for Assassin’s Creed fans to check out Freedom Cry if they’re even remotely interested.","November 30, 2014","true","10.1"," 135 of 146 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","135","146","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/277590/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 5 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","Freedom Cry is a bit of stand-alone DLC for AC4. You play as Adewale, your ship Quartermaster from AC4 turned Assassin. Who sets out on a quest of his own to liberate slaves in the Carribean.\n\nFreedom Cry does a lot to try and be different than AC4. For starters the game is more stealth focused. For much of the game you're liberating slaves from plantations by eliminating their overseers. And the player gets rewarded with new tools, upgrades and weapons for freeing more slaves. However if the player caught they begin to murder the slaves before you can free them. This creates an incentive to play as stealthily as possible and as a result there's significantly less of a combat focus. This was clearly intentional and you tend to only use your blowgun and hidden blades.\n\nAs a result Freedom Cry feels significantly more like a stealth action game than any of the previous Assassin Creed games. And it's to it's credit. The only real gripes I have with it are the story is a bit lacking compared to AC4 and it doesn't take you that long to complete. It is priced pretty reasonably though and it's a blast to try and complete 100%.\n\nI highly recommend Freedom Cry. It complements AC4 nicely, and its more focused stealth gameplay is a welcome change.","March 15, 2015","true","4.3"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","36","38","4","0"

Freedom Cry is actually a standalone game of Blackflag era. Although I wasn't a huge fan of Blackflag, this one did end up with me wanting more at the end.\n\nThe main character, Adewalé, who also played a part in Blackflag is one of the most bad-♥♥♥ characters I've played, not just in Assassin's Creed, but gaming as a whole. The is built like a tank, and won't take any crap from anybody. Proper bad ♥♥♥.\n\nThe story is very DLC style length, and leaves you wanting more after you complete the main mission. There is still plenty of side quests, challenges and hidden treasures to find once you finish it, so for a standalone game, the quantity of gameplay is actually rather impressive.\n\nGraphics wise, very impressive. Built on the same engine as Blackflag, you will not find your self disappointed at the visual side of this title.\n\nI would highly recommend this game. If you are unsure about purchasing Blackflag, this is probably your best starting point as the gameplay is exactly the same, almost like a long demo.

It is a game full of potential -- beautiful graphics, excellent voice acting, and a seldomly explored subject matter tied together with a commercially proven gaming formula. Yet, while 'Freedom Cry' was not horrible, it was not stellar or impressive as it should be. What we got is a game with a partially developed character, about whom I actually want to learn more, in a half-baked story that felt like 'Assassin's Creed' Lite.\n\nIt was innovative to play as a slave-turned-Assassin, who despite having gifts and talents bestowed upon him by the Brotherhood, still needed to be weary of slave jailers because of the colour of his skin. This was enough to change the usual pace of an 'Assassin's Creed' game, and I quite enjoyed that. Not needing to deal with modern day Abstergo/Animus story elements was also very welcomed, but it was odd to see the concept of synchronicity being left in the game. The modern day story elements in 'Assassin's Creed' had always felt like Ubisoft lacked confidence in a loosely historical third-person stealth action game. 'Freedom Cry' would have been the perfect opportunity for the franchise to distant itself from this extraneous story element, but that chance was unfortunately wasted.\n\nMy biggest complaint about 'Freedom Cry', is the naval combat. As someone who had not played 'Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag', I found the learning curve for naval warfare to be steep. There wasn't much of a tutorial and it took much trial and error for me to fully understand the basic mechanics. Plus, there was one mission that would have been difficulty to complete if I had not fully upgraded my ship through constant pirating. Such level grinding has no place in a game like 'Freedom Cry' as it slowed the entire game down. That and the repetitiveness and general lack of mission variety made the game rather tedious at times. Seriously, how many eavesdropping missions did 'Freedom Cry' really need for a nine-mission game?\n\nThe theme of slavery is both a shining factor and a major weakness of 'Freedom Cry'. I got much satisfaction freeing slaves in the game, but when the number of slaves I freed became the currency of weapon upgrades eligibility, I became frustrated. Shouldn't I be freeing slaves because it is the right thing to do and because it is the main character's motivation, not because of a weapon upgrade? Plus, why would black merchants, who knew I free slaves, only sell me weapons if I meet a quota? This game mechanic, while thematically important, was not very well thought out and well implemented.\n\nFor those who have played 'Black Flag', 'Freedom Cry' may appeal to you, but for those who haven't, your time may be better spent on other games than this somewhat mediocre entry to the 'Assassin's Creed' franchise.","August 23, 2014","false","16.2"," 96 of 159 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","96","159","3","4"

It is the same classic Assassin's Creed formula that makes the series fun with new location, improved visuals and continues the Assassin's fight for a noble cause.\n\nI highly recommend it!","February 27, 2014","true","2.7"," 34 of 55 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","34","55","0","2"

Other than that, it's very similar to AC4, taking most of the features, often simplifing them, since it's on much smaller scale, and unfortunately bearing all the problems AC games have.\n\nAnd the bugs! Oh god, the glitches. I've never seen something like this (haven't played Unity yet) - enemies suddenly spawning from their dead comrades (and instantly raising alarm), friendly AI falling down from ladders and killing themselves, invisible enemies that appear on minimap, the good old "I just wanted to jump over that wall, not walk on it", just to name few that were the most memorable, but I kid you not, when this DLC breaks, it breaks hard. I do not remember having such a hard time with AC4 or any previous AC.\n\nStill, even without the bugs, the experience is very limited and other than the story, the exploration is so bare bone that it honestly isn't worth it, you won't find anything different from AC4, where pretty much everything is more fleshed out, so I can only recommend this for the story and when on sale, not for it's regular asking price.\n\nDecent, but (often) flawed experience.","September 3, 2015","true","16.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","13","17","3","0"

You play as Adewale, Edward Kenway's Ex-First Mate. Most of the game is centered around freeing slaves, and the mid sized area you get to play around with is full of respawning side-missions to do like taking an injured to a safe spot set up by the maroon rebellion or saving a half dozen slaves being auctioned off with force or simplying buying them then letting them go free. Your main area is Port de Prince, a town full of activity, but after an hour of fooling around you will know the town like the back of your hand and done anything there is to do. You get a new ship at the start of the game, and I was happy to see Ubisoft made us a totally new slice of the Carribbean to explore, though another 2 hours and you'll have done literally everything. The bright side is there is a few awesome side missions to play. My favorite is the Plantation missions because of the different techniques to employ in getting the slaves out safely. Start a massive riot and hope to god you and the slaves overpower the overseers or thin the heard steath style until the enemy has only a few men left then swarm them. (It's basically warehouse missions from black flag but once the alarm is triggered you have to act fast because the overseers are outnumbere 4 to 1 by slaves so they start killing them right away after the alarm is trigggered) There are also slave ships which are heavily escorted but carry around 100 slaves but can't be damaged at all before borded (obviously). Adewale is a pretty cool guy but they don't really flesh him out beyond he's has to get back to the brotherhood eventually but he refuses to leave until the rebellion is strong enough to stand without him. The new weapons he gets to use are a nice refreshment though. His main weapons is a machete, and its a brutal weapon that gets the blood flying and seems to always get stuck in the bodies of slavemasters. The second and best new weapon is the blunderbluss, which adds a whole new element of gameplay, because now you can take out a concentrated group of soldiers with one shot. Overall a good game though just barely worth the asking price.","October 14, 2014","true","8.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/277590/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nFreedom Cry tells the story of Black Flag's Adéwalé, twenty years after the story of Edward Kenway, following Adéwalé in his journey through the West Indies Sea, where he ends up shipwrecked on the coast of Haiti. Making his way into Port-au-Prince he meets up with Bastienne Josèphe, the proprietor of a local brothel and a sympathiser to the Maroons, a faction of freedom fighters made up of liberated slaves. Soon afterwards Adéwalé gets caught up in the events and ends up teaming with the Maroons to free slaves from around the West Indies Sea. As emotional and personal the story is, its length demolishes almost everything the plot wants to uncover, as most missions will be over before you realize it, leaving details aside and focusing only on the main objectives, therefore taking away from the emotional impact the story could've had if we were presented with some background on the slaves and their masters which Adéwalé is supposed to fight blindly. Adéwalé's relationship with Bastienne Josèphe is one of the few things that stands out strong throughout the six hour adventure, as you will find out more about her intentions from one visit to the next one, and by the end of the story form a bond with her that you could only wish would continue for a few more hours.\nRating: 6.5\n\nGameplay\nBeing an extension to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, Freedom Cry plays exactly the same, with a few interesting things added for the best, and a lot of amazing features present in the original game removed for the worst. This is still an open world game, so you can use your ship to travel from one location to another just like you did in Black Flag, but not only is the game limited to the West Indies Sea which is a pretty small portion of the Caribbean, but at the same time that portion feels empty in a way that Black Flag never did, even with its enormous map. There are only three main islands where the main plot will take you and maybe five more where you can find a chest or a secret, but for the most part the seas feel empty, and even in those main islands aside from the objective where the mission takes you and the slave liberation missions there is nothing else to do, something that feels weird to begin with for an Assassin's Creed game. On the bright side, the Blunderbuss and Adéwalé's machete are some great new tools to play around with, at least in the main missions since that's the only occasion you'll get to use them properly.\nRating: 6\n\nGraphics\nFreedom Cry was built as an extension to Black Flag, so it uses the same engine and environment, which is only for the best since the original game was a beauty with vast seas, populated lands and unforgiving fleets. In this title, the seas are still there in all their beauty and so are the ships cruising them, but the difference comes when you set sail for land and realize there is nothing else to see there; unlike Black Flag, Freedom Cry has only a few island and even those look similar, as no matter which one you set foot on next, you'll still be greeted by the same slave plantation or empty beach.\nRating: 6.5\n\nAudio\nWith such great audio design and quality in Black Flag, it was impossible to screw it up this time, since most of it is reused in here, which isn't much of a problem since all the effects feel authentic in Adéwalé's story as well. There are a couple new tunes created for Freedom Cry exclusively and those find their spot in Adéwalé's story flawlessly, and thanks to some great voice acting performed by Tristan D. Lalla, Adéwalé's character feels even more authentic than it did before in Black Flag throughout Kenway's story.\nRating: 9.5\n\nExtras\nEven though this can be purchased as a standalone experience, it is obviously just an extension to Black Flag, but even so playing an Assassin's Creed game where you can barely squeeze six hours of playtime if you're taking your time with the story, completing all the slave liberation missions and looking around for the few islands that hide a chest feels weird since Assassin's Creed was always about exploration and the things you can do on the side, things that are almost non-existent in Freedom Cry.\nRating: 5.5\n\nVerdict\nFreedom Cry wanted to tell a more personal story than the original Black Flag, but unfortunately the limited length of the story, as well as the empty environment in which it takes place makes it fall flawed as important and emotional events will be over before realizing it and for most parts without any explanation or background on Adéwalé's intentions.\nRating Overall: 6.8\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=310","December 14, 2014","true","6.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The storyline was a bit iffy and not much happened.  I wasn't really sure what was happening with that Templar package.  This game did not really make an impact on the series, being that the storyline was so short and too simple.  I spent 6 hours in the game and that was me taking my time.  There was a lack of actual Assassins at work other than our protagonist.  Although slavery itself is historically accurate, not much of what Adewale did seemed to be on the history timeline.  I don't see any memorable characters in this game that were worth interacting with or assassinating.  The game should cost no more than $5 with the amount of content that they gave.","June 28, 2014","false","5.9"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

When I say this game runs about as well as my 81 year old grandma who just had her hip replaced, I feel like I'm being generous. The number of times I've died due to unresponsive controls from the single digit frame rate have me feeling like I could cut off my big toe from frustration. Taking a ship can be stressful enough simply because of the frustratingly poor camera controls and the series' signature crappy combat, but playing this in slide show mode can make it simply impossible. It isn't that I have the settings too high or that my rig is too old, I have two 4 gb gtx 760s going with a i7-3770k, far beyond the recommended settings, with the graphics settings on low, and still there is no noticeable improvement with the frame rate. I have to say that this is one time it's simply better to play the game on a console, unless you're okay with ♥♥♥♥ optimization and unresponsive controls. Then the game is fantastic, simply a must buy. Such a disappointment because this game could be so incredibly fun, but even moving your character around get incredibly jittery frame rates (I feel like I'm playing a ps3 instead of a $1600 gaming rig that handles far more intensive games with ease).\n\nI'll definitely never be giving my money to Ubisoft again, that's one thing I've learned for sure.

However, when I finished it a day or so later, I felt a little disappointed.\n\nThis game overall feels more like a couple of long DLC missions in the main game than a stand alone game. It's entertaining enough if you liked Black Flag, because this is basically the same, but on a much smaller, less interesting scale. It feels like you're just playing as a reskinned Edward, as the idle animations are the exact same. You can hunt certain animals, but there's no purpose, because you can't craft or make more outfits. Like in Black Flag, you can plunder other ships, but the rewards are so badly scaled to the prices of the few upgrades, that you're basically decked out after you've pulverized four ships. Freedom Cry feels like someone cut a tiny square out of the bayeux tapestry. It's aesthetically pleasing in itself, but it's lacking a whole hell of a lot of context.\n\nI personally don't feel like Freedom Cry's got enough content or weight to be its own game. I played it, I completed it, it was okay while it lasted, but in a critical light, this really isn't that big of a deal.

Playing as Edwards mate Adewale in a smaller section of the Carribean, essentially starting a slave rebellion, the short yet intense gameplay brings a lot of similar action to Black Flack with a great story line to boot.\n\nThe game is fairly short with the story line and there is a few things that can help occupy your time that are similar to Black Flag, with diving spots and whale hunting. Ship battles never get old, although you can fairly quickly advance your ship, making all but battles with a few of the toughest ships a challenge.\n\nAs a fan of the series (not as big a fan of Unity) I would highly reccomend purchasing this cheap yet exciting 5 or so hour long game you will get your monies worth and if its on sale then its a steal.\n\nPros:\n\n- Great story line\n- Smooth combat system\n- Return of the 'Adewale'\n- Ship battles!!!\n\nCons:\n\n- Mission stories are quick to finish\n- Too easy to level up 'Experto Creed' (ship)\n- Not enough equiptment to obtain\n- No legendary ship to defeat\n\nOverall this is a great edition to the Black Flag saga to bring back the memories of maybe the best game of the series. It maybe too easy to give any serious gamer a struggle, though for the price it would take up a chilled weekend. I got this game on sale so very happy with the price for the experience.","July 17, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Black Flag was great, of course, but the story was a little empty and I feel a got more story out of 8 hours in Freedom Cry than I did with 80 hours in Black Flag.\n\nI recommend checking out the undiscovered map locations and islands before getting too far in the story, there are other machetes and guns to find and it's kinda pointless finding them after you complete the story.","March 17, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you do not have it I suggest you buy it at a sale because the main game will be cheaper than the dlc since the price is only slightly higher but the overall content is more aswell.\n\nI own Assassins Creed on XBox 360 and the game simply is breathtaking with the easy to learn gameplay, the open world features and the good and atmospheric music. The story however was a little short and Freedom Cry as a dlc is of course even shorter. Most players suggest an average gametime of only 4-6 hours. However it took me about 20 Hours to discover all the places unlock everything and tried the minigames like fishing. (They are the same as in Black Flag though)\n\nAdewale has his own combat style and uses a machete. Like Kennway he can use firearms, ropedarts, poisoned darts etc. The overall gameplay is the same as in Black Flag but the story is set 20 years later. (I wont say much about it since i dont want to spoiler and it depends on your taste if you will enjoy it or not).\n\nThe map is not very big, i am guessing less than 25% of Black Flags overall map but the locations have their own appearance and are detailed.\n\nI did not encounter any notable bugs but I was a bit dissappointed that Adewales ship is a repainted Jackdaw.\nThe ship however cannot be upgraded as much as the Jackdaw.\n\nA new element in the game is as already mentioned Adewales own combat style and the ability to free slaves either by boarding slave ships or by killing the overseers at the plantations. Some of the overseers have become very hostile and will attack you instantly. If you are spotted on the plantations, the overseers are going to kill your maroonfellows so you should really take care.\nThe plantations sooner or later always get new owners so you can replay this part. The game also can be continued after the story has come to an end just like in Black Flag.\n\nIf you enjoyed Black Flag and want some more story related content or discover some more West Indies locations I really recommend this but dont expect a lot of new content. Also keep an eye out for a decent sale, I suggest maybe 3-5 dollars is a good price.","December 1, 2015","true","25.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

On the one hand, playing as Adewale is amazing and the setting is interesting. On the other hand, the story is far too short and the characters (besides Adewale) aren't very well made. The introduction of new features to accomodate for the fact that you are playing as an African Assassin in a time period of great racial turmoil are very well crafted and subtle. The soundtrack is incredible and the return to Black Flag's ship combat is a welcome one. However, this is a very poor port to PC as no matter how low you set the visuals, the framerate stays at an inconsistent 19 FPS, usually dropping lower and only rising during cutscenes where nothing much is happening. It is very jarring but it is only a problem on PC.

Set 13-15 years after AC4, Adewale has risen from Kenway's right-hand man, to a full-fledged Assassin/Captain. After an intense opening scene, he finds himself washed ashore and caught in the midst of a civil struggle. It's time to free some slaves, hence the subtitle of the game. There are many different scenarios in which you can free said slaves. Some will be locked in a cage, and you have to kill the guard carrying the key. Others will be working on plantations, in which you must eliminate a certain number of guards to free them.\n\nFreeing as many slaves as possible actually grants you bonuses, and sometimes even needed to advance the story. The bonuses range from free restocks on ammunition, to even new weapons. With slaves pratically all over the place ready to be liberated, achieving these bonuses doesn't exactly take a long time.\n\nAs you'd expect, Freedom Cry does have naval content, including it's own (DLC sized) open-world map. Attacking and boarding other ships for goods is still relevant, but nowhere near as much as Black Flag. A lot of the locations to discover are unfortunately pretty dull. There's several islands which consist of only a small beach and one chest to open, then you're done there. I'm not sure why Ubisoft even bothered, as it's probably the most disappointing part of FC. Still, just sailing the open sea remains a joy to behold. No sea shanties (pirate songs), however.\n\nJust like Black Flag, Freedom Cry is GORGEOUS. It's a shame that sometimes some information is still present on your screen, even with the HUD options turned "all off", because I love taking clean screenshots. Even so, it's such a beautiful game to behold, especially the water. You'll catch yourself just staring at the visuals and remember there's a game to play.\n\nI was surprised with the length of FC. I expected to be done in about 3-4 hours, but my save file clocks-in at almost 9 hours. That's including all side-content. Not a bad chunk of time for a piece of something that's stand-alone DLC. So, if you want a demo of Black Flag, this is the closest you'll get of that experience. Granted, Black Flag is obviously the fuller experience, but I do recommend buying this if you're wondering what it's like.\n\nI am pleased with the time I spent with Freedom Cry. A lovely slice of Assassin/Pirate content to keep one's interest for a decent amount of time.","March 22, 2014","true","8.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I feel that this was a rushed product that could have been way better.

Buy the base game, Assassins Creed 4: Black Flag, or Assassins Creed: Rogue.\n\nThe narrative feels rushed and unfocused, beginning and ending rather abruptly. It starts with your classic AC MacGuffin, then promptly forgets about it; Then touches on themes of slavery but begins to quickly move them to the backround, instead focusing too much of it's narrative on a cartographer mapping the Caribbean that happens to be in Port au Prince (The primary setting of this DLC.) This leads to far too many tail/eavesdrop missions, moreso some of the worst, most frustrating examples in any of the AC games to date. It relies too much on tightly scripted sequences that limit your mobility and/or abilities and mistakes tedium for engagement too often. The main story missions can be completed in under 4 hours.\n\nThe freeing of slaves is relegated mostly to narrative-devoid side activities, tied to unlocking upgraded weapons and other optional items, cheapening the poignancy to the point of repetitively farming a statistic. The repetition is not helped by the rapid respawn of prisoners; I could return to the same spot within two minutes to find new caged prisoners, new guards taking the exact same routes, the corpses of their predecessors still laying about.\n\nThe game is really at it's best when you are raiding plantations. You free the slaves of the plantation by killing guards. It's just nice having that chance to take it on in your own way, with your full set of skills and the space to use them instead of limiting them like a majority of the main missions. It's always the same objective, Kill 20 guards, and it feels like a wasted opportunity; It could have used more variety to keep it fresh, and without narrative it only serves as a distraction from the underwhelming storyline.\n\nSailing feels like an afterthought, with a very small map and only a handful of locations to explore, with many of those being little more than beaches with a chest or two on them. After all the sea shanties of AC4, it is very noticeable that Adewale's ship crew is generally silent; it would have been nice if there were a couple of new, theme appropriate songs for them to sing, or just a few of the old ones. There are no treasure maps to find, no forts to destroy, no side assassinations to undertake. Hunting and whaling are pointless as there's nothing to craft. I didn't even notice there were ship upgrades until the second playthrough, the ship's upgraded enough out of the gate to deal with the few ship-to-ship fights. It's also painfully obvious you're always sailing the Jackdaw, the recycled ship model from the main game (AC4 Black Flag.) The ship you're sailing and sinks out of the gate is identical, and then the next one you steal is EXACTLY THE SAME, right down to the decorations, even the three skulls hanging over captains quarters entrance.\n\nThe new items border on impractical: The blunderbuss is a shrapnel-spread shotgun that's just as likely to kill the slaves you're trying to free or your crew as you board other ships; The noise-making firecrackers can only be dropped right in front of you and the noise doesn't seem to have much distance. The Machete is a sword, just like any other AC game, albeit with some pretty sweet, brutal animations. The animations are sort of aesthetically flawed since they go on a little long in combos and tend to get cut off as you parry other enemies in groups.\n\nAs with other recent series entries, this one suffers from an inconsistent frame rate and animation/scripting bugs that mar it's presentation. I watched a hunter's ship sail up the side of an islands rocky peak and into the air before flipping back into the water. I was caught during tailing/eavesdrop missions because sometimes the target would get caught on something/someone and would do a quick spin on the spot, seeing in all directions at once for a second. Sometimes freeing slaves would spawn guards out of thin air (Maybe not a bug but it happened a lot, it was tedious and annoying.) The frame rate plummets noticeably at seemingly random intervals and occasionally assets will materialise in front of Adewale as he runs through the streets.\n\nAdewale is a potentially interesting and charismatic character and I was hoping to get to know him a bit better, as well as explore a very dark aspect of colonialism that was largely glossed over in AC 3 and 4. Freedom Cry does little to add much dimension to it's protagonist, seems uncomfortable confronting the issues of it's own subject matter, and it's disappointing it failed to approach it with compelling narrative or engaging gameplay.","December 2, 2014","false","12.7"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

In fact I like it so much that I'm probbably still going to get unity, but the thing that makes the games great is that they are big. If you played and love black flag and you want more, then I'd say that you should play black flag more or get rouge when it comes out. This game is very small, very very small, you're in a world of wide open seas and enjoying sailing and pirating and oh look at that, the map ended, time to sail back and fourth I guess. I like the machete and the blunderbuss except I keep killing people i don't want to with the bluderbuss. The ship isn't that great and you can't upgrade it that much in fact i don't even remember the name.

You were formerly a slave, working on a plantation until pirates raided it. Although Adewale was previously the legendary Edward Kenway's Quartermaster, Adewale found that he wanted to save slaves, rather than be a pirate. In this game, you follow him across the Carribean, as he liberates slaves and recruits maroons.\n\nThe quality of the game is FANTASTIC! A new feature for the AC series (which was also introduced in Black Flag) is sailing across open world areas, rather than only whilst on missions (in Assassin's Creed 3). Sailing is incredibly simple as all you do is press the forward key, maybe move left and right, etc. A feature of the game (which personally had me excited) was the ability to board other enemy vessels. Boarding too is simple. All you do is press the S key (or whatever you have set stop to) whilst alongside another almost destroyed vessel, and it will automatically cause your ship to dock alongside. Your crew too will react, throwing Grappling hooks to draw your vessels nearer to each other.Your crew will then board the vessel and so on. The Graphics in the game are of a high standard, as Nvidia is involved (seeing as modern Nvidia games are awesome), so you will need at least a 2.6 GHZ processor and a decent graphics card to withstand the urges ingame. The fighting style in AC4 is incredibly similar to that of AC3, with only a couple of differences. For £11 I am incredibly happy, aand will be getting Black Flag soon.","June 4, 2014","true","24.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You begin on the seas in your ship on a mission to intercept a Templar package.  After a brief naval battle, you sail through a storm and end up in Port au Prince in Sam Domingue. From there onwards, you do all kinds of Assassin-y stuff on your own personal mission (of sorts) to free slaves and uncover a plot by Pierre, marquis de Fayet to...do stuff.\n\nFreedom Cry doesn't really offer anything new that Black Flag didn't. In fact, a bit less, which makes sense when you consider the fact that it was originally just a DLC pack before it became a standalone game. Oh and they weren't kidding when they said standalone. If you've never played a single Assassin's Creed title before this one, you won't have any problems grasping what's going on, as it really doesn't have anything to do with the main plot of the series. But, I digress.\n\nYou get two main weapons: a machete and a blunderbuss (as well as your hidden blades, but hidden blades in Assassin's Creed are a given at this point). Both can be upgraded with different versions, but still, the lack of variety in weapon types is a little disappointing. But, again, it's DLC. Most of the side weapons from Black Flag are present, including the blow gun and the rope dart.\n\nThe naval combat is as excellent as ever, though if you haven't played Black Flag it may take a little while to grasp as there's no real tutorial for it here. Your ship, the Experto Crede, is slightly upgradeable with a few gun and mortar upgrades, as well as a hull upgrade. You can also (kind of) customize its appearance with some nifty anti-slavery decorations.\n\nVery basically, it's a slightly stripped-down Black Flag with a different main character and a much shorter storyline. Very fun to play, frustrating as hell at times, and (SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT THINLY VEILED IN RIDDLE) it'll leave you feeling a bit like Brad Pitt's character at the end of Seven. Remember Seven? Man, that was a good movie. What? Oh, right. The review. Um, yeah. Play this game. And stuff.","October 24, 2015","true","15.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

He also has the same darts Ed has access to, and firecrackers (Which i found entirely useless)\n\nThe blunderbuss you originally get can easily kill 6 or seven baddies (Or bystanders) immediately in the area in front of you, which means more damage in less time than Ed's pistols, but you can easily kill your own crew, civilians, or you can miss and you dont get another shot. Its range is also miniscule, and gets worse with its first upgrade. Overall it is a very fun weapon to use if you like burst damage, but lacks in ability to hit faraway targets or snipers.\n\nThe machete is similar to every other weapon in the franchise, smash the mouse button and dodge occasionally and youll kill things. However it is a very sexy weapon in my opinion, and the animations it uses are brutal.\n\nThe game has no outfit changes as far as I can tell.\n\nThe story is pretty simple, and the characters fight over conflicts of interest that weve seen a thousand times, "Don't have a revolution, they will treat the ones unable to escape worse" versus "Better to die than be a slave" and has segments that are a bit confusing, and seem to center around a single woman and her desire to be important, however I am unsure if there is some underlying issue im missing\n\nThe game is the first ive ever seen to touch on Slavery, which is a dirty topic for most of the world, lets be honest. It is a bit disrespectful in some regards, but it has to be to show what life was really like for these people, and show how they were seen by their owners. However it does overdo it. The dev team plays to the "Owners beat and killed slaves on a whim" mentality, when that is utterly false, slaves were expensive and shooting one would be expensive, and i feel dirty saying that but it is true. Slaves of the era also sometimes resisted revolutions and helped their masters fight off raids trying to free them, if that gives you an idea (Source: The fires of Jubilee)\n\nas far as activities go, you have an endless series of minigames dealing with saving slaves to do in the main port and story zone of the game. They are common, almost to a fault, and repeatable. Then you have the plantations, where you have to sneak around and kill 20 guards without being seen. Get spotted, and instead of going after you, the guards will start slaughtering slaves and make you hate yourself for getting spotted. It hurts to watch people begging for their lives get stabbed over your mistake. They are otherwise fun encounters that reset over time. If you attack them at night, you instead have to steal a key and free the slaves from their barracks, and as far as i can tell, the guards WILL NOT harm them, making this a far safer route\n\n\nAnd that about sums it up! for the price you get a different combat style than Black flag, a decent, if cliche little story, and the chance to slice up some really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ men.\n\nIf you have specific questions about game content, feel free to ask! I know it can be hard to find if a game has little specific things you want.","May 22, 2015","true","17.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Didn't take me long to beat it, and was one of the worst video game endings I've ever seen as far as development, closure, and appeal.\n\nFor $3.75, it's about what you pay for. Anything more is a waste. I'm going to pretend Assassin's Creed Revelations was the last AC game, because these last few games have sucked pretty bad. AC:4 didn't even feel like an AC game. It felt like "AC Mechanics as a Pirate!," even though pirates are the main people Ubi likes to appeal to with Uplay using more CPU and RAM reasources than Origin and Steam combined.","April 11, 2015","true","7.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"

The map is very small.  There is not a lot of diversity in the game play.  No "current time" out-of-the-animus story line.

I played the first one and was ok with it till the game ramped up the difficulty and made it a bore to get from point a to b; about 2 thirds of the way through the game.  I bought this game to see if maybe i would like assassins creed after being so many years that maybe they might have added something that would change the game towards my liking and this is a review of my experiences so far at about 2 hours in.\n\nso first thing i noticed was that i just jumps you into the game in ship movement with some combat with no tutorial.  i say to myself ok this is an expand-alone from black flag maybe it's more for experienced assassins creed players.  i get through the ship part barely because even though i have the required hardware even more in some areas, the game runs like complete @$$.  i tried lowering the setting and even going all the way down it still ran like cr@p.  i reinstalled and updated my drivers to have not alot of improvement, but that could be my machine.  i get into the game and it's still the same thing as the first game, nothing is different.\n\nthe A.I is so dumb and doesn't investigate sounds or looking at one of their friends dying that i just ran into the plantation assassinated almost everyone till the last 4 people spotted me which were easy enough to kill and then went and did the quest.  in the town i can kill all of the overseers in front of other people and they just look at me then walk away, no going to get guards or anything.  the combat is almost too simple as to be insulting as when someone is about to shoot you with a gun you get a context button for a human shield even though i never saw someone start to aim a gun and it becomes automatic.\n\nthere are some good things i like about the game like how much mystery there is going on in the story with the main character intercepting the templar package and having to go and investigate everything and helping to free slaves and make a rebellion; not much of a spolier because it's like the second mission. and i also like the fact that the game is set in an era of histroy sensitive to most americans without being demeaning or throwing around racial slurs because it's time accurate; as to my opinion Im not an expert on how african american culture will look at this game.\n\nMy final thoughts in summation is that if you like assassins creed you'll probably like this game. I have seen a few bugs which might be able to be corrected with a new driver patch or even waiting for the game to get patched.  however if you don't like assassins creed like me looking to see has it changed in these years, is it better, do you want a challenging stealth assassin game that feels fresh; im gonna have to say avoid.  $15 is a good price to see for yourself if youll like the way assassins creed has gone since the first one and sadly this series has gone nowhere fast, and i will not continue playing the game because it just like the first one made me bored to death.","February 26, 2014","false","2.1"," 105 of 338 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","105","338","0","11"

There are times when you can either play stealthily or mow anyone down (although with a penalty) so there is some variation in play styles.\n\nTo those who also enjoy the ship portion of AC 3 and AC4, this game comes with a significant portion of that but it's not really that important.

Also, the side quests (related to saving slaves) were very entertaining as there were different ways to do it.\n\nI only wish the game was longer.

Unfortunately, I found the story uninteresting and sometimes confusing. For example, Bastienne, the owner of the local brothel, will like Adewale at the beginning of one scene, then seem to hate him at the end for something he said, and then seem like she's in love with him the next time they meet without explanation or justification.\n\nThen, there are the missions. Most of the missions are about as good as a middle of the road mission from Black Flag. The worst missions, however, are either boring or frustratingly difficult because of annoying placement of enemies or weird technicalities (Why do I have to swap a ship manifest WHILE two enemies are looking at it? Why can't I swap it while it's sitting unguarded? You know, as logic would dictate?)\n\nIf you enjoyed Black Flag, and you're wondering if you should play this game, just pass.

I didn't bother doing any of that because i just wanted the story to be over and done with so i could go play something else which aint a good thing.

Adewale is a black former slave from the old English-French-American triangle-trades where the blacks were used as slave to pick cotton, and different plants for plantage owners. Your main goal in this game is to free other (black) slaves.\n\nLike 70% of the gameplay is to free slaves, and a bit is the old piracy from AC:IV where you steer another pirate ship just like in AC:IV but with Adewale as the captain onboard. It's some real fun if you didn't have enough of AC:IV. And myself, I miss AC:IV after finishing it because I feel that something more besides the campaign mode would be much appreciated. Like all non-standalone AC's, there's a bad multiplayer mode and I feel that this game fill up my needs for the piracy-part sequel I've always wanted.. And yes I know there's lots of piracy-ship games for onlineplay, but nothing with the graphics of the amazing AnvilNext gameengine. I do recommend this game if you're a fan of Assassin's Creed but likes the piracy-ship part of AC:IV more than the newer games like I for example.","February 3","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Freedom Cry suffers from the same issues that all these little filler titles in the series face. It is small in scale, meaning that from the grandiose Black Flag Caribbean, you now get to basically explore a rather small Port-au-Prince, some plantations and beaches and a single wreck. It is less polished, with a fast and easy story whose completion comes rather swiftly and without much diversity. Lastly, the characters don’t give off the same attraction as in the main titles of the series.\n\nThe above is not to say that Freedom Cry doesn’t have its good aspects. The weapon and upgrade acquisition mechanics have been simplified, to the extent where they liberate the player from grinding money to acquire a new weapon or a ship upgrade, taking a menial task of a player’s shoulders and allowing for more slave – freeing. Which, slave – freeing, is done with ample use of your machete and blunderbuss, adding to this loose yet deadly feeling of the title. There is a liberating feeling on just hacking and scatter-shooting your way through the streets, while at the same time freeing the unfortunate slaves paraded about. Adewale is also pretty cool as a character, though he lacks an adequate support cast.\n\nThe controls are the same as in Black Flag, so if you’ve been there, you can jump right in here. There is also some nice music and signing, appropriate for the culture of the people ferried in as slaves to the plantations, which gives a nice feeling of change to the previously known Europe-based musical scores. The game remains definitively easy though, with almost nothing to offer in terms of difficulty, challenge and replayability.\n\nFreedom Cry is by no means a bad game. It is just too small and limited in scope for me to be able to recommend it as a purchase to someone, as not playing it doesn’t really deprive you of anything.","July 13, 2015","false","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wish they had done more with the story and the character of adewale though because the concept is great. You are liberating slaves and this was the games chance to tell a really good and emotional story but they failed to do that.The main story is only 3 hours long but there are extra islands to explore and collectables which should add a few more hours. I didn't bother doing any of that because i just wanted the story to be over and done with so i could go play something else which aint a good thing. Unless you are a massive fan of black flag i see no reason to play this, even if you are a massive fan this dlc doesn't do much to flesh out the story of the main game because there is barely any story at all.\n5/10 (Average)","October 30, 2015","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had fun playing it. Adewale is so cool, he was born a slave and escaped to become an assassin. Now he's coming back to the carribian as captain of his own ship to end slavery in Port au Prince. Adewale, like all the characters in this game, is a very strong and interesting character. The story, however short, is well written, suspenseful, and griping. You also get to steer your own ship and engage in fights oversea.\n\nThese are all the things I enjoyed about the game. But here's where the game falters.\n\nThe first thing I'd like to point out is how very poorly optimized the game is; in every meaning of the phrase. The graphics are beautiful, but if you have them turned up as high as the they can go, the game runs as slowly as a stop-motion animation film. (and I don't mean slower THAN a stop-motion film, I mean slower than MAKING a stop-motion film.) to get the game to run on a playable level, I had to either put all settings as low as they could go, or completely turn off everything. (and I do mean everything) This was the first time I ever had to play a game windowized. The only thing I could play with, was the Vsync.\n\nThis game was my introducion into the assasin's creed universe. So I had absolutely no experience with how to use my weapons, perform parkour, or really interact with anything. The game has no tutorial. I just trial and errored my way through, and after two hours of playing, running, climbing, ship piloting, and purposely getting into fights just to read all of the options that flashed before my face, I had about an 80% understanding of how to control my character and how to pilot my ship.\n\nIn addition to this, the controls are just... weird. This game was meant to be played on Xbox, with an Xbox controler. But I don't have an Xbox, so I just use my keyboard. The keyboard and mouse controls do what they're supposed to do most of the time, but sometimes, they cause your character to do things that you didn't tell them to do. I once tried to run up behind two people and double assassinate them, but no matter how much I clicked, my character just ran right past the guys, right in front of their faces. Those guys then sounded the alarm, and beofre I knew it, I was in a fight with 10 guys. and speaking of which...\n\nThe combat. I managed to win that fight with the ten guys. Most of the time when gaurds attack me, only one attacks at a time, and the rest just stand around waiting for me to defeat their friend before jumping in one at a time. I've been able to easily defeat an entire ship of guys by myself. And not because I'm skilled, but because my opponents just really don't seem to know what they're doing. (how did these guys become drafted in the military?)\n\nShip piloting: Again, a tutorial on how to fire my mortars; as well as my fire barrels; and how to use my swivel cannons, would have been very useful.\n\nOverall, combat feels unengaging and boring. When I'm playing the game I don't feel like I have complete control over my characters actions, which is also unengaging. It kinda sucks having to play a game that has a reputation for good graphics, yet I have to turn them all down to make it playable.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't reccomend this. Not on Steam anyway. Assassin's Creed is made for Xbox and meant to be played on Xbox. So if you want it, get it on Xbox. Not on Steam.","May 16","false","53.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

It is an excellent DLC for what I think is one the best installment of all Assassin's Creed Series. Just the fact that you get to sail again is great (although, sadly, there are no sea shanties), but there is also a lenghty campaign story and lots of sidequest to keep you interested for about 10-12h, or less if you do not care for 100% completion. I recommend this game if you have already played Black Flag. If not, please play the main game first as it is definitely worth it, even if you do not like Assassin's Creed. Yes, it is that good.","April 15","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I get the fact that Adewale is helping the maroons and everything, but what else?! I was hoping for more insight to his life, because when I played Black Flag, I felt his story had to be heard. Slightly repetitive gameplay in terms of slave rescue missions. It took me approximately 10 hours to complete the game with 100% sync. Plus, I think we could manage knowing the other characters a bit more. But good effort by Ubisoft.","April 9","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But after many years of piracy he decides now is time to put the Creed’s name to a good use and begin a new fight and the liberation of slaves, helping the resistance called The Maroons for independence and dignity, Adéwalé and his skills turn out to be of great help to the resistance. Before leaving, he helps building a new hope for the slaves.\n\nGameplay\nThe game mechanics don’t change that much compared to Black Flag, though some new load-out for a new assassin is required as per usual, for Adéwalé we have now some powerful weapons like the blunderbuss and machete, while the blunderbuss is a one-shot gun, its power doesn’t have match, it is a slow weapon but once you have multiple enemies facing you, one blow will kill most of them, if not all, making it a death fest every time you pull the trigger.\n\nOn the other hand, the machete is kind of new to us, we have mostly used swords before, but Adéwalé with machete in hand makes him, perhaps the most brutal and relentless fighter of all assassins in my opinion, he is just a beast and the killing animations are proof of it, a good tool for a great and skilled killer.\n\nMany other things remain the same, there are not many differences, smoke bombs, the rope dart and the poison and sleep darts are kept, a small addition were the firecrackers that will help you with guards at some point in the story, besides that, the game remains almost the same.\n\nNaval combat is the same as well, and the map is very limited, but makes sense, this game is not that long and the exploration is restricted to some few islands and locations.\n\nThe interesting part of this game is and will always be slavery, our struggle is focused on the liberation of slaves, there are plantations in different parts of the map which can be raided and liberated, this will help you unlock new items and missions and also bring new people to the resistance, also during naval combat you will encounter enemy ships carrying many ore slaves, this ships cannot be attacked but they will always have protection. In the main city, small groups of slaves can be liberated as well, either from punishment, caging or auctions.\n\nGraphics\nThere are not many things to say on this point, it looks the same as Black Flag, equally beautiful, so if you want to know more, read my Black Flag review.\n\nSound and music\nThe sound remains identical to Black Flag as well, voices are full of passion and the accents are great. On the music side, we have some new sounds and tunes that are related to the culture, some sort of African like melodies with chants in French, this makes the atmosphere of the game and the slavery theme. Awesome.\n\nThe bad\nWhile ACFC remains bug free and found no issues in-game, I really believe that some few things could have been different to my taste. For example, after liberating plantations, a good idea would have been to destroy at some point certain plantations, setting them on fire or destroying the crops, making them a waste of time to rebuild, this came to my mind after seeing how many times x plantation had a new owner after a few minutes, making it an endless loop of liberation, makes sense, yes, slaves were a profitable business back then and at some point someone will bring more and more, but stopping them once and for all would have been more satisfying in the end.\n\nFinal words\nACFC is a good game on its own, it doesn’t have the same spectrum as previous titles and the character is not developed in depth, but that is not a problem when it comes to action and the brutal way we kill enemies. There are some scenes that truly show how slavery was back in that time, it was terrible and at some point you can see how the life of the slaves was regarded as disposable by the masters and the empires. There are heartbreaking moments to say the least.\n\nAll in all, it was an enjoyable game, with more pros than cons, new tools and weapons and a very satisfying gameplay, Adéwalé is a killing machine!","January 8","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
