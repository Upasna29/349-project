Especially with Crystal Souls, he's taken the best of fan mods to Escape from the Pit and put his own twist on them, bringing a hugely fun fantasy RPG adventure with very tactical turn based combat.  The difficulty settings make it so that everyone can have the level of challenge they want, even switching mid game if a particular fight gets too hard for you or you decide you've got the hang of it.  He's really tightened up the UI in general since the old days too, making the flow a lot smoother.\n\nThe skill trees provide diversity without being confusing, it's easy to see what kind of characters you want and go straight for it.  Magic sometimes feels overpowered, but there's always the enemies that are nearly immune to it, making a balanced party makeup helpful and desirable the whole time through.\n\nThe story in the original Crystal Souls game was excellent, and just like the remake of Escape from the Pit, Vogel is keeping the best parts intact while introducing multiple new areas and bosses to the game.  I could go on for a while, but I think I'll just close with the fact that even the games of Vogel's I was sure I didn't like I ended up loving when I tried them, so you really just can't go wrong if you think you're at all interested.","January 14, 2015","true","115.7"," 184 of 201 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","184","201","6","20"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daex33/recommended/337850/","daex33","Daex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daex33/","753 products in account","Excellent old-school RPG with turn based combat. As the case with other Spiderweb Software games, it's slightly difficult to recommend though. The game delivers in terms of great world to explore, character development and interesting story as well. However, for people used to current generation of RPGs with full voice-over, character personality, choices, it may be difficult to get into this. It is really closer to Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale type of experience. Coupled with the isometric 2D graphics entire dialogue and quest content is delivered through huge amount of text. Don't get me wrong - story is excellent, but from experience trying to share Avernum series with friends, it really isn't everyone's cup of tea. So, please take my (and others') recommendation with a grain of salt.\n\nThe game is natural step forward from the previous remake (Avernum: Escape From The Pit) and while minor upgrades are there, it mostly plays and looks the same. Unfortunately, some of the interface problems are still there, for example the infamous inventory issue is still there (when you press "I", inventory opens, but you can't close it with "I"), but these are truly minor in my opinion.\n\nIt's worth to mention that when it comes to system requirements, you can probably play this on your washing machine too, so if you are stuck somewhere with a decade old laptop or something, you can probably play this game without problems.","January 15, 2015","true","82.3"," 77 of 85 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","77","85","11","0"

I enjoyed it immensely and if you at all like Spiderweb games or turn based RPGs in the tradition of Ultima, then you should buy this now.\n\nThat said, it is slightly disappointing at times just how little is improved upon from EFTP to A2:CS and how, in other aspects, the game takes a few step backwards.  A2:CS fixes none of the glaring interface issues from EFTP.  While the terrible pathfinding can perhaps be given a pass (as it would most likely require significant rewriting of the engine), other minor problems are less excusable: the right mouse button still cannot be mapped to actions (no scroll wheel either), the buttons that open the inventory still do not also close them, and despite the MASSIVE amount of screen space provided, you can still only map 4 spells/Battle Disciplines to the interface hotkeys.\n\nCombat also remains a slog at times, with tons of trash mob fights that can get incredibly tedious, especially toward the end of the game when leveling slows down and experience starts to mean less.  Many dungeons have large groups of enemies in every room, which often kills the fun of exploration and means lots of back tracking to towns to heal (especially since energy elixirs are a bit rarer than they were in EFTP).\n\nIn terms of steps backward, its boss battles are, by and large, pretty forgettable.  Most Avernums, and EFTP was no exception, tend to throw in a few gimmicky or puzzle like boss battles to keep things interesting and make you change strategies from fight to fight.  But A2:CS pretty much sticks to the tried and true, "Dude with tons of hitpoints attacks hard and summons waves of minions as you reduce his health."  It does introduce more area of effect mechanics (such as bosses who cover the floor in fire or ice damage), but it uses them sparingly, and apart from one notable exception, most bosses are susceptible to most types of damage.\n\nThat said, I don't mean to give a bad impression of the game from harping on all its negative points without listing its positives (which are myriad).  So I’ll end with a random list of the game’s delights:\n\n-Maxing out Pole Arms and Hardiness on Mages and Priests to create invincible damage dealing tanks with adrenaline rush (i.e. the ability to attack 3 times in one turn).  You aren’t really playing until your Priest can take 5 polearms to the face and live to cast level 3 “Divine Retribution” 4 times in one turn.\n\n-Doomguard fights\n\n-Random 90s sitcom references (“Absolutely Fabulous,” anyone?)\n\n-Doomguard fights on speed (and also on speed in the game)\n\n-Buying 2 levels of gymnastics for everyone endgame just to scratch an OCD itch in your brain\n\n-Leaving a bottle of Almarian wine in an empty room in a Dharmon Inn for your hommies who have gone before","March 9, 2015","true","104.8"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","40","44","4","0"

This is a game that rewards you for exploring every nook and cranny in towns, the wilderness and dungeons. There's almost no end to the secret passages to find, locks to pick, chests to loot, and lizardmen to skewer. I'm not kidding. If you aren't checking every dead end, or looking behind every wall, you're likely missing something.\n\nThe dungeons are usually filled with a handful of interesting combat encounters, and the turn-based combat is solid. There's plenty of spells, martial abilites, lots of the expected consumables (scrolls, potions, wands), special traits, and skill trees that allow for a classless system while still encouraging you to specializes your party members. Enemies tend to have special abilities that make combat interesting and usually more dangerous, such as poison, damage auras, slowness, elemental immunities, and so on.\n\nIf you like classic RPGs, lots of exploration, and tactical combat, and don't need the latest graphics, I suggest picking this up!","January 15, 2015","true","41.0"," 47 of 57 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","47","57","3","0"

If you have, I'd skip it.\n\nI really, really, really want to like this game.  I've played every game that Spiderweb has put out since the mid-90s, from the first Exile game.  But this one I really can't recommend.  Short version: this game just feels kind of lazy.\n\nFor me the biggest issue is that Spiderweb really doesn't try anything that new with this one.  There are a few additional areas and big fights, but that's really it, which isn't really enough for a third incarnation of the same story; the game is, for the large part, mostly the same as it was in the previous incarnations.  If you've played either Spiderweb's Avadon or Geneforge series (both totes recommended, especially Geneforge), then you known how many choices you face in those games and how intricate the outcomes can be.  Nothing like this has been included in the updated Avernum games, where it is sorely needed.\n\nNobody plays Spiderweb games for pretty graphics, but there are some things here which I think are just not cool.  Many, many, of the enemy models are also just recolors, some of them used six or seven times, with very few new models introduced from the recent Escape game. If you go and look at the sprite sheets for the original Exile games, which are very lovely pixel art, you can see the huge variety of characters.  A lot of the models are also from older Spiderweb games, some going back 15ish years, and the newer and older models reallly don't go well together  -- it's painfully obvious which are newer and which are older.  Again, it just feels kind of lazy.\n\nThere's lots of text I remember reading in Exile II, which says something very good about the writing that I can remember it over 15 years later, but using so much text again just feels kind of cheap.\n\nIf you never played Exile II or the first Avernum II, then you may want to go ahead and play this game, but I'd skip it if you've played either.","January 27, 2015","false","79.9"," 84 of 119 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","84","119","5","5"

Not the fancy 90's, either, way behind BG1. Still, the lack of graphical fanciness, voice acting or physics does allow for a really huge gameworld, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of towns, handcrafted dungeons and combat encounters. The Avernum games (or Avadon, or Nethergate or any of the latest Spiderweb games ported to the new engine) all look cleaner, more functional and less eye-rippingly ugly than (for instance) Wasteland 2.\n\nSo far, I've played Avadon 1-2, Avernum: Escape from the Pit and this. This one is probably the best of the lot, insofar as the combat and dungeons both feel... inventive. Not quite as many "yet another dungeon, yet another bunch of ice/fire/giant/brain/plague/tomb/undead/\nfrenzied/rabid/guardian/ruby/flying/cheese rats" to be found. About half the dungeons have an interesting and memorable gimmick to them, a lot of combat encounters have something interesting and unique going on, and your own powers can combine in ways other than "more damage, better defense".\n\nThere's less talking and more dungeon-delving than in the Avadon games (maybe not on an absolute word-count basis), and what there is is mostly functional "go to place, do thing" but it does shine on occasion. "We found this weird orb and broke it. What did it do?" sort of stuff. The Giant Friendly Spiders - designated wacky comic relief mascots that they are - are actually really well written and funny.\n\nThere are some bugs and interface issues - the game's creator is apparently very reluctant to listen to feedback, so stuff like "the open loot screen button doesn't also close the loot screen" has been in 4 games now, and I'm not sure if there are fewer problems or if I'm more used to them by now - but nothing exceptionally annoying. (For instance, haven't used up a single consumable item while trying to move them in this game. Just me being more careful, or an interface change?)\n\nOverall, if you're interested in a decent and diverse dungeon-delver than can be run on a toaster, I recommend this game.","July 23, 2015","true","71.3"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","27","28","2","0"

You now control a smaller party of four adventuriors, where in the past you could field as many as six. That's right, you used to be able to change your party size. You could even take the crazy route and try to solo the game. Not anymore.\n\n2. Food. In the past you needed food in order to survive, needing to either stock up or forage as you go in order to not die of starvation. Now, food is just a weak healing item.\n\n3. Spells have been completely revamped. One noticable absence being persistant area effect attacks. You could, for example, lay a field of ice shards that damages any who enter or remain in the field, creating an artificial barrier as it were. Most of the spell effects seem to be copy pasta from their other games... Fire bolts, buffs and the like.\n\nIt isn't a bad game. Far from it.

You control a group of 1 to 4 characters and travel from town to town completing quests. Mostly exploring towns/caves, killing mobs, gathering loot, selling loot, rinse and repeat.

None of them have been negative, but it’s their approach to character development that usually sets the tone for their games. Avernum 2: Crystal Souls lands on the “correct” side of the formula for me. I haven’t completed the game, but feel I’ve got enough time in the game to give the internet my opinion. (I only wish Steam would update time played when off-line.)\n\nAvernum 2 starts in the depths of Avernum where the top-side dwelling Empire has decided to not let the banished people below the surface live after an assassination attempt on the ruler of the Empire. (Makes sense.) The people of Avernum fought well enough, but even with familiarity of the area the Empire slowly worked down their defenses. You show up with three others hoping for some glory in fighting for your homeland and instead find manual labor. There’s nothing as fancy and digging tunnels for the greater good eh? Also, some mysterious barriers popped up all over the land and nobody seems to know where they came from. (That’s the beginning story in a nutshell. They flesh it out better in the game.)\n\nYou are eventually tossed into the fight against the Empire, the fight against some other factions and people groups that also live underground and are also charged with figuring out who in the world created the magical barriers that are now disrupting some access to and from numerous places in the underworld. You set off on your journey to explore the huge world of Avernum. Even though I’ve played other Spiderweb Software’s games, the world size always seems daunting. The kicker is I love to explore everything… you never know when you could stumble onto a secret room with gear that will knock your socks off. You’ve got to touch everything, don’t you? Of course you do!\n\nGoing back to character development, it’s done a little different here. In other games like Avadon 2, I feel like your character had more personality and that helped drive the story through your character. In Avernum 2 your character kind of “lacks” personality. It’s not that it’s not there, but it really is given by you, the player. In Avernum 2 the story carries the story (for lack of a better word) and isn’t dependent on a specific protagonist. So this is neat, there’s no real chance of you not liking your character (unless you choose a human with a blue robe and expect it to look different from what it does and then realize that you can’t change it after you find out that it is weird-looking…. but I’m not bitter… much. Also, I’m not sure if the Character Editor allows you to mess with the look, but it taunts me into not touching it so I’m not sure what that feature does.) The reason that you can’t conceivably dislike your character is that you are the one making the choices and making the personality. So if you don’t like your main character, for the most part, it’s all on you and not the developer. It’s also important to note that so far, you seem to be a group of four with the same mind. Individual party members may be called out for their heritage, but you are the mouth of the group. It’s a very interesting method and I kind of like it.\n\nMoving on, Avernum 2 is a tactics game. Some fights you can face-roll through, but some fights will definitely punish you for not setting up your battlefield in your favor ahead of time. There are a few ways of doing it be it summoning creatures or buffing right before a fight. The difficulty of this game is hard for me to measure. If you want a challenge now and then, play on the normal setting. There are fights that just came out of nowhere to me and just wrecked my party something fierce while others were just a “who do I want to kill first” type of difficulty. If you want to enjoy the story, play on casual. That’s what I’m doing and there are still tough fights, but for the most part it allows me to enjoy the story more and get to more of it quickly. With the game being as long as it is, I’d like to experience more of it sooner. (Keep in mind that I like to explore everything.) I don’t even want to think what the Torment difficulty is like.\n\nI’ll hit on the aesthetics just for the fact that some may not fully appreciate the look, but I’ll say it again that I totally dig it. There is an added bonus that I hadn’t really thought of until recently. I’ve been doing a lot of work on my netbook recently and let’s just say it’s not a beefcake of a computer. It is, however, the only thing I’ve got that’s portable and can use while at lunch at work (where most of my playtime has been). I’m not able to play full-blown heavy-graphic games, but with the Spiderweb’s choice of graphics I’m able to play a full-scale RPG with a great story on the go. That’s awesome! I believe they even put the Avadon series on tablets; how great is it to get a great RPG like that for a tablet?\n\nScore: Gewd.\n\nSpiderweb Software has a distinct way they develop games. Love them or leave them, they are great games. If you like RPG’s with a good story-line, then you can’t easily go wrong with any of them. This time, the flavor happens to be Avernum 2: Crystal Souls. I like the story and the writing and since the personality is me, I like the characters as well. The skill-trees are much the same from their other games (which is good) and the music is still well done. Avernum 2 is well worth your money if you are looking for a solid, large RPG and one that you can take on the go and still have it accessible if you don’t own a monster of a laptop.","April 5, 2015","true","3.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahandshoe/recommended/337850/","ahandshoe","Toast PPR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahandshoe/","275 products in account","Last summer my good friend from across the pond Stevie reviewed the title from Spiderweb Software entitled Avadon 2: The Corruption. After reading that review I had to appreciate what the developer was attempting to do, in a sense capturing the heyday of PC role playing games in a generation of gaming that has all but abandoned the old ways. Now I find myself with the similar task of reviewing another sequel, Avernum 2: Crystal Souls. After almost thirty hours of playtime with the title I can echo similar sentiments from Stevie’s review, however what Avernum 2 lacks in presentation and mechanics it certainly makes up for in story and exploration.\n\nThe moment the title begins to load, it is apparent that the developer has chosen to capture the look and feel of classic top-down adventures similar to Baldur’s Gate and other entries in the Forgotten Realms series of games. Sadly however the graphics of a game that released in the late nineties looks and animates better than Avernum 2 does. I am unsure if this was an intentional move on the part of the developer or if the budget was just not accommodating to force the developers into having characters and environments as bare and lacking as what is in this entry. It is hard to ignore the barren appearance and because of that I am almost certain that many players would skip spending the $20 to jump into this world.\n\nHowever once the text begins to populate the screen the story really can hook the player into an experience that can have many twists and turns and smart writing with clever dialogue and interesting characters. I can understand that this can take a leap of faith and many may just not be able to sustain playing through the game on just words and story alone, however after recently becoming more involved in pen and paper RPG’s I was very eager to see what sort of trouble my group of unlikely heroes could get into. The world that is discovered through the multiple paths and hidden areas tells a tale of many nations stretched across dozens of towns and underground lairs, each with a population that may either become friend or foe depending on the choices the player will make. It became very hard at times to follow the core storyline however since picking up so many side quests derailed the progress of what was the current objective.\n\nSadly the user interface was clunky at times like this, where bringing up a map and the objectives that were currently opened were always on two separate screens. This was unfortunate to continuously open and close several screens just to figure out where I was and where I was meant to go, all while having hardly a clue as to where I was in the world due to the game making the world small as my group traveled in a very unfriendly overworld map. Utilizing the mouse to navigate the map at first was unbearable, and would jump out of control every time I attempted to click on a new area to explore. However after messing with the resolution and taking the game out of the windowed mode, it became easier to control. The point and click mechanics were easy to learn, although I did tend to rely on it too much during gameplay, where learning the keyboard shortcuts would have made gameplay more fluid and progress would have not suffered as much as I tried to click on whichever area I wanted to access. This is a flaw on my part however, not the game itself because I am sure that a veteran of playing this style of game or just being a core PC gamer would have picked up the control scheme very quickly. Apparently I have much to learn when it comes to taking on titles inspired by classic turn based games such as Avernum 2.\n\nWith the adventure in Avernum complete for the time being, I look back on the group of exiles that were brave enough to fight back against a cruel empire and I cannot help but think that this can be also be an analogy, albeit a forced analogy of Spiderweb Software. Although they may not have the presentation or timeframe to produce a title in the RPG space similar to other developers such as BioWare or Obsidian Entertainment, this group is still making the games that they have been known for since the mid-nineties, and it is something to appreciate. However we must also acknowledge that other developers will evolve and attempt to change the genre, whereas the developers of Avernum 2: Crystal Souls have struggled with the undertaking of fixing the control scheme and user interface of a title that could have benefitted greatly from smoother gameplay and operating the various menus with ease. As egregious as these problems may be, it is still an experience that I believe many fans should try, even if it may not be as visually alluring as titles such as Pillars of Eternity or Divinity: Original Sin. I for one am pleased to have had the chance to play a throwback to an adventure like Avernum 2: Crystal Souls, problems and all.\n","March 29, 2015","true","24.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

High-end RPG elements and a fun game to try and solo. Lots of secret areas and good reasons to actually get skills like cave lore, and others. I like to compare this to BG2:SOA it feels to me like a successor. It's got a great story and pretty cool how there is a lot of places to explore.\n\nPersonal Gripe:\nI wish there was more utility when it comes to the mage and maybe even allow for non-cheese solo play. I tend to gravitate to a competitive solo-run because with a party it is really too easy. Blink is an insane spell to have on a mage but, since you can only really cast once a turn unless hasted or potted it's really hard to distance yourself as a mage.\n\nI feel like in these types of games you should be able to solo if you understand the mechanics enough. Then again I am not the dev and TBH they did a fantastic job with the strengths and weaknesses of each class.\n\nConclusion: If you don't mind reading and near-perfect RPG elements pick this game up. It's literally the best RPG I've purchased in a while.","January 21, 2015","true","18.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I wasn't sold on the original incarnation of Avernum, but these newer updated rereleases are really good!  I sunk 50+ hours in Avernum: Escape from the Pit to do everything that was needed to fully complete the game, and I can see Avernum 2: Crystal Souls taking at least that long.\n\nI will admit that I was originally disappointed in the way they reduced the number of party members from 6 to 4 and reduced the statistics and magic system from the original Exile series (there were far more stats to sink Skill Points into, and it cost money to train them, and there were around 9 levels of spells in each discipline with up to around 10-13 spells per level!).  However, once I got into the game, I realized that it actually works pretty well in this format.\n\nAs for Crystal Souls, I will say that coins can be hard to come by, even with selling every single thing that has value that you don't need.  Or at least that's how it is for me where I am right now.  Even with that, though, the game is very enjoyable and you get the chance to revisit many of the same places that you did in Escape from the Pit, though there are changes in basically all of them.

Perhaps not quite as good as the first game, but still worth playing.","July 5, 2015","true","57.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is your original classic old-school hard RPGS that gives you an amazing story and made with the care that only the OG indie developer Spiderweb Software could create.\n\nIf you want to play a fantastic RPG, get this.","December 15, 2015","true","72.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have a life to take care of.'  Gone are the young days when I wished games would never end.\n\nThis game is packed with content.  I'm maybe half-way through it and I'm standing at 38 hours of play time.  Then there's the replayability factor, since I like to have different kinds of party makeups.  This game is definitely worth it, if you like old school open world RPG's.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of the separation between realms for a part of the game, since it breaks that open world feel, but it's still a good game.  It reverts to a full open world experience after a while.","December 28, 2015","true","65.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics aren't exactly cutting edge, but Spiderweb Software is pretty much one guy, so cut him some slack. I played my first Spiderweb game, Exile III in 1998 and have been a fan ever since. However, you can pick this game right up without having played any of their other games, including the predecessor, Avernum: Escape From the Pit. Be warned though, you might start playing and suddenly realize it's 6:30 am and you have class at 10. Good game if you're a fan of RPGs, long games, caves, and mysterious alien races.","February 10","true","53.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
