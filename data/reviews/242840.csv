From the first moment of gameplay, I was pulled into this strange and mysterious world. I was so happy to finally play that I completely lost track of time.\n\nThere have been some complaints about voice recognition. So far, I have had zero problems with this. The system works great and responds quickly to my voice even if I don't always say the spell 100% correctly.\n\nHere are some problems I've personally encountered:\n\n1. Does not work with a second monitor plugged in for me. In order to play this game, I was forced to completely disconect my second monitor. Otherwise, the game wasn't starting up. Inconvenient, but not a deal breaker. I can deal with it.\n\n2. After unplugging said second monitor, the game was still crashing. However, I found that once I added "-windowed" to the startup options, I was able to load up the game in windowed mode and fix the resolution manually from there (apparently, that was what was causing the conflict). Make sure you have a microphone plugged in.\n\n3. The game periodically loses sound for no apparent reason. The cause is yet to be determined, but the only way I can get the sound back is to restart the entire game. Annoying, but again - not hate worthy.  I don't know what fixed this issue, but it's stopped happening for me.\n\nAside from these pitfalls, I've had a blast playing the actual game and would still recommend it despite a few bugs/glitches here and there. Contacting official support was a breeze and a response came within two hours of my email.","April 3, 2015","true","24.4"," 267 of 295 people (91%) found this review helpful 131 people found this review funny","91","267","295","131","16"

People looking for action should stay far away from this game as it's a slow methodical explorer with slight similarities to the original Myst, and you will get lost if you're not careful. It's a beatiful world to explore and take in the sights, even if you don't necessarily get lore or any idea of what truly the world has to offer. Backtracking can be a problem however, and the game does not hold your hand (similar to The Vanishing of Ethan Carter). In short, a game that's an alright experience to pick up on the cheap, if you're looking for a game that takes you through a journey of a wandering wizard.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/qNbhr_Jv9p0\n\nPlayer Match: Those who love to explore at a slow pace, taking in their scenery, and want to experiment with Microphone implementation in games.\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nThe perfect game for someone who loves exploring, and in particular, pays close attention to the details around them.\nThe world built is intriguing, and rather beatiful in it's artwork and lighting.\nVoice recognition of the game is implemented wonderful, and it offers options for those who may have trouble getting the default to work.\nStrong immersion factor.\n-:\nThere's no hand holding.

The graphics, controls, and atmosphere are superb. The voice recognition is great and casting spells by voice is a blast. Shame it's wasted on such a lame and incredibly obnoxious puzzler.\n\nI don't think I could design more annoying combat or puzzles if I tried. There's very little combat, and thank goodness for that because enemies are as much of a threat to your patience as to your health bar.  Either they're swarms of critters you have to either back away from awkwardly or whittle away, or they're poorly programmed humanoid enemies who spend half the time sitting there and half the time charging you, and only react to your spells half the time.\n\nAs for the puzzles and exploration, there's very little thinking involved. It's 5% thought, 10% trial and error, and 85% scouring every last area for some easily missed scribbling, statue, hidden mechanic, or other piece of junk you need. The map in the start of the second level is either completely unreadable or for another area, because I spent a good 10 minutes looking at it and looking around trying to orient it and figure out where I was. There's an area where you take damage as long as you stay there for literally no reason, with no indication except for a small grunt when you enter the area.\n\nYou barely even get to use your spells creatively.

Use your mic to cast spells, solve puzzles and protect yourself from the dangers of the temple with some pretty awesome spells. Having to remember as many spells as you can is a nice touch, rather than it just giving you a button to press to cast "spell A", for example, you have to remember the words. In a pinch, that's not always easy to do and fumbling the pronunciation can happen when you are in a rush, but the feeling of pulling these things off is fantastic. Definitely well worth the cost if you want something fresh and interesting and don't mind having to think a little.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldrenean/recommended/242840/","aldrenean","Aldrenean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldrenean/","556 products in account","Note: This is a borderline game, some people will really enjoy it in spite of its flaws, but I can't recommend it for the average consumer, as you will almost certainly need to look up a guide at some point -- read on for reasons why (no spoilers).\n\nThis game has a lot going for it, but as a puzzle game it's really let down by the level design. Your objectives are extremely unclear and though the levels are open, it only serves to confuse and frustrate, as you can't actually complete tasks out of order -- there is a very linear progression to each level, but you have to figure out what that is through trial and error.  That's fun when the game is asking you to figure out how to use your arsenal of spells to get through an area, but it's just annoying when you don't have the tool to solve a puzzle, and you can only find that out by banging your head against it for half an hour.  Multiple times so far I have looked up a solution for a room only to discover that I was in the wrong place and needed to go do something on the opposite side of the map. It adds nothing to the difficulty of the puzzles or the enjoyment of the game. I'm seriously questioning my resolve to finish the game at this point, since I know it will take me 2-3 times as long as it could have if levels were better designed and playtested.\n\nIf you have a high tolerance for obscure puzzles and obtuse level design, the voice-activated spells are truly unique and the game is a lot of fun. If, however, you're not an early adopter of new mechanisms, I would hold off on IVV for now -- maybe the levels will be reworked to be either more linear, or the open world will be given a purpose beyond stretching the game time.  If not, someone will steal the verbal spellcasting idea and put it in a better game soon enough.\n\n5/10","April 4, 2015","false","3.8"," 112 of 158 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","112","158","4","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chatoten/recommended/242840/","Chatoten","Chatoten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chatoten/","482 products in account","Quick Review: In Verbis Virtus does two things right: the visuals (mostly) and then the speaking mechanic. Unfortunately, I think nearly every other mechanic is either annoying or just dumb. The game should have been a pure puzzle game, but it does too much and fails.\n\nHere's what works: Using your voice to pick spells. This is literally the single best mechanic in the game. It works about 85-90% of the time, which may not sound great, but if the game had been a pure puzzle game that would not be an issue. In fact, I am fairly confident it could work in a game like Skyrim, where you have a little bit of leeway between enemy encounter and needing to be completely ready.\nYou can switch between the game's made up language and English for the spells, though the English versions are a little long.\nThe game will say the spells out loud to you if you need it.\nThe visuals. Not very original, and the glowy particles hurt my eyes a few times, (especially the save points) but otherwise the game looks good.\nNot having mana. All mana would do is slow you down and make puzzles unbearable, I am glad it was not included.\nHere's what is functional, for the most part: The atmosphere. It's dark fantasy, I guess. I wasn't actually paying too much attention, but there was magic, blood, and breasts. I can't say too much about the actual writing of the game, I skimmed through literally all of it, but the actual feel of the world is lackluster. It is very static, the only things that move are some rocks and the enemies, but most of the enemies take away from the experience so it doesn't matter.\nThe controls, in theory. As long as you are not doing timed puzzles and there is nothing around to hurt you they work just fine.\nThe spells. Like the visuals in that they were fancy, but not interesting. Not your average fantasy spells, but not very exciting either. I found a flashlight, a laser beam that you had to point directly at the puzzle object, a spell that was 100% contextual and just moved stuff for me, and a telekinesis spell that was dumb and clunky because it required two other phrases if you wanted to move things closer or further away.\nThe music, probably. I didn't really listen to it, but it wasn't offensive.\nHere's what doesn't work: Having health. I guess the no mana guy went to lunch because I don't see any logical connection in getting rid of mana, but not health in a puzzle game. In an action game sure, but this game is supposed to be about puzzles. All losing health does is make the game arbitrarily more difficult. The enemies and puzzles are kept pretty much completely apart, it would have been best if the enemies were removed or made part of the environment instead of kept as a real barrier to progress.\nThe controls, in practice. In order to beat the puzzles you have to be 100% on the target, and a lot of times it doesn't even make sense. Since the voice commands are only mostly accurate, having to really on quick reflexes is completely unfair because you can saying a command right but the game doesn't have to agree with you. In Verbis Virtus seems to be in on it too, spawning enemies to get rid of your health and then putting you in time trial death traps. This is infinitely compounded when you are using a controller. Sure, you can say "Just don't use a controller." but if the above issues were fixed it wouldn't be a problem. At best the controls in-game finicky and annoying.\nStory telling. It was either text dumps or cutscences, absolutely no atmospheric story telling. Okay okay, it isn't much reading, but the problem is you can ignore 95% of it with no problem until you run into a bad puzzle. This leads me into...\nThe game is either too upfront or not helpful in the least. The story is in the first camp, but the puzzles are in the latter. One puzzle is literally this: stare at the floor, walk into a statue, and then stare at this statue without moving for like 5 seconds. That is an awful puzzle, and I only would have known if I had read the text logs, which was unnecessary until that point.\nPlatforming. Not 100% awful, but overly difficult due to being in first person and just not necessary.\nThe puzzles. This should have been pretty much the only element of the game, but it isn't. Had the developers spent more time on the puzzles and less time on everything else (except the speaking mechanic of course) then I this game would be such an easy sell. I am not big into puzzle games, not at all, but in my 80 minutes of playing the game (which appears to be about 1/4th of the game or less based on achievements) almost all the puzzles were either reflecting a lazer or using a spell on the contextual green spot, if they weren't simply unsolvable without googling the issue. There was one puzzle that involved using boxes to hold a door up that I liked, every other puzzle sucked.\nAll of these negatives culminated on one puzzle and I could not go on. This puzzle required super precise controls and two second timing, where if I failed I died because my health was pretty much zero, and what was my reward? A completely new and entirely obtuse enemy murdered me. I am legitimately not sure if I could even damage this guy, but if I could it would have required super accurate aiming on my part anyways. I had no old saves to load to because making new ones required me bending over to use my keyboard, and reloading my only save left me with almost zero health and no other way to proceed but that awful timing puzzle. I had no other option but to quit.\n\nWhat should have been changed: The health bar should have been thrown away.\nThe enemies needed to be fundamentally different. They could have added to the a lot to the atmosphere, made the world feel alive. If all of the enemies were like the bat enemies, where they don't directly attack, but you can interact (i.e. kill) with them things would be much better. At least let me scare off the bug swarms with the flashlight instead of having to ineffectively laser beam away individuals who are only one part of massive groups. It feels like the enemies are from Metroid: Prime and it does not work.\nRemove any puzzle that requires precise timing or aiming. Unfortunately, that was basically every puzzle I faced so the dev team would need to do a serious rehaul.\nMake changes to the graphics options apply without a restart. Also give me an option to get rid of flashing lights if there isn't already one.\nMake the story less ambiguous and get rid of most of the cutscenes, or add more atmospheric story telling.\nI think the dev team lost focus of what they wanted to make. The game should have been either about puzzles or killing monsters, probably the former to be honest, but the way they mashed those two goals together doesn't work. In Verbis Virtus really is not that far away from a pretty good game, but the designers at Indomitus Games seem to lack discipline in their work. Actually, that probably isn't fair, maybe the publisher meddled too much or maybe the team had bigger ambitions and it fell flat; but in all honesty I'd rather see the spell selection mechanic sold to a bigger developer who could handle it better. I don't think In Verbis Virtus is worth your money. Maybe if you really want to check out the voice mechanic take a look, but don't spend more than five bucks.","May 27, 2015","false","2.1"," 105 of 152 people (69%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","69","105","152","6","5"

Am I happy having payed what I did for it? Am I looking forward to more?\n\nYes to all the above.\n\nThe first part of the game frustrated me. A lot. The level design leaves something to be desired. I spent a good deal of time at puzzles wondering "Am I not noticing something, or do I not have the proper spells to solve this problem yet?" On one hand it certainly helps immerse you in the role and really feel like you're exploring something strange and enigmatic; however, if you are frustrated easily this may turn you away early from what is otherwise a very enjoyable experience. I would like to see just a *little* something to help players know they are on the right track or properly equiped for the current puzzle. The second part of the game is a bit less linear and makes the game for me.\n\nI wanted to hate the game so much for the frustration I experienced early on but the setting and exileration of learning new spells just kept me hooked - I couldn't hate it. I was reminded of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and there is something almost Lovecraftian about the game. The graphics are beautiful, and the setting I could go on and on about. Suffice to say visually and thematically the setting is lovingly crafted. I don't think the verbal spell casting is not at it's full potential at this point in the game. On one hand it's very immerseive having to speak another language to cast, but, on the other hand, I don't feel there's enough about it yet to make me say that this game couldn't be the same WITHOUT verbal casting. I would like to see more depth added to the mechanics - such as further contol over spells using voice commands rather than using your voice JUST to cast.\n\nIf I come across as overly critical it's simply because I see a gem in In Verbis Virtus and I really want to see it polished so it can shine as much as I think it can.\nBottom line: I'm very pleased with In Verbis Virtus and I eagerly await everything the devs have in store for us. I think if you have a love for dark settings and puzzles your money will be well spent here.\n\n\n","January 3, 2015","true","66.0"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","37","43","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the-guardy/recommended/242840/","the-guardy","Guardy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the-guardy/","38 products in account","Do I recommend buying In Verbis Virtus?\nIf you like a) pretty things, b) puzzle platformers, c) very fun, innovative and actually working gameplay mechanics, and if you either aren't prone to ragequitting or don't mind doing it too much - yes, I absolutely do recommend you buy this thing.\nBut you might want to wait until the next sale if the game is not completely up your alley, like I did - just read on to find out if it is worth the full price to you.\n\n\nTechnical Stuffs\nThe game runs on my Dell Inspiron 15R laptop on high settings - the thing has a Radeon 7730m graphics card - without any problems - I very rarely get some framerate drops and the laptop runs somewhat hotter than usual, but as I wasn't quite sure if I could run the game at all, I was very surprised.\nI had one crash to desktop, which was most likely my fault, since I forgot to close my browser and its absurd amount of tabs before starting the game.\nThere was one bug, which others also experienced, going by the forums on here - at one point, looking down triggers something, which doesn't work reliably. Trying again seems to work, usually.\n\n\nVisuals\nOH MAN this game is absolutely visually stunning. The entire environment, every little bit of it, is hugely detailed. The lighting is also absolutely beautiful and atmospheric. Some parts almost reminded me of the chapel scene from Bioshock Infinite, except WAY more detailed.\nUnfortunately, it can become kind of straining to look at it for a long period of time, with the generally dark-ish surroundings and patterns and intricate details everywhere.\nLuckily, I usually ragequitted way before that happened, because I actually really hate puzzle games.\nThe fact that I'm recommending it regardless probably says a lot about the quality of this game.\n\n\nGameplay\nSo, as you might know by now, the Gimmicky Gameplay Feature is casting your spells by saying them out loud and hoping that nobody entered your room without you noticing, lest you'd feel a bit silly.\nThe voice recognition works surprisingly well - it's not 100% perfect, but you don't have to pronounce everything super precisely either.\nIn fact, I happen to be German, but I always play my video games in English - this one's no different.\nThat means I have to speak a Latin-esque conlang with a badly-faked american accent (in an originally Italian game, no less), which the game handles superbly well, too.\nThe voice casting doesn't just work very well, it becomes natural after a while. This should absolutely be a thing in most magic-using video games - it's actually easier than having to switch spells via hotkeys or a menu.\nOne big problem is having to remember the names of the spells (there's an option to switch from using the in-game language to normal English, which would probably be easier to remember, but where's the fun in that), which can be pretty difficult, especially in dangerous situations. You can easily look them up with one key press, but that's not a perfect solution either. I recomment sticky notes, to be honest. Or, you know, a reasonably good memory for vocabs. Otherwise you'll probably end up with a very impressive f-word-to-spells-ratio. I know I did.\n\nOn a slightly less positive note, the normal WASD-controls seem somewhat sluggish and imprecise - I normally wouldn't mind, but the game definitely has too many bottomless pits for that kind of thing.\n\nMy biggest problem, however, were the puzzles.\nNow, I absolutely suck at puzzle games, I readily admit that. If I had to beat a puzzle platformer to save my life, I'd probably start saving up for a tombstone.\nI didn't get the feeling that the puzzles were all that evil - challenging, yes, but I probably, maybe, might have been able to figure them out on my own eventually.\nIf not for the fact that you constantly have to use random items to solve the puzzles, which are usually hidden in some way, or just really hard to notice.\nDid I mention the super-intricate graphics? Yes? Now imagine finding one specific piece of clutter in that, especially if you're not even sure what you're looking for.\nI don't know if this is a general problem or if I'm just bad at this game, but to me it was hugely frustrating either way.\n\nAnother odd gameplay element is health regen.\nYou have a health bar. If it's empty, you're dead. You know the deal. That's a bit odd for a puzzle game, but since there are combat elements... sure, why not.\nExcept that there's no auto regen, and there's usually a pretty big distance between savepoints (yes, there's savepoints /sigh).\nYou mileage may vary on that one, but I hate the lack of auto regen and I really hate savepoints.\n\n\nConclusion\nI like it, it's a very well-made game - definitely one of the better indie games on Steam and, as far as 3D games go, most likely one of the best.\nI don't always agree with the devs' design choices, but it's still very enjoyable. Not a game I play regularly or for long periods of time, but I keep coming back to it, and I never regret doing so, despite my dislike for the genre as such.\nI can't really tell you whether you are going to like the game or not, but I'd honestly recommend picking it up if you can afford it. If nothing else, the visuals are certainly worth it.\nI'd also recommend you take the time to enjoy your journey - read all the journal entries, enjoy the scenery and don't rush it.","November 12, 2015","true","3.3"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","30","32","6","1"

Using the spells to solve puzzles, explore, and survive the perils of the temple. The game has amazing design, every detail of every room and puzzle looks abolutely beautiful!\n\nCasting spells with your voice works near flawlessly most of the time. I say most of the time, because depending on the quality of your microphone, you may run into some issues getting the desired results. I have a rather decent Turtle Beach Gaming headset, and some spells still give me trouble.\n\nThe lore of the game, is scattered about the temple, finding tablets will give you some interesting stories.\n\nYou have the option of speaking your spells in "Maha'ki" the language of the gods, or in English, the language of normal people.\n\nAs this is more of a puzzle game, don't expect to use spells for combat too often. You will occaisonally be given a monster to dispatch with your spells, but most of the time, it's just puzzle solving, and for good reason.\n\nThere ARE boss fights,3, to major bosses, and 1 mini-boss, but since most of your spells aren't meant for combat, it becomes increasingly hard to defeat the more deadly foes. Simply put, combat isn't the focus of the game, so it's not a strong point. It took me so long to defeat the first boss, and now that I have, I dread fighting the others, and it's for that very reason.\n\nThe music is great, and epic, and personally, i think it really fits the atmosphere.\n\nAnd lastly, I mentioned puzzles, Well, the puzzles are great! They're so simple, yet still require some effort and thinking in order to solve them.\n\nMost of the puzzles involve directing a beam of light through a colored gem to activate a mechanism, but this puzzle type gets more creative with each new spell.\n\nThere's a few unique puzzels, such as one where you need to distrubute water flow in a certain way.\nThere's even a monster that you fight that could be considered a puzzle, as you need to listen to it's voice, and cast the right spells to counter his own.\n\nSo, now it's time to list plainly, the pros and cons\n\nPros\n-Voice recognition works pretty well\n-It looks beautiful, in both design and graphics\n-Puzzles are simple, but still challenging\n-10 spells, each with their own unique uses\n\nCons\n-Combat is not a strong point, so it might become frustrating when forced to fight\n-If your mic isn't amazing, you will encounter some problems casting spells.\n-It's short, with only 3 chapters.\n-I don't see much replayability after the first playthrough\n\nAll in all, I think the devs did a wonderful job with this idea, and, despite its flaws, I actually do think it was executed quite well.\n\nIf you're looking for an interesting new game, with gameplay, and a unique concept, I can fully reccomend this to you, with a solid 9/10.\n\nJust be sure you invest in a microphone, or else you can not play it.\n\nHope you enjoy the review, and I hope it helps you make your decision","April 15, 2015","true","17.1"," 35 of 44 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","35","44","2","2"

The scenery is so stunningly beautiful that I've caught myself standing in one spot for minutes at a time just to watch the twinkles. The graphics can get a bit laggy in certain areas, but it goes away quickly. The sound ambiance is magical and creepy at the same time, made me feel like I was being followed or something was about to murder me.\n\nThe Maha'ki language failed to be recognised for me, even after pronouncing it the same as it was spoken to me. I sadly had to swap to English (which worked instantly) when I collected my first spell or I wouldn't of been able to advance in the game. It's a shame, I would of loved to gone through the game speaking the language of the creative deities.\n\nSome of the puzzles can be really frustrating, especially when there are no tips. More then likely you will have to look up what to do, which kind of sucks for those who like to do everything without help. But when you are stuck on one puzzle for an hour I think enough is enough lol.\n\nI would love to see more games like this on Steam. I am so glad this game came across the Steam store page or I would have never found it.","July 22, 2015","true","7.8"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","23","24","0","1"

Beautiful level design, tough puzzles, fun spells, and fascinating world.\n\nFelt a little odd at first, wasn't sure if it was just going to be a novelty thing or actually a cool game mechanic. Then I started to realize that I was having a load of fun and pushing myself to remember each spell so that I could recall it automatically should the need arise, and it definitely does.\n\nThe combat is a little different, but I think they did a good job given the way you have to fight. It can be tough to keep yourself from speaking too fast for the spell to activate when you are being threatened. I feel it was fairly forgiving because sometimes I'd be running away from something trying to rip my face off and say "Nomet Abul" or some variation instead of the Namet Atul teleport and it would still give it to me.\n\nOnly one that I consistently had trouble with was the fire spell Atul Aghni. But then again I played through the whole game without ever knowing that I could have made a voice profile that would have captured by pronunciation better than the default.\n\nSome people might think this is a gimmick game, but I think it is actually a step in the right direction for an adventure/puzzle game. Lots of potential for more spells, puzzles, combat scenarios, level design, you name it. The only negative thing I could say about this game was that I felt it was too short, as it left me wanting more. But that is just a byproduct of a good game.","May 31, 2015","true","16.0"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","29","35","0","0"

But luckily, there's a bar in the options to tone it down a bit so you can hear the other sounds better.\nPuzzles are quite hard to figure out sometimes. You really have to make use of the tiny grey cells you have up there.\nIt aint that clear what you have to do or where to go and you can sertainly miss important things if you just try to force your way trough!\nEven the clues to what you're supposed to do are easy to miss sometimes ;)\nThis might be a good game if you want to level up on your personal map making skills ( although not required since there are a few maps spread out, but it is encuraged ).\nNeat Credits! They were actually the first thing I watched, and I was impressed!\nAcievements are verry acievable. Most come naturally as you progress but there are a few you really have to work for.\nLike the 'Tomb Raider'... damn if I hadn't missed that obvious 'Call from Chaos' document at the entrance of the fiery room on chapter two...\nCons:Some spells can be tricky to cast... Oh, you could make your own voice recognition model... that fixes things!\nCombat. Well, let's just start off by saying: I kinda like it, but it has it's flaws...\nEven though it's not a huge part of the game, but this is actually also the only real downside I can actually find with this game.\nThe AI ain't all that bright. It's quite all right, it doesn't have to be much smarter than it is, but on some occations it feels as it could improve just a bit.\nI didn't enjoy all the 'safe spots' where monsters can't follow you for no apparent reason. They jus stand there at an invisible wall untill you pass trough it again... or till you safely pick them off one by one.\nMultiple 'Mark of Fire' should really be able to charge up to full potitential at the same time.So This is not that big of a deal, but I found that lightsources may seem like they're pointing in the wrong direction (at least the first one when you enter the temple), but only when: You stand in a patch where light shines and look at the source from where it's coming from. It sems like it's shining in another direction and you wonder what might be over there... you start walking towards it but when you get out of the lightpatch you were standing in, it dissapears and only shines at the patch you just were standing in.\n...also a few shadows in some tight spots might seem a little out of place or twitchy when using 'Lume Tial'.\nAlso not a real biggie, but I wish it had VR support... That would have been AWESOME!\nConnclusion:Would I reccomend this game:\nYes!\n...At full price?\n...then the answer would still definatley be; Yes!\n\nOk, it has some downsides...\nWell, the only real one I found was actually the combat.\nSo what about it?\nSure combat ain't such a big part of the game... and sure it's fun to 'Athul Aghni' a whole bunch of Saevars, wait till the runes reaches full potential and then say the magic words and watch as they perish in a beautiful display of fireworks!\n...but that can be a real pain to pull of...\nOn the other hand, even though it can be rather fun laughihg situation every time you find yourself shouting the wrong spell at stressfull times (not just in combat) and also feel really rewardning when you make it work.\n\nSo... even though the combat is it's only real downside. I still kinda like it, but it feels it could use a bit fine-tuning.\n\nBut all in all I think I'd probably sumarice it something like this:\n\nThis game has great atmosphere with an immersive spellcasting system and nonlinear level design that also at times has really clever and hard to figure out puzzles!","July 14, 2015","true","32.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","14","17","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baenlynn/recommended/242840/","baenlynn","Bænlynn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baenlynn/","298 products in account","If a game gets the important things right then I can forgive alot in terms of design and execution, and In Verbis Virtus leaves me overflowing with magnanimity toward it in spite of its obvious (and not so obvious) flaws. The atmosphere and tone of the game had me forgetting that I was wandering through an--at times--poorly designed maze because the sights that maze had to show me expertly sold the premise of the game: that this was a place where pilgrims underwent a rite of passage. Confusion, disorientation, exhaustion. . . these things are par for the course when it comes to religious experiences, and I can accept that as justification for all the backtracking I've done thus far. The resemblance of the temple's facade to the famous treasury building of the city of Petra was another wonderful touch, and the piecemeal revealing of our not-so-silent protagonist's backstory had me willing to suspend my disbelief from quite a height, even though I ocassionally had to check the internet for hints.\n\nIf you're thinking about buying this game for its unique selling point I can only say that if In Verbis Virtus has managed to pique your interest you will find your curiosity aptly satisfied time and again. Being able to directly communicate with the game world adds a unique layer of immersion to the story, and one which is not only easy to get to grips with, but well paced and thought out. Sure, being able to call down fire on your enemies is one thing, but being able to *literally* do it is another thing entirely. Yes it's a gimmick, but as a gimmick it is well executed and it showcases what more games can, should, and will be making use of in the future. One thing I would recommend is taking the time to generate a voice profile before you start playing. I haven't had an issue being understood, but I didn't bother with the defaults either.\n\nAll in all: In Verbis Virtus is one of those games that I can see myself playing over and over again simply because it really puts me right in the middle of the action. It is not perfect by any means, but what it doesn't do perfectly it still manages competently, and what it does differently it does exceptionally well.","May 10","true","3.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Thought it would be great for my YT channel especially as I like to hear myself talk.  I thought this would be a quick one video having phone with the voice activation then moving on....boy was I wrong!\n\nWhile the voice activation is a very fun feature of this game (especially when you can't remember a spell and are yelling out funny sounds) as you venture further other features will get you hooked.   I'll give you a quick rundown-\n\nGraphics-  These guys have truly mastered the Unreal Engine as the lighting, textures, etc. are just stunning.\n\nEnvironment-  As you get farther into the game you really start to enter environments/areas that are truly amazing.  I was so impressed by some of the areas I just stood there for a couple of minutes and took in all the detail..while looking over my shoulder of course!  The areas are not your usual blood and gore they are done in a very artistic yet creepy way that seems to even get better the longer you play.   Again using some original design coupled with the lighting, textures, etc. this games environments are truly amazing (even if they are not outside).\n\nSound-  Sounds are really good and there is a good balance between the music and ambient sounds.  I think the sounds could even be improved upon by adding a little more ambient sounds to add to the tension as you explore.  But a great start!\n\nGame mechanics-  No issues here movement is solid and the voice activation is spot on.\n\nI have some videos on my YouTube channel if you want to see the game maxed out and in 1080- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtEMFPsqo5Fq9X_CD1JKI1A\n\nLatest video showing some of the amazing areas-  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q_XMkBFyLE&feature=youtu.be","April 6, 2015","true","4.3"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","22","34","2","0"

I saw the trailers and thought; DAMN, old crypt in the desert, cast spells with your voice... awesome! While it definitly is awesome to do so and the spell casting via microphone works extremely well I feel a bit misleaded...\n\nThere are almost NO fights at all. And if there are fights they're more or less the same enemies or won by doing the same procederes. WHY? I ask? WHY??? Fighting using my voice was SO FUN!!! It really pushes you to remember the spells while trying to dodge, the fights felt so good... However 95% of the game were puzzles... It might be me but I just don't like videogame puzzles... I like board games, small mobile puzzle games but in a 3d game playing a mighty sorcerer in a super atmospheric underground temple? connecting hundreds of light rays via crystals? It might be so that I found them too hard. Some puzzles almost made me angry with their difficulty... Also in my area if you google "in verbis virtus ..." what follows is "walkthrough".\n\nWhatsoever I'll recommend the game, because I imagine if you like the concept AND you like videogame puzzles you'd buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rph133/recommended/242840/","rph133","Skye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rph133/","790 products in account","PROS:\n*Voice recognition works most of the time\n*Good spell variety\n*Beautiful environments\n*Good atmosphere\n*Appropriate music and mostly appropriate sounds\n*Lore is interesting for the most part\n\nCONS:\n*Too many puzzles where even the objective is unclear and where necessary items are hidden away\n*Voice recognition still sometimes fails, which can quickly lead to death during combat or dangerous platforming\n*Spell potential is untapped\n*Writing quality is inconsistent\n*Lore is conveyed entirely through easily missable "documents"\n*Some parts of puzzles are reset upon loading a save\n\nGAME LENGTH:\nIf the player follows a guide and has good luck with voice recognition, this game could last around 10 hours.  Achievement hunters will need a bit more time to hunt down all 35 documents.  Without a guide, this game could last over 20 hours.\n\nSCORE:\n6 out of 10\n\nThis game's best features are its voice recognition concept and implementation, visuals, and spell variety.  It is impressive to me that such a small team pulled all of this off.  Unfortunately, core design decisions regarding puzzles, combat, and direction dealt a serious blow to my enjoyment of the game.\n\nI like to know what my goal is in a puzzle game so that I can consider the tools at my disposal and develop a logical plan for how to achieve it.  I don't mind a bit of experimentation and exploration, but they are taken to extremes here.  Puzzles frequently lack clear objectives even when one is halfway through them, objects necessary to solutions are sometimes hidden away or meant for other rooms' puzzles, repeated platforming around death traps is often necessary to get perspective, it is not always clear if a player is equipped to solve a puzzle he finds yet, and the player frequently does not even always know what solving a puzzle will accomplish.\n\nOne room in the last chapter of the game stands out to me (spoilers ahead):  after going through several steps to lift or move platforms and open up floor and wall panels, the player is "rewarded" with a mysterious ball of ice.  Like the room in which it resides, it has no obvious purpose, but as the player considers it, he realizes that it is growing smaller.  It is melting.  Now the player, with no sense whatsoever of what to do, feels rushed to do something.  It turns out that the solution here is to cast a fiery bomb spell on it, get out of the underground corridor where it was found, take it to another room, place it in one of three holes in the wall that lead to an opening in the ceiling, walk a particular path around a large room while using telekinesis on the ball in the ceiling (because the floor path matches a path in the ceiling that the player cannot see), freeze the ball in place at the end of the path, and make it explode, all before it melts to nothing.  If he fails, he has to start the process all over again.  And this is just one part of one puzzle.\n\nEven if I had the time to devote to reaching such a solution on my own, it would not be time well spent.  Worse, if I need to leave the game, parts of the puzzle (e.g. object positions) may be reset.  Thus, in the absence of a hint system, busy players may find themselves frequently starting the game up to face not just the same puzzle again, but parts that they have already solved.  It is no surprise, then, that only 5% of players reach the end of chapter 2, according to the Steam achievements.  This is a shame, as chapter 3 is the best-looking part of the game and has more spells to introduce.\n\nPlayers who are interested in challenging puzzles or willing to use a walkthrough may still find a reason to walk away from this game:  the combat.\n\nThere is only a handful of normal enemies:  walking and flying swarms that follow a set path and die easily, wisps that follow a set path and die easily, bipeds who charge the player, and floating mages who can cast three spells.  Dealing with the first two types is no big deal, but the bipeds (Saevar) are another story.  One-on-one, they are a joke:  the player can simply cast a bomb spell on them, then stun them to give the bomb enough time to charge.  But since they can spawn in twos or threes, the player never gets any great area of effect spells, and voice recognition may fail, these creatures can actually pose a challenge sometimes.  The floating mages (Shar-Seth), in contrast, are somewhat fun to fight because the player has to listen to the words that they chant for their spells, then act accordingly.  But these are much deadlier if the voice recognition happens to fail.  This would all be fine if battles were always preceded by healing ponds and save points, but they aren't--and sometimes the battles are surprises.  Death means having to re-do whatever platforming was necessary to reach these battles in the first place.\n\nThen there are the three bosses:  the first is almost like a battle with the Shar-Seth, but requires a trick to kill it when it heals itself; the second is a two-part chase involving the ice, teleport, and telekinesis spells; and the third is a battle against clones with powerful spells.  Fortunately, the game either saves automatically at the beginning of these battles or has a save point right before them.  Unfortunately, voice recognition failures tend to result in instant death and the third boss in particular is very frustrating.\n\nClearly, imperfect voice recognition is my biggest reason for judging the combat negatively.  But there are other annoyances.  Every spell cast requires that the player hold down LMB, speak the proper words, then release LMB.  This is obviously to let the game know when to "listen" for the player's voice and when he is done speaking, but since it makes actions take noticeably longer to perform, situations that require quick reflexes become all the more tense.  Additionally, if the player casts the wrong spell, he has to first cancel it before he can cast another, interfering with the flow of combat.  Two spells--the light beam and the ice beam--even look similar, so it may not be immediately apparent that the wrong spell was cast.  Finally, releasing projectiles caught by the shield spell too often sends them flying everywhere except where the player is aiming, which can make the final boss battle take much longer than it should.\n\n(NOTE:  It has come to my attention that the game offers the player the option to record his own voice for spells to improve voice recognition.  I will not be playing the entire game again to test this, so I can't say if this would have improved the speech recognition.  Regardless, the game's obtuse puzzles and awkward combat were enough to hurt my experience.)\n\nThe story is all right:  the player character is simply out to bring his loved one back to life by using the magic he finds in the temple, while the god who guides him wants him to do something else.  Occasionally the journal will update with a little bit of his backstory or his feelings about what he is experiencing, but it didn't add anything to the game.  The 35 hidden documents, however, provide a good deal of lore, explaining some of the history of the temple, the gods, and the civilizations that worshiped them.  It's just a shame that so many of them are hidden (why hide the meat of the story?) and that the writing is a bit inconsistent, sometimes sounding proper and authoritative and other times sounding modern, even sloppy.\n\nI would like to give this game a higher score and a recommendation for its unique mechanic (an experience in itself), visuals, and spell variety, but the core aspects of gameplay--the puzzles and the combat--just don't work for me.  As another reviewer remarks, this game has a lot of wasted potential.  I give this game a 6 out of 10, though more hardcore puzzlers might get more enjoyment out of it.\n\nBe wary of reviewers with only a few hours played:  chapters 2 and 3 are longer and harder than 1.","June 3, 2015","false","14.0"," 39 of 70 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","39","70","3","0"

The puzzles aren't too complicated, but to solve them, the developers have you run through a maze a couple dozen times to collect all the pieces. 1 piece will be over here, the 2nd piece over there, the third piece there, and carrying 1 at a time, they all need to go to location number 4, and in a certain order as well.\nSince it's early access, there's little story and therefore only few hints, of what you're supposed to do.

Also, nerves of friggin’ steel.\n\nWelcome to a land of magic. You are a wizard in search for a strong, ancient power for reasons I will not spoil; but to get to it, you will have to explore the temple, solve its puzzles, and battle unspeakable evil! That last part is more annoying than exciting, by the way.\n\nIn Verbis Virtus is, in essence, a fantasy RPG halfway between puzzle and action. Do not that you are required to own and use a microphone in order to play this game, for that is the whole point of it. As a wizard, you will be doing the spell casting via voice commands. That’s right, that means the game depends on a voice recognition system. That could only bode for fun and frustration, right?\n\nBut lets take it one thing at a time! Because in order to play the game, I had to be able to open the game, which in itself was a puzzle. I have no idea why, but the game alternated between crashing and freezing; probably something related to the resolution.\nOn the upside, In Verbis Virtus has a “safe” mode that opens it in a window on super low res. On the downside, that it has a safe mode because you may need to use it to get into the game is kind of a sad state. Once I was able to start it without crashing, the game ran fairly well only getting a bit choppy when entering a new area for the first time that day.\n\nVisually, the game is quite stunning. even in low settings it didn’t look as bad as other ‘better’ games do, so there’s something to be said for that. The music was really nice too, and what voice acting there was (to show you how to pronounce the spells and in cutscenes) was… I wouldn’t say good, but it wasn’t bad either. The ambient sounds left something to be desired, however, though they weren’t too bad. The fire for some reason sounded fairly similar to the critters, and while I’m guessing the idea of keeping a semi-constant critter-like noise in the background was to keep you on edge, it became annoying as you couldn’t be sure when they were actually coming for you unless you’d been in the area before.\n\nThe game mechanics are pretty nice. Controls are basic: you jump with space, move with wasd, use mouse to aim and look around, shift to run - there is no ducking, however. In order to cast the spells, you interact via voice. Just aim your mouse at something, click and call out the spell name, and release your click. The spell will be cast. To stop the spell, right click. There are checkpoints that auto-save when passing a chapter, and save points spread out through the game, not nearly close enough to what I’d normally like, but not too far apart either. I just like to save every time I accomplish something, I’m obsessive like that.\n\nSurprisingly, the voice recognition system works fairly well, and it has plenty of ways to be used. In the game options you can choose to cast the spells in English or the made-up language of the game, Maha’Ki, I went back to try them both (though my original playthrough was in Maha’Ki) and both worked pretty well. There was the occasional moment where a spell wasn’t cast, which included times such as slightly panicky, rushed casts for getting my ♥♥♥ kicked by enemies, the infuriated “I’ve said it three times already, would you please cast it??” rushed casting, and the “I clicked after I started casting” casting. But overall the spells cast 99% of the times, and when it didn’t, it was user fault.\nWithin the voice recognition options you also have the choice to record your own words for the spells. Now, I didn’t try this, but I can only imagine it can be great fun, and it’s a neat option to have.\n\nAs for the puzzles themselves, some are easy, some are hard, some are really not overly intuitive kind of hard, but for the most they were fairly good. Until, that was, you reached a timed puzzle. Really now, why would you do that to me? Is casting and running and casting while running not hard enough that you have to put the time limit so that we barely make it?\nThere was quite a bit of backtracking to be made from some of the puzzles to other parts of it, which would have been much less annoying without the critters roaming around, but I can overlook that since they had pretty scripted areas in which they appeared and paths they followed, so they were entirely predictable.\nAll in all, I was pretty content with the puzzles except for the timed ones, and then I was a slightly less happy camper until that was over.\n\nI knew there’d be some fighting when I went into this game, I just didn’t expect them to be that annoying.\n\nNow, your mileage might vary, but I feel like the greatest downfall of this game is precisely that: the fighting. Ahhh… what can I say about it other than I completely hated it, and it got me stuck in each encounter I had to the point where I didn’t get to finish the entirety of the story because of it. I got completely stuck, not even because I didn’t know how to beat the bad guys, but because they were so friggin’ annoying, and casting while trying not to die while trying to time something else was just not my thing. The very first fight you encounter is not just a fight, but a bit of a timing puzzle as well, and I seriously spent way too long trying to pass it, to the point where more than once I considered quitting right there. I didn’t. I quit further ahead, but I still quit.\n\nCould this game have done well with fighting? Yes, if enemies had been defeatable via actual fighting spells, as opposed to trying to make them puzzly-difficult for the sake of making you use the several spells. Now, don’t get me wrong, while it could have been “fun” to fling an enemy across a room with my spell to stun him before putting a fire ball on his face (note: you get a fire spell, and then an explosion spell, not a fireball spell, making it even more annoying), you can’t really base the entire experience on the player’s timing skills with juggling 3 different spells in a moment of heated combat. Particularly if the enemy isn’t even a boss.\nI feel like maybe if casting spells hadn’t been dependant of you clicking, calling out, then releasing the button to get it to actually cast, and it would have just recognized voice commands without the need of any clicking (and unclicking) in between, it would have made things much easier and I wouldn’t have been quite so frustrated with it all.  I can see where they wanted to go with the fights in terms of creativity, I just feel like it wasn’t well handled, or just… didn’t belong in this particular game.\n\nAs it was, most the fights I came across were just annoying and brought down the entire experience for me.\n\nBug wise I didn’t come across anything very obvious, except for the problems I had getting it to start and the occasional crash which happened mostly when I started a game, usually before I even loaded a save. But there were some crashes after as well. They really added to the frustration.\n\nThere’s little else to be said about In Verbis Virtus, I wish the puzzles would have been more open, giving you a chance of using various of your spells in order to complete it creatively, instead of “here is this rune or button, so this thing requires this particular spell while you stand in this particular spot.” (The fights suffered from this too; certain enemies required certain particular series of spells, except for the occasional one “easily” defeatable with fire, which still took two spells.)\nYou don’t need mazes and hours of backtracking to make good puzzles, you just need to give the user more creative ways to solve it in a single room.\nI also wish there would have been a “no monsters” option, it would have made my experience much more enjoyable. I could’ve probably done with just the critters and a final boss at most.","July 30, 2015","true","8.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

The Audio is amazing and engaging. The Art Design is beautiful and stunning. The Stage progression was good and it was easy to understand where you were supposed to go as long as you explore a bit to begin with. Now the Voice recognition is cool and all but there were a few times were I would cough and it would count it as the Command spell or I would say one spell and it would interpret as another and I even set up my own Voice profile in the settings though it was mostly on the dot with what I said most of the time. Oh but I do love the sounds of the language used for the spells it was mystic yet regal.\n\nSo to wrap it up I love everything about this game even with the few times I got annoyed at the Voice stuff. I would give this  game a 9/10. Mostly because there are a few areas where you can bug the game out a bit and the voice recognition still needs some improvement in techonogly before it can be prefected for a game like this.

Lots of Puzzles... While I'm not really a big fan of doing intense puzzles, this game involves both combat and puzzles while making it very fun. My very first time trying to cast Lumeh Tial I spoke into my mic and said "Crash to Desktop" and what do you know, it worked! Since then I have made my own spell names, such as explosion for the Atul Aghni spell... but since they weren't working 100% of the time I decided to learn the actual spells. Though the speaking portion isn't 100% accurate for each and every spell you try to cast, I'd say that it was about 90-95% accurate for when I actually used a spell. For instance, there were times when I said Atul Aghni, but instead cast Namet Atul instead. Most of the time the accuracy of the speech-to-spell cast ratio wasn't a problem.\n\nOther than that, I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for an interesting game that will cause others to look at you strangely as you play it, but be warned that these puzzles are not as easy as they might appear. One room (the lava room with the rotating pillars in Chapter 3) took me approximately 2 hours to solve, so by no means is this thing a walk in the park. If you are someone that doesn't have a ton of money, wait for a discount on the game.\n\nRead on if you plan on getting this fantastic game for a few tips:\n1) Be sure to check every possible solution that is available to you before moving onto a new area or returning to an old area. Many of the puzzles have hidden sections or hints as to how to complete different sections if you look hard enough.\n2) Remain calm when in a combat scenario - I panicked a few times and I couldn't remember the spells, pressing the spells list in the middle of combat helped me quite a bit to both think and calm myself a bit.\n3) If all else fails, don't quit, I'd recommend looking up a guide to answer a question or find a hint, full solutions will probably ruin the game as it is intended to be a puzzle. I had to use a guide to know that I was doing the correct thing and not wasting 30 minutes pouring water into buckets to find a pattern...\n4) Sometimes taking a leap of faith is required to advance to the next area or to complete a puzzle.","August 23, 2015","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

That being said the developers are very involved in helping solve any and all issues, and have managed to push out a unique game that already, in its third early access update, contains roughly 6-8 hours of great gameplay. The game itself is a blend of first-person horror, puzzle, and classic rpg games that does not feel like three genres thrown together in a blender. They have been elegantly interlaced in the main story and gameplay. The story is not shoved down your throat either like many of today's games, but rather subtley unlocked. In a way, as you discover more and more about the templethe player discovers more and more about his motivation. I won't say any more on that subject for fear of spoilers.\n\nNow the big thing that sets this game apart and is possibly its biggest selling point is the voice functionality. It is through this command that the game really shines. I have never felt more like my character as I have playing this game, because in this game I have to literally speak for my character. The downside of this function is that sometimes it bugs out. It may use a different spell than what you wanted or may even not cast a spell at all. The develpers, however, are even working on this drawback, as they plan on adding voice recognition training functionality to the game itself, so what the game hears is you, rather then some generic coding that you have to imitate. On top of the pure awesomeness of casting a spell, you can choose which language, english, or the games own made up language, Maha'ki, to cast spells in. Maha'ki is a very latin-ish fantasy-ish language that feels great to speak in. But if that's not your cup of tea, the english functionality works just as well.\n\nOverall, this is probably the best, and most challenging game I have purchased in a long time. I urge the developers to keep up the good work because this games shows the promise of surpassing games from the very genres that it pulls from, such as myst, or even games of the elder scrolls franchise. In the future, this game could be worth a lot more than the $16.99 it is now, especially if they add nearly as much content as it looks like they are going to!\n\nP.S. Even though I don't have one, Occulus Rift support would make this game BEYOND amazing!

I have seen many reviews saying the puzzles are backwards, extremely hard, or just don't make sense altoghether. I could not agree less. The puzzles give you a Legends Of Zelda field, and are slightly challenging, but are great nonetheless. The voicing spell system gives the game a very interesting turn, as you struggle to remember the words of a spell when danger shows (*cough* Every time the bugs come *cough*). Overall, this game is amazing and a great experience. Of course, I have heard it is short, but the game has a great feel to it, and immerses you in the dark, magical world of In Verbis Virtus. 10/10.

I am quite sure that this is the problem of the game.\nSolving puzzles is fun, but wasting my time on looking for god-knows-what all around the map is not.\nI really, really dislike the fact that I have to read all those texts just to be sure that I am not missing any crucial clues.\nStill about texts. A good story telling shouldn't be like this. There's definitely no atmosphere when I have to stop exploring and start to read a book.\nThe idea of performing tricks by speaking out the spell is amazing, undoubtedly. But I don't see any sense in adopting such a feature in this game. Probably it fits games like The Elder Scroll or The Witcher more.\nAlso the AI of this game is not satisfying. Sometimes when I'm standing right in front of a monster at a very close distance he gives no response ;)\nThis game is a very nice try, but it doesn't meet my expectation.\n\nPs. As for the problem of microphone, I am quit sure this is the problem of the game because several minutes before I started this game, I was preparing for a Skype interview so that I thoroughly check my microphone. I tried three different mics in the game and none of them worked. I followed the instructions on the discussion page but nothing changed.

It's a good game, really good in fact. Graphics are nice, though there is a bit of stuttering here and there. The story is deep and interesting, and who doesn't want to be able to cast spells with their voice? However, there is one MAJOR drawback to all of that, and that is this: It's a puzzle game. I know it may seem like a stupid reason to not recommend a game, but let's be perfectly honest. Even a puzzle game like this is boring, even with the ability to cast spells with your own voice. And to be brutally honest, that's this game's only selling point; "cast spells with your voice!". It's a great concept, but I just cannot recommend a game that takes a good concept and puts it in a game it doesn't belong in. This game would've been much better off as an RPG with Co-Op and/or PvP, where you fight other people and hear them cast spells and have that one split second to think of the proper counter-spell. Instead, we get a game where you roam through a boring (though well-designed) crumbling temple that makes you feel like Indiana Jones while you beat your head against a wall trying to figure out what the heck you're supposed to do next.\n\nBottom Line: Beautiful game, well designed, good concept but in the wrong type of game. If your only reason for buying this game is "Oooh, I get to cast spells with my voice? Heck yes!", don't buy it. It'll just disappoint you. But if you love puzzle games, then this just might be your cup of proverbial tea.","May 27, 2015","false","1.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I'm currently not liking where I'm at in it as it feels more like a horror/survival game at times - you have extremely limited options in dealing with emenies that you cannot kill but who are MORE than capable of killing you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thestubiter/recommended/242840/","thestubiter","TheStubiter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thestubiter/","156 products in account","In Verbis Vertus consists of a mixture of first person exploration, puzzle solving, and, spell-casting through the use of voice commands. Throughout In Verbis Vertus the player will move through an underground system of tunnels and caves, progressing deeper into the earth. The majority of the game consists of interacting with and exploring this environment by solving puzzles and mastering spells.\n\nThe main appeal of In Verbis Vertus is it's spell casting. In order to cast spells, the player must memorize the words of a spell and clearly speak them into their microphone. The player may choose to preform these voice commands in English or in a fantasy language designed for the game. Using voice commands to cast spells is a novel concept, and I found myself initially enjoying the system more than a traditional hot-key approach. However, the novelty wears off quickly, and is soon replaced with frustration. This is due to the game's tendency to misinterpret the player's speech, requiring them to repeat commands multiple times. I found this extremely frustrating, especially when rapid action is required. I also was disappointed to find that throughout my time with the game, it failed to introduce any interesting or unique spells, the most interesting being a fireball that can be detonated mid flight. For a game which focused so heavily on spell-casting, I would have expected a more in depth or interesting system. It was sad to see a system that showed so much promise end up feeling lifeless and dull.\n\nThe environmental design In Verbis Vertus also leaves much to be desired. Although exploration and discovery are clearly meant to be a focus, I found the game oddly linear. In order to progress, the player must complete actions in a set order and way. Puzzles seem to have a single solution, leaving the player feeling like they are simply going through the motions rather than figuring things out on their own. Occasionally some puzzles will deviate from this, allowing a bit more experimentation, but these are few and far between. The game also allows backtracking, but provides no incentive for doing so. Fortunately, In Verbis Vertus is a good looking game. It's environments are often packed with color and interesting scenery, which is enjoyable to look at.\n\nIn Verbis Vertus has such a strong concept, but unfortunately falls short in execution, making what should have been a unique, captivating experience feel like a chore. Somewhere underneath all poor design decisions is a truly special game, which makes it all the more sad that I cannot recommend In Verbis Vertus. I hope a sequel is released which further develops all the unique ideas in In Verbis Vertus without its mistakes.","November 16, 2015","false","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

I haven't gamed till late into the nigth but I saw the sun rise when I finally shut my pc down to go to bed (this was day 1 of having the game).\n\nThe spellcasting system works pretty well, and it's a relief to not have to use your keyboard for spells (though I did write myself a little spell overview note because in the heat of it all forgetting the healing spell can kill you...) So it will probably take some getting used to to being able to cast just as well in stressed conditions compared to "normal" ones. But hey, it's a lot more realistic than the simple button mashing in all the other games :)\n\nAs for the surroundings, I can only call that eye candy ♥\n\nI'm very happy I got this game now, not only for the early enjoyment of it, but also because I have a feeeling this game will become a lot more expensive by the time it's finished.

That's all you need to know. If you like magic fantasy games then this is for you. Cast spells with your voice? Screw the "hotbar" using all your number keys and every other key you might have on your keyboard, cast spells with a single mouse click.\n\nPersonally, I NEVER buy games. I've played something close to maybe 100 (maybe more like 50+ but who's counting) games and I haven't paid for squat. Why? Because they weren't worth it. Hell I wasn't gonna pay for this thing at first, but after seeing the potential I knew it was a good idea. Honetly the developers should feel honored they were better than many of the mainstream games around now, good enough to get my measly 17$ and a review. Both of which i never do!\n\nExpect great things from this game, and being that this is only alpha expect beta and full release to be a masterpiece.\n\nNow if only they'd input Oculus Rift support it'd be that much better...","July 18, 2014","true","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The guide basically said "yeah, if you didn't find a random document a few rooms back, there's no way you'll know how to do this thing."

Stop downvoting my stupid review, I'll write it.\n\nHere's why you should buy it:\n\n-The voice control is AMAZING. This augmented reality thing is really worth it. It's one of the most pleasant things I experienced in my life, and that includes Cadbury's Battenberg cake.\n\n-You can come up with your own silly spells that sound like the original ones, and sometimes they work. For example, Obi Wan Kenobi works as a spell for telekinesis. It's a lot of fun.\n\n-It looks pretty.\n\nHere's why you shouldn't buy it.\n\n-Backtracking\n\n-Level design. It's BAD. Not only [see above], but also it's hard to locate important elements in all the jumble that the levels are. At some point I explicitly wanted to find an element in a room and failed, while it was there and was necessary to proceed. At some other point I stuck and used a walkthrough to see what to do, and it said to locate a thing in a room, and it said where, and I still couldn't find it, until I saw a tiny light that was supposed to attract attention to the thing. So success, much triumph.\n\nSo if you're looking for new experience, and would forgive the virtual unplayability for it, then give it a go. If not, go play some DND and shout spells at your friends. It's much more fun anyway.","May 26, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I guess that if you're lucky enough to have a voice similar to that of the testers you'll probably have more luck, but buying this is a gamble.

The problem is, as far as I've gotten, I've spent the last four hours in the same damn area, with the same two dull spells, because there are almost no clues about where you're supposed to go in a small mess of samey underground tunnels.\nYou'll go one way and find a dead end, go another way and find a puzzle that you may or may not be able to complete, and go yet another way and find a thing you should be able to interact with but can't for... some reason?\nThe reason I spent four hours on it was because I love using the magic so much that I want to push through and see the rest of the game, but I can't reccomend the game until the rest of it is fixed.\nAlso there's no save feature, and the game can crash randomely on you, but that doesn't much matter when you can't make any progress.\nEdit: Alright, so after looking online for a few hours, I figured out that when you get to the huge eye temple thing, you have to stand outside of the room it's in, look down at the ground, navigate into the room, look up at the shrine, and hold E, all of which was vaugely hinted at by a plaque in the Mush-room. After a few seconds, you are teleported to the realm of Veritas, who gives you a new power. Unfortunately, now I am stuck again, because the game gave me no more hints on where to go, or what to do, and now I'm worried I'm going to have to do that on every eye in the building.

This game completely hinges on the mechnic working. I didn't have any real problems with it. It works so well it makes me wish more games did something like this. Think Skyrim where you can yell your Dragon Shouts (I'm sure there's a mod for this)!\n\nIt's a great looking game, with challenging puzzles and a mechanic that makes it worth playing.\n\nThis is a hard game to really descibe since much of it is the voice spell casting.

I love the idea of having to speak a spell rather than just hitting a hotkey or clicking an icon. There is a bit of a learning curve at the beginning, but once I got the hang of it, it's all good.\n\nWhere things fell apart for me was the OVER ABUNDANCE of puzzle/platforming. Jump here, jump there, miss the jump and start over. I quit playing out of sheer frustration. If I can't even get throught the beginner area....... I realize other people love this kind of thing. I don't. I just like to kill stuff. I'm glad I tried it out. Personally, I won't play it again.","April 19, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Puzzles are imaginative and the graphics are pretty.  Music is nice too.  But I'm also getting alot of technical problems: the game crashes to the point I have to reinstall it when I try to rig the speech rcognition.  Try to play without this and the game frequently either misses spells I speak or casts the wrong ones (Tial Udah is FAR DIFFERENT from Ekto Lumeh!!).  There is also a lag time between my speaking the spell and it taking effect, sometimes you also need to let go of the 'hand' trigger for the spell to do its thing.  And not all spells do this.\nWhile I want to continue this game (it's a great and beautiful game), I'm starting to get into combat scenarios and puzzles where timing is a real key.  need precision responses from the casting system that I'm just not getting.  maybe in a few updates....","April 12, 2015","false","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

I mean come on, a game where you actually say the spell to cast it? its awesome! Also this game goes away from the norm in terms of progression. It doesnt tell you what to do, it doesnt tell you where to go. Infact, it doesnt tell you anything. And to add onto that there is hardly even a streamlined path (well for a little bit at least). The game gives you a room and basically tells you to figure it out. Which can be frustrating sometimes becomes it doesnt even slightly hint at what you have to do...those dammed fountain puzzles. But thanks to some amazing people who spent hours figuring everything out, there are some great guides. SO, what am I trying to get at? Well its a beautiful game that has you stuck at every turn with complex puzzles, but if you manage to pass these puzzles you feel very accomplished...only to be stuck for another two hours on the next puzzles.\n\nTL:DR This game is beautiful, has really cool mechanics, and is for the puzzle novice and master alike.

I enjoy the voice command system for the break from normalcy.\n\nIf you don't like the concept, you'll probably hate the game since you won't go more than a few seconds without using a chant.\n\nCouple things to note:\n1. The level design is a bit poor. I provide three examples of many:\n- Journal says stay out of the dark, you must walk around two pitch-black corners to find the light power.\n- The light ray power room - it allows you to exit the way you came in but you're supposed to continue behind the carving.\n- In one instance it's intentional (i.e, you read a journal entry telling you that you've lost your way, then it kills you for slipping by a door you can open and it's literally right infront of you to run through). It's poor design, not a clever trick.\n\n2. Voice recog is fine - you can train it in the menu if you cannot into proper english and as long as YOU are consistent, it will be too. I've had a little trouble with the fire spell casting the light ray sometimes, but when i speak a bit louder it's fine, so i blame myself for that.\n\n3.

Yes, it could use a little more "action," I think, but a game where you are literally required to speak the spells you wish to cast has to balance that necessity SOMEHOW.  I cannot imagine trying to fight enemies and having to constantly repeat a spell to cast it.  The amount of time you'd waste and focus you'd lose would suck.  Maybe further into the game this will become an issue...but for now, it works.  Sure, the game is mostly exploration and puzzles, but that's okay.  If those types of games aren't your speed, don't pick this one up.  It's that simple.  However, if you DO like puzzle games, and you enjoy exploration, then honestly, this is kind of a must-have.  Yeah, your roommates/spouses/families might think you're nutballs for talking to your computer, but there is something IMMENSELY satisfying about speaking a spell and watching the effects take place.  And seriously?  Play with the in-game language.  Don't dumb it down.  You're a freaking sorcerer, for Pete's sake.  OWN THAT.\n\nAll in all, yes, I recommend the game wholeheartedly.  I will say this; combat, when it comes, isn't necessarily easy, and you DO have to stay on your toes...that said, the people complaining that there's no health regen have apparently never killed an enemy--enemies drop orbs that help replenish your health.  So...fight, and you live.  Run/avoid, and you die.  Plain and simple.\n\nPlay this.  Honestly, it's a blast.","January 30","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not at all what I expected but nevertheless very cool. I was expected more of a combat-centric, Elder Scrolls type game with the added specialness of using your microphone to cast magic on-the-fly. Not at all accurate.\n\nIn this game, you have no weapons, no items, no equipment or inventory of any kind. You have a journal and a voice. You start out with zero magic. You know how to walk and jump. You soon learn how to make light, then how to make a beam of light, then... well I won't spoil it.\n\nIn Verbis Virtus is a first-person puzzler. You use the magic you learn in the course of the game to solve puzzles and overcome physical obstacles. The language of magic in IVV is clever. Once you've learned a few spells, you start to figure out rudimentary meanings of individual words and that makes it easier to remember how to combine those words into magical phrases.\n\nI'd love to see something like this applied to a game like Magicka. I loved the idea of Magicka but remembering spell combinations and using the interface to cast on-the-fly was too much to hold in one brain all at once. If I could just say a combination of power words into my microphone, it would be much easier.\n\nBut I digress. IVV is a good-looking game and fun. It's just challenging enough to keep me interested without being difficult enough to be frustrating. Some recent adventure games left you at screen three with no hints, making you google how to progress. Never even crossed my mind to google solutions for IVV. Having said that, I'm only about an hour in so maybe the puzzles get trickier.\n\nBottom line: Very cool concept and well-executed. I'd love to see another game with voice-casting in a different sort of game. An Elder Scrolls sort of adventure or even something like Nox (anybody remember Nox?).","February 7","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/recommended/242840/","GameReviewsAU","GRAU","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/","45 products in account","Hold onto your socks gamers, you’re just about to get the opportunity to geek out like you’ve never geeked before! Enter the world of In Verbis Virtus and learn the Maha’ki language to impact and control your surroundings. No… your character doesn’t learn Maha’ki, YOU do! Well you’ll need to if you want to get anywhere in these puzzles. Continue reading for the rest of our In Verbis Virtus review!\n\nI just had to try out In Verbis Virtus. A game that lets you cast spells with your own voice? I was all over that idea and I have to say that I’m impressed!\n\nThe whole game is played through a first-person view using the usual ‘WASD’ keys to move around, and your mouse controls where you look. Holding down ‘left-click’ raises your character’s hand and allows you to speak into the mic to cast a spell you’ve learned.\n\nThe beginning of In Verbis Virtus starts you off in a desert outside of a temple. Navigating to the entrance of the temple acts as the tutorial, introducing you to moving, jumping, sprinting and interacting with objects. After this brief period of learning, the puzzles begin.\n\nPlaced throughout each level are signs showing a map of the area you are in. The maps show your current position, places of interest and the pathways needed to progress. If you don’t have a very good memory or you prefer to progress through games methodically, it might be a good idea to take a photo of these maps to use for reference further down the track. The entire game is pretty much one giant maze.\n\nBy using these maps, you can successfully navigate through tunnels and the like, to find new spells or puzzles to be solved. Most puzzles will require you to have learned a certain spell in order to solve them. So there is a little bit of backtracking.\n\nFor example, right at the beginning, one of the passageways you can take is completely dark. Not only that, but the only way to get through this room is to walk a very thin path that zigs and zags. Therefore, you need to have learned a spell that lights the area up to avoid falling down a bottomless pit. Falling is bad, but not bad enough to kill you. Instead you’ll be transported somewhere nearby to where you fell, albeit missing a portion of your health. However once that health bar is depleted, death will follow, prompting you to restart from your previous saved game. So make sure you save whenever you get to one of the few save points.\n\nPuzzling Times\nThe puzzles found throughout In Verbis Virtus are quite often very difficult and, if you choose to not have any hints, will require you to explore every nook and cranny of an area to find out exactly what you have to do. I must admit that a few puzzles had me visiting some forums and gaining some *ahem* inspiration to find the solution.\n\nSeriously though, there’s going to be at least one puzzle you come across which will have you pulling out your hair, trying desperately to work out the solution. Alternatively you can just turn on hints from the Options menu.\n\nThe story of In Verbis Virtus is played out via animated cut-scenes. As you progress, the story, spells and other information about the temple are filled in to your journal for future reference. For someone as forgetful as myself, this is a god-send. My memory seems to only be able to hold two or three spells at a time… So I’m accessing my journal quite frequently to re-listen to magic words and pronunciations.\n\nMy one qualm I have with In Verbis Virtus is that the voice recognition can, at times, seem a bit picky. (Although it might just be my dreadful pronunciation.) My wife can attest to me repeating spells over and over until they work. But then again, she’ll come over, listen to it and cast the spell in one attempt… ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nBeing able to cast spells using your own voice is the best part of In Verbis Virtus. It’s one thing to be able to take control of an epic sorcerer, but it’s another to run around a lost temple shouting spells on-the-go and making an impact on your surroundings. It’s even fun to just run around aimlessly and cast any spell you want willy-nilly!\n\nAesthetic Charm\nIn Verbis Virtus is quite a graphically intense game and you may need to change your graphics card settings to make sure your high-end GPU is being utilised.\n\nA little tip for NVIDIA users, go to your NVIDIA Control Panel and navigate to the Manage 3D Settings area. Add the game in the Program Settings if it’s not already there by clicking the Add button, going to where your Steam folder is and adding the In Verbis Virtus EXE file by navigating through the following folders: steam\steamapps\common\in verbis virtus\binaries\win32\ivv.exe\n\nAfterwards, make sure the preferred graphics processor is set to use your NVIDIA GPU.\n\nIt will definitely be worth it to be using a GPU that can handle a lot. The environment is designed so beautifully, and textures bring the world to life brilliantly. Enemy designs and animations are extremely well done and you’ll find yourself trying to get a good close-up view of these foes without being beaten to death in the process.\n\nSpell effects are gorgeous and add to the pleasure of being able to cast spells using your own voice. My favourite one to look at has to be the telekinesis spell. It just looks too cool!\n\nThe soundtrack is epic and matches the atmosphere perfectly. You might be facing off against a Saevar in a closed off room with nowhere to go, and the music will rise to a crescendo, making you run around even more frantically than before.\n\nEthereal flutes create an atmosphere of mystery and energetic drum poundings inject you with a feeling of pure epicness! The soundtrack can be purchased from Steam for an extra $24.99USD but to be fair, it is a really good soundtrack.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nSome gamers are put off by the thought of talking to their computer to play, but to be brutally honest, man up and give it a go! Even if you have to wait for an empty house to play, In Verbis Virtus is definitely worth your time. To begin with, you will probably feel a bit silly speaking to your computer in an unknown language, but as you fall deeper into the role of your magic-wielding character, you’ll ignore everyone around you and find a sense of normality in speaking words such as “Lumeh Tial” to light up an area.\n\nIf you’re looking for an action packed game, this probably isn’t going to meet your criteria. In Verbis Virtus is firstly a puzzle game with elements of action squeezed in. Fast reflexes and a good memory are key to success in completing the game.\n\nI honestly think that In Verbis Virtus is a game that all fantasy game fans should play. There are times of frustration and not everyone enjoys difficult puzzles, but you can always get hints and I haven’t found any other games out there that let you utilise your voice to cast spells as wonderfully as this one.\n\nRead the full review[gamereviewsau.com]","February 25","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was watching the trailer thinking: "meh, main focus is magic, its usually more interesting when magic is 1 well developed aspect in the rpg"\n\nthen I scroll down a little and notice "a microphone is required to play this game" and im like: "wait a minute, that's not voice acting Oo!?" I instantly got goosebumps watching the trailer. I don't get goosebumps for a game since Morrowind... yes when it was new and shinny.\n\nHaven't either had an immersion/exploration vibe of this kind since playing said game and Riven and some old Tomb Raiders. Chapter 2 will show you what we have been missing in the last years in map design on FPS, it's pure intricate genius and outright gorgeous at times. Keep in mind this is a cerebral exploration game. If you feel something is missing in that room keep looking and don't forget to backtrack. It's not busywork, its exploration.\n\nVoice recognition is fairly lenient and if you have trouble remembering some spells you can use what works for you. I once forgot the telekenises spell and I said "OP keanu!" well... he bent a spoon on that movie and stoped bullets with his mind :P . Spell name also reminds of "obee wan kenobi" so most are easy to remember, other you can go by their name logic. It also worked when I had some snacks in my mouth on ocasion and the oposite was also true resulting in wonderful moments where I struggled to hold the food in my mouth while I laughed with joy at the awesomeness of the game.\n\nIf you are like me, and used to recite out loud spell names when casting for the lols because you thought the latin/giberish names sounded epic (disciples II, baldurs gate/icewind dale), you know, the kind of thing you don't do in public, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU THAT ->YOU DID NOT EVEN KNOW YOU WANTED<-!

The backstory is unclear, and the reason of "why" fades quickly. Why you? Why are you doing this and risking your life for this? This is cleared up a little bit by reading absolutely everything and understanding it. Though the seemingly endless puzzles is basically what I get from playing it.\nPostive\nThe unclear instructions to the puzzles get on my good side, and here's why. I absolutely love puzzles which seem impossible and you literally have answers to the puzzle in different rooms, or hidden somewhere in the room you're in. The original Zelda games did this, the original Metroid games did this. Nowadays, there are map markers and waypoints telling you where to go next, and that's too easy. Annoyingly easy. This game goes back and touches my memories of being forced to pay attention to the game, otherwise get stuck for hours. Even when I'm not playing the game, I'll go back and try to figure out the puzzle I'm stuck on in my head.\n(If you pay attention and read everything) The story is probably one of the best stories I've ever experienced. Though the backstory is a little shaky, you start to feel like you are the character you are playing. It's so immersive, it makes you feel like you're actually a part of the game.\nThe voice recognition is phenominal. I know some people on here are giving poor reviews for the voice recognition, but they are probably using $10 microphones to play. The game can't hear you if your microphone is cheap, as any voice recognition works. But anyway, after playing the game for 15+ hours, then try to use Siri, I got to realize just how good the voice recognition is. I have a $60 microphone I picked up off of Amazon, and the recording quality is better than needed. My experience with the voice recognition only messed up maybe five times throughout my current playthrough, and it was probably my fault for mispronouncing the spell. Every other time is the right spell, but wrong situational requirements ( like trying to teleport but the cursor is aimed at a location it cannot place you, or trying to heal without standing in water).\nThe combat is actually intimidating. Enemies terrify me, because in the heat of the moment, I cannot remember the spells required to defeat them. This sets a boundary between me and my goal, and those are always the most fun to complete and accomplish (however irritating people say it is).\nExploration is rewarded. I have always loved games like this. Halo has skulls to find if you explored and ignored the objective, Skyrim has... well, everything. This game has extra information to read or a creepy backstory about a particular room you're in, or possibly a place to heal hidden away somewhere when you desperately need it! Things easily missed are things that fascinate me, like in the room where you aquire teleport, there are statues that look at you and track you when you do not look at them. This game has a lot of those moments.\nBasically everything about this game has either amazed, scared, intimidated, or fascinated me. This is a rare moment for me to say this about something, but I wish I could forget everything about this game so I can play it for the first time again. Do I recommend this game? Heck yeah I do! Pick up a $30+ microphone and please play this game. This game is revolutionary and widens the gaming universe of what people can do. Owning a copy of this game is absolutely phenominal and makes me feel good. This was absolutely the best purchase I've made in years. It's the perfect mixture of difficult, challenging, intimidating, and interesting. It's absolutely gorgeous.\n\nSo my rating for this game exceeds the maximum because it has exceeded my expectations. By a lot. 11/10","June 2, 2015","true","33.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/recommended/242840/","GameReviewsAU","GRAU","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/","45 products in account","Hold onto your socks gamers, you’re just about to get the opportunity to geek out like you’ve never geeked before! Enter the world of In Verbis Virtus and learn the Maha’ki language to impact and control your surroundings. No… your character doesn’t learn Maha’ki, YOU do! Well you’ll need to if you want to get anywhere in these puzzles. Continue reading for the rest of our In Verbis Virtus review!\n\nI just had to try out In Verbis Virtus. A game that lets you cast spells with your own voice? I was all over that idea and I have to say that I’m impressed!\n\nThe whole game is played through a first-person view using the usual ‘WASD’ keys to move around, and your mouse controls where you look. Holding down ‘left-click’ raises your character’s hand and allows you to speak into the mic to cast a spell you’ve learned.\n\nThe beginning of In Verbis Virtus starts you off in a desert outside of a temple. Navigating to the entrance of the temple acts as the tutorial, introducing you to moving, jumping, sprinting and interacting with objects. After this brief period of learning, the puzzles begin.\n\nPlaced throughout each level are signs showing a map of the area you are in. The maps show your current position, places of interest and the pathways needed to progress. If you don’t have a very good memory or you prefer to progress through games methodically, it might be a good idea to take a photo of these maps to use for reference further down the track. The entire game is pretty much one giant maze.\n\nBy using these maps, you can successfully navigate through tunnels and the like, to find new spells or puzzles to be solved. Most puzzles will require you to have learned a certain spell in order to solve them. So there is a little bit of backtracking.\n\nFor example, right at the beginning, one of the passageways you can take is completely dark. Not only that, but the only way to get through this room is to walk a very thin path that zigs and zags. Therefore, you need to have learned a spell that lights the area up to avoid falling down a bottomless pit. Falling is bad, but not bad enough to kill you. Instead you’ll be transported somewhere nearby to where you fell, albeit missing a portion of your health. However once that health bar is depleted, death will follow, prompting you to restart from your previous saved game. So make sure you save whenever you get to one of the few save points.\n\nPuzzling Times\nThe puzzles found throughout In Verbis Virtus are quite often very difficult and, if you choose to not have any hints, will require you to explore every nook and cranny of an area to find out exactly what you have to do. I must admit that a few puzzles had me visiting some forums and gaining some *ahem* inspiration to find the solution.\n\nSeriously though, there’s going to be at least one puzzle you come across which will have you pulling out your hair, trying desperately to work out the solution. Alternatively you can just turn on hints from the Options menu.\n\nThe story of In Verbis Virtus is played out via animated cut-scenes. As you progress, the story, spells and other information about the temple are filled in to your journal for future reference. For someone as forgetful as myself, this is a god-send. My memory seems to only be able to hold two or three spells at a time… So I’m accessing my journal quite frequently to re-listen to magic words and pronunciations.\n\nMy one qualm I have with In Verbis Virtus is that the voice recognition can, at times, seem a bit picky. (Although it might just be my dreadful pronunciation.) My wife can attest to me repeating spells over and over until they work. But then again, she’ll come over, listen to it and cast the spell in one attempt… ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nBeing able to cast spells using your own voice is the best part of In Verbis Virtus. It’s one thing to be able to take control of an epic sorcerer, but it’s another to run around a lost temple shouting spells on-the-go and making an impact on your surroundings. It’s even fun to just run around aimlessly and cast any spell you want willy-nilly!\n\nAesthetic Charm\nIn Verbis Virtus is quite a graphically intense game and you may need to change your graphics card settings to make sure your high-end GPU is being utilised.\n\nA little tip for NVIDIA users, go to your NVIDIA Control Panel and navigate to the Manage 3D Settings area. Add the game in the Program Settings if it’s not already there by clicking the Add button, going to where your Steam folder is and adding the In Verbis Virtus EXE file by navigating through the following folders: steam\steamapps\common\in verbis virtus\binaries\win32\ivv.exe\n\nAfterwards, make sure the preferred graphics processor is set to use your NVIDIA GPU.\n\nIt will definitely be worth it to be using a GPU that can handle a lot. The environment is designed so beautifully, and textures bring the world to life brilliantly. Enemy designs and animations are extremely well done and you’ll find yourself trying to get a good close-up view of these foes without being beaten to death in the process.\n\nSpell effects are gorgeous and add to the pleasure of being able to cast spells using your own voice. My favourite one to look at has to be the telekinesis spell. It just looks too cool!\n\nThe soundtrack is epic and matches the atmosphere perfectly. You might be facing off against a Saevar in a closed off room with nowhere to go, and the music will rise to a crescendo, making you run around even more frantically than before.\n\nEthereal flutes create an atmosphere of mystery and energetic drum poundings inject you with a feeling of pure epicness! The soundtrack can be purchased from Steam for an extra $24.99USD but to be fair, it is a really good soundtrack.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nSome gamers are put off by the thought of talking to their computer to play, but to be brutally honest, man up and give it a go! Even if you have to wait for an empty house to play, In Verbis Virtus is definitely worth your time. To begin with, you will probably feel a bit silly speaking to your computer in an unknown language, but as you fall deeper into the role of your magic-wielding character, you’ll ignore everyone around you and find a sense of normality in speaking words such as “Lumeh Tial” to light up an area.\n\nIf you’re looking for an action packed game, this probably isn’t going to meet your criteria. In Verbis Virtus is firstly a puzzle game with elements of action squeezed in. Fast reflexes and a good memory are key to success in completing the game.\n\nI honestly think that In Verbis Virtus is a game that all fantasy game fans should play. There are times of frustration and not everyone enjoys difficult puzzles, but you can always get hints and I haven’t found any other games out there that let you utilise your voice to cast spells as wonderfully as this one.\n\nRead the full review[gamereviewsau.com]","February 25","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, it could use a little more "action," I think, but a game where you are literally required to speak the spells you wish to cast has to balance that necessity SOMEHOW.  I cannot imagine trying to fight enemies and having to constantly repeat a spell to cast it.  The amount of time you'd waste and focus you'd lose would suck.  Maybe further into the game this will become an issue...but for now, it works.  Sure, the game is mostly exploration and puzzles, but that's okay.  If those types of games aren't your speed, don't pick this one up.  It's that simple.  However, if you DO like puzzle games, and you enjoy exploration, then honestly, this is kind of a must-have.  Yeah, your roommates/spouses/families might think you're nutballs for talking to your computer, but there is something IMMENSELY satisfying about speaking a spell and watching the effects take place.  And seriously?  Play with the in-game language.  Don't dumb it down.  You're a freaking sorcerer, for Pete's sake.  OWN THAT.\n\nAll in all, yes, I recommend the game wholeheartedly.  I will say this; combat, when it comes, isn't necessarily easy, and you DO have to stay on your toes...that said, the people complaining that there's no health regen have apparently never killed an enemy--enemies drop orbs that help replenish your health.  So...fight, and you live.  Run/avoid, and you die.  Plain and simple.\n\nPlay this.  Honestly, it's a blast.","January 30","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not at all what I expected but nevertheless very cool. I was expected more of a combat-centric, Elder Scrolls type game with the added specialness of using your microphone to cast magic on-the-fly. Not at all accurate.\n\nIn this game, you have no weapons, no items, no equipment or inventory of any kind. You have a journal and a voice. You start out with zero magic. You know how to walk and jump. You soon learn how to make light, then how to make a beam of light, then... well I won't spoil it.\n\nIn Verbis Virtus is a first-person puzzler. You use the magic you learn in the course of the game to solve puzzles and overcome physical obstacles. The language of magic in IVV is clever. Once you've learned a few spells, you start to figure out rudimentary meanings of individual words and that makes it easier to remember how to combine those words into magical phrases.\n\nI'd love to see something like this applied to a game like Magicka. I loved the idea of Magicka but remembering spell combinations and using the interface to cast on-the-fly was too much to hold in one brain all at once. If I could just say a combination of power words into my microphone, it would be much easier.\n\nBut I digress. IVV is a good-looking game and fun. It's just challenging enough to keep me interested without being difficult enough to be frustrating. Some recent adventure games left you at screen three with no hints, making you google how to progress. Never even crossed my mind to google solutions for IVV. Having said that, I'm only about an hour in so maybe the puzzles get trickier.\n\nBottom line: Very cool concept and well-executed. I'd love to see another game with voice-casting in a different sort of game. An Elder Scrolls sort of adventure or even something like Nox (anybody remember Nox?).","February 7","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Over time you uncover spells that you use to solve the puzzles in the ruins and progress. The atmosphere varies between awe-inspiring amazment, and honestly very scarry as you go deeper and deeper into the ruins.\nThe visuals are amazing and colorful, the spells are fun to use and creative, and the vocal componant is responsive and works near perfectly. It is actually a neat mechanic, as you have to remain calm and enunciate even when you're in a hurry, which is about how magic in most fantasy settings work. It's the first time self control has really made its way into gameplay for a game like this, and I love it.\nThis game is a puzzle game, and some of them did indeed stump me for a bit, and I'd like to think I'm decently sharp.\n\nTL;DR: It's amazing, ♥♥♥♥ off if you don't wanna use your voice, buy it.","February 3","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not at all what I expected but nevertheless very cool. I was expected more of a combat-centric, Elder Scrolls type game with the added specialness of using your microphone to cast magic on-the-fly. Not at all accurate.\n\nIn this game, you have no weapons, no items, no equipment or inventory of any kind. You have a journal and a voice. You start out with zero magic. You know how to walk and jump. You soon learn how to make light, then how to make a beam of light, then... well I won't spoil it.\n\nIn Verbis Virtus is a first-person puzzler. You use the magic you learn in the course of the game to solve puzzles and overcome physical obstacles. The language of magic in IVV is clever. Once you've learned a few spells, you start to figure out rudimentary meanings of individual words and that makes it easier to remember how to combine those words into magical phrases.\n\nI'd love to see something like this applied to a game like Magicka. I loved the idea of Magicka but remembering spell combinations and using the interface to cast on-the-fly was too much to hold in one brain all at once. If I could just say a combination of power words into my microphone, it would be much easier.\n\nBut I digress. IVV is a good-looking game and fun. It's just challenging enough to keep me interested without being difficult enough to be frustrating. Some recent adventure games left you at screen three with no hints, making you google how to progress. Never even crossed my mind to google solutions for IVV. Having said that, I'm only about an hour in so maybe the puzzles get trickier.\n\nBottom line: Very cool concept and well-executed. I'd love to see another game with voice-casting in a different sort of game. An Elder Scrolls sort of adventure or even something like Nox (anybody remember Nox?).","February 7","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat in this game seems it be pointless and frustrating, The 'Beam Of Light' spell is not efficient enough to fight the 'glowing bugs' and the narrow passages don't allow for any tactics to avoid them. I suggest that the 'Glowing Bugs' should be repealed by the 'Let There Be Light' spell. The visuals and spell mechanics are intriguing and the game as a whole needs improving.","February 7","false","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It adds a total new level of immersion to the game and challenges the player to memorize and use the right spell for each occasion. I'd really like to see that idea being used on more games like this in the future. The only downside I could find, is the fact that the developers did not emphasize that much on the combat system. It would be so cool to fight foes with spells you "cast" yourself!","April 3","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has so much mystique to it, and the mechanic of using your voice to activate spells in the game is fleshed out pretty well. After a while, I found out that, instead of the regular words for some spells, you can instead substitute other phrases that activate the same spell for some reason. For instance, there was a spell in the game that I learned is also activated by saying, "John Cena." I used that phrase instead so much, that I ended up completely forgetting the other phrase and just used John Cena. One time, I was in a panic and I tried to use that spell, so I ended up yelling out his name several times, and I hope my neighbors didn't hear it. That actually might explain why they don't look at me the same anymore.\n\nJust buy the game, dude. It's a blast, and it has plenty of content.","May 5","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
