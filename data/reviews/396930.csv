"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/recommended/396930/","seph_au","seph.au","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/","6755 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIsometric stealth action game that plays *somewhat* like a casual Metal Gear Solid. While lovely hand-drawn animation tells an interesting story about tribal politics between chapters, your main task is to bypass or takedown each enemy using any means necessary. Progress further and levels also introduce some basic puzzle elements.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIX9l7jN3sU\nAlmost immediately your character is given the ability to freeze time and take control of enemies, which works in a small radius and runs on a cooldown timer. Recharge time could be lowered by mashing the space bar. Throughout levels you discover 'patches' that are effectively magic which can be used after controlling enemies. Some of these abilities included instant execute, swap positions and health tap. Ultimately I found the game a little on the easy side but still had fun playing. Levels left plenty of room for experimentation, though backtracking in later stages could be refined as some of it felt like extra padding.\n\nNo in-game options were available other then sliders for sound. Gamepad didn't detect and controls could not be remapped, I personally had no issues with the default keyboard/mouse setup. Screen resolutions of 4k+ were supported using the unity launcher. Currently includes 15 chapters (minus training), most were split into 2-3 areas taking 5-15min each depending on your playstyle. Tidal Affair feels content complete and it's another respectable early access game that's worth keeping your eye on. First part of a series but does play as a standalone. Cheers folks.\n\n@Devs\nAchievements might be broken. Completed several and none unlocked.","November 11, 2015","true","2.6"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","29","46","2","2"

In the game you spend your time sneaking, killing guards or avoiding them, solving puzzles. You have a special ability which is freezing time - when you use it you can take control at enemy, execute an enemy or steal health. The story is quite interesting. The art style nice, this looks like a hand painted oil paint. The music is also good. One of biggest negative in a game I think it’s the control system,  this not very good and because this can be sometimes annoying.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+nice graphic style\n+nice music\n+puzzles\n+interesting skill\n+different enemies\n+steam achievements\n\n-buggy cutscenes\n-bad controls\n-a bit high price\n\nWell this game is not bad, but have some problems. For example a control system and cutscenes. If they this resolve shortly its game can be really enjoyable. But at the moment also have some good points for example a unique art style. I think you should try it if you like stealth games, it may be an intresting piece for your collection.\n\n7/10","December 31, 2015","true","2.5"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","24","39","0","0"

The main character is able to take control of her enemies and make them bend to her will. She is able to make soldiers kill their peers or walk them into deadly traps if they are available. It's a battle against resources and can get tricky finding ways to dispose of the various guards. A media review copy was provided for The Hidden Levels.\n\nWhat I enjoyed:\n\nTaking control – I enjoyed taking control of the enemies and having them fight or even jump off cliffs. Once I was able to master the deselecting of the enemy prior to death it became very useful. It's tricky however and you are certainly punished for not deselecting enemies if they die, if they are shot by their peers those soldiers then shoot you to death relatively quickly.\n\nPainterly Canvas – The art style is a rugged and semi rough painterly style, but it works pretty well. There are a few edges or odd set pieces here and there, but overall the environments and cut-scenes have a neat painted quality that makes the game feel a bit more crafted.\n\nHand holding not allowed – The game is difficult for a variety of reasons. I found that the tutorial gives you only a slight idea of how to effectively move through an area without losing loads of health. You have to use your brain a bit and that's something I appreciate. Regardless of frustration levels during play I'd prefer to be challenged rather than led through a game.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\nInterface-off – The interface is absolutely terrible, the click targets are all misplaced as you can see in my video and certain buttons float in very odd places throughout the menu. I had to re-select my controller each time I launched the game. Essentially the user interface and options portion of this game is unfinished and it needs to be cleaned up very desperately.\n\nBurning fuel – The "patches" as they are called are one time use, and progression seems almost non existent in the game. It's essentially a strategy game with a high difficulty level but seems to lack a bit in the replay-ability category.\n\nStrategy games of this type are admittedly not my forte and this game took me out of my comfort zone for sure. I'd say that the game and it's mechanics are solid but the UI needs a desperate overhaul. I can say that I recommend waiting for a sale (Currently on the 2015 Steam holiday sale it's 25% off) due to the unfinished nature of the interface and menu system.\n\nScore: Wait for a Sale","January 1","true","1.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","2"

I don't want to write negative review, but I can't make it positive also.\n\nThe main plus of this game (and what sold it to me) was graphic style. I love it. It's interesting and uncommon. Stealth tag also have some influence, but don't rush if (like me) it's enough for you to spend some bucks on small discount. Game have 2 major minuses - bad gameplay design and controls.\n\nThe whole 8 hours I have played it I have suffered from controls. Main gameplay feature require you to control enemies and their guns, but you almost can't point cursor where you want because it's jumping like crazy all over the place. And it's for joystick. Mouse and keyboard are not setup completely by default and even if you will use mouse it's even more horrible than joypad. Too bad that I asked about this on forums only at the end. Because (from developers response) it occurs that game have problem with mouse and joystick enabled together. And if you will use only K+B it's working perfectly as I wanted. Keep this in mind. This game is muuuch more enjoyable with fluent controls.\n\nSecond - gameplay design. It's just... plain, old (90th), some times stupid. I hope in next game they will have less timing puzzles with spikes, mines and other devices that looks like something completely out of place. Like unlimited flying rockets that block your path and you need to duck to pass them. It's just stupid. Enemies always know where you are if alarm is ringing. And the best strategy is run back until countdown ends. Or check the second steam screenshot with rolling ball. Seems like logic didn't made it alive from this level.\n\nSome times you can't tell where floor met the hole and you character will dive into the unknown. Sometimes you will guess what you need to do next. It's not often, but annoying. Also it seems like they didn't found a way to make more variety to 'control' mechanics. Just add a little more 'patches' (ingame name) variety and more puzzles with them and game will fill much better.\n\nSo it's up to you. If you are still reading and still want to play - give it a try. You might find something to entertain you for an evening or two. Or check the demo (from search, they didn't linked it on game page).","June 1","true","8.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/396930/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Steamified recently added Klei’s Invisible, Inc. to the Steamified Countdown at #346. The next day at #345 we backed it up with another stealth oriented game in Deus Ex: Invisible War. Just yesterday, Alien: Isolation was featured at #342. Needless to say Steamified believes that some of the very best games in the Steam catalogue are stealth games. With the quality of games that fit this genre you can gain an appreciation of just how tough a market Overcurfew has entered with Tidal Affair: Before the Storm. However, you will be delighted to know that the game certainly deserves its fair share of attention.\n\nAt its core Before the Storm is an isometric adventure game that heavily features stealth and tactical shooter mechanics. You traverse levels finding switches to open gates all of the while avoiding being shot at from guards whose sole mission is to kill you and your sister. On top of the stealth and shooting mechanics you have the ability to freeze time and take control of an enemy within a certain radius of your position. When you control the guard you can use him to shoot at other guards or to execute him. Be careful, however, because if you’re in control of the guard when he dies you will lose a percentage of your own health.\n\nI would argue that more skilled gamers will find the game to be relatively simple. However, for your average gamer the game’s difficulty might be a minor concern at the beginning of the game. However, as most good strategy games rely on, you will need to development and implement strategies throughout the course of the game. The tutorial teaches you the basic moves and controls that you will be utilizing throughout the game and then just as suddenly throws you in at the deep end. Some may see this as a negative but I, for one, really appreciated this. The sooner that you throw a player in the sooner they have to learn to swim or otherwise they sink. This is the perfect game to do that with. It was an intelligent game design decision.\n\nThere have been critical complaints about the game’s poor control system. However, Overcurfew have added full controller support in their recent update which has improved it immensely. I would argue that the game is much easier to play with a controller and would recommend it rather than relying on keyboard and mouse. The developers have stated as much in the game update notice going as far as recommending the use of a PS4 controller as the best controller for the game. I, however, have utilized my trusty Xbox One controller and have found that there is no issues there. However, I would recommend one thing to the devs in their next patch. Please fix the tutorial for those who will be using controller. Presently the tutorial only details the mouse and keyboard controls for the game which means that the player has to go to a convoluted control menu to see what the corresponding key is. This will be a little bit of work to determine what controller everyone is using but it will be worth it and increase the game’s accessibility.\n\nI do have an appreciation for the game’s artistic flair. Another Steam reviewer, fantis6 described it best when they wrote that the game looks like an oil painting. It’s a highlight of the game. When combining the isometric nature of the game with the artistic flair I am reminded of Transistor. Yes, they are two very different games but the similarities are definitely there. The soundtrack is rock solid and I can see many people purchasing the soundtrack. For music fans or collectors of soundtrack edition games I would recommend taking full advantage of the game plus soundtrack bundle especially at the current 35% discount.\n\nTidal Affair: Before the Storm is a great indie game that will appeal to fans of isometric stealth games and female antagonists.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 27","true","1.3"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","1"

Detailed crates sit next to stretched roof top images.  Sharp edged plants are drawn in with mostly blurry soft trees.  The screenshots and video look good in low resolutions but even something as low as Standard Defintion easily shows how inconsitent the imagery is.  Push anything higher than High Definition and the Tidal Affair starts looking pretty bad.\n\nThere are compression artifacts and bad alpha blending on some of the textures that are disturbingly amateur.  Some objects layering appears to be incorrect with the bottoms of tree trunks appearing on top of folliage that should be infront.\n\nThe levels are large but sparesly populated.  The puzzles consit mostly of running back and forth through the silly make-work mazes rather than being cerebrally challenging.  There is button pushing, so much button pushing.\n\nThe combat is strange with Manisha sometimes being a bullet sponge and sometimes just keeling over and dying.  The health bar is largely pointelss as individual map roaming enemies do little damage but the elite guards swamp and kill her easilly.  The umbrella - which she pulls out of her leg - seems to do several times more damage than any bullets.\n\nThere are many instant environmental deaths.  The comic falls onto beach sand or water just beneath her feet, exploding into beef gibs when pricked by a spike.  And.  Well there are many environmental deaths just nor many variations.\n\nThe stealth is also a bit hit-and-miss.  There have been occasions where Manisha has been crouched but still spotted when she really shouldn't have been.  Not that it usually matters: being detected doesn't carry much penalty, except when the elite commando squads decide to investigate.\n\nThe mind control portion of the game is not quite right.  The tedious approach of suiciding single guards is far safer than trying to setup scenarios where the 'best' guard can take the others down.  Don't get swamped, give Manisha space to run away and there's no real challenge.\n\nLastly the animations are slidy and stilted.  Achievments are given despite failing those achievements.   The menus and interface are... bad.  And the cut scenes and dialogue are even worse.\n\nIt's a pity, but there's not much going for Tidal Affair.  If you want a  mind controlling stealth game then play Abe's Oddesy instead.","May 19","false","1.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Secondly, patches can be obtained along your way which allow you to perform various helpful actions which all tie into the puppet ability (Excecute controlled entity with no cool down, control entity without space limits, steal health, load headshot instantly, and switch places with the controlled entity). Lastly, you are given an umbrella thingy which is your main weapon. It may not be the strongest, but if you sucessfully sneak behind an enemy and hit them, it becomes an insta-kill.\n\n+Art style is very appealing in cutscenes and in-game- appears to be hand painted. Overall I like the art style that the developers decided to implement into this game, it suits it well.\n\n+Levels are challenging and take time to complete- if you play through all of them, you will surely get your money's worth from this game.\n\n-Cutscenes and voice acting are both a bit clunky. Although this does not take away much from the game, it is definitely noticeable.\n\n-Controls are not the best and feel akward at times.\nFinal ThoughtsAn action/stealth game that requires strategy and persistence.
