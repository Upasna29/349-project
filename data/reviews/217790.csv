You're be jumping from Pearl Harbor to Battle of Britain, from infiltrating occupied France in a captured Bf-110 to torpedo bombing the Japanese flatops at Midway, and many more. The controls must be played with an Xbox360 controller or similar twin-analog controllers (or mouse/keyboard), as this uses mainly the RC plane control method. The AI handles stuff like landing gear and throttle, you just concentrate on turn and burn. Landing is often done for a little extra challenge, and occasionally you need to go after an enemy ace. On easy the planes are responsive and the plane even "regenerates" if you don't get hit for a while. There's even kill cams where the victim of your gun mastery breaks apart in a shower of flames. There are variety of activities, from bombings to rocket attacks, from gunnery to torpedo runs, and if you are desperate you can even call in your wingmen to assist. Graphics are quite good. This is not a sim, nor does it pretend to be, as often your kills will be in the 20's, 30's, even 40's in a single mission. It's a fun game, and it delievers the shallow fun for the turn-and-burn crowd.","August 23, 2013","true","7.1"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","32","35","0","0"

It is mindless and somewhat dull if played for too long in a single session, but in short bursts manages to pull off being a fun little arcade-game that is all about nicely modeled aircraft blowing up in spectacular kill-cam-cutscenes and some beautiful looking combat areas (particularly when you rise above the clouds towards the sun).\n\nThere is no clutter in this, get in there, blow stuff up, return home - rinse and repeat. If you are expecting more, you need to look elsewhere - especially realism has been dropped to provide a more fun, arcade-ish experience - which I feel is the way this needs to be played as it reminds me of earlier Ace Combat-titles or Crimson Skies (while not being as good as both of these series). If you just want to blow some fascists out of the sky, this is the way to go - just don't expect a simulation like IL-2 Sturmovik and you will be fine.","November 30, 2013","true","3.9"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","0"

Instead of being a Flight Combat Simulator, Dogfight 1942 is more of a Flight Combat Arcade-type game. Playing with a traditional Keyboard and Mouse, I found the flying to be slightly unrealistic and to smooth to classify it as a simulator; However, it still has appeal as a fun aerial combat game. Similar to the Ace Combat series, You attack a varying range of adversaries both Aerial and ground-based, using a variety of different period aircraft you unlock through campaigning. The game can be played in Campaign mode, Through Single-player as well as Coop play with online friends. Graphically, I think it looks decent for the type of game it is. The scoring system, as well as earning 5 stars on each mission are what really give it an arcade feel. For a World War 2 type combat game, you could do worse. For an Aerial combat game, I've played much worse. Dogfight 1942 has some appeal, especially if you have friends whom you want to thrash with your own high score.","June 1, 2015","true","0.3"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

But if you don't want to spend a lot of time reading a hefty manual you're in for a treat. The missions offer a great diversity of tasks and you've the chance to fly a lot of different planes. The aircraft models and the overall graphics are decent enough and if you want to take some amazing screenshots wait for the killcam. The missions are short enough to complete in 15 to 20 minutes max - so if you're no hardcore simulation gamer just hop in your plane and have some casual fun.\nI strongly recommend to buy the DLC as you get a lot more content.\nThe game is well optimized and runs smoothly on my system - (see my profile) - and it's worth the asking price although if you're patient you can pick it up on sale quite often.","September 7, 2015","true","5.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/recommended/217790/","dpxmsk","DeadPoolX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/","1183 products in account","I hate to say this, but Dogfight 1942 is a terrible game. I'm sure there are worse action flight combat (it's nothing even remotely close to a simulator, but it was never intended to be either) games out there, but saying something isn't the "absolute worst thing you've ever played" isn't exactly a ringing endorsement.\n\nLet's break this down into categories:\n\nGRAPHICS: I know this game isn't brand new, but it's only three years old, having been released in 2012. For a game that's still that recent, the graphics resemble something from a PS2 title more than anything else. I mean it has low quality polygons, bad textures, muddy colors, etc. If this game had been released in 2005, I'd have said it looked great, but as a game released in 2012? No, it's definitely not a good looking game.\n\nAUDIO: The sound effects aren't terrible and the music is okay. The voice acting is fine, for the most part, although it's a bit overdone.\n\nThe one thing that really annoys me about the audio, however, is that the game refuses to acknowledge the volume controls on my keyboard, so in order to change the volume quickly I have to ALT + TAB out. That's simply unacceptable.\n\nCONTROLS: You can use a mouse and keyboard setup or a gamepad. I've been using an XBox 360 gamepad, and the controls feel very responsive. No complaints here.\n\nSAVE GAME METHOD: Checkpoints during the mission and after the mission, The checkpoints during the mission are also only good while you're playing, so if you need to quit, be prepared to replay everything over (as of that mission, not the entire game). If you complete the mission, then it also saves and when you continue it'll go onto the next mission.\n\nAlthough I consider checkpoints to be a cheap and lazy way of handling saves, I didn't expect much else from a console port. Overall, this didn't have a negative effect on the game, unless I had to quit for some reason.\n\nGAMEPLAY: This is the big one, and unfortunately, it's also where Dogfight 1942 does the worst. As a simple mindless action game it's decent, but the problem is that it's very unclear on the objectives and rarely gives you enough time to complete them.\n\nFor instance, there's a mission where you need to avoid detection, and there's a bar showing you how detectable you are to enemy ships. That seems good and all, but the bar raises and lowers in a seemingly arbitrary way. The way you complete this is by moving all over the place and hoping the game skips to the next cutscene (thereby creating a checkpoint) before you're noticed.\n\nIn another mission, you need to sink a bunch of enemy ships that're attacking your fleet. Halfway through, you have to divert to shoot down enemy bombers who're attacking your airfield. Then you need to fly back to your side's ships and continue trying to destroy the enemy's ships. The problem is they don't give you nearly enough time to complete this, so even if you save your airfield, you'll still fail the mission because you didn't sink all the Japanese ships.\n\nWorse yet, if you don't immediately know what they want and how they want you to do it, they'll start chastising you. I'm not exaggerating either. In one mission they began berating me for not finding a hidden airfield after I'd been flying for two seconds. I actually counted, and yes, it was two seconds!\n\nSo what's good about the game? Basically, the single missions section (where you take to the sky and shoot down however many planes listed) and co-op gameplay. You can play local co-op in the campaign and single missions, so that's fun. Perhaps the game assumes you'll be playing co-op and that's why the game doesn't give much time to complete anything.\n\nVERDICT: I'm going to say, "No, I don't think it's worth buying." However, if you're absolutely desperate for a WWII-era flight action combat game, or you have someone you can play local co-op with, I'd suggest this title ONLY if you can get it on a substantial sale of 75% off or more. Otherwise, stay away from it as it'll only cause a ton of frustration.","March 12, 2015","false","4.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Neutonian physics simply do not work the way this game portrays it.\n"Ace Mode" possibly the worst type of care bear crap ive even seen in a so-called "Authentic, historically accurate" game.\nI killed 37 enemy planes in the battle of midway, while barely taking a scratch. The only thing you have to do to win this game is Press E, followed by left control and the plane does the rest, no skill involved at all! Landing on airfielf or carrier at 160+ mph in reality would rip the tail off the plane and kill the pilot, if a plane stopped from landing speed in 50 meters then why would they have needed 1km long landing strips in the pacific war? The manouvers your plane can manage would blackout or red out the pilot in seconds and or tear the plane to pieces due to airspeed. Just one little thing while im at it, how in gods name do the bombs/rockets get reloaded in the air???? ive seen this kind of rubbish in other games and it makes me wish for battlestations midway all over again. In the battle of britan, u see a Uboat surface to fire torpedoes at merchies in harbour, why in hell would a Uboat have to surface to fire torps when at that point in the war the surface was THE worst place for a Uboat to be???? make no sense at all.\nDont waste money on this poorley thoughtout load of garbage.","September 3, 2015","false","1.0"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

That being said, it has great potential for being an extremely fun multiplayer experience, but alas it only has local co-op.","November 18, 2012","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is kind'a shallow, but enjoyable, voice acting is ok, large selection of planes. There was even a little patriotic touch from Polish autors of the game, namely PZL Jastrzab which was a polish fighter plane prototype from 1939. Its kind of useless though with very low firepower. Tha game has some minor anoyences such as a fact that you can land only in VERY specific places, and touching the groun even slightly of designated area leads to explosion. One more thing: It is a good game, but I was suprised how many people worked on it O_o. Ow and looping the credits after ending the game was a cheap move. I tend to wach the credits after a finished game. But here they go on forever :)\nI defenetly recomend that title.

While on the surface this game appears to be fun, after a few missions the quirks overwhelm much of the good to be had - Focusing on a target aircraft, while helpful for individual kills makes it almost impossible to spray an entire formation of enemy bombers. The missions that involve bombing targets are even worse, since there is little feedback given and plane control gets rather loopy. This last may have been an attempt to increase how realistic the game may seem, but fails in this regard since it makes the lack of other feedback mechanisms (say a "click" when a bomb is release") more noticeable.\n\nAdditionally, the interface and, especially, the HUD in game leave a lot to be desired. Why isn't there a compass, altimeter or anything to indicate horizon? The lack of these contribute to the light, arcade feel but not in a good way.\n\nI don't have any comments on the missions themselves - I know how the "story" turns out and was more interested in shooting planes out of the sky than saving the world.","February 17, 2014","false","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's one of the very few games that I've seen to feature the use of V-1 flying rockets by the Luftwaffe, in one desperate attempt to utterly wreck London.\nAerial combat in World War II was the beginning of a new era of aerial warfare, with the development and use of jetfighters in the European theater. The Gloster Meteor of the RAF, and countering it, introduced in the game soon afterwards - the Luftwaffe's Me-262. This is actually depicted in the game in a very cinematic manner and (minor spoiler) some lines hint to this feeling of change. On encountering the old BF-109s, the RAF squadron remarks that the Jerries are still flying those old Messers, hoping to be the dominant air power with the superior Meteors, but as if waiting for the words to be uttered enters a German jetfighter - the Me-262.\nThere's historical battles, air to air, air to land, air to sea combat; there's local co-op and multiplayer; there's survival mode (somewhat like the Survival mode of Modern Warfare 3 or the Firefight mode of Halo series); there's your favourite airplanes from the WWII era - do you see a reason *not* to call this simply one of the best games of the genre?","December 19, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Actually I left the game for a while and managed to crash twice before taking off from the carrier in the Midway mission, and I had the controlls set on arcade mode, so I suppose that it's not overly simple that way, but the missions and objectives are more simple (get in there, hit the carriers with torpedoes and get out) . The local competitve and co-op play was a big selling plus for me . It has good war game effects - I would recommend turning your headphones down to about 30 percent when first jumping into the game for solo action - the engines and machine guns sound real good .

Before playing this I checked out some of the reviews and there were some negative comments, mostly positive, but the negatives were mainly concerning the controls, lack of storyline, and unrealsim (one guy commented on how the game sucked due to the fact your bombs and torpedos reload whilst in mid air). So these are my opinions! This is game is FAR from a simulator, so if you're looking for a WW2 based flying simulator, this isn't your game! It's a fun, quick paced flight game based around WW2, from all different angles, Japan vs USA, UK vs Germany, and if you have the DLC, making the game a couple of hours longer, you can also play Russia vs Germany, and a mix of countries fighting in the Western Desert Campaign. The plane models are well made and look good, and the Ace camouflages are a good unlock feature and look amazing, and the graphics look and work perfectly fine, I even got some pretty tasty screenshots! The people who said this game is "too easy" must have played on the lowest difficulty, because the skill level between medium and hard levels are such a massive difference. If you like a challenge, then Hard is the difficulty for you, and the mission medals can sometimes be challenging to do aswell. The controls are easy on casual mode, but extremely difficult on the other 2 modes, and to get some medal unlocks and achievements, you NEED to use simulation mode. Really good game, graphics are nice, plays well, and would recommend it anyday, considering I got this from a bundle site, which I worked out that the game cost me 0.36p.
