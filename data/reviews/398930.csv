Inside of two minutes I had already purchased a copy for a friend, and we were both laughing our donkeys off!\n\nThe concept of MacGuffin is that you must break into a crumbling Japanese nuclear plant and find an item known as a “MacGuffin”. (Many of you are already in on the joke, right?) The puzzles are silly easy, and not intended to interfere with progress. Clearly, MacGuffin is a satire of the satirical “The Stanley Parable”, but infinitely funnier (which is in no way a criticism of TSP.) If you liked “Stanley” for the humor, you’ll LOVE MacGuffin for the same reason. (BUT, if you are unable to laugh at yourself, you may find it hard to laugh at MacGuffin as much as others might.)\n\nPop culture references have perhaps never been as ever present as in MacGuffin, from Nixon and what I believe is the song Funkytown, to the dead-solid best uses of the international NO symbol ever created. This game is simply hilarious, and worth more than the pittance being charged. Much of the humor is hidden or subtly sophisticated(?), and is well worth your time to find.\n\nI only have two issues. One is that there is no SAVE feature, and there are SO MANY hilarious screenshots to be posted that I found myself starting over repeatedly (which is maybe the BEST problem ever!) The other is that the gameplay locks at various points (but not menu access. This would lead me to believe that is was intentional, except that the locking has occurred in three places, one quite early.) But since the game is actually the journey rather than the destination, the locking takes away rather little from the experience.\n\nAnd while MacGuffin is a short game (how short can’t be determined until more info about the locking is shared by the DEVs), but for this rock-bottom price and its high degree of replayability, it’s well worth your time and money.\n\n4.5/5 or 9/10 or 90/100 or 934/1000\n\nThank you.","February 19","true","2.9"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","26","29","3","12"

This might be personal preference but I dont think randomness for the sake of randomness is funny.  Portal isn't funny because it's random.  It's funny because the writing is clever.  No such luck here.","February 18","false","3.2"," 29 of 47 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","29","47","0","0"

Performance is also really bad at parts despite how basic the game looks.  It's kindof like the Stanley Parable but nowhere near as good.","February 18","false","3.3"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","23","36","3","2"

That said, MacGuffin needs some love.  I have no clue what the game is a parody of, however it is entertaining as it is.  Comparing MacGuffin to games like Portal, is perhaps dumb.  My son is a Portal fan, ME I wouldn't buy Portal, although I have played it.  MacGuffin is a first-person game, and that's about it (no other similarities to Portal, so don't buy it if you expect it to be Portal-like)...\n\nAbout the game: Your goal is looking for something called the "MacGuffin", what is it?  no clue, (currently) the game freezes before you reach it.  The game is short, hence the price is fair.  You have to solve a series of a lot of self-explanatory puzzles: press any button you find, pull any level you find, power all PCs you encounter, push away things to move around them... and I am not going to give away more... just read the clues, you should be fine.\n\nWhat can be done to improve this game? -- Lots!  Please fix the beach.  Please make it MODable.  Achievements, it needs them.  More levels, pretty much make more missions: "your mission now is to hack an airport's security system and steal a 30 billion dollar jet while everyone has taken off due to some disaster"... and well, possibilities are endless.","February 20","true","1.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"

I did a vid on it and though it was hilarious, also, it costs less than 2 pounds! What do you expect? A game with beutiful graphics like the order, and has an indepth storyline like bioshock infinite with the witty humour of portal? No, this game is random, has one basic goal but like to make your journey to that goal an interesting one. I like it alot","February 22","true","0.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
