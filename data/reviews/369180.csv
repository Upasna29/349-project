That wouldn't be a bad thing. However, the original game was obviously a classic free2play bait where the difficutly rises faster than your ability to fight. Pretty soon, you have to buy more powerful weapons and abilities, rather than wait for them to unlock in the course of the game. I personally hate this kind of games and it's reason enough for me to rate them abysmally low. Here, however, we have something worse. The whole thing got ported without the f2p feature, so without an option for you to buy more stuff. You get gold every day, if you navigate to the proper button, yes. But I'd like to play a game when I'm in the mood, not having it sit on my hard drive for a week just collecting the daily "gifts", just so I can afford a decent attack and progress.","September 5, 2015","false","2.4"," 114 of 124 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","114","124","0","0"

Of course you could wait a week and grab the daily rewards to get the gold needed to buy new items and upgrades, but that's exactly the reason WHY mobile games are F2P and have micro-transactions.\n\nThe game itself is a dumbed down ARPG which could be fun if not for the really obvious paywall. If you sell your game for a price instead of making it micro-transaction based at least adjust the difficulty setting! Really just a waste of time (and money if you haven't gotten it in a bundle).\n\nEdit: Turns out the daily free gold reward is broken. This game isn't working properly and should really be removed from Steam as asking for 5$ in its current state is really a bad joke.","January 9","false","1.0"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","29","32","2","0"

It is very easy to pick up and put down being that the average quests takes 3 to 5 minutes to complete. The crafting system and items/equipment aren't nearly as fleshed out as most other hack n' slash rpgs, but they add a decent enough touch. The game does get very repetitive though. There aren't many level designs and after killing the same 5 mob types for an hour boredom will start to set in.\n\n\nDon't expect an epic Titan Quest type adventure, but for $4.00 it's worth it for the short mindless pick-up and go sessions","June 18, 2015","true","4.3"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","18","33","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/369180/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","I‚Äôm a fan of action RPGs. I‚Äôve poured hundreds upon hundreds of hours into the likes of the Diabo, Torchlight and Titan Quest franchises to name just three. I like too many games across too many genres to be able to claim that I‚Äôm a master of any one genre, I‚Äôm closer to a jack of all trades, but if there‚Äôs one that I could almost make that claim for it would be action RPGs. Therefore you can imagine my curiosity and my interest when I got the opportunity to cover Soulcraft for Steamified. Of course, it had registered as a game that I put on my wishlist when it came out back in June of last year but with so many big budget even bigger time investment titles released around that time (e.g. The Witcher 3) I simply hadn‚Äôt gotten to it until now.\n\nIf truth is completely told then I would have to tell you that SoulCraft is not a great game. It may not even be a very good game. But, and this a pretty big but, I legitimately enjoyed my time with it. This is really one of those guilty pleasure games for me. I had no right to enjoy this game as much as I actually did. I very rarely feel this way about games. There are a litany of issues that  plague this game but at the end of the time that I allocated towards it I was still having fun with it. Sometimes that‚Äôs all you can possibly ask for from a game.\n\nThere were a few things that I kept playing for. The first was that although rather simplistic I found the actual fighting in the levels to be enjoyable. Battles ‚Äì entire levels rather than just individual fights ‚Äì  are rather short and quick affairs that provide sharp, short bursts of gameplay. You could easily play this game in 10-15 minute spans if you so chose to. Given that the game is a mobile port that is most likely the way that it is supposed to be played. It‚Äôs not until you sit down for lengthier sessions that all of the faults in the game become so apparent (although they‚Äôre there and sometimes undeniably so). The second thing that I really enjoyed was the fact that there are so many unlockables. You rarely go between fights without the ability of upgrading a piece of armor, a weapon, a spell/skill or what have you. It can make the game downright addictive and classic ‚Äòone more turn, let‚Äôs see what I got this time‚Äô type gameplay.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is that it is a mobile port. The PC game still carries with it the mobile strategy of it being a free to play game with microtransactions driving the game‚Äôs income. Once again not enough is done to eliminate this system before the developer slapped a buy to play price on it and called it a day. For once I‚Äôd really appreciate seeing a gaming developer call a spade a spade and if they were going to put their mobile freemium game onto Steam to do the same. Put it up for free and enable microtransactions to those who want to advance further or faster into the game. I‚Äôm not ashamed to buy some in game credit if two conditions are met. First, that the money I‚Äôm spending does aide those that developed the title. I know your game costs money to make and even if you put it up for free you need to have some way of making a profit from it so if I am going to be putting money into your pocket to either maintain the game or so that you can develop new titles then that‚Äôs fantastic. Secondly, I‚Äôd like to know that what I‚Äôm buying in game is actually going to be worth it. It will help me and give me the sense that I‚Äôve helped myself as much as I‚Äôve helped you.  If you need an example of games that do this well on Steam look no further than a couple of the clicker games but to narrow it down to one Adventure Capitalist. Some players wouldn‚Äôt have been able to complete the Christmas special had they not purchased in game tokens. They got the reward that they wanted and the developer, Hyper Hippo Games, profited from a well thought out campaign. A smart move for the developer and their addicted paying customer.\n\nThe next problem is that the unlockables are rather pointless. There are so many of them and they come so quickly that you‚Äôre often swapping them in and out more quickly than the game can keep up. I didn‚Äôt find myself using in game gold (which I‚Äôm sure of the two currencies is the one that is the most expensive in regards to microtransactions on the mobile platform) but rather the ‚Äòskulls‚Äô currency which too comes quick and fast especially when you purchase an in game animal who collects the in game drops before they vanish. This both decreased the difficulty of the game to the point of making it trivial at some points but also makes me not worry about micro transactions. Having not played the mobile version I wonder if this is a similar case and if it is then I worry that the game isn‚Äôt making the developer enough.\n\nCombat too can feel a little unfair at times. Instant stuns, unavoidable damage and at higher levels instant-death plague the game without you ever having anything to do about it. This might be a consequence of the game being a mobile port ‚Äì encouraging people to spend money ‚Äì or it could just be bad code. Either way it‚Äôs more than a little frustrating and equally disappointing. You need to give your players a chance. That is what makes games such as Dark Souls so popular. As difficult as they are the player knows that if they learn how to play each encounter the right way that they should eventually win it.\n\nSoulCraft is an absolute guilty pleasure in that it‚Äôs not a great game but I love returning to it. It‚Äôs also a game that is flawed but could serve as an example to freemium mobile developers to learn from. Either keep your game free to play with microtransactions which other Steam games do or develop the PC version in such a way that the mobile pay wall doesn‚Äôt impact negatively against your PC players. Players will support you if you do it the right way.\n\nFor similar reviews and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\nFor our Steam group please join http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified\nFor our Steam curation please follow http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified#curation","February 8","true","1.3"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/recommended/369180/","goldenkitten","Goldenkitten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/","627 products in account","Update 12/15/15: Though my initial review of the game and its mechanics stands, some glaring issues have forced me to revise it to a not recommended. That said it's a middling not-recommended and if the game and its mechanics appeal to you, chances are there's still fun to be had. The issues are that there are a number of gameplay bugs and a handful of bugs for achievements (won't pop-up no matter what, and this isn't just me, they're widely documented) that really bring it down. Normally this wouldn't be enough to bring a game down for me but the fact that the dev has gone completely silent and refuses to talk about it speaks incredibly ill of them. So changing this to a negative review has more to do with shady business practices, not wanting to support a dev that forgets its buyers and a handful of bugs than it does that standing games worth.\n\n----------------------\n\nI‚Äôm not entirely certain where the hate is coming from, save that it‚Äôs a mobile game and there are certain people who just hate mobile game ports, even decent ones.\n\nSo yeah, let‚Äôs get that out of the way. It‚Äôs a mobile port and if that bugs you then you‚Äôre probably going to dislike this game. Though it‚Äôs been retooled for purchase on the PC there are still plenty of signs it was at one time a mobile game. The graphics, the controls, and definitely the gold and daily-quests mechanic.\n\nThat said as far as mobile ports go this one has seen a pretty solid revamping. The controls have been reworked to play like any other ARPG, the combat is simple but satisfying. Though the gold mechanic remains the way you gain it has been drastically altered. You get an acceptable amount of gold simply by playing the game, and unlike I imagine the mobile was, a lot of mechanics used to gain more gold are in fact free here.\n\nThere is definitely a grind to be had, but then that can be said of plenty of games. If you hate grinding then again the game isn‚Äôt for you, but at no point have I felt like the grind was excessive to the point of frustration. The early game moves quite quickly, and though scaling results in a longer grind later on the short missions (none lasting more than five minutes) ensures that you never get stuck doing one thing for too long.\n\nThough this game isn‚Äôt made for the story as someone who likes to know this I‚Äôll include it for others. The story is 100% forgettable and nothing you‚Äôll remember in a month or two. But for what it is it‚Äôs serviceable. It moves you from one objective to the next and isn‚Äôt so horrible as to be painful like you might think.\n\nSo long story short I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with the game. It won‚Äôt be your new favorite game, and it was clearly a mobile game at one point. But it‚Äôs a decent game and a decent port, and for the price there‚Äôs nothing truly objectionable about it.","December 14, 2015","false","9.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
