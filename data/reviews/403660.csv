I got bored around ten minutes in, lost further interest by sixty minutes, and had mostly decided to refund before I reached ninety minutes, but I played out until just shy of two hours because I wanted the game to become fun. It never did.\n\nI believe that the core problem with Omnipresent is the fact that the developer had much bigger dreams than his (it seems to be a one-man game) skills could complete. There are a lot of mechanics and interactions that COULD be really fun, but end up being really boring.\n\nThe stock market: It fluctuates WILDLY from second to second. Stocks can change by hundreds of dollars in the blink of an eye. Of course, you can drop any stock to near-zero just by hacking the relevant site, buy at almost nothing, and sell for everything. The only problem is that you keep getting blocked and having to pay money to unlock your trading account -- which isn't fun or challenging (when you make 3 million per sale of stock, paying 3 million for an unlock still results in obscene profits), it's annoying.\n\nThe hacking minigames: There are two. One is supposed to be timing-based, where you press the right key at the right time. Or you can spam lots of keys all the time and get 90% of the way done, without even pressing some of the right keys at all. The other is just outright spam keyboard mash. Niether of these are fun mechanics.\n\nThe hacking overmap game: There are these little enemy bubbles that wander around the map. Hack when they're nearby, and you get detected. Hack when they're far away and you don't get noticed at all. This isn't fun. You can just wait for them to wander off and then hack whatever you want. Sometimes they don't wander off, and you sit there bored.\n\nThe in-game browser: A neat idea, but having all the sites being "blocked by NSO" or otherwise redacted is no fun.\n\nThe objectives are sometimes unclear (Being asked to hack CTI to get a "special software" with no dialogue or explanation that CTI stands for the California Institute of Technology.)\n\nThe e-mail autoresponses are idiotic, where sending a mission success e-mail with required data is replied with a payment and "So-and-so is unavailable."\n\nThere's never any overmap pressure. You're never being rushed to do things. Any time your detection risk gets a bit high you can wait for the NSO or MIHQ to **** off and the risk to drop, and in a few minutes you'll be right as rain. Never a downside.\n\nI think the final straw was when I started being able to hack the NSO and MIHQ and all of a sudden the "fun" mechanic of tracking viruses started. Oh no! I have to click EVERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SPOT OF THE INTERNET TO FIND VIRUSES, THEN CLICK REMOVE. AND THERE ARE FIFTEEN. THIS IS A WASTE OF ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TIME AND ITS NO FUN AT ALL.\n\nI'm sorry, but Uplink is simply a better hacking game, with more fun mechanics. And if the play-as-AI is your love, there's an uncompleted game titled Endgame:Singularity available for free (legally for free, it's open-source) that is just a better AI emergence simulator. That game is both free and UNFINISHED and it's still better than Omnipresent.\n\nI think the big lesson to learn from Endgame: Singularity was the overmap time pressure. In that game, any base could be detected -- and shut down -- by the humans at any time. You had to spread out, but spreading out too much would result in some bases being found (since they each had individual chances to be detected), which would raise worldwide suspicion. You were under pressure to expand to get the processing power needed to complete research and money-making tasks, but also under pressure to remain small and hidden so you didn't get destroyed. It. Was. Difficult. Omnipresent isn't difficult. It's a time-killer.","September 28, 2015","false","1.9"," 90 of 96 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","90","96","5","5"

Save sometimes doesn't load corretly and you have to start over again. Sometimes saves overlap and you end up with a mission to complete but you have already completed it. Music is quite nice but the default settings for it are a little too high. I cannot seem to lower them using the settings menu which is weird. However, I am still able to control it via sound panel on windows. If the developer could I would suggest having the game come with its own version of JAVA similar to how minecraft is working right now. That way you can make sure everyone is using the same version and it would really help on later on debugging.\n\nI have seen people asking for the soundtrack for the game which the developer has responded he is looking into it. So that is really cool.\n\nYou can go to the discussions page and see that the developer reads and replies to most if not nearly all question posting on there.\n\nThe game itself is quite simple and is mostly like a giant casual puzzle disgused as a AI simulation which in my option is actually quite fun. Sometimes I want a simple game to just waste the time away and this is a really good one to do so. Behind the current bugs I believe this game will get much better than it looks right now. Hence the 1.0+ updates it is continuing to recieve.\n\nI personaly hope the dev later on quite awhile from now figures out how to factor the steam workshop in along with basic multiplayer. DLC would also work if they unlocked different kind of playstyles and were not that expensive.","September 28, 2015","true","4.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

I'm running a very high end PC, and at I have to wait a good 10 minutes on a white screen on startup. Secondly, the game lags a LOT. Map scrolling is terrible, the UI is awful. This game is undoubtedly not worth the pricetag. The other users could not have stated it better. The mini-games are just bad. I mean one of them is literally just "Smash every key til you get it right", but unfortunately, the game has a major chance to crash. The other is some scrolling key press, which seems timed, but sometimes is just random as hell. I thoroughly regret this purchase.","September 29, 2015","false","10.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","1"

Progress is constantly mired down by vague objectives, or the game simply not registering that you've completed an objective. It is a perpetual uphill battle just to get it to work. I often found myself wondering if the reason I couldn't complete an objective was because I was doing something wrong, or if I'd simply hit yet another bug.\n\nNot all of  the game's problems are the result of bugs, however, as many of the mechanics for the game are lackluster, make little sense, or unblanced. Others here have gone into far better about where the game is lacking, so I won't bother repeating things.\n\nOverall this feels more like an early access title than it does a finished product, and I can't help being a little upset at that. While I have to commend this first time dev for providing support to players, and working tirelessly to fix the bugs that are present, I simply can't recommend anyone purchase this.","September 29, 2015","false","6.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

This game is an AI simulation. If you ever asked yourself how would it be an all powerfull AI, this is your game. Yes, the game is easy, yes the hacking games are easy and yes it is easy to earn money. But I think that is the point, how it would be easy for an AI to whatever it wanted.\n\nGuess the Dev being an actual "Award wining AI Researcher" (check his twitter) *rolls eyes*. His imagination of an AI is quite powerfull, and humanity has no hope. So you are looking for skynet vs humanity, this is more like skynet went online bye humanity and time traviling anything.\n\nSo why did I liked this game, like 2001 which is highly referenced in the game, what is the next stage of evulution. And will it be good or bad... or what is good or bad. This game makes me ask these questions to myself. So this game is more like a playable book. Leaves you with a fun experince and lots of moral dilema.\n\nSo, if you are looking for uplink, plauge inc or next hacking game you will have essance of it in the game. This migth be your game. But if you are looking for a fun OCD time with packed moral questions and feel all powerfull then this is definitely your game.\n\nFun game! Had bit lag problem with my SSD comp, but had no problem with HDD laptop. Awsome soundtrack, loved the stock market (OCD). Hated the f**** hacking mini game. Fast responsive one man dev with good intentions and hardwork. Hope all the bugs are fixed and people can have fun!!!","September 29, 2015","true","4.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its has a lot of aspects that I really enjoy in a game and I really did try to like it.  It also has some very big negatives that took away from that desire.\n\nPros:\n-You get to be a super computer AI\n-You have the choice to play sandbox at just about anytime\n-Some clever 'no hand holding' problems\n\nCons:\n-You never really 'feel' like a super computer AI\n-The mini games are repetitive and boring\n-All you can really do in sandbox is earn more money, which is easy to get and doesn't really matter much after you finish your base building.\n-Very scripted linear story that feels... clunky?\n\nWhat I wanted in this game was a skynet simulator.  That isn't what you get.  The unscripted elements of the game are minimal and trivial.  The obstacles to your taking over the world are also very easy to get around and at most just annoying.  All advancements in the game are from scripted missions.  Outside of a few interesting scripted problems all you have is a bag of tricks that you keep using over and over, it gets quite boring.\n\nStuff that needs fixed:\n-Stock market is WAY to easy\n-Scripted email conversations are wonky and impossible sometimes to word right, ends up feeling like you are writing a computer and not the other way around.\n-Moving troops around gets cumbersome\n\nAt the end of the day I'd rather play uplink.","September 29, 2015","false","6.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

What I really liked about the game was that although it was representing the world from an AI's perspective it has the user interface that one can easily adjust to so one does not get lost in all the code you would assume to be in an AI mechanics. The browser, search engine, and all the web sites including stock exchange are very well executed and function like the ones on the web so it is quite fun to use them.\n\nI liked the range of activities you can do as an AI, from stealing research papers to reaching bank accounts etc. And when you connect them all, there really is nothing you can not do as an AI. The really well thought touch for me was the Detection Percentage - the AI is not a program detached from the world. There are both other softwares and people that are in interaction with it.\n\n\nI definitely recommend Omnipresent and am looking forward to the updates and new scenarios.","September 29, 2015","true","2.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
