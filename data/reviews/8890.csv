The kind that isn't a repeat of something you saw with a fresh coat of paint, but a celabration of WHY we love this thing we love. Stylistically it seems to lovingly and joyfully toss in every silver age (and lots of golden age) comic book trope and cliche both in how the characters speak and look. Expressed no more beautifully than through the amazing hero origin cut scenes between each mission. Cut scenes which I hasten to add are easily the best element for me in the entire game. From the narration, to the story itself, to the personas of each hero...the game just knows what it is and knows exactly what its calling back to.\n\nGameplay wise the game isn't mind blowing but I wouldn't call it bad. It feels like a slightly looser and far less complex version of the pause/start style of a Balder's Gate or Dragon Age. Teetering on this little border between beat em up/strategy/crpg. You pause, issue commands, target enemies with abilities or allies with buffs and heals, unpause. It works and honestly its a style of gameplay Id love to see given over to actual comic book video games in the future if it evolved some. I mean it makes perfect sense for this kind of strategy light gameplay to be how a super hero team game should play. Now the issues start to nip at the edges when it comes to things like AI pathing and priorities. But really at the pop of a button you can pause anyway so even though it'd be nice to have your heroes act smarter when not under direct orders at all times...it aint nobodies fault but your own that they ever don't have said orders. Imagine one of the old syndicate games but with more verticality and the ability to pause and issue commands. Also I think some of the 'Jagged Alliance' games utilized this mechanic.\n\nFor me though the issue with this game I had most trouble dealing with was the length. Mind you I played it in 2 hour stints but by the time I got to the end I felt like it had overstayed its welcome. I had long ago seen the last of the amazing hero origin cut scenes and by the time I stopped felt like the game had become rather drawn out. With missions made needlessly long for the sake of tacking on time played.  That being said I could easily still recommend this title to anyone who is a lover of silver age comic books. Its like the first Freedom Force game but better. It's the kind of thing a comic book fan cannot help but smile at over and over again. so considering how cheap it usually is I firmly suggest giving it a try.","January 1","true","12.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Runs great on Windows 7 in Windows Vista compatibility mode. Just finished the campagin for the second time. It's easy to learn and hard to master, just the way I like it. Love that you can pause the game in the single player campaign, really helps to get a more strategic view and plan accordingly. They kept the RPG elements quite light in this game, this really helps when trying to pick your members for your team. I'm now ready to try some of the amazing mods that have been created for this game.","April 4, 2015","true","28.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a fan of comics or superheroes, this game does a very good job at providing a charmingly campy feel and an immense selection of cutomization options for making your own hero, from climbing walls to punching buildings into rubble, to throwing cars, to flying, to super speed, to mind control. I had always wanted a game that allowed true freedom for developing a hero that can do almost anything, and when I found out this existed, I couldn't contain my excitement. Of course the graphics are now outdated, but the game still holds up as an enjoyable comic experience. There is even a mod called Freedom Force X (FFX) that I have read adds more abilities like shapshifting and additional attributes. I have yet to try it, but have downloaded it and look forward to the additional content. I highly recommend looking into this if you are at all a fan of superheroes. Besides, at the asking price of less than $8, there isn't a lot to lose.","June 17, 2015","true","24.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the sequel is definitely "darker and edgier", it keeps and improves on the audacious tone of the original. Even the gameplay, while mostly intact, has been improved significantly - both in terms of simplified energy control and a lot more variety in campaign missions. One my best purchasing decisions for sure.","May 17, 2015","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's cleaned up a lot of the messy bits of the first game, but somehow the story doesn't resonate as powerfully.  Maybe because it focuses strongly on a few characters, rather than keeping the ensemble feel of the first story.
