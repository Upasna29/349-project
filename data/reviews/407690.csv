No pitcher specific pitches, so no high heat from your closer followed by a nasty slider.\n\nThe presentation is, again, shallow. Very little to no commentary, the splash screen between innings is pretty bad. It's somewhere they could have easily put some work into, but didn't.\n\nTeam management is absent: no trades, no AAA promotions, no FA.\n\nIt is a real MLB game though: stadiums, uniforms (including throw-backs), and players are all here.\n\nOverall very simple to control, you can pick it up and play it easily.\n\nHas both online and local multi-player.\n\nAt this price, and considering it is the only MLB licensed game on PC atm, it's worth playing if you need to scratch that baseball itch.\n\nWish there was a neutral vote for game rating. It's not a bad game, it's just not a great game. It doesn't seem fair to hold not being a AAA title against it when it only cost $19.99.","March 29","true","0.6"," 59 of 82 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","59","82","0","15"

Here comes the 2-1 pitch... and he hits a screamer into the alley in left center!!!! This will go for extra bases! Wait... Albert? Albert?? He's just standing at home plate! ALLLLBERRRTTT!!!!!! And Pujols is thrown out at first."\n\nYes, this game has bugs. But wait - I'm an uncoordinated old fart - maybe I hit the wrong button on my steam controller. Nope. The little mini-map that shows the base runners showed no base runners. It wasn't my noobness. Considering other bugs, I know it wasn't me.\n\nAfter the very first game, my starting pitcher won the game! Woot. Then he won it again! Wait huh? After the one and only game, my first starting pitcher had a record of 2-0. That's Cy young material there!\n\nThis is one of those games you wish you had a "Meh" button mashed between the "Yes I recommend it" and "No I dont" buttons.\n\nIt's a fun little arcady type game. If you are looking for a serious and detailed baseball simulation, look elsewhere. If you want to blow 10 minutes every now and then in a brain dead way, then yeah.... I recommend it despite its faults. The graphics aren't quite Major League quality (more like double A) but its merely adequate. The sound? Well... my recomendation is to play this while watching a real baseball game and crank up the TV's volume.\n\nIn the end, Im giving it a thumbs up because I will probably keep playing it for whatever brain dead reason of mine.","April 8","true","6.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","14","15","6","0"

Pitch, swing, miss. Over and over.\n\nSomeimes the AI will make contact, but as I say, its very rare. Thats what I found anyways and its spoiling the game, so going to have to give it a thumbs down until this is corrected.\n\nNot tried online yet, which should be better in this regard, but dont really like playing baseball online as not found many people that try to play it properly and dont just swing at everything.","March 31","false","1.6"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","20","28","3","0"

It plays very much the same if not exactly the same. Automatic dives and jumps have been added this year, which is a good thing. I was really hoping for the ability to make trades during season mode. Currently that isn't an option. I was also hoping for injuries or fatigue for the fielders. Sadly both are lacking again this year. All the fields are there as well as the players. I enjoyed last year's game and I enjoy this one. Can I recommend it? Yes, if you're looking for a baseball game on the PC platform. No, if you're looking for an all out in-depth baseball sim. This is NOT The Show by any stretch. It is, like previous years, an arcade style baseball game.","March 29","true","37.7"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","0"

Has all the nostalgic nods to the old days and brings it to today. It feels and plays just like I remember it. Was able to just jump right in and get at it. Of course, there are quite a few improvements over the NES version of yester years with authentic MLB rosters and stats along with pretty good renders of the actual stadiums (that I have seen so far). Takes a bit of time to get use to the speed of the pitching and controlling your fielders, but I know this will be one I will enjoy as the season goes on.\n\nThose of you looking for an experience like MLB The Show, keep moving. This is by no means a complete MLB simulation game. Graphics are smooth and purdy, but I care more for gameplay than I do how good it looks.\n\nThis was my first time playing any of the new RBI Baseball games that started in 2014, and I am happy with my purchase. Cant wait to get more in tune with the controlls and timing so that I may get my taste of online ranked matches.\n\nIn short, if you loved the original RBI Baseball on the NES, this will not dissapoint.

It has working multiplayer which is rare in the baseball genre on the PC. It's best to have friends on your list to play the game against. Finding random players is rare because the playerbase is so small.\n\nAside from that, there have been overall improvements to the game. Graphics look much better than in 15 and the pitching is fixed. Batting system has been improved. New fielding moves (automatic). The AI has been revamped and has downloadable roster updates as the season progresses.\n\nThis game is arcadey, fast paced and simplistic. Don't let the word simplistic fool you though, it's still a lot of fun.\n\nMy only gripes are the Max FPS not having a disable option (as it is now you can only choose 30fps or 60fps) and when enabling v-sync the game suffers from a bit of studder\lag. We need an option to disable Max FPS. Also, V-Sync seems like it needs more work and be polished up some.","May 2","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
