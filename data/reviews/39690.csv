Let's say it straight, this is different game, don't expect fourth part of Gothic. Some elements are similar, but general feeling is: this is different game.\nSo in the next step I tried to enjoy it as RPG game. If game is different than Gothic, that doesn't mean it's a bad game, right? So in that situation it is not true. This game is bad. Some elements, like graphics and music are quite nice, but generally game is just bad. Main story is totally linear, you can't go wherever you want. World is divided to small parts and you have to explore them one by one, you can't encounter a lot stronger monsters than you.\nI love RPGs, but this game didn't sucked me. I didn't feel that I explore the world I want to explore. I didn't feel I'm a part of adventure, I want to be part of.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you're a fan of Piranha Bytes games, save yourself the disappointment.\nIf you're a fan of good RPG games, there are many better games out there.\nIf you finished all RPGs and you need to play it, be prepared to collecting the honey in one of most stupid quests. So if you like winnie the Pooh, go ahead, this game is made for you.\n\nLike this review?

Are you interested in buying this game ? Let me tell you about this game. This game is not worth your time and money. This game starts you off as a shepherd (not THE shepherd) and has you trying to woo your girlfriend on some island. This game will then do what any game does to ruin the good mood and send you away on a journey for revenge.\nAll the story progress in this game is just for the sake of getting your revenge. Remember that, when you slug through the chapters, hoping for a cool story.\n\nThis game lets you decide on how to play it by offering you all the options : Melee, Ranged and Magic. The overly simplistic and lame skill-tree requires tough decision making from you. +1% mana and +1% mana regen or rather +1% stamina and +1% stamina regen...or maybe +1% ranged damage and +1% mana regen ? The choices...Eventually you might also reach one of the maybe 10 new skills..I say new, but in the end they just change the skill you already have to something better, like giving you a power bash or letting you combo more attacks...meh.\n\nThis game is kinda separated into different hubs, where the actual chapter is being played. As soon as you finish one, you basically move onward to the next hub area. This game is technically an open world game, but you don't have any necessity to ever venture back to the places you've already been to and instead keep following a linear route to your goal. This game sports acceptable environmental graphics, but butt-ugly character models. This game also features some of the most laid back casual combat ever. This game is hardly a challenge on normal difficulty and at least your progress will be steady..combat wise..\n\nThis game however does have a major flaw, which will most likely make you quit rather sooner than later :\nTHIS GAME HAS NO QUEST MARKERS. This game will just tell you to find an item/person in the east/west/north/south of where you accept the quest and then has you run around the place trying to find the item/person without any sort of indication. Even worse, this game often has the habit of only spawning the item/person you are looking for once you accepted the quest to do so. That means you can run all over the map in advance, explore everything possible and then have to do it all over again after accepting some random "HEY, FIND THIS CHEST IN THAT CAVE WHICH NOW EXISTS BUT DIDN'T BEFORE". This game will then commence laughing at you, until you open google after an hour to just look up where the item/person is, that you're looking for.\n\nThis game incorporates very boring and bland dialogue as well, which often makes you feel as if you're just playing some random mmo. Nothing in this game will make you feel involved with the world, mostly because the world itself is such a boring, empty yet quite spacy place..still very empty though..too empty even..way too empty..not enemy wise..quite a few enemies...but otherwise very empty.\nThis game has no redeeming qualities at all. Even the lockpicking system is really irritating with its required timing. This game does allow you to craft, but thats just reading a recipe, press "C" , select the thing and click the "craft" button.\nThis review is already way too long for this game, so let me tell you once again that this game is really not worth it.\nThis game, which I have played for 10 hours, is not recommended :P","February 23, 2015","false","10.6"," 115 of 147 people (78%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","78","115","147","20","0"

I was looking forward to this as a Gothic fan (on it's release it was called ArcaniA: Gothic IV or ArcaniA a gothic tale because it was supposed to be the next gothic game). It's supposed to be an open world RPG but it's more like a liniar bad hack n' slash game with level progression. basicly this is what the game is: after you finish the intro (which is the only fun part of the game) you get to a tiny part of the island, you do a part of the main quest and you unlock another tiny part of the island where you can do another part of the main quest and you unlock another tiny part of the island and so on untill the final battle. And than it's game over, no more exploring for no reason at all. the main quest is boring, there are only a few side quests which are even worse than the main quest. characters are boring and not memoreble at all, even the characters from Gothic 1, 2, and 3 and exploring is rarely rewarding, not that there is much to explore as most of the remotely interesting sites are used for the main quest. if you played the demo and liked it keep it that way the demo covers by far the best part of the game.\n\nArcaniA a gothic fail scores a 3/10","November 29, 2013","false","13.9"," 110 of 142 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","110","142","0","3"

Eventually the desire to continue wanes when immersion is broken due to the callousness to which this RPG as been constructed. Speaking directly to Spellbound Entertainment, I really couldn't care less what your budget is and I don't care about the perilous finances of your now bankrupt publisher. When you undertake a project like this and dress it with the same repeating carbon copy npc's then you have no right to undertake such a project.

Its a semi-open world where you have to unlock the next area by completing certain objectives.  The hero a boy from Feshyr a simple shepard  and I mean simple.  This is one game that truly could have been an OUTSTANDING game. The hero he lacked substance and didn't grow he was still the simple ignorant, and dumb shepard from Freshyr.  If you are a hardcore RPG fan this game might be for you.  It does have some really good parts and the story has so much more to offer then it did.  Mind numbing questing everyone in the game just takes advantage of the main hero (honestly after 25 hours of game play I couldn't tell you his name).  I need to find this will you help me?  Yes but you have to do this first?  OK I accomplished the task.  NO you tricked me or What I have do one more thing.  The repetitiveness of the same quest just a different location hurt this game more then anything. The game mechanics on fighting were good.  On the other hand the enemy’s repeated there attacks in the same order over and over again just like the weather dusk, morning, afternoon evening all sunny.  Then night calm, lets say midnight rain, then dusk it stops and repeats the order.  That’s all the game does really is repeat its self over and over.  The graphics are descent the endless invincible walls not so much.    I don't  personally like to give a bad review because the designers of the games we love to play, put so much time and effort into them but this is one game had the possibility to offer so much more and falls short by a long haul in my opinion. It feels like they had a good a vision for the game but couldn't fulfill or even do it justice on what they envisioned.  One of the most notable parts of the game was the voice actor David Lodge. He was known for his voice role as Kenpachi Zaraki in Bleach and the role of Jiraiya in Naruto.

I really wanted to like this, but I just can't. The problem is not, that this is not Gothic anymore. I knew that already when I bought it (Even thou it tries to be Gothic by having the name in its title). The Problem is, even seeing it as a single game, without the series, its just not a good game. However I'll try to make a list of pros and cons here and you'll see for yourself if you want to play it or not:\n\nPros:\n-Graphics + Design of the enviroment\n-Easy controls\n-Very easy, its pretty hard to die in the beginning, it slowly gets harder, but you never get to the point where you need more than 2-3 tries to kill an enemie, which makes it a good game for people, who don't often play RPG's and/or want quick and fast progress\n-It's not hard to find your way, they're all pretty obvious, there are no long walking parts\n-You meet some NPC's from the Gothic games (however meeting some of them makes no sense, because of the end of Gothic 3)\n-(Bandages are food ;b)\n\nCons:\n-Voice actors in german and english (didn't try others) are terrible. You just can't take them seriously\n-The only thing you need gold for is potions, weapons/armor are free, which gives you nearly no reason to explore your enviroment -> if you do so, you'll find nothing better anyways\n-There are no real choices and the few choices you make have no influence\n-Combat is pretty much clicking, clicking, clicking...and rolling now and then\n-The story is linear, you visit one part of your map after the other, there is no need to go back and what happens next is obvious all the time, every possible cliché is used\n-Skill tree...is not a tree, more like skill lines, good thing is you can't do anything wrong here and your skills don't have influence on what weapons/armor you wear. Magic skill lines will upgrade your spell, there are only 3 spells in total for the whole game\n-Lots of quest items only spawn after you got the quest...one more reason to not look into caves as long as noone tells you to do so\n-The graphics are good in general, but you'll find lots of glitches/textures\n-Invisible walls everywhere\n-No reason to play it again, you'll see everything there is in one playthrough\n-Some small bugs (NPC's not willing to talk to you unless you reload your last save, enemies getting stuck)","July 25, 2015","false","23.6"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","40","51","4","0"

And there's a lot to live up to because the first 2 games were considered sort of icons of the genre. Here’s a list of remarks made while playing:\n\nGame mechanics:\n+ Looting is fast and simple.\n+ One of the coolest looking minimaps I've seen.\n+ Main quest conversations trigger automatically when approaching the right npc. This prevents fruitless dialogues with npc's who don't really have anything to say.\n+ Health regenerates\n+ Interesting lock picking system\n+ Game creates savegames itself in important places. Don't remember the previous ones doing that.\n- If the quest location stays out of the range of the minimap then the minimap doesn't show you the direction towards the location.\n- Minor bugs with characters getting stuck behind invisible obstacles.\n- The question weather it is open world or not. Fans of Gothic say that ArcaniA is not open world like the other Gothic games were. I ask: was Gothic 1 open world? They say 'yes, but a really small open world'. I say: well, there you have it. Arcania has those small areas, bigger than in Witcher, but it's not open in the same way Gothic 3, Skyrim and GTA were. I bring it up because it has been noted as a flaw.\n- Levelling up badly balanced. The game is way too generous in helping you max your stats. By the time I was through two thirds of the game I had maxed out everything I needed.\n\nDesign:\n+ Beautiful textures, highly improved compared to Gothic 3 BUT they blend together horribly.\n+ Weirdly the game get's better designwise as the it advances. Looks like they created the first chapter just to learn how to do the job.\n- The guy who created the 3D models didn't have a clue about human anatomy.\n- Like so often in games the main character looks like some fancy-pants out of a men's magazine.\n- In game written material is in some kind of modern comic font which doesn’t blend with the rest of the game at all.\n- During dialogues, when the characters are zoomed in, armor stretches and bends as if it was part of flesh and muscle.\n- Insanely few character models. The orcs, for example, look all the same.\n\nGame flow:\n+ ArcaniA’s best feature: they've come up with a helpful, easy-to-use dodging system. My experience with other games (Elder Scrolls, Assassin's Creed, Gothic) is that going in for the kill is more profitable that starting to dodge/ block, which in most cases is hard and pointless. ArcaniA nailed it and I give them huge credit for it.\n+ Npc's with quests are marked with an exclamation mark.\n+ Auto-aim enemies in malee battle (like in Assassin’s Creed) . In ArcaniA you come across places where you fight off 8 enemies or so at once. The auto trigger feature makes the battle in such occasions more fluent and faster overall.\n\nAtmosphere:\n+ The protagonist actually talks when you trigger a dialogue. Games these days (Skyrim, Half-Life etc.) have taken the silent protagonist approach which in my opinion closes some potent doors.\n+ Diego and Gorn are the coolest they've ever been during the whole series.\n+ The character is a charming fellow with good spirit. It contrasts highly with the previous nameless hero who at least in Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods was a war mongering bloody dictator who went after some small tribes that wanted to live their own way).\n+ Goblins do whatever goblins might do before you arrive, they don't just stand there idly. They have a tribal look and seem a little more sophisticated than those poor bare guys in Gothic 3. AND they carry cool names like ''Warrior of the bugeater tribe'.\n+ There's actually an epic story behind the whole thing with twists and drama.\n- To the end it doesn't develop that true Gothic atmosphere that made the previous games popular.\n- Voice acting is terribly overdramatized, doesn't sound like natural speech at all.\n- In the whole there's not much to explore, the world feels empty.\n\nA remark about Gothic: some ancient cultures belived that your spirit is immune to harm if your enemy didn't know your real name. The idea is used in both fantasy books and occult rituals. You have to know the name of the demon to summon him. Knowing the name bends the demon to your will. This allegory now comes to mind as I think of the former nameless hero, now Rhobar III who has been attacked by a demon. While he was nameless, he was mighty, but once he got a name, he became subject to harm. The game unconciously plays with this idea.\n\nThe verdict:\n\nTry the game. Never mind the old Gothic games, they had their flaws as well. Arcania had both good and bad sides.","October 3, 2014","true","18.6"," 83 of 124 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","83","124","4","0"

Because I had no basis of comparison from this series specifically, I dismissed those criticisms as associative and wanted to play the game on it's own merits.\n\nGraphically, this game is quite impressive for a title from it's time.  The bitmaps, many of the object models, and foliage and water all look impressive and would be comparable to a game from today.  Environmental sounds are also quite good.  Character models however are showing their age; all males and females share the same basic physique, and the character model used is pretty simplistic.  The player character looks like he's got a bird's nest growing on his scalp.  His hair is detailed but does not move; the hair spray in the Gothica universe must use super glue as it's base.\n\nThe writing and voice acting in this game are jarringly bad and repeatedly wreck the process of immersion.  For example, at the beginning of the game, you need to acquire a bangle so that you can propose to your girlfriend.  Despite just previously completing a quest that had me wipe out a camp of goblins (thus having gold from corpses and weapons to sell going into this quest), here I see my character rationalizing having to do a retrieval quest for the bangle because he 'has no gold', which was clearly and obviously incorrect.\n\nThe dialogue 'tree' in this game is flat-out nonsense.  You rarely have any actual options, and after a couple of hours, I stopped caring about what lore they may reveal and just wanted to move on to questing.  A couple of hours after that, I no longer wanted to play.\n\nDespite the fact that this game was also made for consoles, this version does not have a functioning inventory while using the controller.  I found this to be an unacceptable technical oversight when compiled with the other problems I had playing this game.\n\nI can't recommend a game that I have no desire to finish.  I don't know how this game compares to other games in the Gothica series, but I generally don't think this is even a good RPG.","June 22, 2015","false","4.4"," 42 of 55 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","42","55","4","0"

You also can't murder or kill anyone unless they are hostile combatants.  Don't get me started on the leveling system, it sucks and isn't anything like the Gothic games.

Dialogues are not booring anymore compared with previous Gothic parts. Combat system is much easier compared with previous parts. The thing I really dislike about this game is Open World. Like, you can't go anywhere without a premission, or if you don't have a right key or something else, you just can't walk around like you could back in 1/2/3, I would say that it's like auto balanced game - you complete the quest, you move to next area, where you will need to fight against your lvl creatures, then you complete this main quest again and you have a premission to next area, where you fight against your lvl creatures and so on. I don't really like that type of gameplay. Back in Gothic 1/2/3.. You just start the game and you can already die in first minutes, if you go somewhere random, because there was no such thing as this ''auto balance''. When I play this game, i feel like i'm playing a different RPG game, it's fun, but it's not Gothic anymore. I bought Arcania + Gothic pack (6games together) for just 5$,\nIf you ask me - Is this game worth 5$? then my answer is yes, you should give it a try.\nIf you ask me - Is this game worth 20$?

It's not worth more money than that.\n-Has a Demo you can download on Steam.  Try before you buy!\n\nCONS\n\n-Fast travel is terrible, and feels unfinished.  You get two portals to travel within each town, so you can fast travel within a town but you can't fast travel to a far away town.  You pretty much have to run from portal to portal.  Simply it's only half as good as the fast travel of Oblivion or Risen.\n-The ONLY way you can sprint is with the Runes or Potion to run fast.  Runes have cool down, and potion ingredients are limited.  A real pain when there isn't a great fast travel built into the game. You get a little bored with the slow traveling, and discouraged me from backtracking to find all the statues etc for the bonus items.\n-Dialog is really bad! Not the writing, but the mismatched inflections in the conversation.  Most of the time the hero comes off as a jerk.  It's like they recorded the actor saying one sentence then copied and pasted it into every conversation whether the tone matched the conversation or not.\n-The mission tracking on the map is only good half the time.  The other half you'll be googling to figure out where the heck your mission is located.\n-Graphics aren't great, espcially sky lines and shorelines.\n-Trader menu for crafting scrolls doesn't tell you whether you own it or not. Also you can't compare item stats you have equipped to items in trader menu.\n-Women are not painted in a very good light. After playing through Arcania then Fall of Setarrif right after, I was wondering if there were women haters who worked on this game... The women are painted as stuck up b*tches, or ♥♥♥♥♥s.\n-The PS3 version had Trophies, it would have been nice if it had Steam achievements.","December 14, 2013","true","36.5"," 45 of 75 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","45","75","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taerdin/recommended/39690/","taerdin","Taerdin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taerdin/","1226 products in account","This game lacks pretty much everything that makes Gothic 2 or even Risen (the real successor to the Gothic games) special.\n\nThe atmosphere in Gothic was always the highlight for me. That feeling of being new to a world full of different factions and people who all have their own schedules and agendas and belongings and character. Arcania only brings gated zones that you unlock as the story progresses and characters who are bland. Most of the people in this game don't even own or have ownership over anything, or say anything meaningful or at all when you try to talk to them.\n\nIn past games going into someone's house or stealing their belongings would get you in trouble. In this game citizens will go about their day as you pilfer their chests. Another thing that really struck me was that I was able to fight 3 wild animals in the middle of a crowded tavern and not a single character reacted in any way to what was happening. In Gothic 2 or Risen, the NPCs react to creatures, and will actually fight them. Sometimes they die and are dead permenantly! In Arcania I tried to fight a bandit who was blocking a region I needed to get into, and my attacks did nothing to him as he stood there oblivious to my efforts to kill him. It comes off feeling lifeless and empty compared to previous Gothic games.\n\nWhile passable as a RPG, this game does nothing to live up to the tacked on 'Gothic' name. For fans of the series this game holds practically nothing for you and I do not recommend. For newcomers you are better served playing Gothic 2 or Risen.","December 11, 2013","false","2.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nyx1/recommended/39690/","nyx1","Nyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nyx1/","85 products in account","Graphics:\n+ The graphics were decent for a game that was released in 2010. There are quite a lot of details on characters. The areas look pretty neat as well.\n\n- Many characters are clones and animations could be smoother here and there.\n\nSound:\n+ The music is good overall but really not as amazing as it was in past Gothic games. The voice acting in the English version is completely horrible and makes you cringe at times. Stream should allow players to decide themselves which sound packs to install. The german voice acting is much better.\n\n- The environment does not make too much sound. You would expect to hear animals and other things.\n\nBalance:\n+ You can clearly feel that your character is developing and there are 4 difficulties.\n\n- The 4 difficulties are meaningless. Having played the game on 'Gothic' which is supposed to be the hardest difficulty I have never felt like the game was hard. I have never died a lot except for the last boss which was the first time I started using pots and buffs. Funnily enough I only died 3 times on the last boss which isn't even a lot.\n\nAtmosphere:\n+ Many dialogues are neat if it wasn't for the horrible voice acting. You can feel part of the world. You keep meeting characters you met before and NPCs seem to be moving with you. You also meet old characters from past Gothic games which is a big plus for fans of the franchise.\n\n- The world is very stale and boring. There is nothing to explore except things that you are meant to explore. You can only quest in the area you are meant to quest. All areas are cut off and you can only progress once you do the required main quest. The atmosphere is long not as brilliant as in past Gothic games.\n\nUI:\n+ The UI is decent and I never had issues with controlling my character. You can put up to 10 items and spells on your bar which is more than enough. In addition you can bind the keys.\n\n- The character gets 'stuck' pretty often when he shouldn't be. Sometimes he gets stuck while simply running which forces you to jump occasionally.\n\nContent:\n+ The game is somewhat long. It took me 40 hours to finish but that's including doing extremely boring quests which forces you to run through the entire world to look for hidden artifacts.\n\n- Many areas have nothing special in them. Sometimes you run through a jungle area in which you do nothing at all except run. Why not put one quest where nearby orcs have stolen or killed a friend? Instead there are just random little camps with orcs which you clear and move on. A lot of potential was lost. There are also barely any side-quests at all.\n\nQuests:\n+ The questing is very bad in Arcania. There are nearly no side-quests. However the story starts off in an interesting way.\n\n- Most quests are only about either killing a few monsters or bringing the NPC a few items. The quest stories are also very boring and even when you can do it in more than 1 way it has no effect on the story or even the rewards.\n\nCharactersystem:\n+ The charactersystem is decent. Most of the abilities are useful and you can specialize in things.\n\n- However the system is very simple and boring. You barely have a choice in what to specialize in since there are so little abilities and you will learn all by the end.\n\nCombatsystem:\n+ The comatis fast and interactive. You have to dodge certain attacks which you cannot parry. Other attacks can be parried if you are fast enough.\n\n- The AI is horrible. Many monsters simply keep hitting you with special attacks which force you to dodge. They also hit so slow that it is no challenge to get away from them before they hit you. There are also only 3 spells in the game which make being a Mage pretty boring.\n\nItems:\n+ There are many items and you can craft a lot of items yourself.\n\n- The crafting is useless though. I played the entire game on the hardest difficulty and have never crafted a single pot. When the game was over my inventory was still filled with all kinds of materials. I only crafted around 3 items to wear. Many items were simply useless. You also get new armour very rarely when the game decides you should get a new armour.\n\nConclusion:\nI have played Gothic and Gothic 2 in the past and was highly interested in Arcania. Sadly I found out that Jowood and Piranha Bytes had an argument which is which Jowood removed them and took the rights to the game themselves. They paid another developer team to work on Gothic 4 which is why the game is completely horrible compared to the other Gothic games. I would even say that they ruined the Gothic story. Even though you meet old friends you don't actually seem to work with them that much. The game turned into a drag half-way and I just honestly wanted to finish it which is why I did not even obtain the best armour available. Worst of all is that they end the story abrubtly. The DLC of the game is required to really understand the story. They obviously cut the game off before release just to sell the DLC of the rest.\nI would only recommend this game to real hardcore RPG fans and fans of Gothic but not to anyone else.\n\nI have played this game on this sytem at maximum settings and very high FPS:\nGPU: ASUS HD 7970 Matrix Platinum\nCPU: Intel Core i5-4670\nRAM: Kingston HyperX Blu 16GB\nMotherboard: MSI Z87-G45\nSSD: Samsung SSD 830","April 13, 2014","true","47.4"," 31 of 50 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","31","50","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rofldanger/recommended/39690/","rofldanger","Hamdip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rofldanger/","186 products in account","TL;DR - This game is superbly gorgeous visually, but lacks vision and boils down to a very linear, and repetitive gameplay. The combat is just button mashing, and the story is boring. However, if you are a hardcore RPG fan, I recommend this game, as it still offers a new experience, and the world is fun to traverse. If you're looking for a Skyrim or Dragon Age experience, LOOK ELSEWHERE. This is an odd game.\n\nIn depth review -\n\nThis is game is... Interesting, to say the least. Now I can't necessarily say it's horrible, and I can't really say it's good, either. This game is a weird anomaly of a game, and has an interesting combination of good, and horrible, mechanics and features.\n\nTo be honest, I have never had the pleasure of playing any of the original Gothic series, so going into this game, I didn't have any knowledge prior of some sort of bar this game had to meet. However, going in, I did get that "Weird RPG feel." You know the one. The feel you get when you launch a game from the Risen series, or the first Witcher game. It just has a weird feel to it, and I can't explain it, unless you've experienced it.\n\nAnyways, let's start with the basics of the game, and what's not good or good about those. First off, I'd like to mention the first thing I disliked; the voice acting. Good lord. It's like something out of the Arma franchise. So much overacting, or there's complete lack of enthusiasm with these people. You'll go straight from a stereotypical, high-pitched, screetching witch, to a bored, complaining footsoldier who is in mid-combat. Appropriate. It's just very bad, and very... jarring. It takes you way out of the immersion, and that's not a word I like to use.\n\nNext on the list is the aesthetic appeal of the game, and to be honest, for a game that's 5 years old, it looks great. The colors are fantastic, the sceneries are incredible, and the lighting effects, down to some of the tiniest details is great. Just wait til you get to the point where you fight some flaming stone golems, and you'll see exactly what I mean. Adding to this point as well, there is a GREAT variety of environments. You have everything from starting with a sandy, lush beach island, to a volcanic cliffside, rain forests, and green moderate forests with plenty of rain, and lakes to enjoy. Adding to this again, the world is quite nice. It's not overwhelmingly huge, but they did a good job not making it too linear, even though it has more of that path system. The only thing I'll add that I didn't like about aesthetics were the character models. They weren't BAD persay, but they all tend to look VERY similar, which tends to be a problem with these larger RPGs, especially the older they are.\n\nThe next thing is the gameplay. Really, to be honest, there isn't any. It's trying to be The Witcher, or Dragon Age, with dialogue options and in depth combat, but what it boils down to is just click, click, and click some more. No need to dodge, or even look at what dialogue you're selecting. It all will do the same thing; you win. I have not had a problem ever with the difficulty. I HAVE been playing on normal, but I didn't die til about 6 hours in. Just keeping clicking that sword around, OR just run away. That's always an option, unless the quest specifically orders something to be killed.\n\nThe dialogue is just dumb, just look at what I said about voice acting.\n\nNow, here is where my BIGGEST problem is with this game; ♥♥♥♥ THE QUESTS. Oh my god. I have never seen a more roundabout way to keep a game's playtime up. Jesus, these people milked the ♥♥♥♥ out of these quests. Get ready to fight some goblins, because that 99.9% of your problems. Not your friends and wife-to-be being murdered, NO, your biggest problem will be goblins. Need to prove yourself to someone? Kill goblins. Need to return the kings standard? Goblins took it. Need to help an herbalist get his stuff back? Goblins took that ♥♥♥♥ too. Need to ANYTHING in a cave? GOBLINS ARE IN THAT ♥♥♥♥ING CAVE! And believe me, there are way too many quests that involve going into a cave with goblins. I would easily say that 70-80% take place in a cave. I'm not making that up. That's my honest guestimate. The other problem with the quests is this; they drag them the ♥♥♥♥ out so long. One of the quests you need to go find a king or something that was taken prisoner. Ok, easy enough right? Wrong. You go talk to the orc who's guarding the gate of the camp, hoping you can just kill, or run your way through. Wrong again, you have to talk to this guy. He wants some booze from a shaman who brews the stuff in a forest nearby. Ok, easy enough again, right? WRONG AGAIN. Guess what, this guy won't give you the booze (which is called skabooze, by the way, real imaginative, right?), until you find his nephew somewhere in the forest who ran off. EASY ENOUGH RIGHT?? ♥♥♥♥ING WRONG YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, BECAUSE GUESS WHAT? YOU NEED TO GO FIND THIS GUYS AMULET THAT ANOTHER SHAMAN TOOK! At this point you want to just kill everybody, and what doesn't help is that your character acknowledges along the way that all of this stuff is redundant, and stupid. He constantly gets impatient and makes sarcastic remarks about having to go do menial and boring stuff, and then later, he EXPECTS it. So the DEVs KNEW this ♥♥♥♥ was redundant and menial, but still willingly put it in the game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Anyways, the Shaman that took that other orcs amulet, that you need to get booze, that you need to get into a gate, that you need to get the prisoner? Guess what? After you fight him, YOU HAVE TO GO INTO A ♥♥♥♥ING CAVE THAT HE HID IT IN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FOREST, FILLED WITH ♥♥♥♥ING GOBLINS AGAIN!!!!! So all of that ♥♥♥♥, and guess what? YOU JUST KILL THE ORCS INSIDE ANYWAYS, SO WHY WASTE THE TIME GETTING THAT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HIS BOOZE TO BEGIN WITH?!?!\n\nWhatever. Beyond that, there's something about this that I can't explain that's rather appealing. The skill trees are ok. Combat works, even though it's just button mashing. The areas are rather gorgeous at times, and the music is just on par. The dialogue is complete crap, and story is uninspired, but at the same time, I get enjoyment from this game, and will probably end up playing the original Gothic games. Those are supposed to be the really good ones. So if this one works for me somewhow, I'm sure those will too.\n\nOverall, it's a 5/10 for me, but I still recommend it to the hardcore RPG fan. Give it a shot, you might enjoy it if you're into those weird RPGs. But remember, it ain't no Dragon Age, or Skyrim.","July 17, 2015","true","8.8"," 34 of 56 people (61%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","61","34","56","9","1"

It's true, I enjoyed 3 and I still recommend it, even if I had some mechanical problems with its expansion (For the record I NEVER had any problem with the base game and although it could've used more content, I had a lot of fun exploring it!).\n\nNow when Arcania (the de facto Gothic 4, under a new name for understandable reasons due to studio changes) was announced, the old guard of the former group were pessimistic and people like me were hopeful. I wanted a more polished game that offered the sort of open-world exploration, side quests laced through the main quest, secrets to find, factions to join or oppose and engaging choices that made the last games great, coupled with improved visuals and controls but especially more options and items and goodies in general.\n\nWhat I got was an unbelievably linear, limited game that seemed to strip everything that made 3 fun while keeping everything the old guard criticized about it. I couldn't even finish it. I was bored out of my skull before I could even save the capital, let alone figure out what the nonsensical plot was about.\n\nMaybe it's a little better if you aren't familiar with the previous games, but even then it's an unfortunate use of money to buy. You want to play Gothic, check out the previous three and leave this on the shelf. Fair warning though, I have trouble getting 1 and 2 to work on newer computers.","December 23, 2013","false","35.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The final boss was a cake walk, the end movie didn't involve my character or his fate at all, the magic sword I spent half the game questing to craft was replaced with in two hours (My crafted magic sword: 40 damage, no magic effects. The magic sword of the lieutenant bad guy boss: 36 damage 100% chance to slow on strike. Which would you take?).\n\nMy characters entire motivation was to kill one guy, who I killed, than I took his sword (the slowing one) and killed a whole bunch of other people, undead, demons etc. so I could save the king who employed the one guy to kill my love interest, everyone I ever knew and probably my dog.\n\nBest part of the entire game, and what kept me playing on through, long after I knew I could find something better to play: The voice acting for the main character. I could just hear the sarcasm in his voice every time some handed out a quest: "What? Another side quest? suuuuurrrrrre, why not". "Your not going to tell me what I need? Oh, you need me to do something for you first, how many orc ears is it this time?"\n\nIt was one of the prettiest games I've played, especially in 3D, but there was no substance to it and for the end game someone just shoveled on the suck.","March 24, 2014","false","30.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

YAY!  for graphics ill give it a 6 or 7 out of 10. GAMEPLAY AND STORYLINE: the storyline itself starts out good but it switches states of mind to quickly to seem realistic :/ but its a good way to pass 20+ hours. as far as gameplay its got alot of details in the items system so many MANY items to collect with no carryweight limit. so for gameplay and story line ill give this game a 7/10 because i like to explore all the little corners and the devs took the time to put stuff in said corners.","March 8","true","29.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","2"

It is hard to recommend this game to people simply because of all the things you have to look past in order to enjoy it. The voice acting is hit or miss (and when it's miss its a HUGE miss), some character models specifically female characters) look really weird and poorly made, and the first couple of hours are just a huge tutorial filled with horribly boring quests, like "kill the molerats invading my farm" and "Bring me some mead" and "collect some iron bolettes".\n\nThe strange tradition in RPGs to start the player out doing menial tasks for other people, like the quests referenced above, is super over-done and desperately needs to be retired for something more meaningful and fun in the beginning of a game. This is especially true when the trailer for said game shows a bunch of awesome monsters to fight but only after you go through hours of "go fetch me this" and "kill these rats!" quests. The Witcher 2 did this great by starting out with that badass castle siege pretty early on. Another RPG to have a great opening was Skyrim where once you got to the first village of Riverwood, you had the ability to begin a quest that sends you through a dungeon filled with bandits and draugr, AND ended with you seeing your first wordwall.\n\nThrough all the horribly played out beginning quests and the god-awful voice acting and modeling, I'd give Arcania maybe a 6/10 at best.","August 13, 2014","false","29.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

The combat is however tediously boring due to the somewhat buggy and dodgy tactics you need to 'cheat' yourself with to kill all the enemies in the exact same way.

The female interrest of the (start)game is both annoying and a useless plot device.\n\nAll the characters look "decent" as long as you don't look at them. once you get into a conversation with them their weird blob faces come to light and show how horrible the faces look, combined with the voice-acting it doesn't make any of the conversations you have with the NPC's a good experience and sucks you right out of the game, hence i skipped literally ALL the dialogue in the game.\n\nThe before skillpoint system from gothic 1+2+3 seemed to be not "of this time anymore" since they threw that idea out of the window for a new fresh... aged system that even an MMORPG would laugh at. the skill window is ugly, unfinished and rightdown insulting to the series. there are no special talents for hunting, no different fight styles like two-handed, sword/shield or dual wielding. just 2 bars, one for flurries and one for heavy attacks.\n\nThe active HUD also is VERY aged and doesn't stand up. it's big, gets in the way and is ugly and takes away immersion and focus.\n\nI obviously didn't play much of this game and i intend to keep it that way. 2-3 hours of this game have shown me enouth to know to stay away from this game. some may say that this game has a better story the longer you play it but i really doubt that.\n\nso it gets down to this: if you can look aside ALL the flaws of the game, you basicly have a stripped down singleplayer MMORPG with less depth and a combat system so dumbed down that they actually reached a new low. then this game is absolutely for you. If  however you're looking for an intriguing RPG that is immersive and stands out from the rest, look further because this is not that kind of game.","January 2, 2014","false","1.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Terrible story, awful narrative and devoid of any profound similarity or entertainment value had with the games developed by Piranha Bytes.\n\nTakes all the charm and rewarding qualities that made 'Gothic' unique and turns it into a casual hack-and-slash.\n\nThe best example of how they screwed this game up is... In the other games you get skill points which you use with skill trainers to teach you how to be and do what you want. With magic, especially, it's difficult to acquire because you have to get accepted into the mage's guild/monastery before you learn how to use magic. So you're taught to save your skill points until you can become a mage, if that's the way you want to go. Making becoming a mage an actual ACHIEVEMENT and something difficult to pull off. But it's the most powerful class in the game(s) because the fireball ends up being able to one-hit-kill. It's an incredibly rewarding feeling.\n\nIn this game? At level 4 you can use magic. No skill trainers. Just a character screen and you click the little plus sign.\n\nAnd magic is completely meaningless.\n\nWithout putting any points into any skills, you can be waving a massive sword around wiping out mobs like there's no tomorrow. Again, you originally needed to train to be able to use large weapons. Again, it was an achievement to get that.\n\nIt goes to show how some publishers (and new developers working with an old IP) don't comprehend what gave these games their dedicated fan-base","November 26, 2013","false","4.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

My times were 36 hrs  and 7 hrs. I think most folks could finish in under 30 for the main game and probably 5 to 7 for the Fall of Setarrif. Arcania ends in a cliffhanger, but the story comes to a true end in the Fall of Setarrif. I enjoyed the story and found the ending, and end battle pretty epic. I thought the end battle in Arcania was not very good, but at the end of Setarrif things heat up nicely. I was glad I came prepared although I would have leveled up my skills differently.\nThere were some graphic glitches and one really annoying game breaker after a boss battle about a third through Arcania. I had to go on the forums to get the solution to that issue. Also, you also see the same faces over and over. But there is also some beautiful scenery in the game. Really good for a game from 2010.\nI liked the hero of the game. He starts as a village playboy, but his character grows through the game. The leveling up is kind of simple, but I enjoyed seeing the effects of increasing my skills and gear.\nThe music is well done. A very good orchestra and choir were used. Added a great deal to the atmosphere of the game.\nSo I would recommend.

It tries hard to fix a lot of the issues the old games had. There are a lot of options to make questing more straightforward, distances between questgivers and questtargets are of reasonable length and there have been attempts to make the narrative work. First impressions while playing were actually really good, having just finished Gothic II (and not enjoying it) before playing ArcaniA the change of pace really felt good, appearances of the characters from older games and a seemless integration of this title into the Gothic-timeline were a nice touch too. Halfway into it, it had been a really nice if somewhat shallow experience.\n\nUnfortunately, after that point it suddenly becomes stale really quickly - I could not help but feel like they were running out of time/money in development during the final hours of the game, as the experience shifted from being fast and rewarding to tedious and slow, forcing backtracking and seemingly trying to hold the player back in order to lengthen the time you spend in the final areas of the game.\n\nIn the final hours of Arcania, it's major flaws become very obvious. Particularly dungeons are a definitive low-point, just endless caves or temple corridors filled with the same enemies over and over again. It's literally like Deja-Vu as you keep fighting through seemingly identical rooms again and again. Lacking enemy variety and a button-mashy combatsystem do not help the game and become a real problem in said dull dungeons. Loot and items are kinda broken, you find tons of trash loot and a few really good pieces but I ended up using one sword for the majority of the game because it was simply the best I could find. Same goes for armor, at certain points you get a complete set that is considerably better than the set you had before and that is pretty much it - sure, helmets and bracers as well as jewelry can be found, but they usually only raise your attributes and aren't all that interesting. I would have enjoyed a different approach here if they would only have went with the straightforward approach here as well - a few good items that maybe even have different properties and handle seriously different would have been much more appreciated by me than the tons of useless junk you collect along the way.\n\nThe roleplaying aspect is as lackluster as the rest, the "skilltree" is kind of a joke (they might as well auto-level and not let me spend points in a bunch of categories that unlock a handful of "skills" of which 50% are passives). The game just lacks a sense of meaningfulness and depth (even smithing and Alchemy can't help that), feeling like a weird mix of original Gothic ideas mashed together with influences from Witcher 2 but never accomplishing of nailing it.\n\nVisuals and music are great however, and ArcaniA might work as a gateway-game for people getting started on CRPGs as it is really easy, nearly bug-free (especially compared to older Gothic-titles) has a nice user interface with no clutter whatsoever and everything is kind of straightforward. You might appreciate this if you are a beginner but also people without a lot of time on their hands and/or patience could contemplate ArcaniA. Overall it is a decent but forgetable game, you are not really missing out on anything if you skip it - and that is why I won't recommend it.","January 16, 2014","false","14.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Yes there are some things you'll need to manually adjust in your configuration folder before you play but once you do you'll be running highest settings on any modern none gaming rig with no lag or any crashing. Honestly I havent experienced anything other than lag until I did my fix(Yay no lag XD).\n\nWho ever says they don't care for the graphics they are insane. The characters faces are my ONLY ISSUE so far. The environment is beautiful and feels real. Grass and trees sway in the wind the sun shines in bits through the trees casting fantastic shadows that overlap very well with alternate lighting and works great with other shadows. There's a day and night cycle/weather system and creatures that aren't blind and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so there's another plus.\n\nIt is it's own story so what it's not some fast paced over the top madness some may be use to (COD Players) but the pace allows me to craft forage and fight where im not being overwhelmed meaning I get to enjoy the game and feel like im in a real adventure. Seriously I really did think at several points that I'd get some cliche' nonsense missions that just turn to your character not even dignifying the quest by basically telling the npc to ♥♥♥♥ off lol (not in those words[I wish]).\n\nThe combat is like if twoworlds wasn't terrible and clunky and was refined instead of a rushed mess. (Twoworlds had a better spell system)\n\nI got this in a bundle awhile back and I'd say wait for a sale. I don't really see paying anything more than 10 for the game despite the joys I'm experiencing. I say this because I find there is a major combat flaw that maybe I'm just not noticing but the keyboard controls don't have a lock on button. The dodge works great until large monsters rush you so being able to strafe i combat would be nice. The Gamepad has it but you'd still have to use a keyboard and mouse for your hotkeys and inventory management more less defeating the purpose.\n\nso far a strong 7/10\nAMD A10 Quad-Core Laptop Integrated GPU","November 3, 2014","true","13.9"," 23 of 45 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","23","45","0","0"

The game has nice graphic,but the battle system is hideous. Namley the creeps are too easy to kill, their attack to easy to avoid, don't do much dmg and are overlay too dumb to fight against.\nNext of is the game itself. There are textures everywhere.EVRYWHERE! You will get stuck on imaginery objects, a small stone,wich is more a pebble than a stone, is blocking your movement. The fight animations,jump and moving of character in general is laughable.\nThe game is prety nice to play as a time killer since it has nice story to it. But the quest and the side quest dont even have no information at all! Example:  Collecting Beliar Artefact's. The quest says a quick story behind it and says collect them, with no info about whereabouts (is it the area where you picked it up,the same island you picked it up or the same fricking continent).\nThe only good about it is the roleplay system that allow you to use object such as cettles,waterbarells etc.\nFor me I can't even look at this game as a real Gothic sequel. The  Piranha Bytes who made G3 did almost perfect job on it, but when they joined with Spellbound that made ArcaniA the game lost all its glory.\nOverall the game isn't  worth 20€.

It's definitely playable, but what this game is not is a game in the Gothic series.\n\nIt is completely clear playing this that the makers never played the original 3 games by Piranha Bytes and did not care at all about the actual story.

I came to Arcania without expectations colored by the previous games.  I chose 'recommended' only because Arcania is not a terribly bad game.  It's a fairly mediocre RPG.  There are better games out there, no question.  But if you're in an RPG dry spell and you can get Arcania on sale, it's not a bad 40 or so hours.  It's also pretty stable, the only crash I had was after minimizing several times.\n\nThe graphics are fine for 2010.  The game lacks AA but the jaggies didn't really bother me here.  I did have problems with the horizon between the sky and sea blinking constantly, but I don't know if that's an original flaw in the game or it just isn't aging well with newer graphics cards and drivers.  For the most part the game looks pretty good.  The big exception is the human characters.  In dialogs the hair is frequently translucent and faces can look horrible.\n\nFor me, the strength of Arcania lies in its combat (melee at least, I didn't use bow and arrow much at all).  I chose to focus on melee and go sword & board.  The combat relies on flurries and power swings.  The flurry system is very similar to combat in The Witcher.  Combine that with dodge rolling to escape getting hit and you have a fairly engaging melee combat system.  I thought melee combat in Arcania was more engaging than in any Elder Scrolls game I've played  (even though, yes, every Elder Scroll game I've played is overall much, much better than Arcania).\n\nThe magic system is very simplistic - 3 types of magic (fire, frost, electric) with added features gained on leveling up the appropriate skill.  The magic system enhances the melee combat nicely: you can paralyze opponents with the electricity spell or slow them with the frost spell, before attacking them.  But it's nothing like the complexity in Two Worlds 2.\n\nCrafting is a bit of a let down.  It's all done in a menu, no need to be at a bench or specific location.  I found weapon and armor crafting to be almost useless (except for the one quest specific crafting of a weapon).  Alchemy and cooking was more robust with a decent selection of potions and recipes to buff/heal your character in various ways.\n\nThe story is fairly standard - an unknown man (you cannot play as a female) saves the world.  The story starts off as a revenge tale, which would have been just fine, but by the end it morphs into a save the world cliché.  The game is pretty straight forward.  There is the main quest and various side quests.  There are no factions to join or advance in like in Elder Scroll games or Two Worlds (1 and 2).  Arcania is not open world like Oblivion or Skyrim.  Various sections of the world open up as you advance the main quest, similar to Two Worlds 2 or The Witcher.\n\nI've played worse RPGs.  Arcania is stripped down and bare bones compared to something like Oblivion or The Witcher.  I had fun with it considering its limitations.  If I had to do it all over again, I would have waited to get Arcania on sale if I had a fantasy RPG itch that couldn't be scratched in any other way.  It definitely wasn't worth the $50 I paid back in 2010.  But given that I bought it, I don't think it was a total waste of my money.","September 20, 2014","true","60.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's Arcania. If you're expecting a Gothic game don't buy this game. It doesn't deserve the title of Gothic. This is more of an Action-Adventure rather than an RPG.

I love this Gothic 4. Furthermore, I would prefer more than 3 skills points in every level. I think five is enough. I hate one thing, that is in story line. I don't like that, the nameless hero doesn't know his old friends. I am talking about Diego, Gorn, Lester, Milten. They past 3 gothic games series together as best friends and all together played important role to the MAIN STORY OF THE 3 GAMES. Now they don't EVEN know each other. I was surprised that he didn't know them. Gamers of Gothic were waiting something like the big meet or something like "where you've been, we lost each other" or "what did you do in the meantime" and stuff. Not like this. For me, this is big mistake from the story creators. Gothic game fans will understand my critic.

Gameplay is over-simplified, with only three spells for a caster and a very simple melee system. You can craft, cook and brew anywhere without using a workbench - hell, workbenches are in the game but don't have any use, even if you turn on 'Roleplaying elements' in the options. There is no penalty for stealing stuff, you can't beat up friendly NPCs. Although you're playing in one big world, the pathing is painfully linear. You can't walk down edges (unless you jump), and exploring usually kills you - like when you touch the water surface of a lake you thought you could swim through. The new main character doesn't keep up with the previous nameless hero (how could he anyway?), the story is dull, quests are repetitive and most characters are unconvincing.\n\nMost. What made this game for me was really was the opportunity to meet old friends. Especially Diego and Gorn really shine in this game, and seeing Lester and Milten again also didn't hurt. Besides that, the game is stripped down and shifted way more from the hard old-school RPG to a casual Action RPG, which - if you let yourself in for it - has its benefits: the game is incredibly intuitive, you don't have to put a lot of time to learn the skill system or whatever, and combat feels wonderfully dynamic. The game also looks pretty nice.\n\nI started the game on difficulty 'Gothic' (of course...) which is the hardest one they give you. If you come from Gothic, do this! After about 3/4 of the game I put it down to 'Hard' and then 'Normal' because it started to get difficult and enemies had riddiculously high HP, making combats last forever. This made the late game kinda chewy. It took me ~21 hours to finish the game, which isn't incredibly long for an RPG, but some hours less wouldn't have hurt.\n\nI'll give it a 6.5 / 10, mostly for 'nostalgic value', nice graphics and overall a very polished and smooth experience. If (and only if) you are into the series, it's worth playing!","June 20, 2014","true","21.4"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zweistein_Jimmy/recommended/39690/","zweistein_Jimmy","monster elf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zweistein_Jimmy/","226 products in account","How would you like to see a combination between Fable [old school first game] and Elder Scrolls?\nGothic 4 - Arcania is pretty much the thin line that unites these 2 ideas.\nI gotta say I have never had experienced the whole franchise before, only tried a bit of Gothic 3 after a friend told me about it [and wasn't bad at all].\nGame was out around Oct 2010, which kinda made me expect a tinny bit better optimization regarding a few details than it had..\n\n\n\n[Story]\nThe story is intriguing at start and in the end. Buuut after having played a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of games in my age, can't say I had my eyes popped. But it was cute.\nA few side quests reveal a few more details to you and some fun points regarding what's going on.\nI don't know if it is connected with the previous games but it stands alone not leaving me with major questions... Well.. except the final seconds of the cinematic at the end of the game, wasn't sure what I saw and what it meant. [*cough* probably leaving space for a sequel *cough*]\nIn average it's a cool story to be told, there's much drama script-wise which adds to the suspense but you can say that most of it gets pretty much expected after a point.\nIt's balanced, not too original.\nAlso RPG-wise it's ok, though they could add a few elements regarding romance or key characters to connect more with your character and not have just one super hero that kills and burns and stabs and slashes through everything just to see what's going on afterwards. I mean this isn't the 00s any more guys come on..\n\n[Gameplay]\nThe gameplay is pretty linear but seeing it from an open minded point of view it didn't matter.\nAnd I mean linear because you are indeed in an open world [and a pretty nice one actually] environment, but you cannot go everywhere you want unless you unlock the area through your main quests. Unfortunatelly you cannot climb mountains and you drawn the moment you step into water [facepalming a bit] so when you reach a bridge or a gate, you cannot pass it unless you get the key or some official letter to show to the guard in order to go pass it.\nLot's of quests to do, many RPG elements like tons of items, a crafting system, gathering materials from herbs, teeth and meat from animals to ores from mines.\nLeveling system with a not too complicated [and actually maybe too simple] skills tree.\n3 basic classes to go through, warrior, ranger, mage. Some nice animations to attack, block, evade etc.\nNot really bad but then again too easily to be repetitive as hell and make you a bit bored after a long while.\nFew bugs to notice, though my weak CPU cannot go without noticing some silly moments like snaps from frames that show my character in a model position [open arms and legs frozen half gear on] due to loading, or stupid unnnatural dialogue moments due to the way the data is loading..\n\n[Graphics]\nThey are good for a 2010 game. Sweet open world filled with nature, forests, caves, dungeons, lakes, swamps, mountains etc..\nPeople are nicely designed, though not really pretty faces. Maybe it's ok for being realistic, but sometimes I felt like I'd kill to see a pretty woman's face in there.\nArmor and weapons are detailed and sweetly done, you can also have various effects with a few magical items.\nVery nice weather system, animated nature depending how strong the winds are, rain with realistic sound and thunders and water that you can actually see the water dynamics even on your own armor [something not many games had achieved at that time].\nAlso has a night and day cycle, pretty neat when you see people going to sleep, then waking up to do their work or keep their shop.\n\n[Music]\nVery nice music. Pretty well done and balanced. Suits every moment in the game. I was surprised that I felt like going through some sort of Elder Scrolls game here and then.\n\n[Sound]\nI have to mention that sound is realistic. Not just due to good environmental effects, but for a 2010 game noticing a realistic difference of noice and sounds betwee being out in the wild and in a town, or between being ouside or inside a house is something worth appreciating.\n\n[Characters]\nI was not really satisfied by the characters in the game.\nI mean, they are all done very nicely, designed and animated well. But there's just that one thing, that one element missing that never helped me to connect with any of them.\nI never cared about whether my character was a nice guy or a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I never got sad over a few dramatic events that occurred during the game.\nI wasn't even noticing the change of character and his evolution during the story until some points were made by the NPCs at some times.\nThis was a bit disappointing for me because connecting with my main character in a game is a major and very important thing when I play a game.\nI cannot give you examples cause I don't wanna spoil anyone, but from time to time there had been a few major events happening that really left me standing with apathy in from of my screen wishing the dialogues were a bit shorter or even skipping them so that I could go on.\n\n[Cast]\nThe voices are ok. Seen worse. Seen better.\nMeeeeh. For a 2010 RPG open world mechanism they were ok.\n\n[Others details]\nThe game had tons of exploring to do. If you are the explorer type you would enjoy going around gathering materials or collectibles.\nFun fact; nothing is randomly generated. Every flower you gather, every monster you kill, they are all unique and will never respawn again. That was quite realistic for me and loved the idea.\nAlso there were a few elements that reminded me of Fable. Starting of from a humble young man from a village, growing into a uber powerful super hero of muscle and awesomeness badassery and heavy metal while holding flaming swords and magic shields ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ass through the plot. \m/\n[at some points you can see people acknowledging as a hero figure and their reactions are fun to hear]\nTons of RPG elements, but not quite developed. I mean they put so much efford in everything, they could at least add a few more ideas about spells or increase the max level cap and let you try other classes since there's no free roam mode after finishing the game.\nAnother thing; You all know me. I LOVE ROMACE in my stories. And this game had nothing at all except a small flirty idea at the intro of the game. I was like, come on is there anything to help me connect with this guy? Even the action sequence was completelly stable; explore, kill, talk to NPC, do quest, explore, kill, talk to NPC, do quest, explore....\nOne thing I liked, since everything in the game is not unlimited or randomly spawned, being an explorer is rewarding in many aspects. For example sometimes i would first completelly explore the whole new area I unlocked and if i was done I would talk to the NPCs. That way I already had the quest items they wanted and I would farm exp instantly.\nEasy to get some extra skill points and make you happy for a while? Yes.\nDoes it make sense to already be able to distinguish a quest item from the rest of the world without having taken the quest thus making the item as useful to you as a random rock on the ground? No.\nBut i ain't even mad ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n\n\n[Average]\nThe game is pretty good.\nIt's hard to see through many points because there are imperfections to notice but let's not forget that the game is old.\nIf you are a hard core RPG fan do try it out. It's sweet and give food for thought regarding game elements and tastes.\nIf you are a person with high expectations and wants kickass high end video games. Do not buy.\nThe game is ok. A bit above average. I'd say around 7/10.\n\n\n\ncheers","January 3, 2014","true","29.3"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","5"

Though the cinematics were moionless cartoon images after a certain point, the story was nonetheless acceptable and I did play through the whole game.\n\nHaving said that, the story was pretty straight forward and no surprises or twists along the way. All in all, the story could have been more intriguing. I'd say it would get a 5 out of 10 overall for the story line.\n\nAs for the gameplay, I felt it was lacking compared to other RPG games that were released during and even prior to Arcania's release with respect to NPC interactions (or lack thereof), non-combatant NPCs and absolute lack of assistance from NPCs (with respect to reality of their responses; imagine a swampshark popping out of the ground and an NPC just standing there like nothing happened...), conversation/dialogue options with the NPCs that you can communicate with (lacking) and lack of directions at certain points in the game. Let's not forget the almost total uselessness of sneaking.\n\nAs for what was better, graphics were good (nothing that will blow you out of the water but totally a new level (more like 10) above that of Gothic 3), bugs were much much fewer than any of the previous Gothic games too, which was a nice change... :) I enjoyed crafting, though it could have been much improved (but wasn't, even in the add-on).\n\nIn summary, this game is not for everyone. For those interested to see how the change in devs changed the views on the events after Gothic 3, OK game. Grab it during a sale. As for those that wanted to see the events as they should have been had the original devs continued working with this publisher; total let down and poor game that is not worth buying even duting a sale.","April 7, 2014","true","53.8"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

You cannot go somewhere unless you get permission or the key (with a next quest, of course).\nWorth to try, in my opinion.\n","November 12, 2015","true","21.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Arcania 4, like the past titles in the series does not cater exclusively to the speed smasher of buttons, but does offer a bit of storyline, great graphics (remember, it's not a new title), enough action to keep the player awake and on edge and there's plenty of small details that push the game up the scale to an overall 7.8, in my humble opinion. Graphics are slightly dated as is the copyright so I don't slam the title for graphics that don't meet the standards set by Skyrim! Graphics 8 / Action is plentiful and combat is adjustable in the settings menu so you can adapt it to your personal style of melee combat. Our hero is seen from a 3rd person POV, a slight downer. Action 8.5 / Storyline is simple and straight forward, boy loves girl, girl's father dislikes boy, boy must complete 3 quests to win his approval. Along the way he finds others in need and helps them out, which generally means killing monsters and bad guys like it's a Olympic game and he wants nothing but gold!  Weapons, armor, and bottles of potions are found in chests and these are accessed easy enough by pressing the "E" key, there are no locks, or at least, I have yet to encounter one. Storyline 7 /  Presentation is done with a somewhat humorous approach, though mostly dark humor is used. I only played for 3 hours, but I want to play a lot more, and I will, once I get some sleep! Being retired has advantages, but there are dangerous facets to it as well. I stay up at times for 36 hours, 24-29 of those spent in Skyrim, or in a pitched combat situation whilst playing Battlefield 4 on the PS4, and there are times when I simply randomly select one of the 40+ games I have on Steam and reintroduce myself to it. It's all good, but there's no time for other things, like playing excellent titles such as Aracnia 4 on my laptop. Overall game 7.8 but I always bear in mind the date it was first introduced and the number of serious upgrades from then to now, which shows how the industry really feels about us gamers, the ones who buy their titles without too much price ♥♥♥♥♥ing, and play them until we're blind.

It had very limited character choices, a small, incredibly linear map, and of course the combat felt like you were going to break your left mouse button. I'm not even gonna talk about the one sided characters, limited body models were every second character looked the same and the lack of sidequests. Now that's out of the way I can tell you why I enjoyed it. The first part of making this game enjoyable is by not looking at it as a Gothic game, since many claimed it ruined the franchise I just pretended that it's not a part of it. Secondly, I enjoyed the story, which was short but decent, and I liked the world's look, very polished looking. It might suffer from the dissapointment factor but once you get past it I'm sure that if you find all the good parts you can learn to like it.","May 21, 2014","true","75.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Storyline was longer than i thought it would be and just as you think you're getting towards the end, something pops up and you got another 3 - 4 hours worth of game time. One thing that never got old, was the amount of characters in the game, way over 100 different characters that you interact with, but there are only a handful of character models, so you'll come across 10 people that all have the same facial characteristics, which i thought was very amusing! Besides the obvious tabboo inbreeding going though-out the game, there isn't really that much to complain about. Me personally, i had a bit of trouble with the FPS, and it seems the game has a 40 - 50 FPS cap, but a few times it will drop to 10 or less and was fixed after a re-start. Seems all Arcania games have this problem, and they haven't released a patch and probably never will now.

It was good to see again the old faces. This game however is fundamentally different then it's predecessors, so you have to set your expectations right. The story is rather interesting, but very linear. It does not have the same feeling of exploration as the previous ones, rather, feels like a dungeon crawl, where you clear an area, and move on to the next.\n\nThere is one great downside of the game though, and that's stability. I've played it on Windows 8, and after fiddling with the compatibility, and setting the sound quality on the system to 24 bit 48k sampling (both are recommended and helps a bit), it was mostly playable, but still frequently crashed. I recommend saving often.\n\nI still think it's a decent game, worth trying if you liked the previous ones, but does not have much replay value.","May 20, 2015","true","24.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I would give it 5.5/10 overall.\n\nThe game itself has surprisingly better graphics than what I thought they would be however there were some poor texture loadins and some odd texture spots floating around occasionally.\n\nThe main quest was very linear and besides some minor sidequests, you basically went in a line as you never revisited any other previous locations. The main quest itself got very disracted as at first, you're fighting for revenge (I am trying to avoid spoilers here!), and then you get distracted with trying to stop the paladins, and then you get distracted with trying to help the king, and then you get distracted by trying to save the city, etc. It felt like the quest was all over the place and when you finally accomplished one of the things, it was less than satisfactory. The sidequests themselves were mildly interesting. They actually rewarded pretty good loot and made them worth while.\n\nIt's listed as an RPG but the game isn't really one to be honest. Sure you can sort of focus on using swords or spells, but there are so few skills to upgrade, you end up getting all of them and it doesn't really matter what you're focusing on. The crafting system felt tacked onto the game as it doesn't really serve much of a purpose. I literally only used the health potions even though I could have made 30+ other potions. I also could have crafted some other weapons and armor but by the time I got the material required for them, I already had better weapons and armor than the thing I was trying to craft.\n\nSome minor things I disliked about the game was that it seemed like there were only a few voice actors and there were only a few NPC models. There was basically no variation when meeting NPCs. Also it was annoying that I couldn't tell if I got hit by enemies. They would make a quick movement and I looked down at my health and saw they had somehow hit me.\n\nThe game itself was incredibly easy but I only played it on normal. After that, it can go up to hard and then gothic. I felt very overpowered and didn't really have to pay attention to my HP. I just pressed the attack button and rarely tried to dodge.\n\nSome positive things about the game is that the bow mechanic was really cool. I also liked the overall lighting ambient in the game.  My favorite thing about the game however was probably that I was able to easily find better and better loot, from doing sidequests to doing the main quest. Normally games have a bunch of bad loot that you can get but this was a nice change.\n\nAs I said, overall 5.5/10.\n\n","June 20, 2014","true","19.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

And yes, you can touch many objects and get some nice animations but there is no effect. E.G. using an anvil won't sharpen your blade :) The quests are linear and the ending is a bit disturbing.

Collecting the artifacts you didn't pick first time feels like a good idea. You have to jump down a ledge that you can't climb back up. You think it's OK but the path ahead is actually blocked. You're stuck between a gate ahead (which closed without most people probably knowing) and the ledge behind. All you can do is load an old save to get out of it. Long story but you'll know it if you get there.\n\nThe ending. The last part of the game is in a massive area, and it's a maze of streets and areas. Too big, too confusing.\n\nThe very ending. It left me suprised because there was no acknowledgement of what you did.\n\n\nOtherwise it would be a great game. Combat is brilliant, the graphics are awesome, and the story otherwise is good..(Apart from sometimes feeling they littered it with enemies just to fill it up.)\n\nWhat a shame they left it with issues-bugs.","September 1, 2014","true","47.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Arcania starts up a little slow, though, there are quite a bit of fetch quests even in the main storyline which postponed the immersion a little for me.\nThe story is linear and while the map is pretty large, you're always guided in the right direction. If you're a looter like me, the sub quests - the figurines and artefacts hidden in the world´- are worth pursuing since the rewards are quite nice and interesting.\nThe game ends a little abrupt, though. I'm used to being able to walk around the world in rpgs after end-of-game but not in Arcania, which makes the ending feel a little lacking. So if you do decide to play, I recommend getting the Arcania: Fall of Setarrif, which is an addon that remedies this a little. You still won't be able to roam the world but the ending feels more polished.","November 19, 2015","true","41.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is NOT Gothic!\n\nThis game feels more like 'Fable' and much more like a MMORPG (if you're thinking that's a good thing, you are wrong), even the story quests feel like pointless grinds.\nI'm not very far along in the story but I think I've already lost all interest. Very different feel and a very different character from the original Gothic series. FAR LESS compelling.\n\nIf you are a fan of GOTHIC (III, especially), then you will probably enjoy 'Risen' much more (I did) which is very similar and LOTS OF FUN. 'Risen' even has great cheats and a sequel (which I haven't played yet).\n\nPossibly the WORST thing about this game is the lousy CHEAT configuration.You can edit a file easily enough to enable an, in-game, developer "cheat" menu BUT there is no god-mode and, EVEN WORSE, after you go through the trouble of maxing out your character's levels, points and stats - you die way too easily and way too quickly!!!\n\nMeh, this game sucks.","March 4","false","7.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This meant when I started a new chapter I could not remember what I was working toward and sometimes I confused the main story quests with side quests.  Furthermore, the ending felt unsatisfactory and when Fall of Setariff came out, I finally understood they had released the game without finishing the story.\nThe game is described as RPG, but good luck finding any opportunities to rp.  The game is very linear in that once you've cleared an area you have no reason to return.  Any companion or main story npcs have flat personalities and their main function is to act as quest givers and info dumps.  The greatest decision I made in game was deciding between a two or one handed weapon.\nIn the end, the most memorable part of the game is what a disappointment it is.

So okay, I continue. Tutorial plays just fine, but the game is too loud. So I press escape and go into options, but whatever the I do I cannot switch from the gameplay options to video, audio, or any other option. Then, I notice that even in the gameplay options I cant do anything. Not with the mouse, not with the keys, I can only exit the options menu. So I get over it and play the tutorial further, finish it, and then the game starts, some girl comes over talks to me, I skip the entire dialogue using the escape key. Then an informations shows up that I should view my quests by pressing ,,L''. And at that point all hope is lot. I tried pressing L. I tried Escape, i tried clicking the OK button at the bottom with my mouse.

The devs did not message me back and I doubt they will so I will explain my problem to you guys and hope that somebody out there can help\n\nSo what happens is, I launch the game, play the tutorial and, and it hits me there's no interface, no life etc. I thought it was a tutorial thing. So okay, I continue. Tutorial plays just fine, but the game is too loud. So I press escape and go into options, but whatever the I do I cannot switch from the gameplay options to video, audio, or any other option. Then, I notice that even in the gameplay options I cant do anything. Not with the mouse, not with the keys, I can only exit the options menu. So I get over it and play the tutorial further, finish it, and then the game starts, some girl comes over talks to me, I skip the entire dialogue using the escape key. Then an informations shows up that I should view my quests by pressing ,,L''. And at that point all hope is lot. I tried pressing L. I tried Escape, i tried clicking the OK button at the bottom with my mouse.

It has been stripped and dumbed down from other gothic titles to appeal to a lighter crowd. What you have here is a streamlined story with minimal side quests, terrible voices, repetative character models and mediocre combat.  Most enemies have timed power attacks easily avoided with a roll and almost everyone can be killed by backing up while firing arrows.  The graphics are better than older gothic games of course but arent anything special.  The amount of armour and weapons is extremely limited with a pathetic crafting system.\n\nOn a plus note the game is easy to play if your not familiar with or are intimidated by advanced rpg games.  The games npc's occasionally offer a bit of adult humour if your patient enough to listen to there awful voices.\n\n5/10","October 2, 2014","true","20.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

No. More polished ? Yes. Gothic 3 was a bug- and crashfest, but it did deliver one thing. Fun. With a capital F. It had an open world, quests that you mostly had to find and solve yourself (no handholding) and challenging, but rewarding combat. Gothic 4 is linear (sure, you have open areas, but they're all connected to eachother instead of one gigant world), solutions to quests are shown on the map and the combat is easier (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). I did have fun with it (see; no capital f), but it just isn't Gothic. It doesn't have the same feeling.

The pacing was pretty good, you never see any huge jumps in enemy dificulty. And it is a very pretty game. If you can pick it up on sale for around 5 or 10 bucks, its definitely worth your time. Any higher than that, you'll probably feel like you aren't getting enough for your money.","March 25, 2014","true","17.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I got the whole Gothic series in a bundle on sale so I didn't pay anywhere near 20 USD for it, definitely not worth that much in my opinion. But worth something.\n\nOk RPG. (revised from AMAZING) I would recommend it because I had fun until I read people were hating on it then other people's opinions kind of changed my own. after reading the reviews i realized the game was very linear but before anyone told me it felt a lot like The Witcher 2. Still with that said I have never read reviews for The Witcher 2 but i seriously doubt people bash it as much as this game. Its not bad but it's no Elder Scrolls either. I have all the gothic games but haven't really played any other than this one simply because I buy way too many games and never have enough time to play them all before I have something new to play. So I'm not 'disappointed' by the deviation from the RPG elements of the earlier games. From my stand point I'm looking at it as a stand alone RPG not the 4th in a series.\n\nThe games graphics are amazing if your computer can handle running them at full blast, but some how the tone of the over-all game seems to be very empty. Partly due to the fact that the only fast travel is restricted to 2-way teleporting pads separated by long, LONG walks between areas.\n\nThe game doesn't really have any exploration value though so backtracking to old areas is almost nill. once you've completed an areas quest and unlocked the next area you will have little to no reason to return.\n\nThe game play mechanics were great at first, but that's bearing in mind that I have only played shooters on the PC and this was the first real RPG that I played. they are simple and fun enough, but annoying later on when you just dodge and hack enemies up over and over.\n\nLoot, there's not much to speak of. more than anything you'll be carrying a bunch of junk around with you most of the time waiting to sell it. The magic they tried to incorporate into the game seems unfinished to me, mostly useless. Except one that makes you run faster for a short duration which is nice but annoying at the same time for having to walk such arduous distances in the first place.","April 2, 2014","true","6.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The world is technically open, but there is never a reason to backtrack.  This design is not bad, however, as the developers make each step compelling enough with beautifully detailed locales and creatures to keep your interest.  If a fan of previous Gothics, understand that the structure is significantly different.  There are only a couple of decision points and there isn't a faction system to limit your abilities.  Abilities are also acquired via a skill tree rather than being trained and purchased from masters.

Total garbage, it is supposed to have partial controller support, but many menus in the game require the mouse and keyboard so basically to play it you need, a keyboard, a mouse, and a controller.  Not only that it seems the devs ignored the triggers like they dont exist because the triggers and bumpers dont work in the game at all.  That is alot of equipment for one game to be juggling back and forth and makes for a terrible gaming experience.

That's a nice action RPG, rather friendly to the player: it's easy to learn, intuitive enough, and it takes quite a lot of effort to die here - at least, as far as the beginning of it is concerned. I've played 12 hours so far, and I died only twice (more out of curiosity, in fact, than because of real failure).\n\nI like games with strong lengthy storylines, and that's one of such cases. You can take a variety of side quests as well, but you always feel that it's just a pleasant addition for you to entertain yourself while doing the main quest, the Gothic Story. I have also appreciated the scrupulous approach to environment modelling that my favourite TES games lack sometimes: for example, when it's raining, the ground becomes wet, and people around you start to seek shelter.\n\nWhat I really disliked was the fact that all NPCs have the same faces. Well, not all of them, but approximately 80-90% of people I met do. It seems that the developers have designed two or, maybe, three faces and decided that it's enough. In addition, women's faces are either unpleasant or plain ugly, and it really strikes you when someone supposed to be a nice young lady has a face of mature woman in her late fourties.","October 2, 2013","true","25.4"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

It was supposed to be on paar with Skyrim, so they said... This game hurts to play, that's how bad it is.\n\nMy opinion: Save your money, get Two Worlds 2, an underappreciated RPG which has smooth gameplay and very few bugs, if any; You can get Two Worlds 2 Epic Edition and Expansion on a bundle site for a few dollars and you'll have a lot more fun than you would with this game.\n\nThe gameplay is stale, there are bugs that hinder gameplay such as: When trying to walk down a hill ( mind you, there is a dirt trail so you're supposed to be able to walk there ) it feels like you're walking down steps with invisible walls blocking you, breaking, allowing you to take a step, block you, repeat... You litereally don't walk down the hill, you walk straight as though the ground is level, get forced to stop, drop a foot, then you're allowed to repeat this drama all over again until you finally make it down the hill...\n\nI was suckered in to pre-purchasing this game, a mistake I'll never make again with Nordic Games or Spellbound Studios. It was so riddled with bugs I tried getting a refund from Steam; had I waited until release and still bought it, I would've charged the amount back because this game isn't completed, it isn't playable and I'm not going to waste what little time I have left on this rock playing it; I'd rather wait until my dirt-nap than play this if this were the only game in my library.","January 31, 2015","false","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It was a buggy mess at first, however it evetually became polished by the community patches. I still think gothic 3 is a more ambitious game than risen 1, 2, and 3. Which had better 'metacritic' scores. They where more complete games, they just lacked scope. Gothic 3, had incredible scope.\n\n\nGothic 4, basically a corridor shooter. It's not even the same kind of game as the aforementioned titles,  exploration has been stripped in favor of simple objectives and linear 'areas' with nothing to do. Quests, exp, items, all reduced to the most basic thing you can imagine. The open world, gone.\n\nThis was one of my biggest rpg dissapointments until sacred 3 came along recently. Which game is worse? Sacred 3. But that's not saying much for this game. Play this is you hate open world rpg's with a passion.

Also there's far too many invisible walls, partly in completely unnecessary places.\nI especially liked that the game spawns you right next to the ocean with a tiny invisible wall 'guarding' it because they were too lazy to implement a swimming feature or water physics, because when you jump over the wall your character just dies for no reason whatsoever and just slips around in the water like it's not there.\n\nI also couldn't stand the storyline in the very beginning.

Have you ever bought a game that was extremely cheap but still make you regret paying 1-2 dollars? You've got the chance here.\n\nTo be honest, I was wondering if I should write a review of this game for you, gamers. I was wondering if I want to for two reasons: the game is really bad, no one will ever buy this game. But I assume I might be able to save someone right here, so here we go!\n\nFirstly, I got this game in a bundle (I guess) and I let it stay in my library for a long time, as first time I ran the game it was literally unplayable (performance reasons), my pc is not the best, but still I hoped they would fix some performance issues so I could really test this game. It's playable now. Performance-wise at least?\n\nTalking about performance, this game should be more of a benchmark than a game as even strong PC may not run it well. It's also got non-existent multicore detection, so not only lowering the details might be necessary, but also tweaking config files (and it's really quirky - I've heard it made some people return the game back to a store).\n\nLet's talk about the gameplay itself. You begin with a poorly designed interactive intro (basically the game, but without hp bar and with some other character - not to spoil). Then you will need to do some casual questing - complete a few, simple tutorial quests, not so lengthy, you virtually can't die, very casual. They are mostly badly designed and don't make sense, but it's just a tutorial. As the storyline continues: you're thrown into the deep waters (just a figure of speech) and some very NOT surprising stuff happens right off the bat. If you've ever played Fable: The Lost Chapters you will even see how similiar the beginning is, just... worse. This's less of a "life is a ♥♥♥♥♥ and then you die" kind of game than other games of the franchise.\n\nGame is mostly about fighting with sword, spells and such, and this part is so badly designed it will make your eyes bleed. The camera work is terrible - it takes the player away from the action. The fighting and combo system are very unreliable and not satisfactionary at all. Enemies kinda seem to have high hp, but they are easily (mostly) perma-stunned, don't offer much of a challenge, and rarely you will have any trouble taking out the enemies. Also the roll is so OP in this game, it's not even funny.\n\nWell, what about the audio? Many voice actors seem to be from different countries and they don't really speak English well. Some characters even have some wicked manners of speech, cringeworthy really. The dialogues are pretty boring really, there's nothing exciting or funny about the personas. You won't ever quote this game, that's for sure.\n\nFor the aesthetic values of the game, just to complete this rant: it's bad, really bad. Strangely acting shadows, models with less polygons Gothic 3 used to have, some weird textures at times, also poor facial expressions and this strange "mist" or "fog", it's just really bad.\n\nI can't find anything positive about this game, really. I'm trying, but I can't. If you like badly designed action RPG games, needing a lot of tweaking, patching, patience even, then be on your way, play this ♥♥♥♥. I don't think this game can even be salvaged by community mods (and I doubt someone would go through all the pain). If you really want this game because you like Gothic, try Risen or Risen 2. If you just want a rpg-like TPP game, you can go with Fable, Fable 3, Kingdoms of Amalur even, Gothic I, II, III, Risen, Risen 2 and a bunch of other games.

It appears that this game is sadly incompatable with my computer;  Windows 7 (64-Bit) with 8GB of DDR-3, an AMD FX-8320 (8-Core) processor, and an NVidia based graphics card.  So how did I get 5 minutes of game play?\n\nWell, first I tried to start the game and had an immediate crash, before the screen even popped up.  Tried compatability mode for XP (SP3) and got a black window, followed by a crash.  Added administrator privlidges, crash.  Installed the supplyed PhysX software, already had a newer version.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/W1ntur/recommended/39690/","W1ntur","W1ntur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/W1ntur/","403 products in account","After approximately 10 hours of gameplay, I got the distinct impression that very little (if any) balancing or play testing went into this game.  I did finish this game before reviewing it, to give a complete impression.  I have never played the original Gothic games, so my I have no input on how close it is to the originals.\n\nI will start with what I felt was wrong.  One, because if your reading this review, that is likely all you care about.  Two, because I believe on closing on a good note.\n\nCons:\n1. The run speed!  Oh my god it is way too slow, and they made the horrible decision of throttling the speed even more when inside.  This made completing the game feel like a Sisyphean task.\n2. Invisible walls and impassible gentle slopes.  It is a major pet peeve to have apparently impassible terrain made impassible.\n3. Skill tree balancing.  It is not.  Melee is the best, and that’s good because that is what you will mostly find upgrades for.  Archery can be good, but upgrades are sparse.  Magic is a joke.  Even at max level magic is mostly just a support for melee. The skills feel like they are less balanced against each other, and more like they should all compliment each other at max level.  This is technically impossible without cheats however.\n4. Inconsistent hit boxes.  This may even be worse than the run speed.  Having a skill that increases damage for head shots on archery, and then only giving some creatures miniscule hit boxes with no head consideration.  The giant lizards are the greatest culprit of this.  It is so difficult to "hit" them with the bow at all, I usually just switched to untrained melee.\n5. The voice acting.  The script writing and voice acting for this was bad to the point of being silly.\n6. Creepy animations and Graphical errors.  Diego's smile is unnaturally wide.  When in high settings the textures will turn black. When characters talk seeing a black void, and strangely glowing/lit teeth.\n7. Inattention to details in a game with collectables that require attention to detail.  A tip too amateur designers, if you aren't going to put the effort to make your walls meet so the sky box won't be seen behind them, then do not include quests for collectibles that will have players looking in every nook and cranny.  This only makes the lack of polish stick out more.\n\nPros:\n1. Putting the voice acting/script writing aside, the overall story was enjoyable.\n2. Role play features that can be disabled.  This feature is diminished by it being a single player game.  It allows for interaction with objects of no game importance, but can be interesting for RP.  Looms, forges, and alchemy benches to name a few.\n3. The method for alerting the player of intractable/lootable objects.  This system is the least immersion breaking system I have yet seen.  When a world object is intractable it will have flies flying around it or sparkle, they only doe a highlighting glow when the player is able to pick interact (which is unavoidable to a point).  When a corpse can still be looted it will radiate the appearance of a stinky miasma and have tiny flies buzzing around.\n","August 27, 2014","false","34.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Have you ever bought a game that was extremely cheap but still make you regret paying 1-2 dollars? You've got the chance here.\n\nTo be honest, I was wondering if I should write a review of this game for you, gamers. I was wondering if I want to for two reasons: the game is really bad, no one will ever buy this game. But I assume I might be able to save someone right here, so here we go!\n\nFirstly, I got this game in a bundle (I guess) and I let it stay in my library for a long time, as first time I ran the game it was literally unplayable (performance reasons), my pc is not the best, but still I hoped they would fix some performance issues so I could really test this game. It's playable now. Performance-wise at least?\n\nTalking about performance, this game should be more of a benchmark than a game as even strong PC may not run it well. It's also got non-existent multicore detection, so not only lowering the details might be necessary, but also tweaking config files (and it's really quirky - I've heard it made some people return the game back to a store).\n\nLet's talk about the gameplay itself. You begin with a poorly designed interactive intro (basically the game, but without hp bar and with some other character - not to spoil). Then you will need to do some casual questing - complete a few, simple tutorial quests, not so lengthy, you virtually can't die, very casual. They are mostly badly designed and don't make sense, but it's just a tutorial. As the storyline continues: you're thrown into the deep waters (just a figure of speech) and some very NOT surprising stuff happens right off the bat. If you've ever played Fable: The Lost Chapters you will even see how similiar the beginning is, just... worse. This's less of a "life is a ♥♥♥♥♥ and then you die" kind of game than other games of the franchise.\n\nGame is mostly about fighting with sword, spells and such, and this part is so badly designed it will make your eyes bleed. The camera work is terrible - it takes the player away from the action. The fighting and combo system are very unreliable and not satisfactionary at all. Enemies kinda seem to have high hp, but they are easily (mostly) perma-stunned, don't offer much of a challenge, and rarely you will have any trouble taking out the enemies. Also the roll is so OP in this game, it's not even funny.\n\nWell, what about the audio? Many voice actors seem to be from different countries and they don't really speak English well. Some characters even have some wicked manners of speech, cringeworthy really. The dialogues are pretty boring really, there's nothing exciting or funny about the personas. You won't ever quote this game, that's for sure.\n\nFor the aesthetic values of the game, just to complete this rant: it's bad, really bad. Strangely acting shadows, models with less polygons Gothic 3 used to have, some weird textures at times, also poor facial expressions and this strange "mist" or "fog", it's just really bad.\n\nI can't find anything positive about this game, really. I'm trying, but I can't. If you like badly designed action RPG games, needing a lot of tweaking, patching, patience even, then be on your way, play this ♥♥♥♥. I don't think this game can even be salvaged by community mods (and I doubt someone would go through all the pain). If you really want this game because you like Gothic, try Risen or Risen 2. If you just want a rpg-like TPP game, you can go with Fable, Fable 3, Kingdoms of Amalur even, Gothic I, II, III, Risen, Risen 2 and a bunch of other games. Just DON'T TOUCH THIS PIECE OF FECES.","July 26, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did enjoy this one as well, but, not quite as much. That being said, I'm still hoping for Gothic 5.\nThe game seems to start in a fairly narrow area, that grows to a fairly large map, and then tapers down. I guess maybe the design was intentional.\nOnce you are off the beginning stage, where the story is set and you learn the combat etc. you end up on a very open map, with plenty to do, and explore, I enjoyed it. As it goes on closer to the end, the maps tend to close off more and more to make you follow a path. I wish the end had been more like the middle.\nThe NPC's have the same face, There must have been a lot of NPC inbreeding going on in that game. No hotties, not even one Hot character. I was disappointed in that.\nHowever, I did take a day off work to finish because in the end, i was ready to finish it and see what happened. The end was a very hard battle, but the just went to credits with no real closure.

Most of the time I had to play through the main quest line, there is nothing much to do except that.\n- "Open world" - not really open if we compare it to Gothic series. This game only opens one small portion of the map at a time, and after that you are never going back there again. That's why you have two teleports in a region, because you don't really need to teleport back anywhere else.\n- Magic is very limited, only few magic skills are available and you have to level them up to have any decent reason to use them. There are runes but unless you search every single corner in the game, you wouldn't use them most of the time.\n- Simple fighting mechanic. Although it is not as horrible as the one from Risen, the mechanic itself is just - click to swing your sword and click to dodge, that's all you need to know.\n\nBottom line: If the price is right it is decent game to play, clearly not in the same league as games from Gothic series, but enjoyable for many hours anyway.","July 5, 2014","true","28.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The handful of runes in the game are for sprinting or combat utility which continues the trend of runes taking a lesser role in recent Gothic games.\n\nThe island, story and situation you experience for the first 4 levels or so came off as corny, but the tone is a bit more serious and acceptable after leaving.  From then on the quests drive the story and character leveling at a satisfying pace which keeps you going through the linear progression with pockets of open exploration.  Though the story is not disinteresting, it doesn't manage to cultivate any emotional investment.\n\nVery smooth enjoyable ride with beautiful environments lush with plant life, dynamic lighting, wind causing whole trees to sway, impressive grass render distance, a high frequency of stormy weather and some excellent fire particle effects.\n\nIt will not meet rigid expectations of what a Gothic game should be and this will be far from the highest production value RPG you've ever seen, but if you are craving a somewhat relaxing RPG with a bit less depth for a change then you might enjoy it as I have.  Hard difficulty is probably the sweet spot, as Normal is too easy and Gothic difficulty is considered by many to be unsatisfying.","March 26, 2012","true","43.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story moves along and it occasionally runs into speed bumps in the storytelling but otherwise for an almost 5 year old game it doesn't look or play badly.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that the game seems to be designed for strictly melee combat. You can certainly get spells and upgrade them and use a bow more if you feel thats your thing but from experience if you go down any other road than a typical barbarian build you're going to find difficulties. For instance, theres a skill tree for stealth but it doesn't give you a bonus for a stealth attack until you've accumulated a lot of skill points which you don't get a lot of per level.\nYou can certianly build a mage if you prefer but the game is pretty clear in it's limitations in regards to how you build the character.\n\nOtherwise, the game is fun. The characters are interesting but more or less pretty standard characters for a fantasy game.\n\nIf you're looking for an inexpensive RPG that will hold your attention, ArcaniA should do nicely.\nIf you're expecting a Skyrim-esque experience, this is not it.\n\nOne thing I liked was the collectibles. In most games, they do nothing but reward you with some sort of achievement or otherwise forgettable reward. In this game, it clearly tells you what the rewards are and they could help your character depending on how you play. but at least you know ahead of time rather than finding out collecting all those items wasn't going to be worth it.\n\nIts good. Get it.","June 18, 2014","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the time I had to play through the main quest line, there is nothing much to do except that.\n- "Open world" - not really open if we compare it to Gothic series. This game only opens one small portion of the map at a time, and after that you are never going back there again. That's why you have two teleports in a region, because you don't really need to teleport back anywhere else.\n- Magic is very limited, only few magic skills are available and you have to level them up to have any decent reason to use them. There are runes but unless you search every single corner in the game, you wouldn't use them most of the time.\n- Simple fighting mechanic. Although it is not as horrible as the one from Risen, the mechanic itself is just - click to swing your sword and click to dodge, that's all you need to know.\n\nBottom line: If the price is right it is decent game to play, clearly not in the same league as games from Gothic series, but enjoyable for many hours anyway.","July 5, 2014","true","28.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also there's far too many invisible walls, partly in completely unnecessary places.\nI especially liked that the game spawns you right next to the ocean with a tiny invisible wall 'guarding' it because they were too lazy to implement a swimming feature or water physics, because when you jump over the wall your character just dies for no reason whatsoever and just slips around in the water like it's not there.\n\nI also couldn't stand the storyline in the very beginning.

As a fan of the older Gothic games, I was glad to see another Gothic game come around. After playing both XBox and PC versions of this game, hands down the PC version is the best. Not because of the better graphics, but the menus as well. On the console, the menus were kind of a pain to use and not thought out very well, whereas the PC version had easy to use menus. The game just felt as if it was designed to be played on the PC rather than a console.\n\nOne thing that striked me as odd was the disapearing foliage. I understand something like that if there's no machine that can handle playing it, but why have this in a game at all? It really felt out of place, AND a menu option didn't show up for it until I messed with the game settings saved on my hard drive....just odd..\n\nThe overall story was very good, but lacked substance. Not because it was a bad story, but because the game didn't do a very good job of explaining it to you. I had to play through the game to completion before I could get an overview of the story and why you do what you do. Still, I don't understand half of it, and had to actually read about it.\n\nThe gameplay is by far the most outstanding portion of this title. I really enjoy the combat in this game as it just feels more free than your standard hotkey RPG like most MMOs. Hotkeys are present, but their more for selecting weapons and skills rather than combat.\n\nOverall, I give a 7.5/10. If you're a hardcore RPG fan and a fan of the older Gothic games, I recommend picking up this title. It's worth the $20.","March 19, 2014","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is my first steam review.\n\nYeah i've played it all the way through and i felt that the story was weak, all it was to me is that the main character tells people "Hey, i need to find X" and the other person says "You want to find/speak to X? well you need to prove yourself worthy" and run to a cave and kill one random monster out of the 10 different types of mobs in this game and get a item to bring it back to the to prove yourself worthy to speak to X and then you move on the the next area/town and repeat.\n\nAs for the combat, it was a bit.. Eh.. I like that I have my bow, sword and magic equipped all at once so it brought a fable feeling to me. I havent dug deep into combat with a ranger or mage so I cant type about that but with the melee, i thought the flourishes were kool and the way you can combinate regular attacks with flourishes but your left vulnerble for a second or so. But heres the problem with it. Regular attacks are limited to 6 strikes in a row, so you can hit hit flourish hit flourish and chain another flourish if u have the stamina for it and thats a sick combo but if you max out one of the melee dmg and health tree (i forgot what its called) it'll allows unlimited stirkes in a row without being left vulnerable... which kinda defeats the purpose of using a flourish because most enemies dont attack if your hitting them, so you can basically smack them until they die. (cough cough demonlords and bosses)\n\nSome enemies can charge up a skill while your smacking them and you would think you would stop your endless strike rage on them when they charge a move to hurt you right? Nah, if you get one of the three mage skills that allows you to stun an enemy you could just cast that spell while theyre charging a move and they would stop and you could go back to your endless rage with no worry. im serious... its like an infinite (fighting game gamers understand infinites) thats the only mage spell i touched in the game and just made me wonder "how overpowered is a mage and oh, i forgot i had a bow"\n\nIts about an 14-15 hour run, it kinda felt repetitive.. maybe because the way i played but if you played this game im pretty sure theres other ways of cheapness in the game. As for the ending **Spoiler**... i don't wanna speak about it, you walk to the boss and literally say like 2 lines and you fight him.. easy boss all you have to do is smack smack smack (endless rage strikes) until he teleports and throws beams at you which u can easily hide behind the portal doors and dont get hit by none of em.. he comes back and u repeat and he teleports and spawns enemies and comes back then, repeat and he dies. THE SECOND HE DIES AND TOUCHES THE FLOOR, NO ENDING CUTSCENE AND CREDITS APPEAR, AFTER THAT YOUR BACK AT THE MAIN MENU! so the 14-15 hour journey with a weak storyline comes to a end with not knowing what happened after shepard kills the final demon and you feel cheated of your time invested to see what would happen and nothing happens...\nAll i can really say is thank goodness i bought this game on a steam sale for dirt cheap and i dont recommend you to get this game.\n\n3/7/2014: Edit - I've decided to fight the final boss again because i figured it was weird there was no ending so i killed the boss and the ending scene actually showed this time... But i still don't recommend this game.","March 5, 2014","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The rain looks amazing. That's about it though.\nI only played through the beginning, but I can already see where the game is headed: nowhere. Let's look at it.\nYou start the game as the nameless character from the gothic series, if you had chosen the good apth in Gothic 3. You go through a cave, get to know the combat system, you roll around a bit. Cool enough.\nThen you wake up as a different character and are introduced to your girlfriend. Your girlfriend apparently forgot how to voice act, just like any other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character... Main character included. So you are a sherphard and apparently your relationship with her is a secret and her father found out. So you have to go through these 3 tests that the old geezer is desperatly trying to make you fail because... some reason, to get permision to marry his daughter, which you as the player have absolutely no interest in because you don't get to know her... at all. *spoiler* It is so clear that she is a plot device and will die later. The only time you feel the slightest bit for her is when she leaves you her bow at the third test, and that is pathetic really.

It was supposed to be on paar with Skyrim, so they said... This game hurts to play, that's how bad it is.\n\nMy opinion: Save your money, get Two Worlds 2, an underappreciated RPG which has smooth gameplay and very few bugs, if any; You can get Two Worlds 2 Epic Edition and Expansion on a bundle site for a few dollars and you'll have a lot more fun than you would with this game.\n\nThe gameplay is stale, there are bugs that hinder gameplay such as: When trying to walk down a hill ( mind you, there is a dirt trail so you're supposed to be able to walk there ) it feels like you're walking down steps with invisible walls blocking you, breaking, allowing you to take a step, block you, repeat... You litereally don't walk down the hill, you walk straight as though the ground is level, get forced to stop, drop a foot, then you're allowed to repeat this drama all over again until you finally make it down the hill...\n\nI was suckered in to pre-purchasing this game, a mistake I'll never make again with Nordic Games or Spellbound Studios. It was so riddled with bugs I tried getting a refund from Steam; had I waited until release and still bought it, I would've charged the amount back because this game isn't completed, it isn't playable and I'm not going to waste what little time I have left on this rock playing it; I'd rather wait until my dirt-nap than play this if this were the only game in my library.","January 31, 2015","false","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The handful of runes in the game are for sprinting or combat utility which continues the trend of runes taking a lesser role in recent Gothic games.\n\nThe island, story and situation you experience for the first 4 levels or so came off as corny, but the tone is a bit more serious and acceptable after leaving.  From then on the quests drive the story and character leveling at a satisfying pace which keeps you going through the linear progression with pockets of open exploration.  Though the story is not disinteresting, it doesn't manage to cultivate any emotional investment.\n\nVery smooth enjoyable ride with beautiful environments lush with plant life, dynamic lighting, wind causing whole trees to sway, impressive grass render distance, a high frequency of stormy weather and some excellent fire particle effects.\n\nIt will not meet rigid expectations of what a Gothic game should be and this will be far from the highest production value RPG you've ever seen, but if you are craving a somewhat relaxing RPG with a bit less depth for a change then you might enjoy it as I have.  Hard difficulty is probably the sweet spot, as Normal is too easy and Gothic difficulty is considered by many to be unsatisfying.","March 26, 2012","true","43.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only time you feel the slightest bit for her is when she leaves you her bow at the third test, and that is pathetic really. Then there's this other dude who wants to marry her aswell, and he challenges you and your like "whatever" and beat him up, so exciting.\nYou do get to meet Diego though, which is honestly not very exciting still because he is not much like his old self.\nThen for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason you help this weird witch kill bugs, and while you do that your village is burned down by the old heroes army and your like "called it" because it was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ obvious, and then you go with diego somewhere and is like: "I must have revenge, because I was so connected with everyone in that village"\nGame, If you want me to take your revenge plot seriously at the very least make me feel SOMETHING for the characters.

What we got was an oversimplified RPG with a mediocre story at best that has not even a bit depth like the previous ones. The combat is very easy, making dying the more challenging task even on the ultimate "gothic" difficulty. I made it through the game first just using my two-hand-weapon and left swinging them to death and sometimes rolling to become invincible to projectiles like spells and arrows or to dodge melee attacks that sometimes hit you for no reason. After 1/2 of the game I got tired of this dull combat and just walked through the masses of enemies which works until you hit a forced encounter or a locked door and then you can just kill the 2-3 enemies that are still behind you.\nInstead of an interessting world with many great, optional characters and a lot to do, we have linear enviroment (it is literally a chain of somewhat open areas that needs the completing of the main quest part to advance to the next chainlink) with the same character models being reused over and over again. Instead of being able to attack any NPC, you can only duel some for a quest and else they noclip through your attacks; instead of being able to choose a fraction, you are being forced onto one line to obey; instead of being able to get reputation in a city, all quests are either fully optional for gear or are needed for the progression aka the main quest; instead of being able to get into city fights with you leading the rebels against a whole army of orcs, you are a lone wolf and any NPC will refuse to interact while you are in combat.\nOnly good things are the graphics (for its age) and the small learning curve, if you are into casual RPGs. Not worth the time. Better get an old one and get community patches for them.","March 2","false","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This title is a little bit tricky. You can´t compare it to the roleplayness of the older ones. Especially because you can´t interact with obvious things with obvious effects. I know, I know, there´s a setting, where you can enable or dissable roleplay element, like cooking or "sleeping" but it doesn´t give you effects. For example you can´t skip the night in a bed. Or regenerate health in a bed. i don´t actually know why this is not possible, because it´s even possible in the older ones. Most people be like: Ok i jump ingame, set difficulty to normal and maybe enjoy something. But that´s wrong. In my opinion you can only play on hard or gothic (very hard). Easy: Is just you are running through the world and killing Undeads with a kitchen knife. On normal it´s a little bit harder but still not a good experience. On hard it´s almost perfect. It´s not unfair, but not too easy. It´s a challenge. For example you can easily be killed by 6 or more Bloodflies. I´m almost at 100 health and have the best equipment you can get for this chapter of the world and it´s the perfect difficulty. "Gothic" is for the experienced player. But with "experienced" I don´t mean someone who played the older Gothics. This is far away from being a "real" gothic. You could compare this to Risen 2/3. This difficulty would be ok, but in my opinion it´s ridiculos how they don´t stop the attacking-chain (infinite combined attacks) Now something about the world. Now to the world. If you played the older Gothics, you most likely think it´s an open-worldgame, too. Wrong. It hasn´t an open world. You have one great island, where you fight from chapter to chapter. For example you can´t get from the beginning to the place where the game should end. But it´s not so bad, because you have a really good teleporting-system. No, sorry I was joking. The teleport system is useless. Imagine. You have points A, B, C and D. all of those places have a teleporter, which can be unlocked by just going to it and being near to it. You want from point A to point D. It´s not like you can teleport there, naaaaaah. You need to go to teleporter A, you teleport to teleporter B, you walk all the way through the island to teleporter C, to teleport to the final teleporter D. That´s how the system works. You basically have 2 connected teleporters where you can teleport between. So it could be a disaster. If you forgot something at the beginning, like a Tomb with a piece of an antique rune. You need to get 30 (not sure) of this to get this rune. And with this teleporting system, I only have one advice: NEVER forget about something. NEVER. Ok, that where many negative aspects of the game. Is it still good? Yes. I play it for like the 3rd time and I still enjoy it. Oh, and i have something to say to all the mages: The magic-system is crap. You only have 3 spells (lightning, fire and ice). You can upgrade them to do more damage and have a bigger range, but it´s a shame compared to the older gothics. There are some scrolls, but they are exactly the same thing, as you can learn. Just a little bit better. Maybe. You can´t summon a rain of fire or a huge demon. Not with ArcaniA. I still enjoy this game, so i rate 7/10 points. Because it´s not actually that bad. The landscapes are beautyful. It´s just a nobrainer to play sometimes. But it also have contra-aspects.

I'll admit I'm only 16 hours into this game, However, I've been thoroughly enjoying this game. Visually, It's quite fun to look at it, Extremely beautiful. However there's a lot of reused sprites, and voices which can be a flaw to some (It is slightly annoying, but not a minus for me) I actually enjoy the story so far, I think the combat is alright with really three main ways of playing, Mage, Melee weapon or Bows/Crossbows. There's a lot of crafting you can do(Like making weapons) and a bit of alchemy to do(Like making your own potions, These potions vary from adding to your health regen to increasing your overall stats temporarily)\n\nI will say this though, This game is a bit buggy. You can get stuck in poorly rendered areas or just jumping where you aren't suppose to go, The cut-scenes will make you crash from time to time as well, However you can easily watch the cut scenes from within the Arcania folder if you do crash and just skip them in game. Does this make the game unplayable? For me, No it doesn't. It can be annoying to crash during a cutscene and have to rewatch it again, But it's no big deal for the most part.\n\nI'll also say this, I had a lot more problems running this game off an FX-8150 CPU than I do with my current i7 3770k(Graphics card is a 7970 for those wondering), Whether this game doesn't like AMD or something along those lines I can't say for sure, But my system isn't a slouch by any means. I feel like this game might run better on older systems then newer systems, For instance my laptop running an old first gen i7 at 1.73GHz and a 1GB ATI card(I think 5850) seems to run it without any cut scene errors or crashes.\n\nBut in the end, I really do enjoy this game, The main story keeps me interested, I feel the combat is alright for the style of game that it is, and despite some minor things here and there, I would recommend this game when it's on sale. I personally feel it's worth it's $20 price tag that it wears now. If you see it on sale and you read the reviews and thought "Well, Now I'm not too sure..." I would take the chance to try it out. I can't vouch for the other games in the series as I've never played them, But please, Give this one a chance!\n\nEdit: I've now completed the game with 26 hours played, I'm definitely going to be playing through it one more time, And possibly might buy the DLC as well. I took my time for the most part playing through this and had all but one quest finished(finding 30 belier artifacts), So I'll assume you can get around 25 30 hours on average for this game's full completion. The ending was a tad disappointing in terms of the fight, However I feel the story was still enjoyable despite this. Combined with the great visuals, and a decent combat system, I think this game was well worth picking up if you enjoy RPGs. There is quite a bit of walking, Like most RPGs but it never once bothered me.\n\nThere is a huge amount of potions you can create, A handful of decent weapons, and a couple decent armors. The best items you can craft obviously don't come till later on in the game. The weapons you can make don't come until you're about half way 3/4ths of the way done with the game, When you're able to create Steel Ingots. Some boss fights are underwhelming, Especially when you play the game at normal difficulty or lower, Some bosses will drop some decent weapons however. I strongly recommend following the "Kill everything you see" tactic, Unless you run into mobs that you have difficulty taking down, As each mob will drop a certain item that is special to it. That's it for what I have to say, Enjoy!","January 3","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You see or hear about important characters that were present in each Gothic game so far and there are iconic monsters to fight with as well (damned scavangers!). You see a lot of bugs, so that helps too. You get used to the fact that everything is so much easier to do:\n- Fighting and low HP? Just press your hotkey for the Health Potion and your combat isn't stopped; hell, sometimes you don't even see the character's animation for drinking, but at least you don't get killed by a freakin' wolf pack anymore!\n- Reaching a new level and need to get new skills? Just bring up the Skills menu and bask in the glory of adding those 3 new learning points wherever you wish, even while fighting! Who cares how you suddenly learned how to cast a fireball after you finished off a scavanger and the rest of his pack is now chasing you?\n- Learned how to brew a new potion or how to craft a new sword? No need for an alchemist's bench or anvils, go ahead bring up the damned crafting menu and make everything you want.\n\nIt's not really a Gothic game. It's not even a good RPG game.

It actually felt more like playing a new Source Engine shooter in that respect - everything is familiar, the guns all do the same ♥♥♥♥, and all your settings are the same, but you love it because it feels comfortable. And that's exactly how I'd describe this game in one word: Comfortable. If you've played Risen or Ego Draconis or something similar, and enjoyed it, you will enjoy this. Only real flaw in the game is the whole, "I'm going to try keep you in the map by making you slide off ♥♥♥♥ when you do parkour", mechanic.

It didn't work in Risen, it didn't work in Arcania, and it better ♥♥♥♥ing not be in Risen 2...","February 27, 2012","true","27.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
