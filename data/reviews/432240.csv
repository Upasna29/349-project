"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/432240/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","I’m always a little wary of the indie horror games that get unleashed onto Steam. They have a habit of either being hype machines that fail to live up to the billing or they’re utter garbage that gain notoriety for just how bad they are. Some would argue that its because its generally fairly inexpensive to create cheap jump scares in games and that’s ultimately what you end up getting – a game loaded with cheap jump scares. Very rarely do you find an indie horror game that is worth its weight in gold or in our case the time spent playing the game. And so it was with trepidation that I loaded up UnderDread Bigzur Games’s debut Steam release even though at time of playing the game had a positive review score with the 17 published reviews (14-3).\n\nIn doing research for the game I discovered that this game was titled Slender Man Origins 2 Saga but was changed to UnderDread for its Steam release so as to not get caught up in any copyright arguments with Slender: The Arrival which of course features the now famous Slenderman. The title was highly rated on the various app stores with most finding the game to be rather impressive. However, as we all know phone to Steam ports often go awry so until one reports on it you may never know. As others have already done so and I can confirm the game plays comfortably well on Steam and works as fully intended.\n\nThe game has you adventuring through a horror filled ancient castle. Throughout your journey you will solve a lot of puzzles and avoid the standard ghouls, goblins and associated horrors that one would find in a haunted castle. The objective is to find your daughter who was kidnapped from the inn you were staying at. A strong bonus from my vantage point is that all of the puzzles and the horrors fit within the story being told. There doesn’t appear to be many, if any, occasions where I wondered why a particular game design choice was made when perhaps a better – and more obvious – one would have worked better. The puzzles are enjoyable and the supernatural enemies well designed. I particularly enjoyed the relatively simple but well executed stealth mechanic where you could hide from the enemies by crouching and hiding behind walls, etc. while with a key press you could dispel the enemy for a short time to enable you to complete the task at hand.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is fantastic and arguably the game’s greatest highlight. It enables a good level of immersion that is only ever broken when you need to use the hint system. This is aided by a good choice of soundtrack and solid, albeit unspectacular, visuals. All in all the developers did a solid job in this area of the game – one of the most important for a horror game. Furthermore, they really didn’t go with the cheap tricks that lesser horror titles do.\n\nThere is a hint system within the game that works rather well and allows you to progress through the game when you become stuck. I do believe that there may be some sort of timer in some of the areas of the game on the system so that it doesn’t get abused as there were a couple of areas where I wasn’t receiving a hint when I called for one shortly after using.\n\nI wish that there was greater controller support for the game. There is no reason why the game lacks full controller support but it does. I am fine using keyboard and mouse for games but I do prefer controller. I’m far from a console peasant either for those of you reading from /r/PCMasterRace – I just find that for non-precision games my enjoyment factor increases. I have noticed a lot of complaints about the head weaving. I never really had that as a personal problem but if it was at all possible perhaps in a later update make that an option that players who do suffer from motion sickness can turn off. I’d also like to see the devs add Steam achievements and trading cards. These four factors would improve the game and/or the amount of people who would purchase the game substantially.\n\nUnderDread was a pleasant surprise. I went into the game not expecting a lot and received much more than I bargained for. A very solid indie horror title.\n\nFor our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group","March 16","true","26.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/recommended/432240/","orgelambart","Orge Lambart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/","5483 products in account","This title was originally released for the phone under the title Slender Man Origins 2 saga, originally released for phones, although with that said the original game was highly rated and I don't personally think the developers did it intentionally to mislead people but rather to avoid any conflicts with Slenderman copyright.  With that said, the game is really good with the updates and changes made from the original game are pretty good, or so I've heard as I never originally played the phone game.  The only addition that would have been nice is controller support (the game allows you to move back and forth with a controller but everything else is disabled.\n\nThe game starts off with hand drawn images giving you the basics of the story, you're daughter has gone missing during the night, after asking the locals,  you discover that other children have gone missing as well, a detective is currently investigating the disappearances and has in fact brought several of the children home.  So after searching and failing to discover anything you set out for an isolated castle which is where the Detective was heading the night before.  After getting to the castle you discover something is quite amiss about the large foreboding structure.  The need to discover what happened to your daughter outweighs any fear you may have and you trounce into the castle armed with a trusty lantern.\n\nThe game plays a lot like other games in this genre, you search for items, and use those items to delve deeper into the castle. Aside from searching for items and the spooky atmosphere you discover numerous monsters ready to eat, abuse or generally do unmentionable things to your vulnerable body.  When monsters are nearby you're required to hide and wait for them to leave, or use a ward to send them away.  Furthermore you're able to use hints to help with your current missions, the hints come in handy for users who aren't used to playing old school games that didn't hold your hand..  (major plus IMO, as most games these days hold your hands, this one doesn't do that, but offers you a way to help yourself out on those really tough missions).  As well as finding items to help get deeper into the castle you can pick up notes and pages which help out with information about getting further and giving a general background on the castle and expanding the story-line.\n\nPro's\nGreat Atmosphere,\nEerie Music,\nInteresting Story, (albeit kind of cliche)\nDecent character models and graphics\n\ncon's\nLack of controller support (not a big deal but meh, I love me some controllers and see the basics of them are there)\nSluggish controls\nHead bobbing  (this is again a personal preference.)\n\n\nSo overall:  I'd recommend this game if you're a fan of hide and glide gameplay (yeah I termed these types of game hide and glide... I'm bringing it back.. err well starting it up.), I'd give it a very solid 8 out of 10, that score would go up by a half a point if controller support and achievements were added.","March 6","true","6.0"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","0"

When I first read about it I was super excited, boy was I disappointed.\n\nNow, let's not get this confused; this game has a TON of potential. The atmosphere and setting are on point. I am not a big jump scare person, not that I don't like them, they just do almost nothing for me. If a game is to get under my skin, it's going to do it with sound. This game has that nailed. The random heavy breathing, the eerie talking, all the subtle sounds are incredible and unnerving. So well done.\n\nWhere the game fell flat for me was in the gameplay itself. Moving was often sluggish feeling, almost laggy. My computer can run a lot of games at the highest of graphical settings so there was no reason for this. When I sprinted the game felt fine, but the walking was just .... I don't know, muddy? Also, there were challenges that I had no idea why I was even doing them. They were just there, so I started doing them.. without any direction from the game or any feedback that I was doing exactly what I needed to. These things need to be sorted out.\n\nNow.... let's talk about the main procrastinator. The "monster". Interesting design, though not frightening at all. Is he supposed to be as unintelligent as he is? I mean, he is 3 feet over my cover, I can see all of him and he can't see me? And why does he make that noise? It's not scary, it's nearly gratingly annoying.\n\nLike I said, this game has a ton of potential and I'd love to revisit it if these things are ironed out. As it stands right now, I simply have no interest. I hope this gets the fixes it needs.","April 17","false","0.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The suspense, walking around dark corners, wondering if something - or someone - is going to jump out at me. Then when that does happen, I have woken up all the neighbors and have a brand new mess in my pants that I have to clean up. Bigzur’s horror game, UnderDread, makes this happen very frequently with random spooky noises and jumps, things randomly falling from above, and running from monsters that are trying their hardest to make the rest of my life as painful and miserable as possible.\n\nThe story takes place in the early 1700s where you and your daughter are travelling on a carriage and after growing tired, you decide to stop and rest at a small inn for the night. You wake up the next day to find that your daughter is nowhere to be found. You look around nearby but to no avail. After asking the locals you have been told that there are strange things happening, other disappearing children, and the people believe it has something to do with the former local landlord’s castle. Time to investigate!\n\nIt sounds like an urban legend, something that you could imagine people back then telling their friends around a campfire to scare each other. It is a spooky tale and a great concept for a horror game to be built around if you have the right people working on it and making sure it is done justice. Don’t worry, Bigzur have done a great job!\n\nThe game consists of lots of very difficult puzzles and challenges, in lots and lots of different rooms. Making sure you aren’t caught by a giant floating skeleton with three heads is a challenge enough, but just to add to that you have to flip a bunch of levers spread around the room too! You may use the hints you have acquired to assist you in figuring out what must be done to proceed and the shields to make the enemy leave for a little while, only to return a few minutes to grab you and steal your soul if you aren’t careful enough.\n\nThe visuals and animations bring me nostalgia, reminding me of some old school horror games. This is nothing bad, from an indie game development team it is far beyond what I would expect. Some of the animations and physics - like the lantern - have been buggy, but it is only visual issues from what I have seen so far which are very minor and don’t really take away from the feel of the game. The eerie sound effects and music adds a grand amount to the immersive atmosphere of the game, which make me jump even if nothing happens visually.\n\nAs far as horror goes, the game is more jumpy than something that would keep you awake at night. It is creepy and suspenseful while you are playing it though, like something out of the Slender games, especially at night and with headphones on!\n\nIn conclusion, it is a brilliantly fun game and well worth the money. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys horror games like Outlast, Slender or Amnesia.\n\nI rate it 8/10 floating skeletons with three heads.","May 19","true","1.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

The Slender Man intellectual property banhammer is swung hard at everything from movies to books these days so the developers weren't exactly left with much wiggling room in that respect.\n\nAs it stands, UnderDread is a solid title; perhaps a little expensive for what it actually is considering the original's going for less than £1 on Google Play at the minute but still charmingly spooky in its atmospherics and inventively expansive in contributing to the Slender Man mythology.\n\nYou play a father searching an isolated castle for his kidnapped daughter, as well as stone keys, ancient coins, holy water, daggers, potions, switches, planks of wood and anything else the game can conceivably force you to hunt down as you are stalked by various monsters from which you must hide like a coward. Some aid is offered in the form of Tip Scrolls that will lead you to your next available item and Shields that banish your supernatural adversaries for a spell. It's simple but becomes repetitive quickly as you're forced to backtrack large distances in the name of guesswork. The holy water quest in particular exhaustingly drags you back to the start of the chapter without giving you any indication of just how much of the bloody stuff you're supposed to be looking for. The only way you'll know is to head back to where you're supposed to be using it to be met with a 'Not enough yet, bucko!' taunt. I fail to see what harm a counter or track would have done to combat the sluggish recharging of the sprint meter there.\n\nThankfully, UnderDread abandons most of its scavenger hunting just over halfway through. There's just enough gloss and plot to keep it interesting throughout and some of the enemy designs are lovely, particularly the portable corridor of vengeful corpses that stalks the tunnels under the castle. Worth a go but maybe wait for a sale.\n\nFull video review below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0srV2CdxoI","March 5","true","2.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","7","11","2","0"

Yes.  I'm also told that it's a port of a mobile game, renamed for Steam because it originally had the word "Slenderman" in the title (why is anyone's guess, as there's not a Slender in sight).  Next silly question:  Is it anywhere near as GOOD as Amnesia: The Dark Descent?  No.  Of course not, you preposterous excuse for a human being.  The good news, however, is that it's not as bad as it could have been, given what I've just stated.  Alas, this ain't exactly the second coming of Frictional...\n\nSomething which this game does a mostly decent job of emulating is Amnesia's ATMOSPHERE.  The visuals are nice enough, all things considered, and the sound is pretty effective apart from the occasional jarring moment of abruptness, when a ghoulie departs the area you're in with all the subtle smoothness of someone pressing the stop button on an old cassette walkman.  There's also some - emphasis on SOME - reasonably half-decent puzzles to be found in the game's three to five hour playing time, and the story is...well, alright, even if the ending brings new meaning and depth to the word "unsatisfying" ("To be continued"...yeah, right, sure...we'll all hold our collective breaths for that one).\n\nSo what does the game do not-quite-so-well?  Well, for a "stealth horror" game, the actual stealth mechanics are kinda dodgy to say the least.  Many is the time that I crouched in a corner, with my lantern off, assuming that the ghostie chasing me surely couldn't see me behind this pillar and...nope.  He found me.  See, the early part of the game, at least, works off pre-designated hiding places, clearly indicated to you by a closed eye symbol which appears on-screen, and you just have to trust the logic of said hiding places...even when they seem way more out in the open than other places which would appear, to the logical mind at least, to be more sure-fire safe-spots.  The second half of the game raises the bar of stupidity some more by removing the closed eye symbol altogether, and replacing it with some incomprehensible gobbledygook written on a scroll about hiding in a particular area of the tunnels or some-such...a message which I clearly had little chance of making heads or tails of, given that the only language I'm currently fluent in is English.  (Google Translate really does need to be taken off the internet altogether, as it evidently does more harm than good.)\n\nThen there's the completely illogical back-tracking.  Oh yes, you're gonna love the back-tracking.  Remember the holy water you forgot to pick up in that area way, way back...the area which you've already combed from top-to-bottom five times already?  Nah, me neither.  But there it was, just like the ritual knives I couldn't pick up the first time, and so on and so forth.  I guess it's a "realistic" change from the usual video game antics in which you pick up almost everything in sight, somehow just KNOWING you're gonna need it later on.  So in the interests of grittiness, Underdread makes you wait for a journal entry telling you to go look for said object...before promptly saving you the hassle of spending another ten minutes searching areas you've already been by letting you PRESS A TIP BUTTON which generates a magical blue light which leads you straight to the object in question.  What was that I was just saying about realism?  Oh well.  They tried, I guess.  And it did save them the bother of having to, y'know, make more maps than was absolutely necessary to pad the game out to a vaguely reasonable length.\n\nOh, and to add to the aggravation of the ceaseless back-tracking, they of course had to put a "stamina meter" in to ensure that you can only sprint for so long before you have to walk for a while.  You can, on the other hand, sprint while CROUCHING, so maybe some of you may consider that something of a novelty and/or consolation.  Me, I just thought it was kinda silly, and could only imagine how unintentionally creepy my character must look WADDLING along at that speed...\n\nLook, it's not entirely "bad" - certainly better than many independent horror games recently released to Steam which DON'T even have the excuse of being mobile ports - and does manage to be moderately spooky, even if the relentless presence of certain on-rails enemies becomes highly repetitive and predictable after a while.  But it's mostly okay, and I'm happy to recommend it to anyone who's played The Dark Descent to death, and is desperate for a game that's ostensibly similar without being even a fraction as good.  To anyone else, seriously:  What the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with you people?!  Amnesia: The Dark Descent.  Buy it now.  And everything else in the Frictional catalogue, for that matter.  And Outlast, while we're at it.  And Alien: Isolation.  And Among the Sleep.  In short, there's a veritable ♥♥♥♥-TONNE of "stealth horror" games out there which you should play before you bother with this one.  Go play those instead, and I don't want to see you back on this wretched excuse for a Store page until you've bought and played all the games I just mentioned.\n\nWhat's that you say?  You HAVE played them all?  At least FIVE TIMES EACH?!  Oh, alright then...buy the ♥♥♥♥ing thing.  We horror game addicts are nothing if not BEGGARS, let's be honest here...\n\nVerdict: 6.5/10.","March 25","true","5.9"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","10","17","2","0"

So I just walk through this trigger for a scripted event, and a griffon like statue fell down, and I guess hit me instead of the ground it was supposed to, queue the single sound effect this game plays for its "JUMP SCARES" {I use parentheses because I don't consider them scary in the first place and the large majority of the time in this game I was left questioning whether anything ACTUALLY HAPPENED or not.  Needless to say that is one of my gripes, but on with the story) and I’m left trapped as this was actually a physics object rather than a scripted one, and due to it falling on my head it went behind me and trapped me between it and a COMPLETELY STATIONARY CHAIR YES I WAS BEAT BY A STATUE WITH SUCH A LACK OF WEIGHT I DIDNT FEEL IT HIT MY HEAD AND A CHAIR.  At first I thought that WAS the event and I was trapped in a puzzle, until I got bored of searching, used a hint and found out I had to go the other (blocked off) way so I reloaded the chapter from the start.  And that isn't even the starting point that describes the horrible choices made with this game.\n\nSo anyways anyone reading this ever play, or at least watch someone play the original Silent Hill (♥♥♥♥ Konami btw but onward)  Well great you know something about this game, and that being this game has the same fog mechanics!  Except it's black as if it was dark which makes no sense with the lighting engine put in place, that includes dynamic shadows as seen when you turn a corner with your lamp on, as there ARE lights in this game that ARE lit, and when you get close to them they DO emit light!  But guess what, the African American fog just rolled into town, and it doesn't care about no "LIGHTING ENGINE" that's as much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t as Global Warming, Climate Change, and the fact that Atheism exists!  (Just a side note I’m not trying to be some sort of racist or anything by calling the fog African American then heavily implying stupidity, it's just a way of illustrating my frustration using words)\n\nAlso to list off some more grievances with this game:\n\nYe olde English with more nonsensical grammar and less word choice.\n\nColor correction turns everything blue, as if it was a filter over a screen added for no reason.\n\nThe monster (Of chapter 2) is a generic skeleton except ITS NOT EVEN COMPOSED OF A SINGLE PERSON it just floats around with close to six heads looking everywhere with light and fog emiting at its center, it sounds kind of alright on paper, but it looks superbly generic in game\n\nLow quality models everywhere in game, which is a bit more meh for a indie\n\nNO REBINDABLE BUTTONS, SERIOUSLY WTF GAME\nThe sound FX are pretty damn ♥♥♥♥\n\nBUT WHAT ISNT MEH IS ALL THE TEXTURE OVERLAPPING, INCONSISTENT MODELING OF THINGS LIKE RAILS ON BRIDGES IT TAKES ME OUT OF THE EXPERIENCE EVEN MORE\n\nAND THEN THERES CONSTANT HEAD/VIEW BOBBING!  DONT KNOW ABOUT THE REST OF YOU BUT MY SIGHT DOESNT BOB EVERYTIME I TAKE A ♥♥♥♥ING STEP, BECAUSE WE DONT ACTUALLY RISE THAT HIGH AND OUR HEADS ARE PRETTY STABLE WHILE WE WALK!  FOR ♥♥♥♥ SAKES DEVELOPERS WHY DO YOU DO THIS!?!\n\nThat doesn't mean that much if the gameplay is somewhat decent, but if it was enough to pay for all the negatives then I'd be recommending this game wouldn't I?  Well allow me to discuss it for you.  The main gameplay I ran into was a mix of confusing, overly easy puzzles, frustratingly vauge direction, and seemingly stupid choices.  One puzzle is flipping switches but where I started I didn't notice that it changed the center pillar, and I didn't know how since all the switches start IN RANDOMIZED  PLACES so with a red and green, thinking green means good I just switched all of them to green (Also no hint unless you use the hint tool, and I didn’t so idk if it tells you even doing that) and guessed that it was some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t lever thing where you have to switch all of them in different positions (keep in mind the lever positions themselves are randomized) to open the door but that's not it either, if you read a single journal entry from the detective character it mentions ONCE and vaguely at that that the pillar holds a statue at the top and he wonders if he could lower it, and since you HAD JUST INTERACTED WITH A STATUE TO GET IN that again is the key.  That's not it though, the next puzzle requires you to backtrack all the way back to right in front of the gate and interact with a statue which previously you couldn’t do a damn thing with!  And shows no differently now that you can!  And to further go on this crusade talking about how you can’t clear objectives for the future, there’s a part with a miniature statue of the same look and I thought they were trying to be a bit sneaky and clever and make us interact with this too considering THERES NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE REST OF THE GAME and it stuck out like a sore thumb among and the gold and riches of that area, so I tried interacting with it, and nothing happened, I went on my way finishing the second and then third puzzle of the area to find out the fourth needed a small thing, with a presumably square base heavy enough to weigh down a pressure plate, and at the time I was recording and I said I bet that’s what the statue was what I needed, so I ran a mile through a broken maze and across some bridges, interacted with the statue, picked it up this time, and ran back and F MY LIFE I WAS RIGHT.  So this game became too predictable, until a half hour later I had to create an acid from 30 potions, and the acid was smaller than a single one of the potions so the game doesn’t respect the concept of volume either, so good gayme devs.  And after all of that backtracking and returning I had to backtrack to the START OF THE AREA AGAIN taking easily ten minutes, just to push a stone statue down, when I made the acid to dissolve some metal (WHICH WOULD TAKE A WHILE BY THE WAY) just to find out there was no metal!  Was this game translated from Russian in Google Translate?  Because it definitely seems that way!\nTl;dr of this wall o text; gameplay is repetitive, purposely padding out, and overall horrible.\n\nIt seems with every horror/walking simulator that wants to be the next Amnesia in success and fame, I find fundamental flaws that seem to either stem from the developer not giving a ♥♥♥♥, not having the power or brain to write a story on par with the original Amnesia or graphically create something appealing to look at while simultaneously being nasty, when steampunk is actually a very wonderful theme for this game, so is silent hills kind of deadness and rusty look at places (even if I didn’t like machine for pigs it did have that aesthetic PERFECT at places, and I admit that much)\nOverall I had basically nothing to enjoy, the music was kind of drowned out by the constant thud of walking everywhere and I was too annoyed by the game to really listen to It, but overall that was probably the only thing I found par or above par.\nSo I’ll now leave you all with my work of art “The Lantern Effect; a study of physics and view models”\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=665677433","April 14","false","2.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","8","15","3","0"

Yes the game features a lantern as your primary source of light, and yes it's set in a mad man's castle but nope this isn't Amnesia.\n\nThat's both a good thing and a bad. The game is a port of a mobile game (under a different name) and the port itself is actually really good. I had my suspicions but until I read into it I didn't know this was originally a mobile game. That brings me to the two main mechanics that caught my mobile port senses. First is a hint system which displays a HUGE green arrow over your objective and leads you there with a trail of fairy farts. The second is a shield which allows you to temporarily remove the enemies from the area. Both of these are optional but when used throws your immersion out of the window with a giant ball and chain. These two things not to mention the copious amounts of back tracking we're really the only things that bothered me about this game. Other than that it's a solid indie horror game which I completed in just under 3 hours. Is it worth the price? Well that's really personal choice as you could easily add another couple of hours searching for and reading through the various pieces of lore scattered about throughout the game. Let's put it this way I've played FAR worse indie horror games, but also much better ones.\n\nAnyway if you want to see the game in action check out my gameplay series of which I'll link the first part here.\nhttps://youtu.be/i1gIFmfskrg","April 11","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
