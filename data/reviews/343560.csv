"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Osharlock/recommended/343560/","Osharlock","UGC Osharlock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Osharlock/","169 products in account","Bob was Hungry is a difficult precision platformer which emphasises on a somewhat of a trial-and-error playstyle. The game seems very similar (if not almost identical) to the hit game "Super Meat Boy!" - With the exception that it is a different art-style, and of course 3D.\n\nThe game is incredibly challenging - I have been a platformer for years and was surprised to see some of the early levels be so difficult. However, after one or two failed attempts you can easily do the level. Some of the obstacles placed are in ways that you may not notice until you either land right next to it, or right into it - Highlighting the trial-and-error playstyle I mentioned.\n\nDespite it's difficulty, the game is incredibly forgiving. There is no life system, no punishment for dying and no setting you back - Instead you have a death counter in the top right, tracking how many times you died attempting that level. The death counter will stick on your personal best (If, of course, it was your personal best attempt) and will go down with further attempts.\n\nEach level has a secret "sauce" that must be found to complement the main dish at the end of the level. It isn't needed to complete it, but it adds an extra reason to explore levels and take more risks if you're a completionist.\n\nI would recommend this to seasoned platformers and to people who are looking for a humourous yet challenging game.","August 19, 2015","true","1.1"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","20","28","2","0"

Some levels are nigh-impossible to complete on the first go without dying because you simply can't see the spikes until a nano-second before you land on them. That's what makes Super Meat Boy so great. It's 100% fair. If you die, it's because YOU messed up. Not because you couldn't see the spikes until you landed on them. There are several instances in this game of Bob getting hidden behind a tree or the camera angles hides him behind a wall... That you're trying to climb... And then when you finally emerge from behind the tree or wall, surprise! Spikes! Much of this could be avoided simply by zooming out the camera a little more. Not all of it, obviously, but maybe 85-90% which would be a huge deal.\n\nI've got 500+ hours in Super Meat Boy and have my personal best time in any% down to 21:43 so I don't think experience or skill is necessarily a problem in this case.\n\nBob Was Hungry doesn't get it all wrong though. Not at all. The speed is perfect and the controls are pretty tight. (Not perfect but certainly above average and good enough that they feel comfortable and you don't feel like you're fighting the controls rather than the levels.) The level design suffers a little from lack of flow so you have to stop and wait all the time — i.e. it doesn't feel like it was designed for speed (and neither does the mandatory condiment bottle which could go to hell for all I care) but overall it's very decent. I would argue that it still needs some work but the foundation is really good.\n\nI wish I could leave the review neutral because I would certainly recommend the game if a few of the biggest kinks get worked out, but in its current state I can't in good conscience recommend it to any platforming enthusiast.","August 20, 2015","false","1.3"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","17","28","0","1"

I am very pleased with my expectations of the game and it's exactly how I thought it would be.\n\nThe game is very challenging and addicting, you somewhat become used to seeing the ball get squished and shattered into pieces, but that doesn't leave a sour taste in your mouth in fact it just makes you feel determined to push forward. It feels very rewarding to finally get over a challenging set of obstacles and collect your plater at the end of each level.\n\nOne thing I think they should have added is a RGB Color Palette for the Custom Player Color instead of a slider, because at first glance you are not sure what you changing with the fact that the Use Custom Color option is disabled by default. However I do like how the player is situated in the background of the Customize screen and changes color upon selection, it feels really nice. I just think this screen could be more intuitive from the beginning.\n\nThe controls feel really nice using a keyboard, some platform style games can give you a feeling that you must plug a controller in as it's so difficult to navigate around, this doesn't. However using a controller did feel a little better, so if you don't have a controller to play with this game, it's still very playable and doesn't leave you frustrated.\n\nThe camera tracking is ok, in certain areas it feels like it's too low but nothing that is annoying to the point where it's really spoiling the gameplay.\n\nGraphics are nothing to be amazed about but don't disappoint and are perfect for this style of game, simple yet appropriate.\n\nGame performance is very smooth, very optimized no dips at all, 300fps+ on a MSI R9 280 3GB card. I feel this was a good point to make as you have to be very accurate with your movements sometimes to avoid spikes and close falls.\n\nI have not had a chance to try the COOP out as I don't have any other friends who own it. The game uses its own servers to bypass firewall restrictions which is neat, but it is noted that if their servers go down then you might need to Port Forward.\n\nOverall if you're looking for a challenging and addicting platform game that you can play with up to 8 friends then definitely add this to your shortlist of games to buy.\n\nIf I had to rate my experience with the game I'd give it an 8/10.","October 17, 2015","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

I honestly didn't know it was possible to die 300 times in a game. Bob was Hungry has some great vibrant colours and some areas have some fantastic music (not so much a fan of the space music). The f**king meatballs have eyebrows and blink though, that scares me a little.\n\nBob was hungry is a platformer on the same caliber of rediculous as super meat boy, the puzzles just get harder and harder until you want to cry yourself to sleep.\n\nAlthough there is co-op to this game it doesn't exactly add anything except the possibility to have a seperate spawn point instead of back to the start, this leads me to believe that you'd almost be better off never playing single player and going in with a second controller to use as a check point. Because honestly restarting half these levels from the start is a little over the top, especially when you're as bad as me at video games.\n\nThe co-op could also do with some of its own levels, giving it a proper co-op feeling; rather than just "lets run through and maybe we'll have fun being stuck together" I'd much prefer a "you step on this button while i step on this one" kinda thing, but alas every pushable button only needed one person.\n\nHard difficulty made me want to cry when i loaded up the first space level and I don't enjoy sitting there fighting the elements of a game trying to proceed. The fact that the 10% chance you have of really doing anything on some stages is lowered to about a .5% chance and just makes it unbelievable unfun.\n\nI can see how this game would be really addictive to someone who enjoyed this kind of thing, but for me personally it was too much of a challenge and I don't think there'll ever be a time where I'd be able to go back and complete some of the levels I couldn't even get past the spawn.\n\nIf you'd like a quick look at what this game is and how difficult and fun and exciting and funky this game can be I've made a quick gameplay video for those interest.

Between those layers there seems to be a huge gap which makes it boring to watch at.\n\nSound (4/10)It was fun listening to the soundtrack in the first half an hour. Sometimes it was even motivating. Buter after 30 minutes it just got annoying. So I decided to go to the customizing screen and tried to turn the music off, but what?. Looks like I have to beat every level on normal in a specific stage to turn the sound for this stage only off.\nSo all I could do is go to my Windows Sound Settings and disable sound output for the application.\n\nGameplay (6/10)The game is tagged and described as challenging platformer which is just fine. Pretty much it looks like it is inspired from the very good platformer "Super Meat Boy". The challenges in "Bob Was Hungry" mainly consist of jumping into the unknown and maybe you get lucky and pressed the correct controls. This is the main flaw I saw here in this game. If you fail its because you either play the level for the first time and didn't know what will outside the screen or you are playing this level over and over again, but it's just too hard to know where you will land exactly or where the moving spike will be, when you get to the landing spot.\n\nTo be able to unlock the hard mode of  specific level you have to do an additional objective. Hidden somewhere in the level there is always a bottle which must be collected. Only if you successfully pick the bottle up and reach the platter (the exit) your time will be saved and the hard mode is unlocked. If you don't collect the bottle you will not be able to beat your own highscore.\n\nCompleting a level will reward you with one food item. Collecting the bottle and completing the level will reward you with two food items. Those are picked random, so if you want to complete every level with every food item as a reward you have to play the level over and over again.\n\nWhat I am missing though is a leaderboard. Of course I can see my own highscore but what is the reason for an highscore if I cannot compare it to the highscore of my friends.\n\nPositive is that there are a huge amount of levels that can be played.\n\nControls (8/10)First I was using keyboard controls to play the game because the game did not recognized my gamepad. But replaying today I found the settings where you can calibrate your controler. You even can remap all the buttons to a layout you are very comfortable with.\n\nWhat I have my difficulties are the lag between pressing a button on the gamepad or keyboard until the character is moving. Especially when you make long jumps into nowhere and have to react very fast because of moving spikes or other evil things.\n\nResult (6.25/10)There are just too many flaws I would like to see to be improved. This is why I cannot recommend it to my friends at this point, but maybe if some things get fixed I will change my review.","August 23, 2015","false","3.3"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","12","23","2","1"

On normal, this game seems more like a Mario game than Super Meat Boy. If they made a sequel, and fleshed it out with powerups and baddies, I would play the crap out of that. If Super Meat Boy is your thing, you'll love the hard mode. Hard mode is definitely a challenge and more indicative of that type of gameplay. It does take a second to respawn from death, so it loses a couple points there. If you're going to die often, it's best to respawn instantly. The camera is also pretty frustrating on hard. Not enough to warrant a pass on the whole game, but the developers have placed a bit too much emphasis on form over function here. Some spikes and traps are hidden from view because the camera is at an angle. Nitpcking aside, probably the best $1.50 I've spent in ages!","February 7","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's well executed and the camera is mostly well-placed.\n\nThe graphics and the odd food theme are perhaps a bit of a weak point, but who really cares when it's this much fun.

It's very zoomed in and if you're hoping to move quickly good luck seeing what's ahead of you.\n\nSecond the controls feel very floaty. I found traps a breeze to avoid while platforms were easily the most challenging thing to land on. Jumping from block to block shouldn't be hard because the controls just kinda float you past it. And traps shouldn't be tough because you can't see them.\n\nI didn't try the online mode but other folks seem to have really enjoyed that part of the game. If it's on for super cheap and you love platformers then yeah grab it but I'm a huge fan of the genre and I couldn't bring myself to want to keep playing even for an hour.

FyreNyxie Here!\n\nBob Was Hungry gets a 3/5\n\n-Graphics: Good graphics. However, the 3D aspect of the environment can get in the way and block your view.\n\n-Sound: Cute little music to match the cute little ball of... whatever he is.\n\n-Story: It's a platformer what story are you looking for here? He's out of food and he's hungry. Go find food.\n\n-Single-player/Multiplayer: Both, but NO local co-op.\n\n-Controls: Simple controls, but the odd feeling of low gravity takes some getting used to and the jumping doesn't feel as responsive as i'd like it to be. There were plenty of times where I landed and wanted to immediately jump again but didn't and my bob fell to his death.\n\n-Setting: I wish there were more exotic levels since your Bob is supposedly traveling to different planets in search of food. The areas I've been all look like they could just be on Earth.\n\n-Characters: Just the one hungry Bob character that you can make whatever color you want.\n\n-Gameplay: Fun and challenging.\n\n-Customization: Not much to customize, but you are able to turn your Bob into whatever color you want.\n\n-Dialogue/Well-Written: N/A\n\n-Tutorial: Yes, the first couple levels go over the basics and it's very simple.\n\n-Other: I don't like the food combinations. On each level, if you want to complete the level 100%, there are six different food combinations of three food and two condiments that you have to get. However, you don't search the level for all six. Instead, you have have to collect the condiment in the level somewhere and you get the food at the end of the level and hope you get a combination you need. Furthermore, to record your time on the level you have to acquire that condiment item. That proved to be way too much repitition for me. Once I defeated the level I didn't want to replay at least five more times, and that's not including all of my deaths, to get the other combinations.\n\n-Worth the price tag: I would maybe wait for it to go on sale, but definitely get it on sale if you're going to buy multiples since there's no local co-op.\n\nHave Fun Gamers!","May 24","true","5.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It bumps it up to a whole new level being able to play it multiplayer. I've spent nights just sitting in Discord with my friends laughing our asses off trying to get through some of the more challenging levels. This is a great game to play with friends.","March 29","true","11.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
