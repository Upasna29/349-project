"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Elgalad/recommended/344850/","Elgalad","Elgalad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Elgalad/","1258 products in account","This game was a little bit of a surprise..  I don't usually get much into tycoon type games, though I have fond memories of Theme Hospital from a few years back, and I guess Rollercoaster Tycoon, so my experience isn't great to compare this to others in the genre.   That being said, I find this game a great deal of fun.\n\nThere are two core elements to the game;  a Logistical puzzle, and, a decent strategic/business simulator.  I'll cover these separately.\n\nThe first part is what you mostly see in the pretty screenshots - you need to construct assembly lines that transform raw biological substances (insect parts, plants, etc) into finished pharmaceuticals.   There are a good number of different medicines you can manufacture and each one has vastly different requirements.  You need to purchase a variety of machines to transform the product as it moves along the belt from the 'in window' to the exit.   Some machines strengthen effects and some dilute them.  Other machines are used to combine two ingredients, to analyze a finished drug, to modify or rearrange effects, and to package the final product.  All of these machines have different 'in' and 'out' slots that will need to be matched up via conveyor belts in the correct order.   At first this can be a little daunting and frustrating, especially when you attempt to 'upgrade' a drug to a more powerful version, and some trial and error is required.   That said, it's great fun once you learn the basics, and quite rewarding when you smooth everything out.\n\nThe second part of the game is the business sim.  This is probably standard fare for these types of games, but again I'm not experienced enough to provide a good comparison.  In order to succeed you'll need to carefully manage your expenses - buildings and expansions, machines, drug ingredients, research, and exploration all require money, and while you can take out loans, this will quickly sink you if you don't have steady cashflow coming in.   There are competitors who are trying to make a profit as well, and deciding which drugs will provide the best returns can be a challenge.  You must invest time and money into research in order to unlock better machines and make your existing ones more efficient.  You also must send explorers out to discover new substances that can be transformed or combined into new types of drugs.  Random events can have impact on supply and demand as well, so it pays to keep an eye on news popups.\n\nThere is a good tutorial, which introduces you to game concepts as you play so you don't get overwhelmed.  After that, a series of 'missions' of advancing difficulties keeps the game fresh.   I can't speak to the replayability of the game as I'm nowhere near completing the core missions yet, but I believe there Is a sandbox mode once you've mastered all the basics.  The missions themselves can take from 15 minutes to a couple hours, depending on the difficulty and how focused you are.\n\nBig Pharma's art style can be described as cartoony and colorful.  It really reminded me of a less silly version of theme hospital, but aside from the graphics (and upbeat music) there aren't may other similarities between these two games.  One nice feature is the ability to 'paint' your factory - with various primary hues and patterns.  This could be useful to customize different product lines or processes on each line, or just pretty things up to your own tastes.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who enjoys casual business sims and puzzles.  Big Pharma succeeds well at both, and I found it well worth the price of 24.99, though I was fortunate enough to get it on sale.\n\n","August 30, 2015","true","22.6"," 135 of 150 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","135","150","6","1"

Unfortunately, the logistics puzzles and business simulation don't really play off of each other well, and the game quickly becomes tedious.\n\nThe two halves of the game don't play well together. The logistics lines are a little bland and mostly come down to twiddling the concentration of a drug up, then down, then up again to evolve its attributes and get them to the right concentration. This might be more fun if you could go whole-hog laying out a complicated production line, but the business side of things ensure that's generally unprofitable. Everything operates at just a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio, so there's no thrill of big, powerful throughput like you get with a massive Factorio setup or a speedy Spacechem reaction.\n\nThe business level isn't that interesting, either. Your profit is dependent on the efficiency and margin of your manufacturing lines. Sometimes competitors will interfere by saturating your drug's market, which reduces your profits. Often, a competitor will beeline patent technology just to force you to replace your best drug every other year. That's just annoying. It's also your chief source of waiting, as you twiddle your thumbs waiting for the next ingredient or technology to unlock.\n\nThe GUI is also a bit of a chore. You'll frequently be flipping back and forth between the "Ingredients" and "Cures" tabs to try to figure out what steps you need to evolve your drugs, which ingredients provide the desired attributes, and finally what concentration you'll sell it at, and whether competitors are saturating the market.\n\nThere are some clever things. Sometimes you will sell a drug with a bad side-effect profile just because it's not profitable to sell a more refined form of the drug. Or maybe your drug will be too effective and demand will go down, or maybe your one drug's side effects will drive sales for another drug. These are all twiddly little fringe cases, and they're not cause enough to keep me playing.","November 7, 2015","false","8.4"," 210 of 252 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","210","252","7","4"

While it's not like actual pharmaceutical research and development, it does capture the essence of drug development (evaporation, distilling, different excipients) and does it while keeping things interesting.\n\nThe minute-to-minute small puzzles of configuring everything in a small space, managing price, pushing for the next-best-thing (or not, if it's more profitable to flood the market with cheap, side-effect heavy medications), and monitoring the competition are all pleasingly done. You're allowed to set your own pace and customize your challenge through a wide variety of options, missions, and randomization of ingredients.

Maybe YOU are the guy curing Ebola, getting rich and famous?\n- Research new ingredients, new cures, new machines, new developments, new production methods\n- Send your scouts and scientists on month-long missions to find that rare beetle somewhere in the Arctic ice or learn how to use that new technology you need to unlock a fourth or fifth level of an ingredient.\n- Expand, start with new ingredients, new cures, do it all over again!\n\nIt's a sandbox game and feels a lot more like Transport Tycoon or Infinifactory than Theme Hospital, you have your input (a plant, an insect, any kind of biological source), you refine it, mix it, filter it, strengthen or weaken specific effects, create a smooth running cycle with dozens of machines or steps in between, then export it as a medication in various forms. Pills or syringes? All your choice. Then you get rid of the side-effects, mix in other incredients, improve, get your A+ cure out and feel proud!\n\nPlay with or without competition, maybe you just like to make it look good and not fight with other companies?

The game is more or less about completing scenario's with tiers of set goals and two months ago I made a rather long post on /r/bigpharmagame that explained why it's not done very good well overall.\n\nThe short version is basically everything you need is random. The amount of space you start to build in is random, the drug effects you start with are random, the effects on those drugs are random, the order you unlock new drugs is random, the products your competitors will make are random. The only non-random things are how much money you start with and your overall goal for the scenario. Which leads to many many MANY unwinnable situations, e.g; It's possible to play a scenario were you have to produce certain medicines within a certain time period and random chance will put the drug you need so far down the research list that there's no possible way to even get to it let alone produce anything with it before the time expires.\n\nTo put it into something that most people would understand; pretend your playing StarCraft 2 but the amount of SCV's you started with was random, so was the amount of vespene geysers, mineral patches and how much was in them.  With me so far? So YOU might start with 2 SCV's, 4 vespene geysers and 3 mineral patches, while your opponent starts with 10 SCV's, 2 vespene geysers and 20 mineral patches. Now ontop of that also make all the unit costs and research a random number as well. Do you see why this is bad now?\n\nIt's basically a requirement to restart a scenario over and over again til you get the space and favorable drugs you need if you plan on getting anything but the bronze completion. Even if you get a favorable start, you still might need to end up restarting anyway because you may have had 2 of the drugs you needed for the 3 pills you had to produce but sadly #3 is the very last one your explorers can find.\n\nOverall it's what killed the game for me. If there was set drugs with set effects with set starting positions on the board then I wouldn't have had nearly any of the complaints I did. But overall you spend more time restarting then actually playing the game unless your content to bust your ♥♥♥ for bronze the whole way through, riding the waves of luck.\n","August 27, 2015","false","13.7"," 470 of 665 people (71%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","71","470","665","28","50"

It's not a simulation of medical pills and pharma companies, and it certainly is not a game about the overall management of such a company or the simulation of such a thing.\n\nIt makes promises that it can not keep. You will get little strategy, severely abstracted simulation, and very limited management. 'Big Pharma' is not about anything big at all.\n\nInstead, it is a small scale game that is essentially a puzzle about optimising chains of machines to produce a desired output, in a randomised building area of random size, with random ingredients that have random effects. If you like that, then good for you. You will probably enjoy this one, but for the rest of us who are after the other 'features' it proclaims to have..\n\nThe simulation is basic to the point where I wonder if it is a simulation at all. Diseases have a set number of sufferers or a set cycle/increase of sufferers and your management is limited purely to the supply lines, machines, and conveyor belts. Everything else is abstracted to the degree that I wonder why it was even included in the game, and many times adds nothing except a timer you need to wait on before you can continue working your belts.\n\nThe challenge, and main gameplay is more alike a puzzle.\nFit machines in the (random) building you have to have your (random) ingredients produce an optimal effect for maximum profit. Nearly all the gameplay is about optimising your conveyor belts and machines, which will be frustrating to you because the machines come only in one form with 4 facings. You can not make a symmetrical and effective supply line, and conveyors can not go over or under eachother. You get a limited amount of (Randomly placed) input/output areas to connect to, and often you will not have space for just about anything more than a basic machine.\nEmployees never have to walk in, out, or do anything in your building, they are merely an animation that is part of the machine. Research and exploration happens somewhere else. You never see your scientists or explorers except in a menu where you send them out.\n\nIf this game was only purely the production tab, was honest about its size and content and somewhere between 5-10 dollars, then it would be great. But as it currently stands I just can not reccommend it for its price.\nThe conveyor belt optimising puzzling is nice, and I will likely play it a few more times just for that, but that is all there is to the game. There is no 'improving the lives of millions', there is no 'getting rid of disease', there is no real management or simulation of a 'pharmaceutical conglomerate' here. The challenge scenarios are jokes, the rival corporations are jokes, and the whole 'business sim' part that it talks about in the "About This Game" part of the store are jokes.\n\nThis is a conveyor belts puzzle with shiny graphics, get it for that if it is ever at a 75% or even 50% sale, but as long as it stays above 10 euro/dollar, I recommend avoiding it.","September 2, 2015","false","17.8"," 161 of 212 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","161","212","4","11"

Your competition is supposed to be another company or group of companies, however, as long as you're turning a profit it doesn't really matter.  You are given objectives to meet and once you get the hang of it, they're pretty easy.  Your competition doesn't seem to affect much.  There are more punishing game modes (start with debt, etc) but honestly the reward of "winning" isn't enough to even contemplate another run through this game.\n\nThe biggest adversary in the game is the whole researching and combining platform.  There are maybe 12 things to research, so this has already become exhausting and a chore.  It just has to be done and there is no thought needed.  I've found myself "waiting" far too often.  One of the biggest draws for me for business simulations is the complete micro-managing which ensures you always have something to do, that does not apply to this game.\n\nThere is a puzzle element to this game that I'm not sure it needs.  It's more annoying than anything.  I suppose if you're really into maximizing space you could enjoy it but it's much easier to just buy a few expansion spots and build what you need in an empty space and not worry about it.  I think planning your factory floor would be more enjoyable if the inputs / outputs of your machinery were customizable.  As it stands you have 5 of the same machine on a line all outputting in the same direction and you just get a maze of belts.  It's asthetically unpleasant and tedious.\n\nI don't know how many more times I'll play this game.  Maybe a few run throughs here and there.  I've had much more fun with smaller / cheaper sims like Game Dev Tycoon.\n\nIf / when the workshop comes to this game I think it will be worth a second look.

The concepts are awesome and they're off to a good start, but the gameplay just doesn't deliver enough enjoyment.  The game's systems are very complex, and the main problem the game suffers from is the interface.  The information you need to find out in order to make effective choices is arranged in a very arcane and dispersed fashion.  This leaves you with two choices: 1) Play the entire game alternating between Play and Pause, and spend most of the game looking for information while Paused, or 2) Discover all the information you need AND engage in critical thinking while Playing, at which point, the situation will have changed so much that you need new information and a refinement of your original plan.\n\nWhat this means is, the gameplay just doesn't deliver enough of a hands-on feel so that you feel real control over the game's systems, and over your chosen outcomes.  But it's one of those games that gives you enough tiny little dopamine-buzzers (Dings, music, sounds, green profit text, etc.) to fool you into thinking you're having a good time and keep you hooked.\n\nBut after you play for 4 hours, you're just left with kind of a "blah" feeling.\n\nIf they made the interface more concrete and less arcane, the game would have a better feel, ie.

If you place a conveyer it costs you $100, and if you then destroy it you only get $50 back, even if you did it right away! If perhaps the game only charged you upon unpausing the game, then perhaps you could go nuts building everything without fear of going broke due to mistakes.\n\nI felt like the random elements in the game did not offer enough variability in how you play the game.

I had a sneaky suspician that this was going to be a good game (from what I'd researched prior to its launch), but I was surprised to find that it was much better than I had expected.\n\nSee the TL;DR read section at bottom if you want just the quick notes.\n\nI'm trying to keep the in-depth review as brief as possible, but it's very difficult...there's so much to say about this game.\n\nThe Good\n1. GAMEPLAY\n\nYou start, grow, and manage a pharmaceutical company. You control every aspect of it such as production lines, research and development, budget (purchases, importing ingredients, payroll, cost of production), meeting market demand, etc. This is a pharmaceutical tycoon game and it gives you plenty of options and features to run the business as you please or win a scenario as you please.\n\nDesigning the production floor is like a puzzle...but I really hate using that word. It's not a puzzle game. You have to make use of the space you are given (which is a lot so far for me) and plan workflow, but it's much more than that. There are options upon options to consider  The game can be very complex at times, but it also allows the player to keep things simple if they so choose.\n\nThere are 8 Scenarios with 5 missions each. Some missions are specific, some are rather broad.  There's also a custom game feature and a free build option. Together, they allow the player to really play as they want. You can develop highly sophisticated medications or you can deal with simple production lines. It's entirely up to you!\n\n\n2. THE GAME IS POLISHED!\n\nUnlike many indie games, particularly with early access but not exclusive to them, this game is extremely...I mean extremely polished. Everything was very well thought out and organized. Key features were included yet nothing seems to exist that doesn't need to be. ALL the necessary fundamentals you'd expect are here (rare for many games today unfortunately), but many are done exceptionally well and are thus, quite noteworthy.\n\nExamples...\n\nOne of the best tutorials I've ever seen in a game - it comes in the form of sections and are repeatable (for those of us who sometimes take a hiatus from a game then return later but forget some of the key controls/mechanics). There are also more in-depth tutorial videos by the dev for those who prefer some serious explanation as to what is going on (most probably won't need it though). The tutorial not only gives you the basics and walks you through the steps (allowing you to learn by doing vs reading a wall-o-text in game), it gives you game strategies such as using dual pill printing and options for varying concentration effects). A lot of thought went into the tutorial here.\nSpeed controls - should be standard in every game of this sort...but unfortunately many aren't including it. Pause, play, or speed up time here.\nEase of controls - you can hold down key to drag belts and it will auto path and connect where you want. Middle mouse copies an existing machine for further placement, double click allows you to move an existing machine, right click sells a machine.\nConvenient linking from one page or pop up to a RELEVANT page or place in the game (such as a an alert for new ingredient having a link to take you to the Ingredients page for convenience if you so choose)\nAnimations are very well done and relevant to what is happening (fun to watch)\nAesthetic customizer - change colors of belts and floors, you can customize your buildings the way you want.\nContemporary design - very well done design with the gui and game assets. Details like in-game notices are done very well too (sliding from the side at top of page vs simply popping up in the middle of the page or displaying on the right hand side which is what most games seem to do).\nLastly, one of the biggest parts of polish which was noticed...was the lack of any bugs!  I am despearately trying to find some. I know some have to exist. But I so far, have failed to discover any. The game runs smooth and there are no bugs that break immersion or stop gameplay.\n\nThe dev did what most other devs do not do today it seems...he focused on QUALITY. He put a substantial amount of time into the game PRIOR to released. He focused on giving customers a QUALITY project to enjoy by making sure the details were there but also that the game works as it is supposed to. He demonstrated that he actually cares about his own game, his own work.\n\nNovel idea huh? Give the players a quality product they expect to have?\n\n3. DEV ACTIVITY\n\nFirst of all, this is the work of only 1 developer. He, like most devs used outside sources for assets (graphics, sounds, effects, voice), but 1 guy is the brain behind this game. Very few games can be pulled off successfully by a single dev and this one was.\n\nHe also is very active in his communication with customers (his own forum, social media, and here at the Steam forums).\n\n\nTHE BAD\nI am still struggling to find something. I honestly am. I've not experienced anything negative about this game yet.\n\nThe only thing I can see wanting to change, is a part in the last tutorial which discusses maximum strength analysis and how to implement it to upgrade a medicine's rating. To me, that's a bit fuzzy. I tried to understand what was being described and how to pull it off, but didn't understand it. That could just be me though. Regardless, it does not prevent the mission from being completed. It just means the user, or me anyway, needs to ask for clarification on the forum.\n\nSUMMARY / TL;DR\nHigh quality game, extremely polished, plenty of options and features, a lot of variation, NO BUGS (so far). This game will probably become one of the standards of quality that gamers will compare other games to (like many compare other ea games to Prison Architect or Kerbel).\n\nIn a sea of poorly designed games from devs who don't seem to either care about their products or have the knowledge to make them great...and with the current gaming community's frustration level at an all-time high due to the abundance of bad games and ripoffs coming out on Steam...let this game refresh your faith and trust in the industry as it is proof that high quality games CAN be delivered and some devs DO care about their project and their customers.\n\nIf you enjoy tycoon style games, do yourself a much deserved favor and GET THIS GAME NOW! You will not regret it (especially with Steam's refund policy of course - but you won't need it).","August 27, 2015","true","19.3"," 93 of 135 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","93","135","3","2"

But it focuses more on production process then profit. It is safe to say Big Pharma is a game about creating an efficient production line to achieve your (scenario) goal.\n\nThe game has a tutorial, but instead of (usual) series of interactions, tutorial itself is actually a guide-like-text in “tutorial scenarios”. If player can follow the text, it is quite helping and explains the details to a certain degree. Still, for the first few games, it is highly expected that the player will revisit these tutorials. It is also worth noting that the game expects the player to have “planning skills” because it never mentions how a good/efficient layout should be.\n\nIn this game, player is given a set of machines, and a number of ingredients. Every ingredient has one curing effect and one to three bad side effects (There are 4 effect slots on each ingredient). Each effect on an ingredient is active on certain “concentration range” and is most effective at a certain concentration. This concentration and activation of effects are the elements that create the base of the game. The player is expected to create a production line using the given machines, to activate the positive effect on an ingredient and create a medicine. Of course, bad side effects are present and are to be avoided. Curing effects on the final medicine increase the value and side effects causes it to lose rating resulting in losing value.\n\nIllnesses and cure recipes are known, and when you produce a medicine, more advance version is unlocked, up to level 5 medicines. Although illnesses and cure recipes are known, ingredients are not. For each game, ingredients are randomly generated. Only things consistent among games are that each ingredient having only one curing effect and activation range of effects. From effect combinations to how much those effects change final medicine’s value is random. This increases replayability value. But it is also random for scenarios; therefore it affects the actual difficulty of the scenarios. One time the game may be too challenging and other time, it may be too easy.\n\nAnother randomly generated content is layout for production buildings. In each map, there are several (depending on the size of the map) partitioned buildings. The player is randomly given a partition at the beginning and buys the rest. The buildings and sockets are premade but layout of the buildings is random. Depending on the layout and starting position, the game may be annoying. Annoyance comes from shape of the buildings or the socket positions/count in a partition. Sockets are the points of entry/exit for the ingredients and medicines, on the walls of the buildings. Although there are at least 2 sockets in almost every partition, it can be more. Starting a partition with 4 sockets enables the player to have two production lines, without the need to but new partitions. Also a bad shaped building may prevent you to complete an advance production line required for the higher level medicines.\n\nThere are also exploration, research, patenting and “company management”. Research is the common knowledge. Player hires scientists to do research. Research unlocks new machines and some infrastructure projects such as cheaper machine prices or ability of exploring different types of lands. Exploration is the same thing as research but unlocks new ingredients instead. On a normal game, only the most basic machines and only 2 ingredients are available at the start. Rest is unlocked through researching and exploration. That said, researching and exploration are just a tab in the game and not the main focus. Same thing applies for the “company management”. Other than patenting process, company management is just an info tab showing player’s medicines, yearly revenue and profit. Also rivals’ basic info can be seen in company management. There is a research that enables to see detailed info about your rivals but it is pretty much useless. Patenting is what the name suggests. Patenting a medicine prevents the others from selling the same medicine for a limited time. The length of time depends on how much player chooses to spend on the patent.\n\nRivals in the game serve two purposes. One of them is to cause saturation because they use the same ingredient as the player and produce (mostly) the same medicine. This saturation increases the cost of ingredients and lowers the demand for a specific cure effectively lowering value of medicines. The other purpose is to patent medicine preventing the player to sell the same medicine. Of course the player has access to patenting after researching it too. This creates a nice “patent war” situation in the game, but patenting is pretty expensive and mostly not worth it until late game.\n\nAs with all of the production themed games, most of the time in the game will be spend in paused mode. The player will try to make a good choice of ingredient-medicine pair to avoid side effects. After that, he/she will spend an equal time to position each machine in a way that they will occupy the least space. Since it is the nature of the game it is not a bad thing. Still, it is worth noting that machines can only be rotated in 4 directions and belts (connections between the machines) can’t be multi-layered (although they can be crossed and it mostly works well). These limitations may annoy some people, but also some “puzzle people” may welcome them because it gives the production a puzzle feel.\n\nThe interface is very well designed and the player is never lost in it. It has a futuristic design and goes well with the game. The sound effects of the game are nice and do not bother the player. But the game is a bit quiet. It needs a few more soundtracks.\n\nFinally, a personal note: Everything in the game is sold back at half the original price. Especially at the beginning, you  may struggle with the design and make lots of mistakes. Buying and selling the belts will cause you to lose lots of money. To prevent this, plan and imagine the whole process in your mind, put all the machines first and then put the belts. It is also possible to get the “free belts” mod from the official site.\n\nPros:+ Simplistic: All menus and tabs are cleverly put together in a clear and simple manner.\n+ Good Formula: Game elements go well together.\n+ Fluent gameplay: There is nothing to get in the way during interaction with objects and interface.\n+ Mod Support: It does not support workshop but has a separate mod support.\n\nCons:- Randomization in Campaigns: This results in the campaigns becoming too easy or too hard.\n- Crammed Buildings: Sometimes building designs are too narrow or weirdly shaped and they do not allow a good production line.\n- Feels Repetitive: Although some of the content is randomized, after a while, the game feels repetitive due to its focus on production. This may be a deal breaker for some people.\n\nVerdict:If you think this game as a production tycoon game -as I did- it is well made (considering this is developed by a one-man-company). Overcoming the challenge to get rid of the bad side effects and creating a high rating medicine gave me enough satisfaction, so I recommend it. But because it focuses on production, it may be insufficient for some people.\n\nP.S: As a rule, I won't comment on price tag. Everyone has a different opinion on whether it is worth the price tag or not. So it is up to you to decide.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nEdit: Fixed some typos","September 13, 2015","true","23.6"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","35","43","2","5"

Getting these to work in a fluid manner (maximising profits) is quite challenging and requires a lot of trial and error so i highly recommend after the tutorial loading up the mode which has all the research and drugs unlocked so that you can play around and learn how to create a fluid setup of the machinery and adapt to the different building structures (there are only a few so even though its completely random you will get familiar with each one eventually).\n\nI did read alot of reviews before purchasing this game and a few mentioned the randomness of the drugs you recieve at the start of the game and size of the building being annoying/limiting the ability to play the game. However i dont think this is as much of an issue, the game seems fairly balanced and gives you plenty of time to complete scenarios regardless of the spawn. I can see the spawns being an issue if you are an achievment hunter who wants to complete all the levels on master (the time limit is much much less), however this can be worked around if you just restart the mission a few times so in my opinion the randomness is not a big deal for those who read those reviews and got worried that the game is broken.\n\nI also especially like the addition of a "global economy" aspect in relation to the competing companies whereby you need to ensure that the drugs you make are better than theirs by fine tuning them or you will not sell as many units loosing you money or manufacture ones that the ai have not considered thereby creating your own monopoly of the drug (can also be done by patents).\n\nAlso a must have are the mods for this game, only ones i have found so far are the ones supplied by the actual Big Pharma website, they are very useful (example free conveyor belts).\n\nOverall, great game, very challenging and i can see many hours of my life being eaten by it.","August 28, 2015","true","16.1"," 58 of 82 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","58","82","2","0"

Or perhaps you’re one of those that prefers saving lives to growing a bank account. Either way, your dream can now be a reality, or, well, a virtuality?\n\nAlcohol, tobacco, and pharmaceutical drugs are legal, but they can hurt a lot of people.\n\nZiggy Marley\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Big Pharma.\n\nGameplayAs a big time fan of management games, I couldn’t help but to take a look at Big Pharma, as it looked like it had everything it needed to be a great game. I couldn’t have been more wrong. It isn’t a great game. It’s a fantastic game. In reality, I should be playing right now, making some medication to cure everyone that doesn’t like the game.\nNot only will Big Pharma test your personality, it will also test your ability to efficiently organize a factory. There aren’t any shareholders to please, but there’s always the need to be the best, and save everyone, or at least keep their wallets.\nFrom preventing your opponents from producing a certain medication due to your patents, or even be stopped by your opponents with those same patents, to building massive lines that enable a super cure, you’ll find everything you need to have a good time right here.\nThere’s not much you can’t do in the game, except releasing diseases to help you improve your sales (there’s a suggestion right there!), so even if you’re having a bad day, you can always start the game and give all your customers bad blood pressure, or headaches, or anal leakage…\nBottom line is, Big Pharma is a fantastic management game, that offers some challenging scenarios, with some puzzle components, as well as need for a carefully planned development plan for the more challenging scenarios.\n\n\nPros The scenarios provide tons of hours of entertainment;\nAfter spending a good number of hours with the scenarios, you’ll have some more fun with the sandbox, providing even more hours of entertainment;\nCustomizable sandbox;\nThe challenges are, indeed, challenging, and a good way to progressively learn the game;\nSome of the side-effects might cause perpetual laughter;\nExtensive technology and ingredients trees;\nThe puzzle component of the game is also somewhat challenging, forcing the player to find the best way to save space as well as find the best combination for the line, in order to make more money;\nWide variety of ingredients, equipment, side-effects, even floor patterns;\nThe UI is very simple and easy to use;\nAbility to name your products, sounds simple, but it’s incredibly enjoyable;\nDespite not being an important part (for me at least), the graphics are pleasing;\nModding - just imagine the possibilities;\nThe developer is quite active on his forums.\nThere’s really nothing I can think of that’s negative per say, but, for those of you that might be somewhat perfectionists, there’s one small detail.\n\nCons Some of the equipment doesn’t accurately portray reality.\nVerdictI'd give it a 9.5/10, which could easily be a 10, with one or two additions, such as being able to bankrupt opponents, or even release diseases to improve sales (yes, we all know it’s true).","September 1, 2015","true","24.7"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","30","40","6","0"

It's charms and graphics are heavily leaning on THE definitive medical game of all times - Peter Molyneux's Theme Hospital.\n\nSo it has the looks, it has some of the charm, it has the management down and once you play a couple of games you will find that the AI scenarios (it comes with like 50 scenarios and also a very detailed custom scenario editor with import/export functionality) are a shark tank of competition, that reacts to your productions, aggressively researches and uses patents to shut down your profitable products etc.\n\nThe research is great.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sporkmonger/recommended/344850/","sporkmonger","Sporkmonger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sporkmonger/","1586 products in account","One of the best management simulators to come along in ages and ages.\n\nThere's a lot of complexity here and there's a bit of a learning curve, but the tutorial covers the bulk of what you need to know. Unfortunately, the format of the tutorial feels pretty lazy to me and it suffers for that. Namely, it's rendered almost as an in-game manual. The game really needed an overlay-style tutorial rather than "OK, now click this widget, whose location on screen we will now describe in words instead of just pointing at it." But that's seriously the only criticism of this game I've got and it's easily fixable if the developers wanted to put some time in on it. It's also an issue that you'll quickly forget about once you start getting the hang of things.\n\nSo basically, your job is to make drugs. Drugs need to cure things. Ideally with as few side-effects as possible. But critically, you need your drugs to be profitable. Everything you do to remove side-effects or analyze the ideal mixture and concentrations for your drug ingredients introduces processing costs, which lowers your profitability. Meanwhile your competitors are making drugs that may target the same conditions. If their drug has fewer side-effects, demand for your drug will drop, and with it, the price you can charge for it. Suddenly you have to go back and do all the work you maybe skipped in the interests of profits because your terrible drug was properly recognized in the market as terrible. Unless of course, you patent your drug. Competition sucks. Nobody wants competition.\n\nYou also have some interesting processing challenges around parallelizing the right parts of your pipeline while working within spacing and arrangement constraints. Actually, that's pretty much the core of the game. It's probably one-third budget management and two-thirds arrangement puzzle game that heavily informs the budget management aspect (bad arrangements are unprofitable).\n\nI'll be playing this one for quite awhile.\n\nHonestly, I could also see this game as being quite workable in a multiplayer format and I think multiplayer might be pretty fun. Since the game is moddable, it might even be possible for the community to supply that functionality.

Well, ok, every game gets repetitive - even life itself does - and Big Pharma is no exception. Still, you always get a rewarding sense of accomplishment when you see your production lines running efficiently, your drugs selling more than your competitors (and for a higher price) and when you get good trial reviews because you're a good man and ran the extra mile to make them patient-friendly. Also, every level has a different objective, and you can get a standard, expert or master "score" on each, depending on how fast (usually) you achieved your objective, and that keeps you on your toe every time, avoiding any mistakes to get your "master" rank in every level. You do, indeed, start every single level with the same formula (slight variations, but the same routine), but I find the game is still fun after 20+ hours playing it, mainly because achieving the master rank in the toughest levels is a good challenge.\n\n2 - The "managing aspect" isn't a big part of the game - Again, I disagree. You absolutely need the money aspect, and it fits the game perfectly in my opinion. You must keep your drugs (and their sales rating, if you have the DLC, which I recommend) profitable, your income on the green, to be able to keep going. You must beat your competitors (and fast) or they'll end up showering you with patents and taking a huge share of the market, diminishing your sales. You gotta be careful with the loans you get so their interest don't end up eating all of of your profits, and also balance how many explorers/scientists you have - and what they are currently working on - to keep enough cash flowing in and your company, again, ahead of the competition. In my opinion, the management aspect works perfectly with the puzzle/logistic facet of Big Pharma. It's a double-fun experience, specially if you're the type of person who enjoys both things.\n\nI think that covers most of the "thumbs down" this game has received.\n\n***\n\nAbout the DLC:\n\nIf you liked the base game, you'll like the DLC. It adds some neat new features (check the DLC's steam page for specifics.)\n\n***\n\nOn a serious note / Something special about this game:\n\nThere's a very interesting and particular side to Big Pharma: it opens your eyes for how the REAL "Big Pharma Industry" works, or at the very least it makes you think about it.\n\nIn this game, you can leave side-effects on drugs on purpose (and regulate their, as well as the cure's, strenght as you will) to keep demand for some of your other drugs (those that treat such side effects) up high. You can patent your drugs to get a temporary monopoly of a market's share and raise your prices up to the sky. With the DLC, you can run trials on your drugs and deliberately disqualify the bad results to trick the consumers and raise  your sales. You... see where I'm going with this.\n\nAfter playing this game, one must wonder: "Dude... this can totally be done for real. Maybe real companies do this kind of stuff." Then you keep thinking about it and... "Why wouldn't they? Well... maybe they have principles, and goodness in their heart. Maybe they want to help people." But wait... we're talking about some of the (if not THE) richest people in the world, people you never heard about, people whose names no one knows. People who torture lab animals on a daily basis, who tested prototype-drugs on jew prisoners during Hitler's Reich. People who profit from the suffering of the sick and weakened, and make a living extorting the dying. People who steal an old guy's economies dry under false promises of an unlikely cure (**Google "cancer" here**).\n\nFinally, you'll find yourself concluding: "Man... screw polititians, mexican cartels, weapon dealers and african warlords. Big Pharma - that's the real nemesis of mankind."\n\nI just read that Johnson & Johnson was just condemned to pay and indemnification of 55 million dolars to a woman because one of their talc powders gave her cancer. The doctors had to remove her ovary, and it was literally lined with talc. And that's a second (at least) for them because, months ago, they had to pay 72 million to another woman for the same reason.\n\nIf this example and reason alone aren't enough for you, Google "Big Pharma" or any company's specific name (Johnson & Jhonson, Pfizer, etc.) and read for yourself.\n\nWhat I know is I'm never taking any medicine again unless it's strictly necessary (AKA I'm in heavy, constant pain). If you keep thinking about all this stuff, it's easy to see how far these companies can/could/do go to take your money (like an infinite chain of side-effects and their temporary-with-more-side-effects treatments). Seriously, we are on the "genetic mapping age", how hard can it be for trillionaires (the Big Pharma industry generates a trillion dolars per year) to cut off side effects and balance a drug's components if they want to? Damn, even I can do it, according to Big Pharma (the game).\n\n***\n\nConclusion:\n\nBig Pharma is a very nice game. It gives you a sense of reward every time you score a "master" on the tough levels and that's the raw thing every game aims for. If you like puzzle/management games, I'd say this one should keep the average guy entertained for 30-40 hours, maybe more (it took me 70 hours just to get "Master" on all the levels in "Advanced" and beyond). That's good value for your money, and this is the kind of game that you start playing at 6pm, play for one or two hours straight, quit, and realizes it's already 11pm.\n\nIf you're concerned about the negative reviews (I always and seriously take them into account myself), maybe you can wait for a sale, but I really don't think you'll regret your purchase at full price, as long as you understand what the game is like (the screenshots alone can give you a fair idea) and feel you are going to enjoy it - the game's execution itself is great, that is not going to disappoint you.\n\nEDIT: btw, I never got a single bug or crash whatsoever.\n\nEDIT 2: ok, now the game has crashed once, after 45 hours or so.\n\nEDIT 3: I just found out that this game was made by ONE dude, alone. That always baffles me (Terraria was also made by a single guy, if I'm not mistaken). I, myself, can barely get dressed on my own, so... congratulations Tim, amazing job.","May 3","true","65.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","16","17","3","8"

The Advanced Mode's machines, along with the Centrifuge from Intermediate, radically increase the ways in which you can manipulate ingredients. It's also much harder to make and maintain a large profit, especially since competitors play a much greater role in the Advanced Mode. You'll need to start utilizing some hidden optimization tricks involving things like the packer or crossing belts with machines that have a cycle time greater than 1. So while dead-simple machine placement will get you through the Beginner and some of the Intermediate Scenarios, reaching Master in the Advanced Scenarios requires a lot more thought.\n\nThe negative reviews for this game have some merit, but the game doesn't promise anything more than it delivers. What this game does, it does very well: designing and optimizing production lines, anticipating what the market for a drug will bear, deciding what ingredients and machines to research or upgrade, all while balancing a budget that is very tight early and expands greatly over time. It's a beautifully-animated game that presents a relaxed puzzle atmosphere and gives you almost all of the information you'll need up-front.\n\nLet's get some things out of the way, though. Sick people are abstractions, which is honestly what I'd expect from most Pharmaceutical companies. The larger the market for a cure, the greater the relative price and the more of that cure you can produce without tanking the price. The market can increase or decrease as a result of random world events, increase naturally over time for infectious diseases, and decrease as people are cured. A cure that's particularly potent will fetch a much higher price, but you may eventually be left without a viable market for that product.\n\nThe available cures and how they're upgraded are static. The starting concentration of an ingredient has a fairly narrow range based on the range of the Level 1 cure. The number of plots available for purchase, and the sockets within each building layout, are predetermined. On the other hand...The ingredient order is random, side effects are assigned semi-randomly, the building layouts you get are random, and the market for each cure is random within a small range. This can make or break the profitability of several cures, but the Level 1 cure of every starting ingredient is profitable and smart research choices can dig you out of some terrible early setups. Even a terrible cure can fetch a profit, although it can be much lower than you'd get from a perfect cure.\n\nAnyone who says that the Competitors are pointless was playing on one of the easier difficulties. The competition presents a real challenge in Advanced Mode, as you have 3 competitors that all have the same early options that you do. Different AI companies prioritize different things, but they'll usually go for the more profitable cures and cures that can fetch high ratings (ie, no side effects). You have to be smart with your market choices in Advanced because the AI will very quickly oversaturate and tank the price for several cures. Anticipating what your competition will do is a big factor in your success. Patents in particular can really help you or really screw you over in the short-term, although they're fairly easy to work around, but you can do the same thing to the AI. Mucking with the AI's profit margins can really slow them down, giving you a chance to reach (and patent) the very high-level cures before they get a chance to ruin your market.\n\nSometimes you can make just plain bad choices, but usually there's okay options and really great options. There's almost always something you can optimize more if you put thought into it, and if you're shooting for a certain level of revenue or profit you'll be shifting around production lines a lot. I used to hit patches where I'd just need to wait, but now patch 1.01 added a much-needed 5x speed option!\n\nPersonally, I love this game. The progression has a level of predictability that may put some people off, but the random elements that people keep complaining about actually keep things fresh.","September 3, 2015","true","58.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","1"

Luckily, that's not the case.\n\nThere's far enough depth to raise the game well over the "casual" category. At the same time, its elements are completely transparent, so it doesn't overwhelm you with complexity. It could rather overwhelm you with opportunities. If you enjoy putting your brain to some work, this is a game a doctor would prescribe.\n\nShortly, it perfectly touches the same strings that was touched by good old tycoons you are fond of, adds a surprisingly relevant puzzle element, and flavors the mix with good city sim's spirit of careful planning & continuous improvement. For details, look below.\n\nPART 1. MAKING DRUGS\nYour goal is to create medicines and make money of them. A complex, profitable medicine usually consists of several components. Making such medicine usually takes many steps: starting an initial mix from a single ingredient and processing the mix through the chain of machinery, changing its concentration and adding other components (in specific order and specific concentrations). Each ingredient has some positive and negative effects. Effects are not just simple "+" or "-": during different processing, each effect could become stronger or weaker, or changed to another, or be removed at all. A mix of several ingredients, as you can guess, is even more complex and could end as many various intricate compounds.\n\nSo, making your products is not a straightforward task: there are many methods to make different pills for the very same illness, with various effectivity and side effects. Every production step costs money, so your new creations are usually a compromise between love for humanity and love for money. Plus, when you carefully planned all processing steps and finished your future production line design, you need to fit it into your precious factory space (which is sometimes a puzzle itself).\n\nPlus, you start with a limited set of ingredients and the most primitive machines, so your first drugs are cheap and will not provide for too long. To advance into new delicious markets, you need to jump quickly into expensive research, which cripples your feeble cash flow. And when each of yourr products finally comes to market, there's another story to tell....\n\nPART 2. MAKING MONEY\nYou can estimate the market size and common price level of drugs for specific ilnesses. So, you can estimate your profits and risks of entering chosen markets, and pick out the best opportunity. You carefully look for needed ingredients and improve your technologies to make the product with minimal cost. Better quality can get you a hefty price bonus. But your product is not evaluated instantly. Only real applications show how good your creation turned out to be. So, only after time, statistics shows how effective the drug is, and how many side effects it caused. The price can fall dramatically if the medicine performs poorly, or causes far too many unpleasant experiences. Wrong formula? Your problem. Does demand for raw materials drive their prices up? Your problem. And don't forget you're not alone here. If your competitors saturate the same market with their products, and prices go down, guess what? You got it. Your problem.\n\nWhat's better: to reach after the tastiest pie with a risk that, in a year, every company will also be biting it? Or to look for stable but safe haven in a sector no one is looking at? To rush into selling an untested formula on industrial scale to make some quick money? Or to test all effects in detail and get the best product and ideal production line that will feed you for years? To flood the competitor's market with cheap alternatives to cut its profits (cause I can, baby)?  Or to use the same precious factory space for a new experimental drug? Your choice, and... yeah, your problem.\n\n"5 hours of gameplay" reviewers usually stop at, or even before, this point. People with more patience realize, unexpectedly, that Easy scenarios pack is a well-hidden tutorial extension, and that single "competitor" actually was a yawning guide in disguise.\n\nPART 3. MAKING ENEMIES\nWhen you move to second scenarios pack, dusty gnomes inside your PC are finally convinced that you got used to the rules, and things start to get serious.\n\nThe whole new dimension of opportunities: research tree is exploded twice. Equipment which no one has shown you before. New level of formulas you can't even imagine creating without a pen and a paper. Vast number of ways to go. Tremendous amount of things to look into.\n\nThe whole new level of warfare: margins are thinner. Side effects' combinations are more sophisticated and widespread. Rivals that, you know, look smart, have different characters and can painfully stab you (and each other) in the back. Wow, now I can patent drugs! What, now THEY can patent drugs?!\n\nAll news are a news from a battlefront. Every day is an exhausting race for future riches and fierce dogfight for scarce resources of today. So, do you enjoy to put your brain to some work? Say again? Sorry, wasn't listening. It's all about stress. Got problems with my Prozac production. The composition is a joke.

You can say it’s a business simulation puzzle tycoon. You build, research, develop new medicine all the while trying to maximize profits. There is one part of the game that focuses on the production aspect of the medicines, in this part you have to concentrate on researching new medicine/cures and try to improve your medicine overall. The second part of the game is the economics of your company. You basically have to earn profit and try to improve medicine.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics are simple yet beautiful looking. The colors are very bright and eye-catching. It almost sort of has that cartoon look. There’s not many options in the graphics menu other than resolution adjustment.\n\nSound:\n\nThe music in the game is okay, you won’t get bored from it but it’s nothing to write home about as well. The announcer voice can sometimes become annoying though. Other than that most of the sounds work as they should and not bad at all.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe majority of the game is based on missions, where you start out with $50000 and you have a task. For example the first mission has you earn a certain amount of revenue in 10 years. Most of the missions are like that and as you keep doing missions the next batch of missions gets harder and harder. There’s a lot of missions and even free mode where you can just play without having to worry about anything. There will be a rival company which also influences your company when they introduce new drugs etc.\n\nThere’s also a puzzle element of fitting your medicine making machinery in a limited space, so figuring that out can be a lot of fun. You can choose from 8 different characters when you start a game. There are perks when you start a new game. E.G a perk where refunding equipment gives you 100% money back instead of regular 50%. You can choose 2 perks, at the beginning there’s only 4 perks unlocked but you can unlock more as you do missions and do the objectives the said perk requires. It’s a very strategic game where everything you do has an effect eventually so you must make your decisions well thought out. Game can be pretty complicated so if you like serious management games, this game is for you.\n\nThe DLC “Marketing and Malpractice” adds a whole bunch of add-ons to the game such as marketing tools where you can adjust your prices of your drugs as per the demand/demand, you basic economics. This basically changes they way the game works with your competitors as you can undercut their prices. You can give “gifts” and other such to doctors to increase sales. The DLC in my opinion makes the game much more interesting and gives it that new perspective of playing.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nSound: 7/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nOverall: 8/10\n\nConclusion:\n\nBig Pharma is an excellent time waster and a very good business/tycoon/simulator/puzzle game. Though prepare to spend plenty of time learning the ins and outs of the game as it can get very complicated. All in all it’s a fun title and the DLC is pretty nice as well.","May 3","true","9.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","2"

I'm happy to see it's now on Steam!\n\nBig Pharma is a very unique game. It's best described as a tycoon/management game, mixed with a logistics puzzler or "product chain" puzzler, such as SpaceChem, Infinifactory, or Factorio. Your goal is to create and sell cures ranging from cough suppressants to cancer medicine. The creation process is done through a network of machines and conveyor belts that tinker and transform the potency of raw ingredients into the desired cures (often combating undesired side effects).\n\nOften just figuring out how to make a good product is an excellent puzzle in itself, but it's made even more challenging by the ability to perfect the potency of a drug, mix multiple beneficial effects, and remove unwanted side effects. On top of that is a whole financial layer, including an ever-changing market of supply (how much raw ingredients cost) and demand (how badly a cure is needed), further complicated by the competition of rival companies who can drive up ingredient costs, compete for similar cures, and even try to patent certain drugs to prevent others from selling them temporarily. All this is mixed with a large research tree and an interesting procedurally generated list of unlockable ingredients that need to be researched and experimented with in order to advance your company.\n\nSound complex? It is! This game is not a casual experience. As a management game, it strives to be more similar to older "Tycoon" games of the 90's and early 2000's, where succeeding financially is a genuine challenge and there's very little hand-holding when it comes to how to get there. At the same time, the game is definitely in the same vein of puzzle games like the aforementioned SpaceChem; a production puzzle game with no single "right" answers, but millions of wrong ones. Arranging the differently shaped machines and placing conveyor belts is as tricky as trying to figure out the correct combination to make the desired product. But, like the best  of both of those genres, as hard as they are, Big Pharma is actually very easy to learn once you wrap your head around its new ideas, and the payoff is countless ultra-satisfying "I'm a freakin' genius!" moments. The most important thing to note? The tutorial is NOT optional for a new player, and since it's a bit of a wall of text, I imagine that might put some people off.\n\nIn terms of aesthetic, I absolutely adore the game. The music is absolutely perfect for the subject matter, the UI is one of the cleanest and most functional I've ever seen, and like most good factory-themed games, seeing your products  move down conveyor belts and through wacky machines en mass is an absolute delight.\n\nMy only worry with the game at the time of writing is that it might have released just slightly too early. For the most part it's fully functional, but there are still a few bugs here and there, and it felt like the balance of things like competitor productivity and patents were still trying to be worked out when the game was released. So far, I've found nothing remotely game-breaking and it's definitely more functional than many things released on Steam, but I'm sure it still could use a few patches (there's also whispers of modding support that might expand the game in the future).\n\nOverall, Big Pharma is definitely my kind of game. I'd say it's a must-buy for anyone who likes production puzzlers like SpaceChem or Infinifactory, and a good buy for those who have fond memories of old Tycoon games (with a thematic boost to anyone who loved the game Theme Hospital). Those who want a more casual experience may want to look for something simpler, but for anyone for a great brain-straining puzzle and interesting management game, Big Pharma has your cure!\n\ntl;dr\n+ Great open-ended logistic puzzle gameplay\n+ Lots of depth, with a good tech tree, many machines, and tons of cures and side effects\n+ Procedurally generated factory layouts and randomized ingredients make each game feel unique\n+ Great music and lighthearted aesthetic\n+ Very challenging with many different ways to succeed\n+ Interesting business simulation with fluctuating markets and competing companies, adds a new layer to the financial aspect of the game.\n- Complexity may be off-putting; tutorial NOT optional\n- Minor bugs, might still need a few balancing tweaks\n","August 27, 2015","true","36.2"," 50 of 80 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","50","80","0","0"

I have compeleted most of the missions offered in the game and have dabbled in the free-play/custom game mode.\n\nBig Pharma is essentially a one part puzzle - one part economic/business simulator, as most of my fellow recommenders have already mentioned.\n\nAs it is a two part game, both aspects of it become important at different times.\n\nEarly game, the business aspect I feel is the more forefront of the two. Money is tight, and the AI at times can be brutal competitors either flooding the market for a product or squeezing you out of one. Not to say the game is too difficult, but for those who love business simulations, the early game is your niche.  Late game however, the game gives way to its puzzle aspect as the more pressing of the two. You both lose opportunities to flex your capital might as well as simply run out of space to place your production lines, usually resulting in having to forgo certain markets alltogether just to produce a high tier product. And one that is impossible to optimize at that. Some of the late game markets are quirky too  I feel - The Male Contraception treatments are apparently permanent (in any form, but pill form specifically just boggles my mind).\n\nFor those who love business simulations though, I'd recommend giving the game a go.  Its drawbacks to me are more quirky than actual problems with the game itself and you can get decent value from the game at its listed price.\n\nIn addition, I tink Mark Allsworth did a decent job with the games soundtrack.","December 5, 2015","true","76.2"," 33 of 51 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","33","51","3","0"

I was torn whether or not to give a thums up or thumbs down. Ultimately I went with my gut feeling...\n\nOverall this game does what it sets out to do. It is polished, has no bugs that I've run into, and has a good solid ui. So why the thumb down?\n\nBasically, as a puzzle game this is a fine game. It combines elements of marketing and math together with problem solving. Did I personally find it fun? Not really, though I'm sure this ticks the box for a lot of you out there. I was expecting a game of resource management (space, cash and materials) whilst competing against the AI in a race to find cures and market them efficiently and grow a company. I suppose I went into the purchase wanting a little more Tycoon/simulation based playstyle, what I bought instead is essentially a "Spacechem" type genre of a game. It just isn't for me.\nRegarding price. Even if I don't particularly connect with the game type I respect the dev for making such a polished product.

The game is REALLY good, if you like repetitive puzzles with some niche changes over the cause of alot of different challenges pre-set by the game. It also has some sort of custom games mode - I have not touched on it so there might even be infinite amount of games you can play.\n\n2. The game itself doesn't try to make you interested in playing more of it. It is a game that you pick up and play and then put down again - it doesn't have a character to it that makes every drug/medicine you make unique in its own flavour. You basically just try to figure out how many positive things you can put on a single thing and sell it.\n\nDo I recommend the game? No. The game has an artificial longevity that is repeated in the same pattern over and over and over again. There simply is nothing 'unique' about each challenge you do since you will still build the same machines in every playthru' even if in different ways and shapes - they are still the same.\nSame thing with the drugs... you need to compete against a competitor's painkillers? Then here's your one ingredience with a side effect - now make it good. Rince and repeat.\n\nThe game has replayability in the fact that all of the side effects and beneficial effects are random to some degree but like I said before, you are still building the same machines over and over again. Nothing happens except your own ♥♥♥♥-ups which some people find intriguing and I do too... in competitive games, not in games that makes me want to think and figure out what to do next.\n\nAnd this game doesn't really do anything to try and challenge you - there are some mechanics like patents which can make you lock out your competitor's drugs for some time and they can do the same to you but, mechanics like those are just infurating when dealing with an AI where as these mechanics have a place in games when you are able to screw over one of your friends; you are able to get a reaction from them.\n\nOverall the game is brilliantly made but doesn't do a whole lot with it. I bought it for 18,39€ where as I think the game's value would be around 9,99€ to 12,99€ - consider it when its on a sale but AVOID IT AT FULL OR NEAR FULL PRICE!","September 7, 2015","false","37.5"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","0"

Yes.\nWould I recommend it? Not really, especially not for 23 Euros.\n\nI love the setting, I feel there should be way more disease/medical-related games and I do enjoy the graphics, by which I mean I don't mind the simplicity. I like the making of new drugs, the setting up of belts/arrangements, the tight budget, the slight humour, the ideas like exploration and the reasearch tree.\n\nSo why wouldn't I recommend it? Because it gets boring, and it does so rather quick. The reason for this is, that its repetetive. Gamesessions usually are done in 1-3 Hours depending on difficulty and consist of you researching new techs and producing new medications with increased difficulty in the setup of your conveyer-belts.\n\nThe Problem is that its the same each mission. And the Drugs/Ingredients are completly interchangeable. Unless youre a "Letsplayer" you wont care for the name of the made-up Drugs/Ingredients within seconds but they will just be stats like "increase/decrease concentration by 3" so thats all you do.\n\nYou find the easiest way to reach that wanted concentration. And theres only (when fully researched) like 3 ways of increasing decreasing, meaning +/- 1 ; +/-3 ; half/double. So thats not hard! In fact nothing is really "hard" in this game. Theres no need to make difficult choices, as you will most likely produce every medice you can as far as research and exploration go, since every "tick" gives money, theres also no need to think about if you should keep the medicine going - if it ticks in money, keep it, if it loses money, replace it.\n\nThe result is a very easy game and the "challange" comes from increasingly hard scenarios. But this doesn't mean anything interesting like "do this-and-that with 3 rooms" or so, no, while there are ~5 different types on missions they all play the same, as you just need to make more of the best kind of medicine, cure a number of people, make some money or something along those lines, so they all mean you build up your, lets say "empire" and then at some point you win. And weather your task is to make 5-super-medicines or to make X Million $ doesnt matter as you do the very same thing. The Difficulty of the Game (which does go quite high in the late game) only comes from increasingly narrow timelimits, so the medium and hard difficulty is identical, except in one you need to make (lets say, not sure about the real number right now as it doesnt matter) 5 Milion in 10 years and on hard its 10 Million in 5 Years.\n\nSo after 10 hours lets say you will start more than your 10th game (the easy games go by rather fast) and you will do the very same thing the 10th time in a row, still not caring. And since setting up the conveyer belt-systems is the only real aspect, and you do that about once every 5 minutes, you will have done that about 120 times. And then its just routine, theres no fun to be had (there hasn't been in quite a while) and all you do is click your new belt, wait for money to pour in, click your new belt a.s.o.","November 23, 2015","false","1.3"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","20","31","0","1"

I'd love to say there was more to the game than that, but sadly there really isn't. All the challenges are basically the same, which makes the game very repetitive and it gets boring very, very fast. SImply not worth the price. You can get mobile games for free that are much more worthwhile and will give you many more hours of entertainment.\n\nI bought this in early access (and got the Steam version for free, but never played it on Steam) and expected a lot more to be added to the game, but was then surprised when the release date was announced, constantly thinking "that has to be a mistake, it's not remotely done." But no, Tim considered it done and it was released. Sorry, Tim, but you made a bad game.\n\nThe good part:\n- Figuring out how to turn ingredients into drugs using as few machines as possible is fun, at first.\n- Trying to create crazy drugs by combining different cures that aren't normally combined can be fun, at first.\n- Watching all the machines work is fun, for a while.\n- You can name all your drugs whatever you want, which is also compeltely pointless because there's no multiplayer so there's no one to laugh at the names you use.\n\nBut then comes all the bad (and the list is only short because there's so little to the game):\n\nYou have AI opponents who for the most part only seem to be there as decoration. They're no real challenge and even with the patents it's not a problem to beat them because you can just make another drug that's slightly different. You never feel cornered or like you have to rush. The only challenge remains beating the timer if you care at all about scoring gold on everything (which in itself doesn't earn you anything whatsoever other than a golden line on the scenario selection screen).\n\nOnce you beat the first scenario you know how to beat the rest of the game. The only thing that changes is how fast you have to make your money and what drugs you can make. Nothing else changes.\n\nTim (the developer) has a background in simple mobile games and it shows in Big Pharma: It lacks depth, it lacks complexity, and everything is over-simplified to the point where you have no control over any of the things that would have made the game remotely interesting. I wasn't the only one who asked for a more complex economy, but Tim felt it wasn't needed. Unfortuntely having no control over the economy means it doesn't really matter what you do because prices fluctuate at random. It also means that half the info screens don't matter because you can't do much at all to affect your economy anyway.\n\nTim's idea that "scoring gold on a mission can be incredibly motivating" doesn't fly when the game is so incredibly boring to play and has no real content. You simply have nothing to do, ever, other than plopping down the machines, connecting them with belts, and trying not to lose count of whether you needed two or three machines to get the right concentration.\n\nMeanwhile you scream for more to do and bang your head against the wall to express your frustration for yet another incomplete game that was released with no plans for more content.","April 14","false","2.0"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlizzCounty/recommended/344850/","BlizzCounty","UPSIDE DOWN CHICKEN MASK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlizzCounty/","339 products in account","Big Pharma is a tycoon-style game based around pharmaceutical development. It holds the isometric view of classic games like Rollercoaster Tycoon while being graphically sleek. As with its tycoon-style roots, it also contains puzzle elements as the equipment you must use act as puzzle pieces that you must fit together in a fixed amount of space.\n\nSo what makes this game appealing?\nFirstly, it's a management simulation game. If you're as big a fan as Rollercoaster Tycoon as I am, chances are you'll enjoy this game just on the style of the game alone.\n\nAs for how the levels are set up, there are several categories of scenarios each with their own set missions. These categories range from Beginner to Advanced difficulties, along with Quick Play and Crippling Debt categories, the last of which severely handicaps you if you're looking for a challenge!\n\nWhen it comes to dropping into a scenario, the building space and ingredients you have at your disposal are completely randomized. This means you can start the game with a nice area to start building in, or perhaps a not so nice area. It also means that you can have ingredients that induce negative side effects or not. But no fear! You can buy more space with the money you have and discover more ingredients through exploring different biomes for new raw materials to make cures to illnesses with so overcoming a rough start is entirely doable.\n\nExploring for new ingredients is a must as well as researching new methods to manipulate the drugs to turn them into cures. The ingredient system works very well in my opinion. Sometimes you just have to change the concentration of the ingredient to make higher level cures but sometimes you also need to mix it just right with catalysts to make the drug a higher selling product which adds more layers of depth to production.\n\nWith all that, there are also competitors that influence the drug market in their own unique way that isn't the same each time you play. Competitors may release the same drug as you have, saturating the market with supply which brings the price of the drug down a little. So release patents to stop them and hope they don't do the same to you!\n\nThis game, while simple at its core, offers a great managing experience and varying levels of challenge even within each mission through three different win-states. The win-states are like a "Bronze, Silver, Gold" medal type system which rewards both casual and hectic play.\n\nWhat may users not like about the game?\nIf you’re like me that wants to try to perfect everything and max out the space you’re given? There's ALWAYS something that requires your attention, requiring you to be ready to do a whole list of things until you end up closing out of the game or pause it to take the dog for a walk. There's no real time to take a step back and admire what you create or take a breather. Even on the beginner levels there are always ways to enhance production, make new production lines, enhance ingredient discovery or research, etc. However, you can choose to take the game slow if you want; there’s nothing stopping you but the goals you set for yourself when you drop in!\n\nAlso just a note, this is one of those games that you need to play the tutorial to really get a good foundation on how to play.\n\nIf you're still indecisive, I've made a small video series of me playing the game trying to reach master level on the game. I jump right into it and explain how everything works and I believe you'll know if it's a game for you within a few minutes of skimming through gameplay.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEx3_SSiCgc\n\nAside from that, have fun making drugs that give people headaches while simultaneously cure migraines!","August 28, 2015","true","0.3"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","26","44","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobC04/recommended/344850/","RobC04","RobC04","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobC04/","513 products in account","The game focuses on setting up the production lines - it really isn't a business sim, but I don't think the game suffers because of it. Combining ingredients to get the desired effects, working within the confinements of your factory - there is plenty to think about. It can be very satisfying to tweak a production line to operate more efficiently, or to engineer out one of the pesky side effects. Probably do to my inability to think ahead, I'd have to re engineer my plans to overcome an obstacle I didn't anticipate. Researching better equipment opens up more options to formulate your products.\n\nOn the first advanced scenario, money was much tighter and the game provided a tense challenge. Sometimes competing against the AI feels arbitrary, maybe because they're mostly just messages that pop up. I don't feel like they're going through the same process as me. They are effective though - I would curse them when they patented a cure that was on my production line and they provide for some interesting moments.\n\nMy two main wishes are more fast forward levels and an online leaderboards so I can chase my friends' scores. Another nice touch would be to have a 'random' setting for each parameter when setting up a custom game. Many times games are more enjoyable if the player doesn't know quite what to expect and have to adjust their play once they discover what's going on.\n\nI've read some people's complaints about the amount of content included in Big Parma and I don't get where they're coming from. There are many scenarios, taking hours to complete. Setting up a custom game offers more play for those who want it too.\n\nSo, if you enjoy setting up and tinkering with production lines, my guess is that you'll like Big Pharma.

Big Pharma might look like your run of the mill tycoon game, but it is much deeper than that.\n\nThe concentration system for drugs, the random ingrediant generation and robust AI compeditor performance (especially on higher difficulty levels) lends this to be a very interesting and *very* replayable game. Sure the random nature might mean that the available ingrediants are awesome in one game and suck in the next...but since everybody in the game plays with the same pool of ingrediants, the challenge is to make the most of what is available.\n\nThis is also a part puzzle game as you try to figure out how to cram your more and more complex production lines into a limited space. It can be extremely satisfying to have nearly every square inch of an area filled to the brim with drug machinery humming with their various drug modifying operations.\n\nThe tech tree is laid out in a logical but still strategic manner. Researching techs takes scientists and keeping scientists employed is expensive, so deciding which techs to go for in which order is important. Given the variable ingrediants each game, you aren't going to always want the same path down the tech tree each game. Not to mention you have to weight the options of leaving your scientists idle, which generates research points that are used to upgrade your equipment (making it cheaper to operate) or use them to research new techs, giving you access to brand new equipment or other discounts.\n\nIf you are a fan of business tycoon games at all, this game is for you. It is absolutely worth the price of admission.","August 28, 2015","true","59.2"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","1"

Easy to learn the basic mechanics of it but challenges you to put these into practice. The game consists either of the challenges or the freeplay option (I have been playing the challenges). The challenges I have played so far have a good level of difficulty, providing a challenge, while you explore the various options within the game. As the ingredients are randomised, it makes each game slightly different, as you attempt to create more and more high value drugs. i've seen some reviews complain about the price, which I can understand, as the game can appear quite basic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/344850/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","Big Pharma is obviously a business management sim, but it has some unique things going for it that distinguish it from other types of business management sims and give it a unique hook.\n\nFirst let's discuss the normal business management aspects. You run a company that makes drugs, and there are essentially three areas of the company you have to manage. The first is that you need the space and the equipment to make the drugs, which means you will need to spend capital to purchase floor space and then you will need to spend more capital to purchase machines to go on that floor space that are used to make your drugs. (There is a LOT more complexity to this part of the game, but we'll get into that later.) The second area is research, which is pretty much just an unlock tree. You pay an initial flat rate to hire a scientist and then also pay each scientist by the hour. The more scientists you have on payroll, the more quickly you'll rack up research points, but that obviously gets expensive, so you need to balance with your income. Research unlocks new machines, new shipping methods, access to new drug recipes, ability to file patents on your recipes, and more. The third area is exploration, which is a tree similar to the research tree. In this area you pay a flat rate to hire explorers and then also pay them by the hour. You deploy your explorers to search jungles, deserts, oceans, etc for new or rare ingredients. By discovering new ingredients with new properties, you have access to new recipes that can be used to make a variety of new drugs. Explorers also have their own research points which you can spend to reduce the purchase price of ingredients and reduce your cost of materials.\n\nThese are the basics. Know that you will always have rival companies that are manufacturing and selling drugs in competition with you, and if the rival company's drugs are of a better quality than yours, they can eat up your market share (i.e. you will make fewer sales and earn less money due to your competitor stealing your customers). In the early modes and difficulties, competitors are a breeze to deal with. They can be more of a menace in later modes, though, for sure.\n\nOkay, so what is the unique hook? The unique hook lies in purchasing floor space and machines and then assembling production lines. It is a complicated PUZZLE. Bear with me, because this gets a tad complex. Every ingredient you have to work with has four effect slots, and those four slots are filled with effects. The slots can either contain a curative effect, a negative effect, or simply be empty. The easiest ingredients to work with tend to have one curative effect and one negative effect. The more difficult ingredients have one curative effect and three negative effects. In addition to these effect slots, each ingredient also has a CONCENTRATION value that can be anywhere between 1 and 20. The higher the number, the higher the concentration. Each of the effects in the four slots has a random concentration interval assigned to it, and the effect is only ACTIVE if the concentration falls within that interval. For example, if the ingredient has the curative effect SOOTHES COLD that is active between 11-14, and the negative effect CAUSES CONSTIPATION that is active between 5-12, and the default concentration of the ingredient is 12, then THAT means that both effects are active in the ingredient, so you have to put the ingredient through a machine that will change the concentration so that the curative effect is active and the negative effect is not active. So if you change the concentration to 13, it is still within range to soothe colds, but it will no longer cause constipation. Get it? Still with me? It gets even crazier.\n\nOkay, so obviously there are machines that can change the concentration value of an ingredient to alter the effects. But sometimes you have ingredients with three negative effects and it is literally impossible to deactivate all of the negative side effects, so then what do you do? Well, there are also machines that can shake up the order of the effect slots, and machines that can swap effects between two ingredients. So if you're clever, you can swap negative effects out and positive effects in. In some situations, you can even create super drugs that have multiple positive effects! The problem is that it can require a lot more machines to make these crazy drugs, which is not only more expensive to purchase the machines, but each machine also has a per-use cost as well, so it is in your best interest to have as few machines as possible. UGH. DECISIONS.\n\nThere are other ways to deal with negative side effects as well. For example, you eventually learn that not only does every effect have an active range, but every effect also has a "sweet spot" number, which is a specific number between 1 and 20 where the effect is 100% effective. So you can research your own drugs to find the sweet spots and improve your drug quality, which is important so that your competitor doesn't steal your buys with better quality drugs. And of course there are some interesting technologies you can unlock that don't really pertain to concentrations or effects but are still highly useful in other ways. There is really A LOT in here to learn and figure out.\n\nOh, and don't forget that you actually have to manually place each machine on the factory floor, rotate it, hook up the conveyor belts yourself, etc. Sometimes you have enough funds to set up a production line for a new drug, but you're out of floor space because you built too many huge production lines and you can't fit the new one in there. (Discontinue a line of drugs to make room for a new one? DECISIONS.) So there is also a spatial puzzle element of using the fewest machines possible, laying the conveyors to actually complete the circuit, arranging your machines and production lines in such a way that it doesn't get in the way of future building and/or allows you to upgrade or expand the current production line later as new ingredients become available.\n\nThere are lots of different difficulties, modes, and objectives to play. There is even a sandbox mode where you can get all machines, all tech, and are given infinite money, so you can experiment with the machines to figure out what all of them do. (Some people may be confused about how the mixer works at first, so having a safe place to test and observe it is helpful. Combining the mixer and shaker is an advanced gameplay strategy that is difficult to understand or use without a bit of practice and experimentation, so sandbox mode helps with that as well.)\n\nMods are available from the dev if you want to change up certain aspects of the game. For example, some people (including me) don't think it makes much sense that by default it is impossible to move conveyor belts without selling them and rebuying them at a loss, so you lose money for just correcting/moving conveyors (which is not the case with machines). So there is a mod to make conveyor belts free, which I recommend. (Though what they should have done for best balance, IMO, is just make the buy/sell price the same.)\n\nTutorial is well done. It is very hands on, but also easy to skim through quickly for those who have little patience and just want to get down to business (i.e. me).\n\nHighly recommended for business sim lovers---especially if you like the idea of having some headscratching and puzzling thrown into the mix. You REALLY have to plan with this one.","September 4, 2015","true","28.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I'm glad to say that I was wrong.\n\nDon't be fooled by the simple, clean UI---Big Pharma is a surprisingly deep simulator where the logistical puzzle of placing machinery to assemble your drugs is the least of your worries.  For me, the real difficulty of the game was interacting with the drug market, where you must balance drug prices, market saturation & also keep an eye on what your competitors are doing (if they're importing the same ingredient as you, for example, that ingredient may become oversaturated & its price will rise, hurting your bottom line).\n\nYou can flood the market with a side effect-laden drug for some quick cash if you want, but consumers will eventually figure it out & punish you as your cure rating drops & your drug starts losing money.\n\nMy only criticism of the game so far is that it lacks a planning stage where you can lay out your production lines in advance.  I had to repeatedly switch between the Ingredients & Cures tabs to work out how to develop a level 3 cure, and keeping track of the machines that I needed quickly became overwhelming.  In the end, I'd go to the Production tab to place a couple machines, then back to the Ingredients & Cures tabs to figure out what machines to place next.\n\nA planning stage that tells you the concentrations/catalysts of imported ingredients (from the Ingredients tab), how to get to the cure (from the Cures tab) & the concentration/catalyst of the drug as it exits each machine in the planned line would be incredibly useful.  Then click a button to commit the entire thing, and you're done.\n\nAlso, when I'm deciding which machines to upgrade, it'd be very helpful to know how many of that machine I have across all my production lines.  For now, I can scan the lines to get a rough idea, but this is another example of mental gymnastics that the game could eliminate.\n\nBig Pharma is a game that I wouldn't hesitate to pick up on sale.  I'll be following this one for sequels/expansions.\n\n(This review was for version 1.00.04 of the game.)","September 6, 2015","true","39.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is a very simple game, but it is not easy.  You start with a production floor, which can be increased.  The production floor is randomly generated, so it is different on every game.  The ingredients are also randomly generated with both positive and negative affects.  There are 20+ challenges with 3 different levels of completion each.  Not to mention the equipment and upgrades.\n\nIs it repetitious at times, yes, but so are every other game in a similar genre.  The randomized aspects of the game keeps you from doing the same exact thing from challenge to challenge.  And the game does not take itself too seriously.  Yes, you can make a migraine medication that has headaches as a side affect.  And lets not forget the names of the medications you create.  You can name them yourself, or have the computer do it for you.  With a female contraception called (by the computer) Jeff's Preg Be-Gone, how could you name anything better than that.\n\nOverall, it is a good game, and I paid full price for it, $25.

Big Pharma is like a distilled version of that.\n\nIt has 35 levels, all of which start you near the bottom of the tech tree. Pretty much every level will start the same - 10-20 minutes of building low-level supply chains, trying to get a profit while you wait for research to unlock. To make matters worse, building the supply chains is actually really tedious as you have to jump through the menus to research each stage of the process before you build it. You're constantly fighting to make a profit, and many of the levels have time limits.\n\nDon't let my high playtime fool you - I was afk for a lot of that. Big Pharma is only good for about 3 hours. After that, there's just too much tedium and not enough fun.","September 11, 2015","false","8.8"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","23","42","0","0"

Game could seriously benefit from faster speed acceleration than is currently available.  The lack of an area selection tool to move or delete sections of production line is also a noticeable negative.\n\nThe pieces all have set shapes, which is part of the puzzle element of creating drugs.  But this works to the games disadvantage as well.  You end up with such chaotic and ugly lines of production that you lose some of the joy and pride of accomplishing a difficult creation.  I'd rather have the option of choosing between multiple shapes for each device.  It would also be very nice to feed one device directly into another without a conveyor belt.\n\nLater on in each mission, you have a large amount of ingredients and production lines.  There is no nice clean link between the screens that show ingredients, production, and your outputs.  It would be extremely helpful to show something as simple as "You are buying 90 of these per month.  This ingredient is used in 3 outputs".  This also doesn't belong on the giant graph/screen on the right once you click on an ingredient.  It should be in the descriptor block for each ingredient.\n\nClick on an ingredient, drug on the cures page, or on one of your drugs under the company page, should show you where on the production map those items are being imported or exported.  This would alleviate some of the tedium.  Or at least on the production map you should be able to zoom way out, and still see the ingredient and output icons that you can see while zoomed in.  Finding one light pink pill on a jumbled messy map is annoying.\n\nIf you want a puzzle game, go play Infinifactory.  For an economic sim game, the lack of reporting and inspection into how things are going are lackluster.  For a casual game, each level just takes too long.","September 5, 2015","false","25.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

What happens is it takes some time to get machines unlocked, etc. while playing in missions, so you find yourself doing essentially the same strategy for every scenario up to the point of fulfilling the mission objectives.  For example, several missions are "earn xxx profit in xxx time" - well that's easy enough once you have done it for $1,000,000 you can do it for $10,000,000.  There are missions like "cure xxx xxx times" or "supply xxx drugs", again, once you do those once, it's fairly easy to repeat.  The AI players are pretty much a non-threat.\n\nI believe there's a good 20 hours of playtime in the game.  After that, it starts to become repetitive.\n\nMy advise:  Buy it on sale.  $15 or under would be OK.\n\nTo the devs:  Game is good but too expensive for what it is - I wish the missions were more varied.  I wish you could really ramp up the difficulty and the AI was an actual competitior.  For example, being able to bankrupt the AI or having the AI complete the same mission objectives you are would be good.","January 18","true","68.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

You'll make decisions regarding the quality of your cures vs. the strength of their side effects vs. the profit margins you get for selling them vs. the randomly-generated sized and shaped warehouses available to build in.\n\nTo go along with this, you'll have to work through a Research tree to gain access to better equipment and new ingredients as well as many ways to discount the various costs and/or efficienices in the game.  The better equipment is needed for making higher-end cures as well as making cures with less overall machines that might require more creative conveyor belt routing.  Some machines do take more turns to complete an action so now I need to build another conveyor line going this way and then bring them back together over here and then I just need to...  ahem...\n\nThere's also an Ingredients tree where you'll send explorers to various places to unlock the ability to cure other diseases.  Some of these ingredients have special catalysts that you'll need to use to upgrade other ingredients.  Upgrading lets you develop cures for the more difficult and expensive diseases to treat.  All ingredients have side effects though that can vary widely - adding another layer of difficulty.  Inactive explorers will help you reduce the costs of your ingredients as well so you can bring up your profit margins without having to sacrifice a cure's quality because that stupid jerk other company is stealing my marketshare and my patent won't finish for another three months and staying in the green is tough right now so I just need to... ahem...\n\nThe game's main story mode has a really great variety of challenges to play through.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/344850/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","This key was obtained from the developer for review purposes.\n\nSummary:\nA surprisingly deep experience in the strategy genre. The game hits you over the head with the options for the custom game. Granted, it'll take a bit of time to understand all the elements the game, and the tutorial could be better at teaching you the game's elements. But once you get an understanding of everything the game has to offer, you'll find surprising depth. The game's strategy design is where it shines: what elements are adjustable and ones that are not are done with purpose and reason in my opinion. Dealing with competitors that actually can affect your gameplay in slight and even more direct ways was fun, and it made me a bit sad that there's no MP element of the game, as I really felt like the game could have truly shined there. When it comes down to it: I felt this game did something that I feel a lot of developers could learn from: start with a great base design, add the options later on, and designed it from the player's angle: and what they'd want. Rather impressed in the long run, and can recommend to strategy gamers out there.\n\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYuUF9spzM\n\nLists:\n+:\nLots of customization options in terms of gameplay, and in particular with the custom game. Really can change the elements down to the most specific growth rates and research trees that are available. A lot of strategy games can learn from this level of customization.\nI cover strategy games rarely because of the type of player that I am (I'm the builder type, basically consider me the opposite of the zerg play style), but this game was right up my alley in terms of my game style, but other game styles as well.\nGood balance of gameplay elements that don't overly punish you for not using them, but reward you for taking advantage of them. Cost vs effectiveness of the drug does make a difference, especially in the early going, but both strategies can be viable.\nFound that it stood the test of time in terms of variety with the smaller elements. Despite me restarting a lot due to my own personal weaknesses (aka wanting to perfect situations and so repeatedly starting again), I still found myself having fun.\nThis may seem weird to say, but some of the elements that you'd expect that aren't there (like setting the price of the drug)\nActually like the restricted playing fields. Causes you to have your own puzzle mini-game regarding machine placement that works rather well.\nDid I mention there's a good selection of options? There's a good selection of options.\nThere's apparently mod support. That's always a plus.\n-:\nTakes a bit of time to get going in terms of understanding. Lots of information to digest, and it could have been passed on to the player easier in the end. Tutorial could have been done better.\nLittle rough around some of the edges. In particular with things like the belt controls feel like that there may have been a better implementation. Luckily, it's something that you can easily get adjusted to in time.\nWould have loved to see a MP version of the game, but understand the development costs that would be required in order for that to happen.","November 30, 2015","true","14.9"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","18","34","3","0"

So far I have managed to progress to Intermediate level in the scenarios. From my experience this game is what a sim management should be.  With a bit of twisted humour thrown into the mix seen in classics such as Theme Hospital, Big Pharma is beautifully made and very entertaining with a lot of replayability.\n\nInterface and graphics\nThe main menu looks like a mobile port but don't be fooled! The simplistic buttons and side menus in the main game add to the overall functionality of the game. There are options to change the resolution, sound and graphic quality in the game. The graphics are in the cartoon style. I personally prefer this because cartoon style graphics will age much slower than the more realistically styled games, if at all.\n\nGameplay\nThere are 3 game modes for you to play - Free Play, Custom Game and Scenario. Free Play is the sandbox level where every machine and research branch is already unlocked and you have no money. Custom Game is where you set your own criteria to win the game. All of the goals/criteria in the game are number based and it would be nice to have a little more variety in how you win like being the most or least ethical competitor in game (but this might be in the expansion). Other than that the gameplay is solid. There is a lot of scope for replayability. There are 3 ranks in each game: standard, expert and master. The higher up the rank, either you have to do more within the standard time limit, or you have a shorter amount of time to complete your criteria. It's not just about what the game tells you to do as I find that I set myself personal goals long after I have finished my game criteria on a certain level.\n\nA few funny bugs\nI have experienced some world events that were not logical at certain times. An example of this is the 'mild winter' event that popped up in May. I was also stuck on the 'Keep calm and carry on' scenario for a bit because none of the raw ingredients that were available to be explored in the game had the certain enzyme that I needed to be able to upgrade my drug to an anti-anxiety treatment. I made sure to explore all of the available areas.\n\nMy verdict\nThis is a great game. It gets really addictive so don't pick this game up if you want to be productive.

It has a very tycoon feel to it while being very puzzle like in the builds. It currently has 35 different challenge senarios that all have randomly generated buildings and ingredients with randomly generated possitives and negitives each time you start a new challenge so you can very much play the same challenge over and over and get an entirely different play through each and every time. The machines mechanics are for the most part well expained though there are some things that you learn by just doing.\n\nAnd say you don't like any of the scenarios or have beaten the master rank (basicly gold in a gold/silver/bronze rating system) of all the scenarios (which would take a long time to do even if your great at the game)  custom game has a ton of customization to it, choose anywhere from 0-3 competitors, 5-15 randomly generated ingredients, where you start with 2-5, how many catilist there are and their side effects, victory conditions of total revenue, operating profit, within x years, x products with atleast x profit or value or level, minimun cure rating, total products, and pay off loan, which you can combine in any fation, so say you want the winning condition to be where you have to have 3 pills that all make atleast $1,000 profit per pill produced all with atleast B cure rating within 15 years with no competitors, you can do that. You can also set what research you (and all competitors) start with and even what research is disabled in the game (so say you don't want anybody to be able to make patents you can disable patents).\n\nThen you get into settings like map size, event frequency, loan interest rates, plot cost, research speed, scientist saleries, scientiest hire cost, explorer saleries and hire costs, analyzing speed, patent speed, patent cost, cure market size, cure profit margins, starting money, starting loan, ingredient prices, process costs, build costs, research point accrual speed, ingredient point accrual speed, cure rate, infection rate... and all of these things don't have just like 5 settings, they are all sliders that have many many settings even if its not good at informing that well (for example plot cost you could set to where it says low and the first land may cost $500, but then you set it again in low but slightly in a different slider cost and now it costs $480 or $620 for the first one.\n\nBetween the randomly generated buildings, the randomly generated ingredients, the number of custom challenges with 3 ratings that are fairly challenging to get the best rank on, and the sheer customability of custom games, you will find that this game is very replayable even doing the same challenge or even same custom game settings because even with the exact same custom settings the buildings and ingredients are randomly generated each time which also means what the competitors make which effects your profit margins also changes each time. And can be as challenging or easy as you want it to be. And even as quick or long as you want it to be depending on how you set all the custom game sliders and victory conditions.","August 27, 2015","true","4.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atxferret/recommended/344850/","atxferret","ATX Ferret","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atxferret/","156 products in account","I don't like puzzle games. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. I bought this game because it's a business management simulator. Thing is, the business management part is only half of it, if that. The restf is very much a puzzle game, but not one that requires you to go so in depth with your puzzle solving thinking that you end up with a migraine.\n\nWhen playing Big Pharma, you'll notice that most of your time is spent, with the game paused, trying to fit equipment into spaces that make it work well with other equipment, within the constraints of the sometimes awkwardly shaped space provided. Sometimes you'll find yourself thinking "Geez, they must have made this chain of machines incompatible with this dumb building on purpose", while at other times you'll think "Wow, this fits so perfectly here, without wasting any space at all, that I must be doing something right!" Odds are pretty good that the reality is somewhere in the middle, where there wasn't much thought put into it at all aside from using the shapes of the buildings to throttle the difficulty. You will be annoyed at the lack of space, irritated with the AI for seeming to be able to patent something just as you're ramping up to produce it, but overall, you will get a sense of strange euphoria, seeing your machinations chug along, making you lots of money -- and it is pretty darn easy to make lots of money in this game. That part isn't hard. The difficulty definitely comes from making the pieces fit in a way that accomplishes your goals, effeciently and on timie, without blocking you from making the next line.\n\nThis is a great game to play with the background music turned off and your favorite tunes playing instead. That's not to say that the background music is bad. It's just mediocre, and mostly pointless.\n\nThe graphics look exactly like they should for a game such as this -- good enough. They're not realistic but they're not so cartoony as to be a distraction from the puzzle aspects.\n\nThere is no story or campaign or anything. The closest you get is the "challenges" screen, which is the first thing you see when you click "New Game", and offers various scenarios with challenges attached. There is a tutorial which is both easy to use and fairly comprehensive, though you'll probably have to Google some of the higher tier equipment to see how they work. The information is not hard to find, though, so that's not really a downside.\n\nOverall, Big Pharma is a pretty good game. The simplicity will draw you in and keep you hooked even well past the point where you're tired of doing the same things over and over again and, really, that's its biggest rub -- redundancy. From the moment you play the first game in the "Beginner" column to the moment you put it away, you're doing pretty much the same thing over and over again. Think about it as an assembly line simulation tied in with some simplified business management concepts and you've got a good idea of what Big Pharma is all about.\n\nYou're simply placing machines in a way that will be as efficient as you can make them. Everything else is just details. Is that a bad thing? In this case, I don't think it is. To me, the repitition gave me a sense of comfort, knowing that, at the beginning of every scenario, I had at least some *idea* of what I was doing. The first level drugs are extremely easy to make, and they get you off the ground pretty quickly, though you are forced to get more complicated since you'll oversaturate the market with them if you just make those. It was when the idea of starting fresh became significantly more appealing than continuing to try and get Master Level of accomplishment at a scenario that I realized it was probably time to play something else. However, that was 80 hours in, which is not a bad return for a game that costs $25 when it's not on sale! I'll probably go back to it at some point, too.","January 31","true","78.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The challenge comes in two forms. The first is a business management simulation, not unlike Theme Hospital or similar games. The second part of the game is a spacial puzzle. It starts out simply enough. Very simple production lines bring ingredients in and pump packaged drugs out with a few steps along the way to prepare the formula. As you progress in the game you will unlock many new ingredients and cures and technology used to prepare them.\n\nInitially, the game only offers you selections that are available at the current level. As such, the game appears quite basic on the surface for the first dozen or so scenarios. As you progress further in to the game, however, you unlock a great deal of new research projects and technology.\n\nMany of the negative reviews I am seeing for the game (not all, but many) are suggesting the game is very basic and has a short lifespan. These same reviews were mostly written by players who had between 2 and 6 hours of play time recorded. I suspect most of these players didn't even play long enough to see how much added complexity there is when you unlock patents and stage 4 cures, etc.\n\nHighly recommended to programmers or anyone who enjoys optimizing engines. The production line component of the is reminiscent of SpaceChem.","November 3, 2015","true","23.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The production line building is more like a puzzler were the challenge lies to make a space efficient and use a minimal amount of machines to reach your goals.\n\nThe ingredients you use have 4 "slots"  on them each with 1 curing effect and also 1-3 negative effects, stacked into the negative effects are also catalysts that are required for many cures to be upgraded. To top that off the ingredients also have a concentration wich ranges from 0-20 and different effects (both good and bad) are active at different concentration levels.\n\nAltough the concept of the game is quite easy to understand, it can get quite complex as you advance and need to mix and match different ingredients while trying optimse the concentration levels for upgrades while simultaniously trying to run a full speed production with a minimal amount of machines usage for your super drugs. All this is done on limited space and "sockets" that you need to bring in ingredients and ship out the drugs.\n\nThe machines you use "never fits" wich adds a great deal of challenge while also giving a glorious feel of accomplishment once the line for your anaesthetic that cure aids, alzheimers and functions as a male contraceptive.\n\nI highly recommend this game","August 27, 2015","true","15.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I bought both in the end. You will be hugely disappointed with this if you've played Factorio.\n\nGood:\n-Idea is great! Everyone can relate to drugs and pharmacies at least on some level. You will realise that curing is not profitable, treating is.\n-Graphics look very pretty!\n-What has been implemented, has been implemented quite well.\n\nBad:\n-Very shallow in depth and repetitive. There isn't that much to do. Pretty much all incredients are treated in the same way each time, through the same machines. Only slight variations and you will end up with pretty much the same machines each time. It is a VERY linear game.\n-Space is very limited, so you cannot build exactly what you want. So building becomes more like a puzzle of space rather than just puzzle of machinery complexity.\n-"Artificial" AI enemy. You cannot see their factory and their numbers are taken out of a "table" rather than from an actual situation.\n\nReason for not recommending: it is just not worth the premium price tag.

I'd played at least a dozen hours before the 1.0 release and have been very please with how the developer has not only been regularly updating the game, but also responding to community inputs and making changes based on them.\n\nI'd have to say that it's partly a puzzle game, in that you have to build assembly lines that require some planning and tinkering to fit them in the available space and also to spend as little money as possible. And you have to research more efficient (abet more costly) production machines that take up less space.\n\nIt's also a business sim, in that you buy resourses, process them and then produce a product. This is done very well in the game because you don't have to stare at spreadsheets, instead you can just mouse over the production lines or your company page and the appropriate info is right there. And it's very easy to understand where you are making and losing money, in fact I'd say that this game is one of the best examples of how to make a business sim right.\n\nAnd the other nice feature that I like is that the game is composed of a number of scenarios/missions, most of which have three different levels of victory, and you don't have to unlock any particular mission to play any other of them. Plus there's also a custom game mode, where you can alter all sorts of criteria and conditions, and a free build mode where you can just make assembly lines and geek out on that.\n\nThe game is very polished and glitch and bug free. I very much recommend it.","August 27, 2015","true","13.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

When I first saw it, I fell in love - it's Factorio crossed with Tetris, with a sprinkling of a management sim in there. Puzzle games like this are rare - the idea of shoving machines in a warehouse, throwing belts around and *poof!* You've made some migraine medicine! - puts an inventive twist on the puzzle gaming genre.\n\nThe management simulator side of the game isn't to be sniffed at either - you've got to make a profit in there somewhere! For me, one of this game's many amazing points is that making perfect pills isn't always the best solution! Sure, throwing a few Ionizers and Cryogenic Condensers around will stop your pills making people faint, but is it economically worth it? While you're stopping people fainting, you're losing a few hundred pounds per day, and that isn't what your company's here for! (Unless you're a really nice person, in which case, good for you!)\n\nThe sheer range of things that you can do in this game is amazing. There are 11 different cure "trees" to conquer, from Blood to Lungs to Body Response, each with up to 5 different cures in them, ready for your company to take on. There's a myriad of machines at your disposal to pump out cures for the maladies, from humble Dissolvers and Evaporators to the high-tech Hadron Collider and the Atomic Sequencer (yes, why you'd need to tear your drugs apart to cure HIV is beyond me... but the animation is neat, so why not?). The side-effects aren't in short supply either, from the usual "causes headaches" and "causes nausea" to more sinister carcinogens, hallucinogens, and pills that can permanently paralyze your customers! All because you didn't want a cough...\n\nThe game has just came out of Beta, and naturally it isn't 100% perfectly completed - while there IS modding support, the documentation on it is slim-to-none, with a few links to mods available on the website, but that's it. I'm sure that the developer (yes, singular!) will be working on the modding scene before long - I guess we'll just have to suffer with the game as amazing as it is for now!\n\nStill, while the modding scene is a little slow off the blocks, there's no need to mod this near-flawless game. I've been playing for hours and hours, and I'm still not nearly done with this masterpiece! Easily the best £13 I've spent in a long, LONG time.","August 28, 2015","true","74.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Where similar games get by overloading with content and chaos--more things to build, higher volume, etc, Big Pharma rewards for elegant solutions.  It isn't about how much you produce.  It's about how you produce it.\n\nFor simplicity's sake, I will contrast Big Pharma with Factorio, which I also got a lot of enjoyment from.  Factorio is about managing resources and logistics--incredibly large numbers of exceedingly simple tasks that combine to create hectic situations.  The entire game (Factorio) can be summed up as deciding what you want to make, then ensuring the right buildings are getting the right amounts of all requisite materials in a massive and complicated chain involving dozens of buildings.  All gameplay revolves around that.\n\nBig Pharma is absolutely nothing like that; rather, it is about design and decision making.  Where Factorio gets complicated, Big Pharma is merely complex.  In Big Pharma, you can make whatever sort of cure you like.  Expensive or cheap, whether you earn or lose money is determined by *how* you chose to make the product and whether it was a wise choice to make it at all considering demand, competition, and your current capabilities.  You can make crazy wonder drugs and lose money with a hasty production line a la Factorio, or you can put some thought into it and make millions.  The same applies to the cheap drugs.  Maybe you even allow a minor, negative side effect in the product to ensure economic viability.  It's up to you to determine what the right move is, and when you make that right move, you get genuine satisfaction out of it that games like Factorio are simply incapable of matching.\n\nI am not saying that Big Pharma is better than Factorio.  I got a lot more time out of Factorio than I did from Big Pharma.  But I do believe the time I spent with Big Pharma was more enjoyable and satisfying, which is quite fitting.  Production in Factorio is all about volume, and production in Big Pharma is all about quality and substance.  This mirrors my gameplay experience with the two games quite nicely.","April 23","true","23.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","3"

Delicious unregulated money!\n\nThe problem is that in a game where you are constantly doing the same thing, you'll find out sooner or later just how bad things can get.\n\nMixing ingrediants is a confusing, frustrating mess. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. There is a toggle switch in the mixer to change different "base" ingredients (Whatever that means.) and you can't toggle it if something is in there to see if it worked. It's entirely trial and error when it gets to the mixing phase when you are first starting so spending 20 minutes and thousands of dollars trying to get two things to mix only to have it do absolutely nothing leans on your patience after awhile. The only thing I can say is completely ignore the tutorial and just look for a tutorial on Reddit.\n\nOnce you get past that you fall into another hellhole: Patents. Patents are expensive early on and take time to research. However, the computer (not bound by the same starting limitations) seems to always go for them. So if you spent an hour trying to get a teir 4 cure, you better make sure you take the patent out on it or have the one method the computer won't use. Patents only exist to punish the player as there is no other reason to get them than to prevent the computer from dicking you over.\n\nI also feel like once you get used to everything there is a lack of... well... Big Pharma. You should be able to flood the market with pills that give nightmares, then flood the "cure" for nightmares which creates a side-effect with something else, creating this daisy-chain effect, but to my knowledge the only thing side-effects change are the flavor text.\n\nThe other thing that will irk you constantly is the way you place conveyor belts. Belts will always go where-ever they want and never in a way that makes sense unless you build them one at a time and even then it is impossble to make a corner piece unless you stop and build somewhere else. And if your conveyor is a stair-like shape then there's no way to get the belt to build the way you want without deleting things.\n\n\nYeah, it's not that big of a deal, but in a game this repetitive it gets really bad.","September 1, 2015","false","66.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Its a Puzzle/ Simulation game. It takes a bit to get used to even after playing the tutorial. I think this game would be better if it had leaderboards or if you could play a live game against your friends corporation. The single player aspect of it gets monotnous after a few hours. You just have to figure out the best solution to make profits. It would cool if they incoporated other aspects of big pharma to the game like getting aproval for your products by the government or getting doctors to recomend your product to their patients. All this is is watching conveyor belts transport goods untill you figure out the right combo to succeed. That being said it is a nice unique game that im sure you can have a lot of fun with.

However, it is far more puzzle heavy than sim/strategy/management. Even if it had the charm of the luggage converyor game in the Let's Explore The Airport with Buzzy children's game of yester year, it would have been okay. As is, it leaves a bit to be desired.\n\nCons:\n- Conveyor belt routing is a time waster, but not totally miserable.\n- Initially have to reference a fair amount of material hoping back and forth between tabs, making it more like work than a game.\n- Once you memorize the tech tree and how the different components work, it becomes a logic/routing/adding/subtracting exercise. It isn't what I think of when I think sim/strategy/management. I feel like it is a tad mislabeled.\n- The tutorial is rather important, but is a text walkthrough at the moment.....\n\nPros:\n- If you like time sensitive puzzles, this is a great game.\n- If you are looking for logic/spacial reasoning work within the framework of a nice looking interface and overall "game-like" goals, this is a great choice.\n- The graphics are nice.\n- The interface is usable and I have not run into any issues with it yet.\n\nI might want a good puzzle every now and then. However, enjoy playing it for hours on end I highly doubt.\n\nRecommend? Yes, as a puzzle game. As sim/strategy/management?

I did however find this a few pounds cheaper than steam on the Humble Store, so its worth shopping around. Needless to say I think it is worth the asking price for the return in gameplay. In some respects it reminds me of one of my favourite games of all time: Transport Tycoon. I would spend hours in that game building and perfecting train tracks. In this game I played on the stage past completing it and perfected the belts and machines in a similar way, and with space limitations of the rooms it can be quite challenging. If anything is lacking it would have been nice to have seen more humour (Maxis\Theme Hosipital style). The game is solid and stable and only had one instance so far where I could not get a coveryor belt to flow in the direction I wanted.

Deciding what to build usually takes about 2s, but finding how is the only issue. It's kind of like playing tetris with medical equipment. The UI helps a lot into making the game seem like it's complex, while it actually really lacks depth.\n\nResearch and exploration makes very little sense too. There should be a way to preselect what you want to find, and should have a way to make the game go *really* faster until something worth your time happens (which would be not often if preselection was possible), spending hours waiting for something interesting to happen isn't my idea of fun.","February 7","false","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/344850/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","A tycoon/simulator game where you build production lines for medicine. There is no story mode/campaign but rather many scenarios that require you to reach a certain objective (like a target revenue) within a time limit.\n\nYou start with an open area and have to build production lines for medicine. You start with a vent on the wall to import raw ingredients, pass it through several processing machines to refine and produce the medicine, then end with a vent on the wall to export the completed product. There are a variety of machines and you'll have to make decisions on how to make your medicine. There are tradeoffs in space, manufacturing speed, profit, and quality of medicine based on which and how many machines you use. Also, there is a research system in place that requires you to invest money to eventually unlock more ingredients, machines, and other bonuses,\n\nCertain things could be better polished/presented:\nThe tutorial could be better- it's just one long scrollable text box. I would've liked a tutorial that was properly divided into separate windows for each step and with UI focus (like highlighting/pointer arrows, etc.) on what is being talked about. It's not too hard to learn if you've played similar games or have a knack with understanding program UI but the tutorial could use some polishing up.\nAt first glance it seemed that there were only 4 columns of challenges but one day I was surprised when my mouse cursor wandered to the right edge of the screen and it scrolled a little. There's no reason to move your mouse all the way to the right (you can hover over the right-most challenges without scrolling the screen)\nSometimes it's hard to click on a specific thing (like vents to change ingredients or to delete specific tiles of that are partially hidden behind things). It's due to perspective but there has to be some way to better select objects in the back. You have to click on a certain area for vents that you'll have to learn by experience.\nThere are a couple UI changes I would have liked:\nTo have a dedicated area to see current active events. I couldn't find the details anywhere after I dismissed the event box. After a while you can manually check the graphs for the changes but it would still be a nice addition.\nTo toggle ingredient icons while zoomed out (normally, all icons disappear). I liked to use the icons to figure out which areas are making which product (which is useful when you want to change production).\nTo find the location of your product line by clicking on the product in your company tab\nTo display the amount of ingredient currently being used in the upgrade tooltip (like the machine upgrade tooltip). This would let you know at a glance which ingredient you're using a lot (so how much the upgrade would benefit you).\n'Auto pause and focus' is nice but it will sometimes not work if you've currently opened another event window. Your product line (and its revenue) will stop completely while it waits for you to name a product so the product naming window should really always pause and force you to deal with it (Or the product should keep selling under the generic name until you name it).\nPersonally, I would've liked a campaign or scenarios with personalities and scripted events to make things interesting. A little story to link things together helps keep my interest when doing multiple playthroughs of the same thing. The sandbox is fun for a while but it's not like The Sims where it's easy to make your own story in the sandbox. I had fun doing a few challenges and then went straight to a custom game with all tier levels unlocked to get the full experience.\n\nWorth a look if you like sandbox tycoon games and refining your strategy through multiple playthroughs.","April 3","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A Weapon Shop?". Other than giving specific goals to reach, such as gaining $1,000,000 in revenue in 10 years, this game really has no point other than to keep you in the "endless cycle", which is why I cannot give it a "thumbs up".\n\nHowever, If you are the type of person who loves these kinds of games, then I will tell you that there are many aspects to consider, including:\n-Research\n-Finding new Ingredients\n-Getting Loans when your bankrupt (which many games do not allow you to do)\n-Upgrading standard Migraine Pills to something even better\n-Upgrading Equipment\n-Competitor Companies (AI companies, not multiplayer)\n\nEven though Big Pharma is not my preferred cup of tea, it may be of interest to people who like the game I just described above.\n\nHappy Gaming\n-Matt","August 30, 2015","false","2.8"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

Thought it was a steal but I still ended up asking for a refund. Now I cannot say that all will share my experience. But this game was far too complex for me. I got frustrated playing the tutorial. A tutorial which encouraged me to create the requested result "In my own way." to just "make sure the end result is the same." I did this several times throughout my 4 hour playtime. Eventually I gave in and just copied exactly as it was in the pictures (as far as layout) and what do you know, It worked. However, the end resulting drug that was created was the EXACT same drug I created with my layout. As I stated in the begining, this may just be my own fault. This game may be too smart for me. But I feel that if your tutorial contains grammatical errors and lack luster instructions to say the least, it makes it a bad time universally. To its credit, it's very robust. Tons of scenarios and modes to play with.

A little bit to describe my playstyle: it ranges from primitive shooters to sophisticated strategies, though I do have a thing for city building / production line management games (starts with Caesar III, then onto Anno and Zeus/Pharaoh/Caesar IV, Simcity, Skylines, etc).\n\nWhat do I have to say about the game? It's extremely catchy. System requirements are low, price's not that high (especially if you manage to grab it during a sale like I did); the game really does remind you of Theme Hospital quite a bit. Hell, when I first saw it in my "featured" tab, I thought this was a remake of the series. You know, the kind when you can't exactly sell a game under its old name due to some legal issues, so this potentially looked like an Indie rework of some Theme Hospital fans. The similarity ends right there, Big Pharma has way more depth to it. I'm just going through the first stage of the tutorial but I can already see a lot of -interesting- complexities. Having said that, the game is really easy to learn. It's not a Hearts of Iron or Victoria by Paradox that you'll spend two weeks learning with constant hit-n'-miss play sessions resulting in frustration before you understand what every little button does and every tiny switch stands for.\n\nAll in all, Big Pharma is exactly defined by its tags. An indie (the dev seems to respond in the hub), puzzle (gets you thinking, that's a check for a fact), strategy-management (Theme Hospital- / Tycoon Deluxe-style) with a theme that makes sense (simulation).\n\nLet's see if it manages to keep me busy long enough, I'll edit it then. <:","March 12","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has crashed 4 times, once with an actual "The game has crashed"  dialog (creating a crash dump folder which I emailed to the developer), and 3 times it just locked up solid at various points., forcing me to Ctrl+Shift+Esc into Task Manager to kill the process.

I don't normally play games like this but I decided to take the plunge and buy it anyway, and boy o' boy I was happy I did. The game puts you in a senario where you have 1 (or more) objectives to achieve. These objectives could be anything from earning money, curing cancer/ another disease or unlocking everything and making a massive monoply of drug production. I mean you can cure CANCER. BLOODY CANCER!!!!\n\nBut on a serious note this game has a medium ammount of content to offer with a high replay value. You have a total of 6 catagories of gameplay to choose from (1 of them being the tutorial levels) and under each of these catagories or dificulties there are different challenges for you to compleat. There is rival companies in the game which take market from you, make drugs and provide a gameplay challange.\n\nThere is also a free build mode with is basicall the game with god mode with infinate money, no competetors and everything unlocked. perfect for someone who just wants to make a bunch of drugs! but there is also a custome game mode where you can tune the game to your liking with options such as number of competetors, number of ingrediants, reaserch, buildings, cures, sideaffects and on and on.\n\nThe game focuses on making a production line where you pass ingrediants between machines to make the cure/ temp-cure to your disease/virus.

It's more of a puzzle game.\n\nThink Tetris where you have to research the different pieces.\n\nThis game cries out for a sandbox mode... where you can build a room, build an import, layout your machinery, then build an export - use the funds to research/innovate/explore etc - enlarge your factory, add more production lines, make more money, stay ahead of the competition.\n\nInstead you get numerous scenarios in which you have to gain an arbitrary amount of money and/or create a specific type of medicine by a certain date and/or before the competiton.\n\nThe game itself is that you fit your production line into a predetermined amount of space. The ingredients must be researched and require various amounts of machines (which must also be researched) to get them into medically effective states. Your work out the logistics to make it all fit. Rinse, repeat.\n\nPersonally, I dislike scenario games like this; any game where I'm asked to spend time building something only to leave it all behind and start again from scratch level after level, wears thin on me rather quickly.\n\nThat said, the game is extremely well made in terms of quality, the UI has been streamlined and overall it's very solid.

Most of the gameplay is creating drug chains that optimizes drugs (for profit or usefulness) and then to sell them. Which is really a really satisfying puzzle game. All of the machines that create drugs have a different shape and size and in order to fit them all in you either need to plan out what you'll need ahead of time, because moving production lines after they are completed is really difficult, alternatively you can buy smaller more effective machines, however those will crank up the production cost for the drug, directly affecting your bottom line.\n\nThe game is great in that you can create really weird drugs that may or may not actually work, but after all it's all about making money and not drugs right? You will need to decide wheater you value space efficiency vs price, what research should you prioretize. All the while trying to stay ahead of the competition which have just patented your new drug formula rendering the giganormous production line you just created, worthless...\n\nIt's a great little zen game where once in a while you sit back and just wait for your drugs' ratings go up or down, accumulate money etc. Contemplating weather or not it's the right time to expand, what you should expand into, is it worth optimizing that one cure so that its drug rating goes up...\n\nThere's almost always something to do, at least in the beginning and then the game zens out after a while.\n\nOne bad thing about the game however is that when you get to a sort of "critical mass" you basically cannot lose, except  for deadlines. There's not really too many challenges after the initial ones, because when you manage to get enough drugs to sell, you will start making tons of money and the game really turns into a fine tuning game.

In Big Pharma you do manage a pharmaceutical company but it's more of a puzzle game with management elements.\n\nBig part of the gameplay is placing various machines that increase or decrease concentration of ingredients or mix them up and finally turn them into pills or creams or syringes. All these machines have different input and output locations and often sizes, you also need to add conveyor belts and with limited amount of space and doors through which ingredients can enter and leave your factory creating a new drug becomes, well a puzzle. Besides planning your factory you'll send explorers in search of new ingredients and researchers to invent new types of machines or improve existing ones.\n\nYou can play in free mode or one of many challenges. What is really smart and should be adopted in other games is that the challenges get progressively more complex. And I don't mean that the competition gets tougher or you are hit with arbitrary debuffs. The game actually limits your research tree and ingredient list to only present you with simple choices. Then as you progress you are given more and more options. It's a really nice game that hits that improvement itch, you've created a cure for bad breath and now you can improve it and cure sore throat. Coming up with more and more complex recipes for more advanced cures is extremely satisfying.\n\nDad rating: Excellent\nGame can be paused at any time, giving you time to attend to the little ones. Speed can also be increased if you prefer to breeze through the more boring periods.\nNo violence what so ever. No scary monsters jumping out on the screen either. You can safely play it with your child on your knees.\nI highly recommend it my 10h with Big Pharma felt like a breeze and I'm looking forward to many more.\n","February 9","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's more of a puzzle game.\n\nThink Tetris where you have to research the different pieces.\n\nThis game cries out for a sandbox mode... where you can build a room, build an import, layout your machinery, then build an export - use the funds to research/innovate/explore etc - enlarge your factory, add more production lines, make more money, stay ahead of the competition.\n\nInstead you get numerous scenarios in which you have to gain an arbitrary amount of money and/or create a specific type of medicine by a certain date and/or before the competiton.\n\nThe game itself is that you fit your production line into a predetermined amount of space. The ingredients must be researched and require various amounts of machines (which must also be researched) to get them into medically effective states. Your work out the logistics to make it all fit. Rinse, repeat.\n\nPersonally, I dislike scenario games like this; any game where I'm asked to spend time building something only to leave it all behind and start again from scratch level after level, wears thin on me rather quickly.\n\nThat said, the game is extremely well made in terms of quality, the UI has been streamlined and overall it's very solid.

All the machines have nice animations, and the customization of your building, albeit basic with flooring and wall paper, add a bit of hominess and individuality to your lines.\n\nSound: Not much to say. The music is nice and the sound effects are good, but far from breaking any records.\n\nGameplay: Big Pharma is a building game, a puzzle game, and a business management game. You pick "play" and you are presented with a wide varity of missions. These range from "produce X amount of treatment for X" to "Make a profit of X dollars." What is great is that you are able to approach this however you want; the game doesn't force you to follow specific paths. You get to build whatever manufacturing lines you'd like to produce medications. It gives a feeling of freedom, compared to other games where they hold your hand and demand you do things in a certain order, and more or less penalize you for differentiating. Each effect requires a bevy of actions first. To get treatment for X, first you must set the concentration to the right values with machines like the evaporator and ioniser. You may need to combine it with a catalyst effect- Which comes with other symptoms too, so you have to figure out what to do with the biproduct too. Along with keeping a functioning line running, you need to keep a mind for space conservation- each exspansion of your building takes money, and they aren't too roomy. Along with making sure your lines work and you have enough space, you need to keep an eye on your competitors; developed a wondercure for a very exspensive symptom? Soon, the AI competitors will rush to roll out those medications and steal some of your profits. Multi-tasking is a critical part of the game, and if you will have a bad time if you're only good at focusing one thing at a time. Another great feature is the hands-on tutorial. It lays down the foundation you need to understand the game and get a business running, but is entirely skippable if you chose.\n\nOverall, Big Pharma is a great game if you're into the business management economic simulator genre of games.","May 13","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only to realize that, well, you won't. The theme of the game is, basically, building a pipeline from a start to a finish point with some machines in between to "produce" your pharaceuticals. The tricky part is that every type of machine has a defined input point and a defined output point, which means that if you have to put like 5 of them behind each other, you will invariably end up either in a circle or in a really bad design.\n\nSolving this is, basically, the game.\n\nIs it still fun? Surprisingly, yes it is. The graphics is cute enough to make it fun to watch that machine do its magic, and the liberty you have to make decisions is just enough to give you something to ponder. Should you scrap that low profit production line and hope that you can squeeze in the much larger one that gets you better profit? Do you have room to use three cheaper machines than one expensive one? Should you hire more scientists to make production cheaper in the long run, even though they're expensive to hire and maintain?\n\nIs it good enough to warrant the price tag?

This game offers a lot of scenarios to fulfill, it has an easy to learn from tutorial (if you're willing to read), a custom game mode if you don't like any of their scenarios, and if you just want to build, it has a freebuild mode too. The controls are customizable which was helpful, when I first played the game I would go select one of the menus but the camera would move away from what I was looking at. I was able to disable this in the settings, which makes it a lot better.","December 23, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
