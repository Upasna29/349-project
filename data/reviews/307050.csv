The story is sweet and cute, and two main characters are fully voiced, which certainly adds to its appeal.\n\nHowever, Shan Gui has no dialogue choices or multiple endings one might except from a VN, although in its case it is sort of fitting, and I can’t think of any place where I would’ve changed the story. But those who don’t mind the lack of interactivity will be rewarded with a beautiful story.","August 25, 2014","true","4.5"," 218 of 236 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","218","236","0","0"

Bear in mind that this is a static VN, without gameplay or decision-making, simply a story to experience. It's up to your discretion if the price of content justifies a purchase. I can say that those two hours are well spent.\n\nCriticisms primarily pertain to elements of the voiceacting. You may want to adjust the sound settings in option and turn the music down a bit, as both of the VAs are, for the most part, very quiet, and the music may drown out their performances. Furthermore, the protagonist is consistently lacking any sort of enthusiasm; in comparison, her new friend, while similarly quiet, has moments of excitement suited to the demeanour of a child, and when she sings it's a delight. That said, the voiceacting is more often a benefit than a detractor to the experience. Auto-scrolling is perfectly timed to the voice acting.\n\nPerhaps some of the cultural specifics of the region could have been conveyed better through dialogue. Links are provided to articles as aids to understanding the region, its history and various mythological concepts. They're okay to thumb through upon invitation, but not seemingly necessary for enjoyment of the experience.\n\nThe UI is standard, perfectly functional, and requires no introduction. I recommend the use of Quick Saves to allow the story to continue to flow.\n\nThe settings are beautiful and excellent captures of the Chinese landscapes. Your mileage may vary with the characters and hand-drawn scenes themselves, but transitions allow both sides of the visual coin to compliment one another. The descriptive writing also helps the user fill in any blanks, creating a general sense of tranquility that goes hand in hand with a visual tour of Purple Mountain. The English translation is competent enough to carry that sense across to English readers.\n\nI do not feel the plot is anything to write home about; it is a modest story, as the author says. However, it is a product of love, a captivating experience, a simple journey and an look at a new world for many of us; it's about seeing the beauty in everything.\n\nI recommend it to anyone who's a fan of visual novels in particular. If anything here piqued your interest, you should read it too. It requires little investment of time and money and the experience is captivating.","August 30, 2014","true","1.8"," 122 of 131 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","122","131","0","3"

Beautifully voiced entirely in Chinese, the translation isn't perfect but it isn't so bad that it becomes a distraction.  The story is simple and engaging, and I thought it was interesting that the game actually links to wikipedia entries on the actual locations and lore mentioned in the story. I do use "game" in a loose sense here, because this is definitely more of a novel than a game. There aren't choices to be made, you just click to progress the dialogue through the linear story.\n\nFor the completionists, Shan Gui has strong Steam integration with super easy achievements and a game that can be completed in a very short amount of time. I didn't actually see the short story and lack of replayability as a bad thing, but I got the game deeply discounted and I feel like the content was worth what I spent. The extras include a gallery of the gorgeous artwork found in the game, as well as the soundtrack.\n\nShan Gui does really feel a bit like a travel and cultural guide though.

It's up to you to decide whether you think that's good or a bad. Personally, it's a nice change of pace from all the other VNs I have played on Steam. There are times where you just want a straightfoward experience.\n\nThe game throws a few wiki links along the way which depict actual scenery or sights/art present in China. I find this as a great opportunity to share numerous beautiful places to visual novel enthusiasts. If you shine a positive light on this, it can (emphasis on can) actually be quite educational.\n\nAs far as the price point goes, I think it's set fairly. There is of course a lot of room for improvement so one must take that into consideration before making the final judgement about the game.\n\nSeeing as I want this game to improve and the developer to succeed, here are 2 small suggestions (for current or future projects):\n\n1. Improved audio - The voices were a bit muffled at the beginning of the VN. This may be because it was intentionally meant to be hushed up a bit when portrayed as the character doing a monologue but the audio during that part could have definitely been a bit clearer.\n\n2. More scenery (in the future?) - I really do believe that if you are going to link us to wikipedia links of various places, you should definitely make the most of it. China is a vast place and I am sure there are tons of beautiful scenery there so it would be a boon/benefit for a Kinetic Visual Novel to feature these places.\n\nEdit: Thank you zedraxlo and all those involved with Shan Gui. I look forward to playing future chinese VNs","August 19, 2014","true","2.0"," 132 of 180 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","132","180","0","1"

They spend the day together.\n\nThe beginning of the story is rather boring, and when it takes up pace, or interest, around two thirds of it are already over. It would have made a nice short story, and it is good to have such visual novels on the PC.\n\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are nicely painted, the beautiful spirit of the younger girl is nicely caught, as well as the worldliness of the elder girl, the main protagonist.\n\nSound:\nThe sound can only be praised when the younger girl sings. Otherwise it always is fitting.\n\nStory:\nThe story is the main issue of the novel. As I said, it doesn't take up pace until too far in - until then, it feels mostly like a sightseeing tour around the Purple Mountain. Without the achievements, I would have missed the nice parts since the beginning would have thrown me off. It takes around one hour to enjoy it, maybe 75 minutes. The recurring theme is that beautiful times won't last forever\n\nRecommended:\nIf you have it, it is definitely worth going through.

Eventually, most of us come back around from the rebellious phase and learn to listen to what parts of our tradition and culture may be worthwhile additions to our own identities. But what if we're already too late?\n\nShan Gui is a short, Chinese-developed visual novel about finding one's familial and spiritual roots in a society that increasingly shuns both.\n\nDuring its one hour of playtime, the reader follows lost and disillusioned Han Hui on her way to revisit a vacation spot from her youth. She meets and befriends little He Jia, who guides her through the mountains and shows her around the various nature sites.\n\nLet's get the formulaic part of this review out of the way first: It's a kinetic novel without any player choices or branching paths, the story is pretty unique in its thematic focus but extremely slow when it comes to pacing, the background and character art meets a high quality standard and retains a distinct visual style that I would not mind seeing more of, the soundtrack, relying heavily on solo piano pieces but branching out here and there, is nice (if ultimately forgettable), and the very authentic voice acting adds a lot of charm even though it suffers from the use of lackluster recording equipment.\n\nAlright, now let's get to what makes Shan Gui actually interesting.\n\nThe textbook approach to structuring a story is to establish a setting and a premise, create some tension or conflict, then construct a dramatic arc that resolves the conflict and guides the reader to a satisfying conclusion. This curious little thing, however, does very little of the sort. Even though it uses the elements and mechanics of storytelling, its mood and deliverance probably have more in common with those of a poem or even a painting.\n\nI can only imagine that the theme of modernization and technocratization of everyday life clashing with filial piety, tradition and spirituality might resonate with young Chinese people even more than it does with me, but at the very least it has the potential to speak to anyone (or at least anyone in a position to be able to play computer games), no matter their cultural roots.\n\nShan Gui handles its themes with care. It doesn't hide behind opaque metaphors, nor does it beat you over the head with simplistic morals. It simply puts you in Han Hui's shoes on her way to learn more about her past. It's up to personal opinion whether her quest is a worthwhile one, and it's up to interpretation whether she succeeds, and if there ever was a concrete goal to  begin with. I was easily able to empathize with her struggle to explore her identity and I am glad to have witnessed this very personal journey.\n\nThe one negative aspect that really stood out to me was the sexualization of the main characters in some of the artwork, which is not only unnecessary but also completely at odds with the story itself. Maybe the developers assumed (correctly?) that those screenshots would increase sales, which is a bit of a depressing reality. In any case, I had to roll my eyes and grit my teeth through it.\n\nIn addition to that, Shan Gui unfortunately also ticks some other boxes on the "Bad VN" checklist. Still though, while putting my opinion into words I find myself thinking "Sure, there are embarrassing typos in the script that really should not exist in the age of spell checkers, but..." and "Yeah, the sightseeing web links in the middle of the in-game dialogue are pretty immersion-ruining, but..." and I just have this positive gut feeling about it as a whole. It seems like whatever it tried to do, it succeeded with me.\n\nMany Steam users have yet to make their first contact with a visual novel, and I have to say that I can not generally recommend Shan Gui as a starter VN, simply because, for all intents and purposes, nothing much happens. So unless you specifically enjoy slow and meditative mood pieces, there's a decent chance you'll just find it boring.\n\nGenerally though, with the above caveats in mind, I'm going to take a bit of a leap and recommend that if you think it could be for you, you should sit down (preferably with a cup of good tea) and give Shan Gui a chance. If you're lucky, maybe you'll even learn something about yourself in the process.","December 22, 2014","true","1.1"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","45","51","0","1"

The main reason for this comment is that I think this game is overvalued, my mark is 5.5/10 (6 is a pass).\nStory: 6/10. The story is sensitive, easy to recall the childhood memory, and the localization work is praiseworthy. However, the story is too short and lacking necessary links, which makes playing this game like switching different scenes and scanning different CGs.   The writing style of Chinese version(the native speaker version) is too close to Japanese, that disappointed me a little.\nArt: 6.5/10. A typical Japanese manga style, colorful and good backgrounds. But I think the art designer is not good at drawing people, especially characters in different ages and human body proportion.\nMusic: 7/10. Soft songs, and free OST for listening.\nVoices: 4/10. I closed the voice when I hear the vocal of He Jia until the end, so this score is biased. As a leading character, the voice of He Jia lacks emotion, which is a big problem on GAL.\nGameplay: 2/10. No gameplay at all. Playing this game is a half-hour clicking without any choices.To be honest, I do not recommend this game even though it is 50% OFF now. In my personal view, Shan Gui is much more like a short visual fiction( I had to wait another half hour after the end for the card!) than a GAL game and its high price makes everything worse. As other comments said, it is only recommended for card traders and perfect game seekers.\n\n---End---\n-------下面是中文评测-------\n2015年4月的更新：\n制作组在这段时间里加了别的语言，加了个别的视觉小说的广告和新成就，还重新做了女主之外人员的配音。不过……我配音意见最大好像还是女主，然后木有改= = 而且其它的黑点依然没变，所以我这里也依然保持差评o(￣ヘ￣o＃)\n\n---原评测分割线---\n\n之所以决定入这个游戏，一开始是因为看到某位友邻的评测。之后到商店看了一下，觉得差评里无脑黑太多，所以决定玩一下看看。玩完之后觉得给个中评比较合适，但又回到商店一看居然是85%好评……所以给差评完全是为了拉评价以免让别人跳坑。\n\n优点：\n1.故事走轻小说风格，没大槽点（如果搞姬不算槽点），对一些人而言应该有种特殊的亲切感；多语言好评。\n2.UI什么的很不错，精美细致；背景虽然是PS+参考照片但还是有一定的水准。\n3.音乐还可以，轻柔舒缓的风格，平时也可以当工作学习BGM；而且不要钱。\n4.全成就很容易达成，掉卡速度也能接受（虽然也挂了20分钟左右的机）\n\n缺点：\n1.故事太短，点点点的话十几分钟通关；剧情推进和转折都稍微有些生硬，莫名其妙的就通关了，而且灵异元素什么的……\n2.我猜人设一定是个男的，不然画不出那样的萝莉。虽然上色技巧还ok，但是CG与立绘中的人体比例和年龄感实在是硬伤……\n3.配音实在是出戏……妹子说了几句话之后我就怒关语音了（不好意思= =）。\n4.有些细节问题啊……明明是国人做的游戏，简中版的男女NPC叫“男子”“女子”不行么？“Man”和“Girl”真是太雷了……\n\n总体来说这游戏如果要是在10RMB左右还是可以的，5刀的定价未免太坑了；虽然现在在半价，不过我觉得买了也只是不亏而已，从某些方面来说还是鸡肋……只推荐给卡贩子、成就爱好者和没钱买游戏表情的玩家。\n\nP.S.大概看了一下评价，感觉外国人民的评测虽然也很水，但认真写评测的的比例相对高一些（因为外国普通玩家不会特意玩这种游戏吧）。还有虽然不了解这游戏的制作者有什么问题，但我个人觉得只为了制作组就无脑黑也有点中二。","October 24, 2014","false","0.9"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","25","31","0","0"

You meet a young girl, He Jia, that will guide you through the places, showing you the wonders around and maybe, make you smile again and keep the sadness at bay. Maybe you'll learn more about your own family too.\n\nShan Gui is a visual novel where you click and you click and you read and where you don't have any action done. In other words, apart the dialogues going around, with He Jia reflecting a bubbly teenager and Han Hui being lost in herself, you're doing nothing. No day to pass, no skills to improve, nothing of that. Just watch how a sad Han Hui overcomes her mood to be joyful again.\n\nSo why should I recommend a game with so much dialogues that it's more an interactive book than a game - when I indeed descended in flames another game for the same reason? First, it's translated in several languages and not in English only. It means that I can play it in French. Secondly, that visual novel is focused on the Purple Mountains and everything going with, which means a lot of educational content. Indeed, each link that you'll find will send you to Wikipedia and the pages related to the content, in your selected language. Wikipedia may not be an exact encyclopedia but it's still better than nothing.\n\nThe art is quite good apart that I don't really agree with the way the heroine's breasts are represented. You're under the impression that it's fan service - I'm not fan of big breasts. Being a woman isn't the main reason behind this dislike, but I find that so unrealistic by moments... I've seen some of my favorite characters with these and it's not suiting them. Han Hui isn't at least too much in the exaggeration but still, it's not something I appreciate in the art.\n\nThe soundtrack is also quite good. It's fitting the ambiance of this visual novel. You don't have any action, true, but if the music was a disaster, it would be more boring than you think.\n\nAnd while you get some extras in the game or cards or achievements, I can't let go of the fact that I didn't have a choice. When I play a visual novel, I want to have the freedom of choosing my own path - well, mainly, deciding which I'll go through first, so that, when I'm done with the game, it's the ending I wanted the most that will be the ice on the cake.\n\nBah, for the price, consider it as a nice interactive book.","August 25, 2015","true","2.4"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","25","33","2","1"

This is the admirably honest description on the Store page, a kind of honesty not easily found on the official description.\nFirst things first: a kinetic visual-novel is one in which the player can't interact with the (linear) story, so don't expect this to be a VN proper; in other words, this is not a game - rather, it's a non-interactive mixed-media experience, and a rather good one at that.\n\nIt takes about an hour to complete, more if going through the Wiki links (more on this later), and even more if you'll take your time to sit (sometimes quite literally) and enjoy some of the little... "atemporalities" (pardon me) it offers. The replay value is absent - because this is not a game, bear with my redundancy - but this doesn't mean you won't find yourself drawn to re-experience some of the aforementioned time bubbles.\n\nThe story may appear a little plain/slow to the Westerner's eye, especially in the very beginning, but it catches up quickly; on the other hand, those acquainted with the East Asian cultural sphere and its peculiar mindset will take great pleasure on the many references - some rather obvious, others less so. This is why I strongly suggest to break the immersion and check out the Wikipedia links provided in-game (and perhaps follow up on those when the story is over).\n\nThe translation is decent both in English and German, there are some grammar errors and there's a certain ingenuity in the choice of words, with some nuances irremediably lost in translation. Both characters display some degree of naïveté, however, which makes that ingenuousness somehow fitting. The voice acting is fine as far as I'm concerned; 'tis certainly not the best I've ever heard, but it serves its purpose well enough. Another reviewer said that "the protagonist is consistently lacking any sort of enthusiasm", which can hardly be denied - but, given the plot, I think it may have been intended.\n\nAs to the "art" department, I found the soundtrack remarkable, the sound effects rather good and their timing effective. The backgrounds are gorgeus, and most of them can be "visited" using Google Earth's street view; the artwork is solid, although some scenes have the protagonists overly-sexualised, and while I realise that some if not most will welcome such a thing, I found it rather out-of-place. An utter buzzkill, actually, although that's pretty much the only real downside I stumbled upon during the whole experience, and it is an understandable marketing (and cultural) choice. Thankfully such buzzkills are not that common, and they ultimately had little impact on my enjoyment.\n\nWhat else can be said? The controls are smooth and so are the transitions; the game can be run in fullscreen up to 1920x1080; 16:10 isn't supported, resulting in movie-like black bands on the top and bottom - not an issue due to the nature of the product (as in, a kinetic VN as opposed to a game). I suggest using headphones for a better experience, if only for the cicadas and thunderstorm.\n\n---\n\nDid I enjoy it? Far more than I would've expected\nWill I go back to it again? Yep.\nWould I recommend it? Absolutely, and quite frankly I felt it was a steal at a 1,69€ sale, given that even with its shortcomings I'd still buy it at its full pricetag (4,99€), retrospectively.\nBut do keep in mind that this game is not for everyone, although I think I made that rather clear in this review.\n\n","February 21, 2015","true","1.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

As any other kinetic visual novel - a VN without any choice option - it is built upon a specific preference and taste, thus it cannot be recommended for everyone. Aside that fact, I think it lacks much rather than it accomplishes even within the boundaries of its genre.\n\nAs Jeremy Irons once said, we all carry our own exclusive time machines with us. The one that we use for travelling to the past is called memory, and the one that we use for traveling to the future is called dream. For the case of Shan Gui, we are invited to take a really vague glance at Han Hui's time machines. She is a lonesome university student who decided to take a personal journey towards the Purple Mountains of China. There, she will chase after her childhood memories with the guidance of He Jia, a young, cheery and not so articulate girl with mysterious (!) origins.\n\nThe story display is slow progressing and doesn't reveal much, aside playing on a feeling of missed chances and family liaisons. The narration is plain and simplistic, without metaphors or any close up environment details. It is basically the collection of some nice environment depictions and oddly exchanged dialogue between some shallow characters. Through dialogue, we are given Wikipedia links to related places and folklore references in hopes of enriching the setting, which breaks the immersion rather than being helpful if you ask me. At the end of your 1,5 hours, you are left with a predictable spiritual motif and a rushed conclusion.\n\nArt style might be considered elegant for backgrounds, and even character design would be nice if you were to overlook the fact that our heroine is well-endowed to an exaggeration; to a degree of being fan service, which is completely at odds with this specific setting's concept. Plus, some scenes that our characters do share - sharing popsicles, playing in the pond - are completely unrelated to story and displayed in a lewd manner unfitting to the mood. He Jia's childish innocence is exploited and displayed crudely to gain attention from a certain male demographic, which I find to be ugly in side by side with the actual mood.\n\nCompleting the game doesn't take longer than 1,5 hours. Thus the price of the game couldn't be called unfair. Still, I must confess I've seen 1 dollar games with better displays around. The soundtrack music is given free with the game, and this collection of solo piano music might be considered the biggest bonus of this game. It is not outstanding, yet it is melancholic and meditative.\n\nAs a final word, Shan Gui is not the best choice for someone just starting to play a visual novel, and probably not one of the better choices even for someone who is already interested in the genre. I played better games, watched better anime series; heck, even watched better commercials on the value of family than this. In the end, this is still your 2 dollars. Am I regretful? No, as I said I am glad for the beautiful piano music.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 18, 2015","false","2.6"," 74 of 123 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","74","123","2","11"

The voice acting borders on average, the music is touching and the scenes are breath-taking.  The plot itself involves a female tourist being guided by her mysterious friend (another girl) to real locations in the mountains.  (Think "Go Go Nippon!" but in China).\n\nThe whole experience is like reading a short romance comic while listening to classical music in the background.\n\nPersonally, I can only wish that the friendship (relationship) between the two main characters was explored in greater detail.  This can be somewhat of a disappointment especially for Yuri fans, unless the writer intends to make a continuation!\n\nAll in all, it's as short and straight-forward as a kinetic novel can get.  There are no choices to be made to influence the story.  Depending on how fast you read, you can finish the entire novel in an hour or less, at the same time, take in all the achievements with no effort.   These factors may be pros for some, and cons for others.\n\nConsidering the novel's length and it's price (it's better when on sale!) then Shan Gui is a good deal.","January 2, 2015","true","3.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

A bundle had 2 or 3 of my wish list games on so I had to take that chance.\n\nThat being said I still had no real idea what to expect from this title as I installed it. I decided to just jump into it, and I'm glad I did.\n\nIn simple terms this is a Chinese story of a girl (Han Hui) who decides to visit areas of her past (for reasons explained in the story that I do not want to give away), and upon her journey she meets a wonderous child (He Jia) who claims to be local and aids in Han Hui's adventure. Through their adventure which lasts only a day they help each other with their problems and become very close, though through it all not everything is as it seems.\n\nI really don't want to give the story away so please forgive the basic description. Just know that if you like Chinese fables, beautiful scenery with well drawn images, don't mind slightly broken English and have a few hours spare then this is worth a try.\n\nThe translation of Shan Gui is Mountain Expensive....which leaves me puzzled (about the expensive part). I know some Chinese so I double checked but found it to be true. Still, that isn't something to be put off by.\n\nAdditional Note - All achievements are easily received. 7 come from the story and 1 comes from watching the credits.

Like the description states, Shan Gui is flat; there are no choices or decisions that alter your ending, thus having no "replay value" either.\n\nThe engine, as most visual novels, is Ren'py, so expect a familiar interface; quick load/save, load/save files (not really needed), text speed options, skipping seen text, auto text and a speed option, etc.\n\nAs someone who has played a large number of visual novels, and I prefer them to be kinetic anyhow, I can't recommend this VN. Despite buying it 50% off for $2.50, the thirty minutes I spent reading it (and there after leaving it on for the trading cards) I can't say it was worth my money. I felt dissatified with the, like many said, "childish" ending. Sure, Shan Gui had it's sweet moments, and a relaxing atmosphere, but I couldn't bring myself to like plot. It wasn't as "touching" as I hoped, it wasn't really touching at all.\n\nThe music is great and the CGs are wonderfully done, though some may not appreciate the art style (like one person said, "dorito eyes"). However, there definitely are some inconsistenciess. But that's not what bothered me. I felt that some moments of the story were ruined by the sexualized art. Han Hui, a college student, does have noticeable affection towards He Jia, a girl that appears to be around 12 or 13. Somehow what seemed to be innocent in the text itself, with the images, it gave a that vibe Han Hui had a sexual attraction towards her. The CG of He Jia in her panties (actually there's...two), didn't help with that. It felt awkward, if anything.\n\nThe voice acting in Shan Gui is a nice addition, despite it being a bit muffled at times. Han Hui is unfortunately monotone throughout, but He Jia is done rather nicely. Voices can be turned off if it bothers you. And as others have said, the translations are somewhat poor, but there is going to be a patch later on, redoing the translation. The wiki links provided in the text is nice though, providing background information to what many people would not be familar with.\n\nThe other extras are pretty nice though.There are trading cards are worth around $0.60 cents a piece, and you get 3 of them for just buying the game. There is also a free OST. And like most said, getting 100% in achievements is extremely easy, just play once and watch the credits in the extra menu.\n\n\nShan Gui isn't a bad VN by all means, but it just wasn't for me. Even for a $2.50 price tag, it felt a bit steep for the 30 minutes I wasted, and I couldn't get myself into it. The game suffers from some minor inconsistencies, translation errors, and quality of the voice acting, which might bother some. But it might be worth a shot for those who would like a short, relaxing, sweet visual novel.","November 4, 2014","false","1.5"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"

Anyway, basically, this was an interactive novel wherein the heroine was wandering lost after a life changin event (revealed later in the game) and comes upon another girl who shows her around the area they are in, visiting sites and teaching the protagonist how to deal with that life changin event in a way that made her feel some joy rather than sadness, and gave her a means of connecting with the world around her as well.\n\nThis one could have turned bad quickly with the aforementioned over sexualizing, but tey managed to keep it just within the lines of what can be considered acceptable, and it ended up being more a tale of sisterly love and coping rather than....well something more than that.\n\nVery pretty backdrops with all the locations in the area the story is hosted, with real life places which some of the dialogue is wiki linked to (within the game) for your perusal on your browser.\n\nAll told, I think I give this a 9 out of 10 for graphics, and a 6.5 out of 10 for a story that almost makes you cringe....almost.

Reason being? It falls somewhat short.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I absolutely adored the art (Both character and background), but sometimes questioned it. An example is the Manager at the restaurant. His glasses aren't completed and there's no reason on why he has glasses that are basically cut in half. When you have things like that and they aren't explained, it makes you wonder a bit.\n\nMy next point would be the Voice Acting that happens. He Jia's voice acting was splended and was okay to bear as the emotion was there. Han Hui's however sounded so extremely lazy. Scenes where "Oh! Are you okay?" sounded unenthusiastic and rather plain and dull. It would have helped if that weren't the case, but it was.\n\nThe game does have a wonderful soundtrack though that comes free with it. It's got that going for it.\n\nThe story as a whole is very nice and cute, but sometimes felt extremely predictable. There isn't much of a twist. Least not for me to see or feel any. It's extremely short as well. Some translation issues and such, but it can be overlooked.\n\nAll in all is it worth full price? I can't say it is. Is it worth it on a sale? Maybe?

It's enjoyable, but buy it on sale.\n\nShan Gui Is a pretty simple visual novel with a nice story. I can't talk too much about it without spoiling anything, but it basically follows the story of a young college student who is visiting a rural part of China to remember some memories she made with her family there. There wasn't anything too unexpected in the story, but it had a nice message of remembering to enjoy the little things in life.\n\nThe art is decent and they did record voiceovers for the two main characters. Gameplay-wise, well, there's none. There is literally no interaction with this game whatsoever other than clicking the mouse to advance the text, there aren't even any choices to make like in most games in this genre. You are just there to enjoy the story and that's it, though they did include a gallery option if you really want to look at certain art again.\n\nWhile I did enjoy the story itself, it's quite short. I finished the whole game in 60 minutes, and with the lack of choices for replay value, there's really not much of a reason to play this more than once.","February 13, 2015","false","1.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I absolutely adore the background visuals and the soundtrack, as well as some of the art, but the story itself just was not doing it for me. That isn't to say the story isn't a bad story, just that the execution itself was not as great.\n\nAs I said, the art is fantastic. The backgrounds are easily the best part. The actual character art is good, however there are times where it is inconsistent, and other times where there were huge problems with proportion or anatomy. There are also stylistic quirks that may bother some (the ways the eyes are shaped); for example, I'm absolutely bothered by how the clothing just sticks to the character's bodies. What seems like a normal shirt looks like vaccumed latex suits to emphasize her breasts, and it just does not fit with her clothes. This only further adds to the strange sexualization of the characters and writing at times, and takes away from the simple and beautiful serenity the story is trying to go for. The character designs, however, were great, and the colouring really made up for some of the linework's flaws.\n\nThe story is pretty simple: Our main character Han Hui returns to a place in her childhood hoping for nostalgia and memories. The core of the story itself is to experience peace and go along with Han Hui's walk, and I think it was able to make things beautiful. However, it fails at execution and explanation for motivations, so in the end the characters and their relationships to each other felt weak. The biggest thing I wanted to know was Hui's motivation for wanting to go back, of wanting to keep those days from every disappearing. There is a brief explanation near the end of why, but I felt like it did little to impact me so when the reveal happened I wasn't affected by it. I think it would have been better if we had shown an interaction that demonstrated her explanation (show, not tell, if you will), but there was none to be found there. I also felt that this affected the friendship between her and He Jia itself, though to a lesser extent due to He Jia's longer screen time, I also don't quite understand how the characters reacted at the end, and to avoid spoilers let's just say it didn't seem very believable.\n\nThe music itself I have no complaints with. It was very fitting and pretty serene, and honestly my favorite part about this VN. The voice acting is nothing to write home about, and while I liked the addition of it, Han Hui's VA was monotone and the sound quality for her mic was not as good as He Jia's. There were times where voice sounds cut out (though maybe it was intentional?) and there were grammar errors or strange word choices the popped up occaisionally. The links they gave to fill you in on the background information of the game were a welcome addition to learning about the area.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, and while I did like some of it, other parts I just couldn't. I recommend if you do plan on getting it to get it on sale (as of writing this it's 66% off) but don't expect too much from it.","February 16, 2015","false","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Shan gui was a subtle, cute little journey about revisiting childhood memories in rural China with the help of a little local chinese girl whom there's a quiet relationship/friendship with.\n\nBeautiful, reserved at atmospheric in the art and music, it's very good for the 1$ I spent for it, I'd probably buy the soundtrack alone for the 5$ asking price as it's really a delight even for the short playtime. The voice acting is amatur at best, but He Jia's childlike voice is quite cute. It's also really great to see a female main in a VN. Being affectionately referred to as "sis" makes me melt a little, I see why some guys like being called "nii" now.\n\nI disabled the voice for the main since she's not that great, as she doesn't really have much emotion and I like to personify anyway. The eyes are kinda weird, but it's not like the character designs are bad, it's just an odd style choice.\nEasily one of the best VN's on steam (not that that's saying much), and for such a cheap price you have no real reason not to try it if you're feeling sad or stressed and need a pick-me-up to raise your "spirits" for a good price.","February 24, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite the voice of Han Hui is a bit flat, that of He       Jia is really impressive which makes me enjoy the talk in the game. What's more, pretty Paintings and pleasant music attract me more .\n\nThe story is really short which makes me feel a little disappointed..

Not bad, but not that good either. The art and the music is good though. I think the art is quite beautiful if you compare it to those western VNs, which try to imitate the japanese artstyle, but often fail at that and in the end look like something from deviant art.\nAlso I have to say the VAs fit their roles. I think both of them did a good job capturing the roles of the character with the "cute" little kid and the older and calm university student.\n\nFor 4,99$ it might be a bit too expensive for a 40 minute experience, but everyone who wants to see how a chinese kinetic VN plays like should consider buying it during a sale.","September 13, 2014","true","1.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Even without a studio a proper microphone could have made a world of difference.\n- Auto option with additional options/choices, while this made the game relaxing it does feel a bit like a ripoff when advertised as a game.

Pulls you in right away, and ends before you know it.\n\nGameplay:\nIt's a visual novel, so you pretty much just left-click your way through it. However, sometimes it will link you to a Wikipedia page explaining various parts of Chinese culture, which was a nice plus. If you take the time to actually read about the places and creatures mentioned in the game it adds a lot to the whole experience.\n\nGraphics:\nThe pictures, both the characters and the scenery, are beautiful. I went straight to the gallery to have another look at some of the pictures as soon as i finished the game.\n\nMusic:\nTo me this was probably the best part of the game. The instrumental pieces were beautiful, and you even get the OST for free when you buy the game! There are a lot of games out there, with much worse music, that make you pay for the OST, and then this game lets you have it for free! BIG plus.\n\nThe two voice actresses also did a pretty good job. I have only studied a little Chinese, but was able to pick up a few words and sentences here and there that I knew, so for those studying Chinese this game might be a nice listening exercise.\n\nOverall:\n9/10\n\nI'm rating this game this high because despite only taking about an hour to finish, it's 1) a very good game, 2) a very beautiful game, and 3) a very cheap game. I've had the credits rolling in the background since I finished the game a while ago, just so I could listen to the music ("Can't Wait Sweet Osmanthus Blooms") while writing this.","January 1, 2015","true","1.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

The background art is gorgeous and I really enjoyed the music. The voice acting is passable but not very professional (you can hear a lot of breath pops). The story is relatively simple, which is good because the translation is iffy throughout. You'll get a lot of lines about hearing the "chirps" singing in the mountains or the protagonist's backpack, which is apparently "full of shenanigans". I appreciated the wikipedia links in the text as well, filling in references that a Chinese audience would presumably have understood.\n\nUnfortunately at this point I'm going to have to say I don't recommend it to a broad audience. There's no interactivity in a KN, so it's not for everyone, and with the awkward translation and unfortunate art (with the protagonist's rocket boobs and the lovingly rendered and completely unnecessary image of a 12 year old's wet underwear).\n\nHowever, if you're familiar enough with the visual novel scene to ignore those issues, this KN is a nice way to spend an afternoon.","November 6, 2014","false","2.0"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Here's a short list of pros and cons.\n\nCons:\nBad Art\nHe Jia's Voice acting\nVery short\nPros:\nLikable cast\nGreat soundtrack\nCons:\nSo about the art, I've played a great many VNs in my life, but never have i seen characters with such poorly drawn eyes! They're triangles... Also the backgrounds. They where poorly considered. They switched from what i assume to be CGI to  photos that had been poorly converted to a painting in photoshop. If all of the backgrounds where one or the other, i wouldn't complain. But the switching randomly between the two was just sorta awful. I found that it messed up the otherwise good flow of the game. Another major complaint is the length. I cleared the game in 75 minutes. That's just no good. The Voice acting was quite good, but only for Han Hui (main char); He Jia's on the other hand sounded like it was recorded on a laptops internal microphone... Quite unacceptable in my opinion.\n\nPros:\nThe characters where likable and He Jia in particular was cute. The OST was great as well.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall it's a game that had a lot of potential that was sadly wasted do mainly to technical issues. I'm sad to say i can't recommend it for the 4.99USD price it is now; if it was 0.99 cents it would be a different story. It was fun enough to justify 0.99 cents, not 4.99USD.","May 16, 2015","false","1.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Now that I've played it, I can definitely say I'm glad  it was, because honestly, it rather felt like a cute little project done by a bored hobby artist that is distributed by them on their Facebook/Blog/Website for free rather than a commercial one sold on Steam.\nThe story is supershort and predictable, the characters have a cute interaction but are honestly scary to look at (keyword: Jia). Admittedly, this might be subject to the art style, but let's face it - A pre-pubescent, tiny 9 years old with pointy boobs? That's not part of an art style, it's a choice and just sexualization. Give Han Hui boobs as monstrous as you like, she's an adult. But... just not the kid.\nThe overall game design actually had a pretty aesthetic to it, since it's not too common to see Chinese games on Steam (not to mention Chinese Voice Acting) and I think it's nice they set their story into real locations, including in-game Wikipedia links to look the latter up. But alas, this all does not make up for how unspectacular the story is. Plus, whereas Han Hui's Voice Acting is fine, Jia's Voice Actor seriously needs to consider getting a new microphone. The recording quality is... not befitting a commercial game, and even the decent acting job doesn't cover it up.\n\nI enjoyed it out of curiosity for a Chinese Visual Novel, but that's it. While it would have been beautiful as a simple, non-commercial indie plaything (heck, if one of my friends made this, I would even cherish it), it is not as a game on Steam.\nI can imagine tipping the creators a little, but nevertheless I can only recommend Shan Gui when it's on sale and really only a few cents.","September 7, 2015","false","0.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Shan Gui is the story of Han Hui, a young woman on a break from college, who goes to revisit the location of some of her childhood memories. While there she meets He Jia, a young girl who offers to be her guide. Together they travel through the mountains, appreciating history and nature, as well as each others' company. Through their travels He Jia helps Han Hui come to terms with some of the new difficulties of adult life, and some of the unpleasant memories of childhood.\n\nThe story is well written, with only a few translation errors still remaining from the original Chinese. The voice acting is decent, though it sounds like it was done with low-quality materials. This doesn't detract from the feeling of authenticity of these characters. The music is tranquil and fits the mood of the story well.\n\nThe art, especially the background design, is quite striking. You're going to remember some of the scenes after your play-through.\n\nThe game is quite short; you can finish it in 1-2 hours, and there are no choices, so there's no real need to play it again. Still, as a story it's definitely got some good feeling to it, and it's quite cheap. If you're interested in some lighter VN fare, then you'll probably like this one, and there's really no excuse not to buy it if it's on sale.","April 23, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has a distinctly "amateur" feel, but also has a negligible enough price tag to make it worth reading through.\n\nA "Kinetic Novel", it has no choices or gameplay elements, so those that hate such things, move along.  Shan Gui is basically just an illustrated and voiced story about a girl meeting another girl and having a pleasant conversation.  In the side, they sneak in some tour guide-like descriptions of some monuments in real-world China.  Sometimes, however, humble ambitions pay off well when they focus upon delivering their core experience. As nothing but a cute story revolving around two contrasting character types, it's something you can certainly enjoy when you feel like taking a break from the tension of a "real game".\n\nOn the negative side, it's rather short (although it's also cheap), and the voice acting in particular deserves mention; The voice actress of He Jia (the younger-looking girl) in particular uses a low-quality microphone that gives all her lines a staticy, reverbed sound like she's on a bad telephone connection.  The character art is also somewhat sub-par and a little too skinny and angular, while the background art is quite good. (Although, as a combination of real pictures with filters to make it "look anime" and hand-drawn images, it can sometimes look discordant to see two different art styles depict the same structure.)  Han Hui (the main character) also seems to have a shirt that hugs her chest impossibly tight and a bra size that changes between scenes, with some art seeming to focus a little too much on it.\n\nIf you're at all interested in it, I suggest getting it during one of its frequent sales - it's hard to feel cheated out of half a dollar, no matter the shortness of the story.

This is definately not the genre for me.  I need to speed through Hotline Miami just to jatter my mind straight again.

Probably not, unless there's a very very specific market for this softcore thing, if it can even be called that.  I'm the last person to ask.  The fastest way to beat the game is to click as fast as you possibly can...\n\nSorry, I really don't have experience with VNs.  I think I was supposed to feel sad and connected with the characters.  I nearly feel asleep as I was sloped at an angle my chair was never meant to hold a human being in.  I remember you "take control" or "play as" (seriously this genre) a college girl going on a walk because of bad memories or something, then you pass out.  Then a girl appears who is totally not a mysterious fox being and then whatever sadness and stuff and you're supposed to cry and then the game ends.\n\nFor you pervos out there looking for a throbbing time, you'll be left disappointed.  For you fanatic VN fans, I hear this one is comparitively short.  If you're like me and you need instant gratification in your video games, stay away.\n\nI'll mark this as "recommened" for at least being a high quality game with the music and Chinese voices, and some unlockables.  By the way, keep your default internet browser open while playing this, sometimes clickable links to Wikipedia pages on Chinese landmarks pop up.\n\nI need to play Smash Brothers or something.","December 30, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The backgrounds are lovely to look at, the music is beautiful and uplifting. There is no interaction whatsoever, so setting a comfortable dialogue speed and hitting the auto-play button helps with the immersion. Getting into the characters is difficult because the story is told pretty vague and the "play"time is only about an hour. The character art is good but lacks facial expressions. I also think there was no need for highlighting Han Hui's chest that much since it doesn't fit the theme or mood of the game. The characters are voiced in Chinese. Translation is good for the most part, only a few sentences were formulated a bit messy.\n\nEven though there are these cons I enjoyed Shan Gui and would recommend it for a discounted price of 1-2€. If you're not sure if you'd enjoy the game you probably could also just watch a let's "play" on Youtube without commentary.

This is definately not the genre for me.  I need to speed through Hotline Miami just to jatter my mind straight again.  Erm.. unbiased review away!\n\nJust to set it straight, this is not a porno adult erogame.  Probably not, unless there's a very very specific market for this softcore thing, if it can even be called that.  I'm the last person to ask.  The fastest way to beat the game is to click as fast as you possibly can...\n\nSorry, I really don't have experience with VNs.  I think I was supposed to feel sad and connected with the characters.  I nearly feel asleep as I was sloped at an angle my chair was never meant to hold a human being in.  I remember you "take control" or "play as" (seriously this genre) a college girl going on a walk because of bad memories or something, then you pass out.  Then a girl appears who is totally not a mysterious fox being and then whatever sadness and stuff and you're supposed to cry and then the game ends.\n\nFor you pervos out there looking for a throbbing time, you'll be left disappointed.  For you fanatic VN fans, I hear this one is comparitively short.  If you're like me and you need instant gratification in your video games, stay away.\n\nI'll mark this as "recommened" for at least being a high quality game with the music and Chinese voices, and some unlockables.  By the way, keep your default internet browser open while playing this, sometimes clickable links to Wikipedia pages on Chinese landmarks pop up.\n\nI need to play Smash Brothers or something.","December 30, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That's all. To sweaten the deal, it cost half as much. Then, I don't remember clicking "buy", strangely...\n\nBut it doesn't matter anyway. This is still one of the shortest, most relaxing and beautiful kinetic visual novels I've ever played, and I've played. hm, a few by now.\n\nFollowing the most routine scheme, let's just take a quick peek at story, characters, music and graphics.\n\nStory\nThis game might not have the storyline clew of Ever17 - Out Of Infinity or some similar projects, but it has a certain ring to it. It's all about your inner feels and emotions. Have you ever felt, that you don't care about people, you are ought to love? Have you ever felt left behind in a labyrinth of your inner fears? This VN is all about it. It also had some pretty sensational moments, which I won't, of course, spoil, but know, that you have some things and twists to look forward to.\n\nCharacters\nA student with a bit of a messed up life and warm childhood memories meets a strange understanding, enthusiastic, but unic in her own way girl. There's not much to say, just that MC were pretty well made for a story that short.\n\nMusic\nPretty enchanting and relaxing tunes on the background and some nice voice acting. I don't particulaly like Chinese, but I can't ask for too much, can I?..\n\nGraphics\nThe scenes (especially sceneries) were amazingly well drawn and felt real. The character designs were kinda mediocre, but cute at the same time.\n\nOverall, I can't say I regret buying it. At least, I know it exists now, and I can recommend it to someone. By the way, it reminded me of Kotonoha no Niwa quite a bit, especially when the rain came into play. Same intriguing, but relaxing feeling.

Given the fairy-tale setting the characters were believable enough and each rather sweet in their own way. The cast was limited but that felt fitting and the new voice acting was a huge improvement over the old. The fan service moments were amusing and done in good taste, even if I well that main character’s breasts were over accentuated in just about all the art she appeared in. If a player is ready to sit down and experience a story instead of interacting with the novel, then they’re in for a treat. That said, the lack of player interaction leads to two main problems. First is that there’s absolutely no replay value whatsoever unless you want to hear the exact same story and character interactions again. Second is that since the game is pixel for pixel the same experience for every player you could just look up someone else playing the whole game on YouTube instead of buying the game, which would save you the money and still give you virtually the same experience. The only reason to buy it is for the “vanity” of having it and its play time in your library and also getting the achievements and trading card drops if that’s your thing. Overall I think it’s a good experience and definitely recommend it, but I don’t think most players will benefit from purchasing a copy themselves.","June 3, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I finished the game twice recieving all of the achievements except one and I am very satisfied with the results of the game.  In other words what I am trying to say is Failure is an unavoidable fact of life. Its devilish claws knock you down when you least expect it, but it's how you react to disappointment that's important. Shan Gui is the digital embodiment of the idea that pleasure can spring from pain, but although death is pervasive in this 2D platformer, it does not define the experience. There is an incredible sense of satisfaction when you clear a particularly nasty level that makes the setbacks you endured to reach that lofty goal well worth it. It's the feeling you get when you miraculously squeeze through two slicing blades unscathed or leap in the air to snatch a dangling bandage that seemed impossible to reach only moments earlier that continually pushes you forward to tackle the next challenge. Shan Gui is an extraordinary game that makes you work for every inch you gain, which makes success taste so much sweeter when you finally get there.","December 24, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","2"

The music, however, often had me wanting to rage quit from the sheer irritating repetition and limited variety included, not to mention the off levels of the spoken word dialogue between those two as far as clarity goes.\n\nThere's a good deal of character development as well, though a sizeable chunk of it about half way through seems forced to link the tale to real life locations and historical events, padding out the length instead of keeping the tale moving along fluidly. There's also wikipedia links in the story so you can research the places being mentioned, which is a nice tough for those interested in having a better understanding of the secondary setting that occurs and serves little purpose to the narrative at hand. Overall, not bad, but one worth waiting on a sale to acquire.","June 22, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If my broski brock didn't spot me this game, I would have masturbated and ejaculated all over my closet door handle.  After playing this game for roughly 20 minutes, my sex drive has astronomically recovered and I have much more T.  I finished the game twice recieving all of the achievements except one and I am very satisfied with the results of the game.  In other words what I am trying to say is Failure is an unavoidable fact of life. Its devilish claws knock you down when you least expect it, but it's how you react to disappointment that's important. Shan Gui is the digital embodiment of the idea that pleasure can spring from pain, but although death is pervasive in this 2D platformer, it does not define the experience. There is an incredible sense of satisfaction when you clear a particularly nasty level that makes the setbacks you endured to reach that lofty goal well worth it. It's the feeling you get when you miraculously squeeze through two slicing blades unscathed or leap in the air to snatch a dangling bandage that seemed impossible to reach only moments earlier that continually pushes you forward to tackle the next challenge. Shan Gui is an extraordinary game that makes you work for every inch you gain, which makes success taste so much sweeter when you finally get there.","December 24, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","2"

The original voice acting was poor quality, but the dev was aware of that, and rerecorded it with much better quality... except for He Jia, who has something like 40% of the voiced lines, and still sounds lo-fi.  I have no idea whether there are plans to fix that.\n\nThe story, which ought to be the best part of a VN, is just a couple hours of a young woman revisiting scenes from her childhood, making a new friend, and learning a little more about her father after his death (plus one scene that's almost entirely innuendo and feels completely out of place).  It ends with a small twist that adds an element of the supernatural, but I don't feel at all bad about spoiling that becase it's foreshadowed from the start with all the subtlety of a boot to the head.  Overall, it's decently well-written, but too lacking in conflict to be all that interesting (even internal conflict, which would fit with the game's theme - the protagonist strikes me as aimless rather than conflicted).\n\nI don't regret having taken a chance on it since I got it in a bundle, but I came away from it feeling that the art was the only excellent part of it, and I can't recommend it on that basis alone.","April 7","false","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/recommended/307050/","seffles","すみか","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/","499 products in account","Shan Gui is a fairly short Kinetic Chinese Visual Novel.  Kinetic meaning linear story and if there are choices they will have little to no effect on the final outcome.  The story as a whole is rather sweet and whimsical, the  music is well done and fits the journey, and the background art can be breathtaking at times.  The character / sprite art on the other hand, while well done, isn't really to my taste though it doesn't detract from the experience as a whole.\n\nIf there are any downsides to the game they would have to be the quality of the limited voice acting and the English translation.  Personally I didn't find either of them to be a big issue, but for the sake of full disclosure it should be mentioned.  The translation itself does the job it needs to, I don't feel at any point something important was lost as a result, but the wording used can be very awkward at times.  As for the voice acting, the actors didn't do a bad job, the sound quality just seemed rather poor, which is strange considering the quality of the music.  Once again, not a big issue for me though.\n\nI honestly think one of the more interesting things this visual novel does is at times you will have highlighted items in the text box.  Clicking on these items will open up your web browser and take you to a Wikipedia page to give you more information about the real life locations, myths, and history touched on in the game.  It was a small thing but I found it rather charming for those interested in knowing more.\n\nAs a whole, considering the price, I think it is worth playing if you enjoy Visual Novels.  It isn't perfect, nor is it super deep, but it has a sweet tale to tell and it doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\nScore: 6/10","November 2, 2014","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/recommended/307050/","seffles","すみか","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/","499 products in account","Shan Gui is a fairly short Kinetic Chinese Visual Novel.  Kinetic meaning linear story and if there are choices they will have little to no effect on the final outcome.  The story as a whole is rather sweet and whimsical, the  music is well done and fits the journey, and the background art can be breathtaking at times.  The character / sprite art on the other hand, while well done, isn't really to my taste though it doesn't detract from the experience as a whole.\n\nIf there are any downsides to the game they would have to be the quality of the limited voice acting and the English translation.  Personally I didn't find either of them to be a big issue, but for the sake of full disclosure it should be mentioned.  The translation itself does the job it needs to, I don't feel at any point something important was lost as a result, but the wording used can be very awkward at times.  As for the voice acting, the actors didn't do a bad job, the sound quality just seemed rather poor, which is strange considering the quality of the music.  Once again, not a big issue for me though.\n\nI honestly think one of the more interesting things this visual novel does is at times you will have highlighted items in the text box.  Clicking on these items will open up your web browser and take you to a Wikipedia page to give you more information about the real life locations, myths, and history touched on in the game.  It was a small thing but I found it rather charming for those interested in knowing more.\n\nAs a whole, considering the price, I think it is worth playing if you enjoy Visual Novels.  It isn't perfect, nor is it super deep, but it has a sweet tale to tell and it doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\nScore: 6/10","November 2, 2014","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I will say however that the Music is very good and I really enjoy having it play just in the background while I'm working. The art is also good in my opinion. Its not like the American anime style which doesn't quite have the same Japanese look. Though similar it definitely stands out visual and the color palates chosen make the character not blend so much into the background.

More on the art in the next section;\n- The translation, which is a bit clumsy, is almost poetic in its naivity.\n\nThe weird:\n- Some inaccuracies in the sprites (Jia has orange hairclips in the frontal sprite only and in some CGs);\n- Breast size fluctuate. Breasts and nips are generally emphasized, which I thought was weird; sure, the main character does feel some kind of attraction for Jia, and this element is important, but I still feel like it's portrayed as non-sexual in the writing and it's sexualized in the art;\n- Narrative-wise, the ending in which the main character has that little quarrel with Cheng and then just accepts that Jia is a goddess... it felt really weird.

First of all, it was interesting to play a Chinese VN, since most of my experience has been with Japanese. The fact that the novel included actual locations and dealt with aspects of Chinese mythology added so much realism to the experience.\n\nThe art is simplistic and breaktaking, looking hand-drawn with care. The novel also includes voiceovers for both female characters, which are superbly done. Though it's not a complaint, I will say this novel is somewhat short. It takes about 30 minutes or so to play through in one sitting. But it's a very well written, concise and thoughtful plot, leaving open a possibility for a sequel perhaps in the future...~?  (we can hope)\n\nIf you're expecting a VN which involves multiple routes and varied endings, this isn't for you. There are no choices presented, only a beautiful story to enjoy.

I see people complaining about boring lazy voice acting but again- this story is so chill there is no need for anything dynamic. It's similar to the VN "Narcissu" in this sense, less is definitely more.\n\nThe only things I can fault with this VN is down to my own pickiness. The main character certainly didn't require such huge bazongas and the whole ending scene seemed a little forced and out of place, but maybe that's just me.\n\nIn the end- though it is a low price, unless you particularly like this kind of thing, or (like me) you are jumping through every hoop for easy achievements that you can get- I'd wait until this is on some sort of sale to buy it. It's pretty- but it's shortness and lack of any major depth makes it hard to scream "BUY IT NOW!".","July 12, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Breasts and nips are generally emphasized, which I thought was weird; sure, the main character does feel some kind of attraction for Jia, and this element is important, but I still feel like it's portrayed as non-sexual in the writing and it's sexualized in the art;\n- Narrative-wise, the ending in which the main character has that little quarrel with Cheng and then just accepts that Jia is a goddess... it felt really weird.

First of all, it was interesting to play a Chinese VN, since most of my experience has been with Japanese. The fact that the novel included actual locations and dealt with aspects of Chinese mythology added so much realism to the experience.\n\nThe art is simplistic and breaktaking, looking hand-drawn with care. The novel also includes voiceovers for both female characters, which are superbly done. Though it's not a complaint, I will say this novel is somewhat short. It takes about 30 minutes or so to play through in one sitting. But it's a very well written, concise and thoughtful plot, leaving open a possibility for a sequel perhaps in the future...~?  (we can hope)\n\nIf you're expecting a VN which involves multiple routes and varied endings, this isn't for you. There are no choices presented, only a beautiful story to enjoy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ScottyMacPherson/recommended/307050/","ScottyMacPherson","NekoTheLazyGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ScottyMacPherson/","68 products in account","The Graphic Novel game is not really a game per say, rather a Graphic Novel itself.Unlike most of it's genre you'd find on steam, it strickly plays out from beginning to end without making any decisive choices or playing through any mini-games to proceed. The ability to save is more like sticking a bookmark in a Manga. As a Manga, I'd label it as a slice of life story. It's not built to hold an awe inspiring epic tale or journey, nor to aim for some phylosical meaning of life. Instead, the story focuses on a day inwhich a freshman university student comes accross a young girl around the age of 12. There's some strong symbolism made between the 12-year-old girl and a fox, and it's hard to say if the author intended the symbolism to be some foreshadowing of something supernatural or merely to address her character as someone elusive and free spirited. Either way, I appreciate a more innocent take on a fox girl than Kanokon had to offer. I found that the story did a good job at capturing the image of a female college student who has wondered off to without any motive in mind, and comes accross a young girl who flatters her by addressing her as a sister. Clearly the girl looks up to Han Hui (the college student), and wishes to lighten her day.\n\nThis is were I address a bit of an annoyance, the wikapedia links. The graphic novel allows some room to learn about chinese culture, and for some references that wouldn't be universal knowledge, the virtual book provides some links for Background information. If you internet's not cooperating at the time, then you're really not must at luck. I'm sure that this is something they intend to fix in time or someone might create a mod to resolve. Regardless of that inconvience, the art of story telling does a good job at addressing that where He Jia (the young girl) took Han Hui is a sight of some historical importance that man within the area have visited as kids.\n\nI would say If anything, I had a love for the artwork as well as the peaceful classical styled music in the background. As for the voice acting, I would not recommend trying to learn or pick-up much chinese from this game, unless you're already trying for an advance level of language comprehension. It's understandable for the voice to be for the most time soft-spoken. My one issue with the artwork is about the same as the artwork for Sekirei, for whatever reason, Han Hui's nipple is somehow so distinguishable that it distorts the outline of her shirt. I do not care how big a women's nipple might be, and I scarely believe any woman's article of clothing would be that revealing or tight. I also have it on good autority that women often wear bras to cover that sort of thing. In the big scale of things, it's really not that much of a problem, and it seems to only be Han Hui design with that artistic detail. Perhaps it was from the dew or I never paid that much attention to modern fashion.  I also noticed that He Jia is also drawn a bit more mature than the age she's meant to be, My guess would be somewhere around 15.\n\nThe common complaint has often been that it was too short, and I felt almost like it was ended too early as well. Looking back at the price, I find considering what I often paided for each Manga that would hold about 4 chapters with no significant hold on an overall plot cost around 8-10 dollars. Too, looking at how much a DVD contain about as much as this novel, the price is quite high. So in the big scheme of things, the game's still worth the price, and plays out like a subbed anime where I don't have to put my speed reading skills to the test. The developers of the game also stated that a sequel may be on it's way, it might take a year, but it shows that there would be more to come.\n\nOverall: 6.5/10","January 4, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sure, I can, and will complain about the bad voice acting and pretty bad English translation, but believe it or not that's not really that big of a letdown overall.\n\nThe voices themselves weren't bad per-se, just that you could tell the voice actors were struggling. Most of the time I could envision the two in a recording studio instead of the actual setting. Still, all I did was turn off the voices and kept reading it for the story, which worked surprisingly well, only turning them on again during the humming scenes.\n\nMy next bone to pick with this were the English translations. Really... really hit and miss most of the time so you have to rearrange the sentences in your head for the most part. That said, after a while I got used to them and only took one or two seconds to rearrange the broken sentences for myself while not losing that much of the atmosphere in the process.\n\nNow while it might seem like I'm bashing this more than praising it, I'm mostly throwing my critics first since I wouldn't want to spoil anything about the actual story for once, and since everything that was good to be said about it was said already. Short but real cute story overall, impressive visuals and a surprisingly good soundtrack which I'm still surprised they're giving away for free.\n\nThere's also one more... feature shall I call it that I'd want want to talk about, and that's the wiki links it provides throughout the story. Personally I spent at least a quarter if not more of my time in-game reading wiki articles quoted. That said though I feel like they could've linked a few more since it was a real nice feature. Using Steam's inbuilt overlay browser instead of my normal one would have been nice as well bit this isn't really a resource hog so could have the browser opened without any problems.\n\nAll in all I'd recommend this if you feel up to handle the hit and miss translations. Otherwise wait for more updates on the matter.","November 8, 2014","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, it's important to note that the game IS a visiual novel- one with not a single choice the entire story. If that's not your cup of tea, Shan Gui might not be worth it. It's also a really quick read, with not so much re-read value, so keep that in mind while purchasing. I recommend that lovers of visual novels pick it up when on sale! It's definitely worth the read, and is as I said before, a really sweet story.","November 28, 2014","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The artstyle for the characters can be a little jarring if you think about it too much, but it's charming and the vibrant backgrounds really draw you in.

I found the backgrounds to be lovely. I love being able to see all the artwork and backgrounds after I completed the game. The game does not take long at all to complete; 1.3 hours for me, and that's only because I went back to a few things when I'd skipped to soon. I liked hearing the Chinese and it was nice getting links to the various places, people, and such in the visual novel itself. The music is relaxing. It's a quiet little game that I think is good for when you need to relax. I also enjoyed the descriptions of the scents and what Han Hui experienced. I thin kthe only real negative would be the way Han Hui is drawn; her breasts are a bit...oddly drawn to say the least. Clearly some fanservice there. That being said, it's still an enjoyable little game.

There are a few forgivable typographical errors here and there, but I was surprised by the quality of writing in general. It's better than I had anticipated. I've played many a game created by native English speakers with far worse English grammar/punctuation. Kudos to the translation/localization staff.\n\nThe soundtrack is calming and well suited to each scene. There are a few points where it cuts out entirely, in an attempt at dramatics, only to start back up again shortly thereafter, and honestly it feels more jarring than anything. That's pretty minor though, only happens a handful of times in the story and is never too detrimental.\n\nArtwork is fantastic, very serene choice of imagery that really lends credibility to the setting, and helps make the locations visited feel well realized.\n\nGive this visual novel a shot.

Instead, the story focuses on a day inwhich a freshman university student comes accross a young girl around the age of 12. There's some strong symbolism made between the 12-year-old girl and a fox, and it's hard to say if the author intended the symbolism to be some foreshadowing of something supernatural or merely to address her character as someone elusive and free spirited. Either way, I appreciate a more innocent take on a fox girl than Kanokon had to offer. I found that the story did a good job at capturing the image of a female college student who has wondered off to without any motive in mind, and comes accross a young girl who flatters her by addressing her as a sister. Clearly the girl looks up to Han Hui (the college student), and wishes to lighten her day.\n\nThis is were I address a bit of an annoyance, the wikapedia links. The graphic novel allows some room to learn about chinese culture, and for some references that wouldn't be universal knowledge, the virtual book provides some links for Background information. If you internet's not cooperating at the time, then you're really not must at luck. I'm sure that this is something they intend to fix in time or someone might create a mod to resolve. Regardless of that inconvience, the art of story telling does a good job at addressing that where He Jia (the young girl) took Han Hui is a sight of some historical importance that man within the area have visited as kids.\n\nI would say If anything, I had a love for the artwork as well as the peaceful classical styled music in the background. As for the voice acting, I would not recommend trying to learn or pick-up much chinese from this game, unless you're already trying for an advance level of language comprehension. It's understandable for the voice to be for the most time soft-spoken. My one issue with the artwork is about the same as the artwork for Sekirei, for whatever reason, Han Hui's nipple is somehow so distinguishable that it distorts the outline of her shirt. I do not care how big a women's nipple might be, and I scarely believe any woman's article of clothing would be that revealing or tight. I also have it on good autority that women often wear bras to cover that sort of thing. In the big scale of things, it's really not that much of a problem, and it seems to only be Han Hui design with that artistic detail. Perhaps it was from the dew or I never paid that much attention to modern fashion.  I also noticed that He Jia is also drawn a bit more mature than the age she's meant to be, My guess would be somewhere around 15.\n\nThe common complaint has often been that it was too short, and I felt almost like it was ended too early as well. Looking back at the price, I find considering what I often paided for each Manga that would hold about 4 chapters with no significant hold on an overall plot cost around 8-10 dollars. Too, looking at how much a DVD contain about as much as this novel, the price is quite high. So in the big scheme of things, the game's still worth the price, and plays out like a subbed anime where I don't have to put my speed reading skills to the test. The developers of the game also stated that a sequel may be on it's way, it might take a year, but it shows that there would be more to come.\n\nOverall: 6.5/10","January 4, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

We have a tale of a college-age woman returning to the place her family used to picnic at in better times, striving to recapture those idyllic feelings she remembers from her carefree childhood days, a quest aided by a mysterious girl of, according to our narrator, perhaps twelve or thirteen.\n\nSo, why no recommendation? Because of the disconnect between the character design and the story.\n\nBoth characters seem designed with fan service in mind, to the extent that our first meeting of the main character is a shot of her in a shirt sweaty and tight enough that her nipples are poking through. The '12 or 13' year old girl has a less outrageously busty but still well-developed hourglass figure and there's a scene where she inexplicably strips down to her underwear to swim and her underwear clings rather disturbingly close to her figure.\n\nThere's also a vaguely sexual feel to the interactions between the two main characters, particularly in the popsicle scene where the young girl insists if you suck really hard it's sweeter. Bleagh. I get that some people like fan service and if that's your thing, have at it, I guess. I'm not giving a negative review just because I'm not into it. I'm giving a negative review because the fan service is discordant with the rest of the feel the game strives for and detracts from the contemplative story.","March 8","false","2.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

For instance "Thank you" (in the speech as first part and in the translation at the end)\n\nBut, there's an option to switch voice off, if needed.\n\nAnyway, Shan Gui is a very nice visual novel with nice artwork and okay voice overs. There're some small production errors in the recordings like mic blows, but okay, who am I to pick on that?\nI would say: "Get it while it's on sale."","October 29, 2014","true","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Seeing how this game has no gameplay or choices whatsoever all that's left to judge is the aesthetics and the story.\nThe background art is the most impressive, showing off the beatiful environment the game is set in. Solid music fitting the setting too! Character art is okay, though there is very little of it.\n\nThose are the good things this game has to offer, the rest is subpar. The voice acting isn't great, kinda monotone and seems to lack emotion. Voice clips also include a lot of background noise, like cheap recording equipment was used. The story is not particularly interesting and the text is full of errors.\nThese glaring issues really hurt the overall package and based on that I would not recommend this game to anyone.\n\nThat being said this game has some value, but it's all in it's Steam content, not the game itself:\n- The Steam backgrounds are gorgeous, the emotes are nice if you want some manga style emotes.\n- Also includes 8 achievements which you are guaranteed to get by going through the story. Easy 100%\n\nGo check out the backgrounds and emotes on the Steam market if you're into the art style, and just buy those instead of the full game.\nIn case you're looking for cheap games to add to your 100% achievement list, consider picking this up just for that.","October 29, 2014","false","1.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShinjiKnox/recommended/307050/","ShinjiKnox","ShinjiKnox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShinjiKnox/","1136 products in account","Shan Gui is a short chinese Visual Novel, and while it doesn't last much, you will be glad that it doesn't take long to finish.\n\n\nStory:It is hard to talk about Shan Gui's story. At times, it seems plain bad, and sometimes even a bit good. In the end, it all falls short.\n\nIt feels like you are taking a tour through Wikipedia, and the whole story becomes overshadowed by the imprecise writing that can't focus on feelings, or the scenery. The characters will talk about all kinds of feelings, but you just can't relate at all. Not because there was not enough time, simply because it feels short, sudden and out of place.\n\nSound:At the start you can actually hear something. From the middle onwards, the whole background goes almost silent, or doesn't even stand out at all. You walk through many places, but it feels like you are deaf most of the time.\n\nThe voice actresses are not bad at all, however the amateur recording is enough to set your mind off the story to wonder if it is better muted or not. In this case, muted is better.\n\nMusic:A bit of effort went here, but not enough. The soundtrack is simple, but not capable of feeling.\nSongs repeat too often, and they just blend in (in a bad way) or loop strangely. It's not enough to make you mute the game, but it could be a lot better.\n\nGraphics:For a Visual Novel, the visual part was done well. Backgrounds are amazing, character sprites are nice (the eyes are a bit off, though) and there are plenty of great CGs.\n\nThe backgrounds and CGs are inconsistent between art styles, but this is a minor issue. Unfortunately it takes more than nice graphics to make a good Visual Novel.\n\n\nWrapping it up:Shan Gui is short, unfunny and can even manage to feel like it's being dragged off. Its half to one hour of reading are enough to make you think about just holding the skip button until you unlock all achievements.\n\nThe art is nice and feels good, but the visual novel falls short in every other category. The amauterish voice recording overshadows the potential of the voice actresses. The sound feels like it's not there at all. The story jumps through locations, feelings, monologues and convenient settings too fast, not giving you enough time to understand or relate with it.\n\nThe highest reward for playing Shan Gui is to enjoy a nice couple of CGs, and even a little fanservice. However it takes more than that to save a Visual Novel. $5 feels a bit too much for it, but it's definitely a title worth of checking out if bundled. For a dollar, why not?\n\nShan Gui gives the reader a subtle tip: you are better off enjoying your real life local scenery. Or maybe buying a Osmanthus crop is a better deal.\n\nScores:      Category     Score         Story      5/10          Sound      4/10          Music      6/10            Graphics       8/10               Overall        6/10","December 5, 2014","false","1.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

As it stands, it is comparable to some of the more poorly fan-translated manga/anime/visual novels I've seen.  It is it's good for cards/badges/emoticons and free achievements of course.\n\nIf you sometimes enjoy stories for what they could have been, inspite of what they are, like the aforementioned shoddily translated manga/anime/visual novels, then you can probably get something out of this.

I think the story is very cute, and I did not expect the end. Both the MC and Jia were well rounded and had different, yet well matched personalities. I would highly recommend this to all people interested in visual novels as it only has the single route with Jia.

Its like a good short book there are two girls and a lot of learning trust me its too much this now im not ganna talk about the story but the story is great. The only bad part is that its 2 HOURS long ! its a shame really i was really looking forward to what shan gui was all about but it is a virtal novel so i geuss its not suppose to be too long but still. This game gets a 6/10! give it a look. Now a 6/10 means in my scorebored means its good but has some flaws this games only flaws are its too short.

The story is a bit on the tame side, being just about a young woman trying to reconnect with a memory from her childhood with the aid of an excitable young girl she meets who has something strange about her, but it still packs a fair bit of emotion. The story really is a bit too simple (there's no conflict of any kind and the "twist" is predictable as all get out), but the soothing presentation invests you in the characters. In either case, it's short, cheap and you're better off having played it than not (unlike SOME games I could mention *coughSakuraSpiritcough* where you feel like you just burned an hour off your life that you'll never be able to get back) so it gets a thumbs up.
