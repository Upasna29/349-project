It's fantastic and you should buy it.\n\nI am a huge fan of Civ. I love the exploration, the gradual expansion, the sense of progress and increasing power.\n\nAs a Civ player I tend to turtle, that is, I like to build a solid and impenetrable perimeter before I expand further. Eventually, I'll push out to nab a bit of territory here, a strategic resource there. Over time, I'll get bigger and bigger, with every gain hard fought and locked down. Rebuild 3 might be my perfect game.\n\nAnother thing about Civ is that it is not intended to be a realistic government or historical simulator, I like the fact that Chairman Mao is fighting with Abraham Lincoln. I like the bright colours and the slightly irreverent tone. I don't need the game to include 'realistic' details like racism and slavery, and I don't mind the fact that swordsmen can occasionally kill a tank.\n\nRebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville is not a realistic zombie simulator, it contains cartoonish graphics, cannibalism, and over the top stereotypes. You can convert a field of rubble into a tower apartment block with a single builder. It's fun. Obviously, however, if what you're after is something dark, brooding and 'realistic', this game is not for you.\n\nOne more thing. The prequel, Rebuild 2 (AKA Rebuild Mobile, or just "Rebuild"), was a popular game on iOS and Android and Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville has also now been released on the same platforms. The mobile version is identical in every way to the PC version, and the game plays really well on the mobile. If you want your mobile games to stay on mobile then feel free to buy it there. But I'm mostly a PC player and I like my big screen and mouse control.\n\nRegardless, Rebuild doesn't feel like a mobile game in that it's not particularly 'clicky', menus work like PC menus and the interface works like a PC interface. Still, it doesn't have infinite tech trees or massive worlds or complex animation and that's a huge part of its appeal.\n\nBasically, if you're after a light 4X game with a very strong sense that you're always making progress, that doesn't become overwhelming towards the end game, that doesn't have dead time following an initial expansion/exploration rush, that strips out a lot of tedious micromanagement, and if you like your 4X games to completely play out in a couple of hours each, then this is your game.","May 29, 2015","true","73.0"," 231 of 255 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","231","255","10","12"

She finally struck out to create a full game of the series and here it is!\n\nThis is a turn Turn based or Real time strategy game. You start out with a few blocks of the city under your control and useing your survivors attempt to reclaim the entire city while trying to survive the zombies and other factions. There are different types of buildings, different types of survivors, and a variety of items to equip them with. Additionally there is research and a tech tree to go up unlocking new buildings and such. The survivors will also gain experience as you send them out on different jobs and you can choose new skills with that experience.\n\nI have had a ton of fun even in the earliest stages of the alpha (Woo for being a backer) and will certainly have tons more in this game before and after release. Hope this tells you about the game!\n\nEdit: Someone asked if there are new things from Rebuild 2? Yes!\nFrom Comments: Yes, most of the game is either expanded with new parts to it (such as survivors can now gain skills after gaining experience, new buildings, new items) to entire new things such as other factions to deal with, survivor traits, and new jobs for them to do. Most of the cooler ones are still in development but you can check the Coming Soon list on the store page to see what's planned.

There's something rather addicting about slowly but steadily expanding a town and leveling survivors. However, eventually you realize that's all there is to it. The "tech tree" is just minor upgrades, reactivating power and water are just happiness bonuses, maxing characters in a stat just makes them slightly better, and fighting/diplomacy with other gangs is tedious at best.\n\nI got it on sale and I don't regret it, but $15 dollars feels a little steep. Campaign will keep you around 30 hours, but you'll probably be bored before then.There just isn't enough content to keep me coming back. Perhaps if each of the in-game factions was playable with different playstyles... but they aren't.","November 4, 2015","false","27.7"," 157 of 194 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","157","194","3","3"

I loved the all the little touches, the artwork, the little jokes here and there, the mechanics of the game - I loved it all, it just kept getting better and better. So when I finally got my hands on this I was so excited.\nI'm not disappointed, don't get me wrong, but some things don't feel quite right, it wasn't as simple mechanics anymore and there is a lot more faffing around to do.\n\nFor example, the one that gets me the most is probably the characters backstories. I loved the idea of unique backstories to a character and getting a respective perk for backstory was great - but ultimately it became tedious to go through over and over again, searching for the people who needed an upgrade was a drag and I ended up either not doing it or not really immersing myself in the story.\n\nThe interactions between characters are also... well, not that interesting. It's nice to see people get married and stuff but there seems to be very little indicators leading up to that event, some mini bonus events that help you watch the love between couples grow before marriage would be quite nice.\n\nOn the other hand, interactions between people who hate each other are very frequent, and an absolute pain to sort out, because they tell you the names of the two people (and to be honest, with 40+ survivors, I don't learn names!) and nothing else - it doesn't show you where they are working on the map - I think a little icon saying 'there is conflict here' on the map would make everything a little easier to sort out. Maybe if you put people who like each other together you'll get bonuses on missions (less time to complete, more safety etc.) and it will show you on the map with a little smiley face or something - and vice versa for people who don't get on, so you can get a fair warning of when conflict will happen and manage your forces accordingly, it will pay to put those who like each other on the same team, or it will force you to spread your forces thinner so missions will get done.\n\nAnother thing... I adore the different factions idea, but I don't think they should be able to expand that easily. See, the game is supposed to be about zombie invasion, but really after 15 minutes of nitty gritty survival, the factions take over and its 'plop a survivor into leadership school so I don't go to war' - the zombies become non existant and you just fight factions for territory, it feels like thats a greater part of the game than the actual zombies are.\n\nAlso it seems like all the factions get along even though they are completely opposed, they only seem to have trouble with me - the technophobes and the technophiles get on fine, as do the rowdy rebel schoolboys and the oppressive government, but not my kinda neutral faction, I'm the only one who does wrong. Getting rival factions to hate each other and working that to your advantage or, it being your downfall as you have to take on two or more at once if they are allies, would add a new layer of depth to the game. You choices of friends and foes becomes more important.\n\nThe factions you befriend don't really have any special perks too, besides getting a few free resources (which is useful I guess, when materials become hard to find and you have a steady supply) - it would be nice if when you befriended a faction, say the Government, it provides a strength boost, or with the Pharmacists, death rate falls and injuries are quicker to heal.\n\nI absolutely love this game, don't get me wrong, but I just feel like so much more could be done with it! You can never stop improving a game, no game is perfect, I think it's fun to watch the game grow and develop in complexity, and for all my grumbles I'll still keep up to date with the game, and I'll still keep playing. Just needs more layers for me to sink my teeth into!\n","November 10, 2014","true","24.0"," 68 of 71 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","68","71","2","0"

Nice little personal touches with random background stories, perks and familial ties, feuds and friendships that form during gameplay.\n+ Persistent retinue in the campaign. You can usually take 3 followers with you to the next map.\n+ Factions are nicely unique from each other and sport different goals and motivations, which can be used to your advantage or depending on your gameplay, stir trouble with them and make them hate your guts.\n+ Long campaign with various subplots\n+ Research tree\n+ Personal equipment to every character to customize them.\n+ Nice illustrated graphics and clear interface and UI.\n+ Replayability with the random map gen function.\n\nCONS:\n- Some game functions are not necessarily instantly apparent or even explained to the player. For example, the loss of stats on your retinue members for balancing reasons between maps in the campaign.\n- The soundtrack gets a bit repetitive after a few hours.\n- After every map, you have to research everything again and again and again...\n- Turn-Based gameplay seems to work much better as opposed to the RTS timer, in which you have no idea when anybody is going to make a move and when.\n- The factions have no memory of your previous engagements with them, be it in alliance, indifference or bloody warfare\n- The last mission of the campaign can be a bit unrewarding storywise, considering the difficulty spike.\n\nOverall, I'd say the game is definitely worth a look for anybody who enjoys city management and zombie games, a dash of humour and reliance on your judgement to make best out of all the resources you have at your disposal.\n\nI also found the persistent retinue feature and survivor micromanagement very satisfying, although after the number of survivors climbs to dozens, it becomes quite hard to track the right people you're looking for without organizing the survivors into work gangs.\n\nHowever dissatisfied I may have been by the outcome of the story, it was still a good journey, eventful and at times lots of fun, despite the ever-looming aspect of dying of starvation, zombie bites or having your neighbouring gang turn you into a link of sausages. The side quests and writing made it certainly worthwhile- fresh in memory is one event in my early campaigning, when I lost my treasured top hat of office to domestic intrique.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dondics/recommended/257170/","dondics","Nagito","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dondics/","194 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt is fantastic to see Rebuild return to my screen, now in the form of a full browser title as opposed to a flash game. I had always been a fan of the series and I was delighted to see its triumphant return.\n\nI had not been a backer for the game, having only discovered its existance about three days before it's official Steam debut. I was however immediately excited, so I eagerly awaited the game and had it purchased within an hour or so of its release. I spent a short time playing it, just to get the gist of how everything worked, what had been changed, what was the same and all that stuff.\n\nFirst thing I noticed which I was mildly disappointed about was the graphics. Whilst they are pleasant to look at, that proves to be its downfall in my eyes. The first and second games were ultimately horror games with a lot of grim aspects which the graphics complimented. The people shown always looked ragged and realistic, which I felt sucked me into the experience. While it's still too early to say if the game's dark tone has changed, it currently appears to have become slightly more cartoonish and less gritty. Now, this doesn't ruin the game in any way, but it does kind of disappoint me.\n\nThe music also disappointed me slightly, being less dark in tone than the original. Of course this is personal preference and it in no way spoils the experience, but it does still warrant mentioning. It grows mildly repetitive, so it may be nice if future updates were to perhaps add multiple tracks or an extended version, just to keep up variety. As for general audio, there isn't any major emphasis which I understand and appreciate. The audio isn't where the heart of the game lies.\n\nThe gameplay itself is interesting. I switched the game to turn-based because that's how I had become familiar with the series. It is nice to see a game which gives the option between real time and turn based. When I got into the game, I could see that many mechanics had been made far more complex. In the originals, you were to click on a building, select a task which you wished to perform on that building, you would select the number of people you wished to perform that task and as you added more, the estimated time to completion got smaller. Now we have a combination of a variant of that and a click-and-drag system, in which icons of the characters are clicked and dragged to areas on the map. While it does work quite effectively, there was occassionally mild confusion when I for example, sent several people out on a single mission and was unsure of how to select them individually again. I don't know if I missed something, disabled something or if the tutorial simply needs a little tweaking. For the most part, things can be sorted through trial and error.\n\nAs can be seen immediately, many features of the game are still locked. Zombie attacks are only implimented in the sense that you are given an alert and then told that the feature has yet to be implimented. Character customisation is still extremely limited, which I hope will be changed with proceeding updates as it became slightly awkward as many characters looked nearly alike.\n\nConstruction now requires materials, which is a new aspect to gameplay. Buildings can be demolished to scavenge for new materials which can then be used to create new buildings which are of more use. I suspect that there are more ways to gather materials, but unfortunately my play session was not very long.\n\nOverall, I consider this to be a very good addition to the series which is let down purely by the fact that it is beta, which can hardly be claimed as the fault of anyone. I shall reccomend it on the basis of future updates. Fans of the original should pick up this title immediately, whilst those unfamiliar should perhaps wait a while until the game has been updated a little more.","May 16, 2014","true","0.4"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","41","44","0","1"

It takes little time to work out the mechanics the rest is mastering them.  I have an insane amount of time into this game already, and still continue to play it over and over.\n\nIt would be easy to see this as a quick sit down and play a game, but there isn't anything quick about trying to complete a full game.  You can easily find yourself spending an afternoon when you intended to only spend an hour.  You have little to regret.\n\nThe game is a real-time strategy where you start with you and three other survivors and you try to expand your territory and deal with zombies.  You can play with factions and they offer some interesting methods to play through.\n\nYour goal is to ally yourself with the other factions or to eliminate them, or ally with one and eliminate the other.  This completes the current game, allows you to leave and start a new city.\n\nThis is about making the best choices to make your survivors the most productive to advance your game.  Your survivors level and increase in skills, eventually getting storyline bonuses.  You can find stuff to help your skills and scavenge for materials to help build your city bigger and bigger.  Zombies have a few surprises and can be a bit to handle, but they are fairly predictable and slow giving you time to react.  Factions can either help you with trading or you can raid and war on them and  they are typically harder to deal with than zombies.\n\nThe best part of the game is it's great artwork, and its homage's to other zombie horror both films and games.\nThe worst parts can be some of the bugs but nothing making the game unplayable.  I've only ran into two cases where a game simply broke (would not finish properly) but as this game gets patched regularily they soon are no problem.  Of course this is still alpha/beta status so its silly not to expect bugs.  Still this is quite a polished effort and will provide hours of simple yet not boring gameplay.\n","December 27, 2014","true","481.3"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","39","46","4","0"

The user interface is a lot cleaner and easily navigatable, and having played this, I struggle to go back to Rebuild 1 on my ipad.\n\nHaving said that, here are some of my complaints.\n\nBuildings - There is no need to have more than one type of building beyond apartments and farms. It would be nice if we could have some building options that aren't just more food or more space.  I could build more bars or churchs, but they are kinda pointless if I dont have more leaders to stick in them (And leaders are generally the type of character I dont want more than one or two of). Some buildings that add to your overall base defense (as long as its on the border of your land) would be cool.\n\nGangs - I love the introduction of factions, and making allies is done really well. Fighting them, however, is kind of boring. You have to go through and take every property the enemy has, simply taking out the hedquarters doesn't suffice. This has lead to me allying with every single faction I can because going to war just takes far too long (and is probably harder too.  Maybe.  Niether option is particularly difficult).\n\nAside from those gripes, if this is your first foray into rebuild, I absolutely 100% recommend it. If you've played any of the previous ones and were indifferent, give it a miss for now, as there isn't really anything new.","April 30, 2015","true","30.5"," 41 of 50 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","41","50","0","0"

The game is near completion and there isn't anything that really differentiates or improves this game from it's free flash predecessors.\n\nIf you want to play Rebuild, find it on Kongregate - they're more serious, less cartoony, more realistic, and free.\n\n*8/31/15 Update - Revisiting the game and doubling my game time*\n\nI put 20 hours in the game in the past two weeks, doubling my game time, as the game has been fully completed.\n\nThe core of the gameplay is still the same, and if you liked the first two Rebuilds, you'll enjoy this one. That being said, the reason why Rebuild 3 is so addicting because it plays exactly the same as the first two Rebuilds. Building a strong community of survivors while reclaiming buildings for your base was the reason why the first two Rebuilds were addicting and it is the same for Rebuild 3. The new faction addition doesn't add much to the enjoyability of the game because it's repetitive and the novelty fades away faster than you'd like.\n\nThis game introduces factions, which you have to befriend or destroy, and the premise is exciting. Learning how to befriend these factions for trading and security bonuses for your base is very satisfying. However, forging alliances is formulaic - as long as you have a high level leader, craftable trading goods, and agree to all the demands of the faction leaders - you'll have an alliance before long. There are meaningful interactions with the faction leaders which make the faction system unique and interesting, but there aren't nearly enough of these. Each map in story mode is the same as the one before it and there isn't much variation to the gameplay. The result is an alliance system doesn't really add much to the game and Rebuild 3 falls short as a paid sequel.\n\nIn conclusion, Rebuild 3 is an addicting game that is a polished version of its predecessors. For what it is, Rebuild 3 is a fun game - a fantasy zombie survival. However I ask that you try the free prequels on Kongregate before you purchase, because the fun part of Rebuild 3 hasn't been changed since the first Rebuild.

While new technologies are unlocked in every city you travel to, your group apparently forgets all of the technologies along the way. Basically every new city you travel to is a completely new game, save for a couple of survivors and their gear. This constant need to build from the ground up, rather than being able to start somewhere in the middle quickly grows wearying.\n\nThe other complaint is the lack of differentiation. What I mean is (And has been mentioned by others) the buildings are rather boring. Apart from farms and apartments, you only need one of every other building. I get to the point where half my fortress is filled with parking lots and office towers, because until I need the space for something there's no point in coverting them\n\nConclusion: While an enjoyable game for a few hours, it rapidly grows old.

After spending plenty of time with the game, I came away with some very mixed feelings, because the core of what I enjoyed from the original games is still there, but I don't think it benefits from longer play-sessions or a sprawling campaign.\n\nGood:\n1. Storyline - I rather enjoyed the story that was threaded through the campaign, and there were a lot of great little touches of humor that went well with the game's cartoony style. I also enjoyed the attempt to make each character into a character (even if it was based on procedural elements).\n2. Gameplay - I rather liked the light-management aspects of the game, struggling to build up a self-sufficient colony while under assault from zombies.\n3. Art - I like the colorful and cartoony style\n\nBad:\n1. Progression - The campaign doesn't feature a very engaging progression system. Yes, research upgrades are gated during the first few levels and you can bring a few survivors along with your main from town to town, but those reached a peak midway through the campaign. With each new level you're also forced to climb back up the tech tree (granted, subsequent levels would be much easier if this wasn't the case).\n2. Repetition - Most of the levels play out in similar ways and they all kind of blurred together. You have your initial struggle for survival, followed by slow growth until finally you're rolling out acros the whole map. Levels mostly vary by size rather than by the kind of challenges they present to the player. All of this makes the game feel a little bloaty and the campaign overlong.","May 14","false","56.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

I recently reinstalled the game after not playing it since near when this review first was posted and the game has come a long way. Spoiler, if you were on the fence over buying it whilst it was in early access, you shouldn't be anymore. The game has furfilled what it promised and I'm glad to see it has been updated a fair amount since my last playthrough.*\n\n:Early Access Review:\n\nI finished it yesterday on normal and so far its improved on every aspect of the original 2. The new graphic style is very pleasing. The new way it handles time is much better in my opinion. Being able to be more precise for how long you send out survivors gives the game much more depth. The faction system is good, although they seem very predictable when at war.\n\nThe only issue that i have with it at the moment is just an event put into the game where survivors will hate eachother. Sometimes you will be finally reclaiming the building you've needed for ages and suddenly a survivor is injured for 3 days because they didnt get along with someone and had a fight. In a zombie apocolypse, i doubt people are going to fall out and beat eachother up instead of fighting for survival. All the other issues are bugs that should be fixed later on and thats fine. The skrimish mode (the only mode available at the moment) repeats itself however e.g. same events happen in every new game. I hope this isn't the case for other modes as after the first playthough, it can get quite boring getting the same "should we save the bunnies or eat the bunnies" event.\n\nOverall, zombie defence fans are fine to buy it in its current state. I have no doubts that it will be even better upon full release","October 26, 2014","true","55.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","2"

So glad to have actually found this after a mere google search. It's certainly worth the initial 15$ (Hopefully the upgrade option will stick around) if you enjoy this sort of thing.\n\nI still don't really know what has me stick to this 'franchise' as much as it does. From the variancy to the charming characters, this is a welcome expansion on Rebuild 2's systems. While I still play on easy, I found it more difficult to manage happiness this time around. All the more irritating when everyone and their mother were pining over being welcome on the plane I just found but took forever to rebuild.\n\nI never took much stock in the endgame scoring systems. I noticed I took a massive point hit for 'taking so long'. But I enjoy this game because I am a careful player. I scout, I wipe out zombies, and I clear the map because I enjoy doing so. Yet I'm penalized for taking my time and making sure my defenses are secure and not getting ransacked by angry factions. Okay then, sure. I'm not looking to be on any scoreboards, just looking to have fun.\n\nRegardless, I do imagine this game being very specific to the player. Replayability with this series is at all time high with every save game being fully customizeable from the number of factions you have to deal with, to the size of the city.\n\nI recommend playing Rebuild 2 first (If you haven't) and after a couple (Or a few) hours, you find yourself desiring more...

Now, I'm not bashing on religion here, but I really wish that this game could have offered what was offered in Rebuild 2 with the Cultists. (The ability to destroy any and all Cultist crap)\n\nI had a selection of 5 people gathered from the start, it went down from 5 to 4 by default, and then one of my builders (One soldier, one builder, myself, scavenger, and a scientist) had a kid, and we couldn't take that child on further missions. Left him behind in the 2nd city. We continued on, and when we got the world of the Cultists, my whole population turned.

If you like a more casual take on games, you probably like it better than me.\n\nAlso I think it is too easy on challenging difficulty & becomes very repetitive after you played like 2 or 3 towns in the campaign. Arriving at the 5th town on challenging diff, I haven´t lost anyone of the ~150 people I was commanding until then in different towns and setups - this should speak for itself. Always the same procedure, secure food supply. Create surplus, buy anything you want from factions. No challenge & no suprises in that. If zombies ever get through a weak spot in your wall they just take away 1 field which is irrelevant because you own something like 30 anyway and retake it within 45 seconds. Always liked the start better than mid to late game like in most games where the survival challenge prevails...\n\nThe towns and characters are RND generated but that doesnt help much as you quickly learn the components they consist of by heart.\nThe story writing is pretty good & heavily inspired by the walking dead. The humor is the best thing about this game but you won´t read the same stories over and over again so you just click them away and the grinding (assigning tasks) remains. Actually the writing was the reason why I kept playing since I wanted to explore some quest lines and because I´m an hopeless addict to vid games in general.\nThe weakest part IMO is, when you expanded a big fort in a city and are just waiting to finish quest lines parts with your leaders - being just a matter of time - and when you start hating the timer for not allowing you to talk to a faction again while there is nothing other left to do..","October 31, 2015","false","46.5"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

It borrows the principles of tower-defense, but the goal is not to outlast the horde. Rather, you have to dig into it and reclaim the territory. The gameplay is fun, elegant and original.\n\nRebuild tries to tell a story too. The stories are well-written and mostly interesting. That is somewhat ruined by the fact that, too often, it assumes that I care about my survivlings on a personal level. I don't. I really don't know who "Liz Chambel" is. She came with a bunch of unskilled recruits and she's going to die before the end of the game (I play on higher difficulties). Working her randomized name into a story only serves to confuse me. Maybe if the game's technology allowed me to see her do stuff in the fort then I would notice. But now she's just a portait I move around.\n\nI would rather the dev had polished the way events are presented.

The flash version can be found all over the web for free and I believe the full version of Rebuild 2 is playable on steam through a package offer with the third one. If not, I apologize for constantly referencing this game.\n\nUsually, I would start my review with an explanation on what the game is. However I honestly want to get my issues with it off of my chest first.\n\nMy main gripe about this game is how far it strays from the second version. On pen and paper, it seems like the second game with obvious improvements, however that is just not the case. The general art and atmosphere in the game is different. The pace of the game is different, for sure. The turn-based timing is gone and a continuous real-time thing is introduced. Sure, turn-based is an option that you can put it back to in the settings, but you can obviously tell how much the game doesn't encourage it as it messes with the values of things in the game in order to work. I personally would have rathered the developers that the "3" out of the title and just make it Rebuild: Gangs of Deadsville.\n\nMy secondary gripe is simply the fact that there is a lot of cosmetic and flow issues that the game has. And not to mention, these flaws were in the previous game as well. For starters, there is almost no coordination with how characters are designed and how the city is laid out. You can have 5 farms side by side in the smack middle of the city and seemingly bipolar generation of basic infrastructure. And with characters, the character may sport a police uniform and vest, but his backstory will say how he was a hick pig farmer that despised the urban setting. Oh, and for frankly a lack of reason the game will set his job as "engineer". You can get all kinds of wacky combinations. With everything. Have you seen a city laid out with five police stations within the same small section of the city? Well, you are probably about to.\n\nMy third gripe, is how the game does not seem to care about the second gripe. It just doesn't matter or affect the game at all that there is a lack of organization for anything. The backstories seem randomly assigned with little influence, and combined with the fact that the game makes you choose how their character's trait list develops AFTER you develop their skills and equipment is annoying. (Oh, you didn't have your backstory unlocked yet, so I decided that you will become a fighter, and have this assault rifle to take with. Oh wait, you want to become a pacifist who refuses to use weapons and would rather handle negotiations with other enclaves? Too late.)\n\nHonestly, this game is great and was hard to put down. But asthetically the game is a rough block of wood that is yet to be shaped and sanded. The fact that the majority of the characters wear some kind of biker leather is annoying as well, as the spikes that they have are just simply not smart and overly cartoonish.\n\nOther than all of those things, the game is simply a must have. Although if I was told to recomend a defense game with concentration on development as apposed to combat, I would still tell people to play Rebuild 2.\n","November 13, 2014","true","12.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

I felt like I was truly helping with fun developers make something new and improved in a series they've been using as a juggernaut.\n\nHowever, perhaps I overestimated how in-depth the game would be. As a few other people have mentioned, the gameplay becomes extremely repetitive once you play through at least 3 or 4 cities. It's still fun to play, and at least a decent way to think about how you use resources, but outside of the plot, there's not much else to it.\n\nEarlier, I mentioned I put $20 to the kickstarter. According to the kickstarter page, I would have access to the alpha (which I did) and later the Deluxe Edition when the game finally came out. I've received no notification to this day of such a thing, meaning I essentially paid $5 more for the final product than the average player. Doing some research, I found others experienced this problem and tried inquiring, only to get handwaved away. In short, I find that's a bit of a backhanded move on the devs' parts. Whether they deliberately held back on their end or simply bungled the situation, it really makes it difficult to want to put faith in any future titles they put out.\n\nAnd speaking of the price, $15 is a bit steep for a game that has a total of maybe 20 hours outside of free-play mode. I get that you need to put food on the table and make sure to have enough for travelling, but the simple fact of the matter is at $15, it's not worth it.\n\nSorry, Ms. Northway, but I'm gonna have to give a Thumbs-Down for this. :\ The quality of the game and the price you're demanding for it could be overlooked if you had at least delivered for the kickstarters.","February 21","false","308.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

You can even get into a relationship and marry another member of your group. At the end of the scenario you escape to the next town with a handful of the group you were with before. The thing about this, the people you take are randomised after the first couple of towns. So you have a partner and you've grown some people into high stats with some good gear who will be very useful in the next town, especially early on. As you enter the new town you find out that you've left them all behind and brought with you three level one leaders instead.\n\nThe research tree just becomes frustrating later on. Every time you enter a new town you seem to just forget everything you've learnt from the previous one, even if one of the scientists randomly starts with you. Personally, a research system that takes weeks instead of days but stays with you through the course of the scenarios would have sat a lot better with me. Even if it took months, if it was a life long lesson learnt it would be more of a slog but more satisfying.\n\nWhile each map is randomly generated, sadly the gameplay has little variation. The objectives to win are the same for each level, a couple of maps have an alternate way out. The first of the alternative way can turn out to be a bit of a ♥♥♥♥ move if you're not prepared for it, you can still progress through the normal manner but it's a bit of a zombie hell which makes the normal way a lot more difficult.\n\nPersonal account\n\nI'm around three quarters through the main campaign and the mechanics of throwing zombies en masse is becoming tiring. You have two main dangers from the undead, "Massed zombies" which are zombies at the border who have grown in number and are close to breaching the walls. Simple enough mechanic and easy to deal with at first. There's also ways to reduce this threat. Let's get too the late game scenario, with the handful of survivors you start with I had one pop up within minutes. Easily dealt with, immediately after that another popped straight up followed by a second one. Expansion was a little slow but any progression is good. While dealing with this the other main threat popped up.\n\n"Mobbed zombies" which are a group of zombies placed randomly on the map who charge straight for your nearest fort space. Nothing will stop them as they will even barrel through other factions squares, doesn't matter if there's a faction squad on the square, they will just blink the square away into neutral ground and keep coming making it your threat to deal with. Early on these are pretty easy to deal with, let's get back to late game.\n\nNow at this point I'm not that far into the scenario, I only have half the squares I need to build a special building which permits interacting with other factions. I'm already dealing with a trio of constantly spawning massed zombies, now dealing with mobbed zombies. Progression slows as I'm trying to keep the ground I've covered. Ten seconds after the mobbed zombies have been dealt with another popped up. In the space of ten minutes progression is pretty much halted as I'm now dealing with five massed zombies and constant mobbed zombie attacks. Not to mention a faction is sending a raiding party to my fort every minute or so, oh wait, they just sabotaged my laboratory now I'm losing ground.\n\nConclusion\n\nNow I didn't expect the late game stages to be a cake walk, I was just hoping it would be more of a challenge than just throwing ridiculous amounts at you. There are ways to reduce threats, but with not even a couple of dozen survivors having to stave off dangers from seven different sides all at once... I think I'm going to leave it here, this isn't a bad game. I just can't recommend it as being a good game either though.","May 24","false","21.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

You are a survivor of the zombie apocalypse, rebuilding the city around you. This can be in standalone quick play, or in multiple cities as you progress through a storyline in campaign mode, attempting to find a cure and save the world (of course!) You do this by recruiting people and setting them on tasks. Each person has different skills and perks, and the tasks involve expanding your territory whilst ensuring that you are well defended, have food, building supplies and that your populace is happy (harder than it sounds especially with a larger group to manage). On Easy, there is very little you can do wrong, but you can set the difficulty level up and on hard, it's very difficult indeed. Every single move you make you'll need to look at all the angles. As your city expands, you have more people to manage, and more threats to come in, from zombie attacks, as well as multiple factions. You'll need to decide whether to go for diplomacy or fight; and you then need to manage your political manifest that will affect your populace city-wide.  There's also a skill tree that you research at, a workshop with some crafting items, and a variety of buildings you can choose to build with their own advantages.\n\nYou'll get random events that pop up, ranging from the predictable to the very odd, with some tongue-in-cheek silly humour, quirkiness, and also some quite touching backstories to the characters. Your citizens will periodically want to chat to you about their past, which unlocks perks for them, as well as random events with them, where the decisions you make will have permanent affects. On the surface it seems like a fairly shallow amount of moves you can make each turn, but at higher difficulty levels, as your city progresses, the amount of strategy is actually quite complex. It's shockingly easy to make a mistake on the hardest difficulty setting that will send you into a spiral of doom and gloom. Citizens rioting, Z hordes amassing and factions baying for your blood. Send help, please!\n\nHowever; the one major downside it has is that it is reptitive. Playing through the campaign offers multiple cities, and gameplay in each city starts out the same, although there are different objectives. Because of this the first part of every city felt like I was simply doing stuff I'd done before to expand my base and set the city up. It only becomes more exciting once the random events start rolling in and since these are pooled from a set of scripted events you will eventually experience them all, and some of them seem to occur quite frequently. Once you've completed the campaign, you can always play it again on a harder difficulty, or play random maps through the quickplay function, but I can definitely see this getting a bit samey and monotonous.\n\nValue is obviously entirely subjective and if you're not sure if this game is worth whatever the current asking price is - simpler javascript versions of Rebuild 1 and Rebuild 2 are available on Kongregate.com. Rebuild 3 has considerable more depth and a full length campaign, but if you just want to try the gameplay out and get a feel for the game, head over to Kongregate and try out the previous completely free iterations first so you can experience the style.\n\nA definite recommendation for me - an addictive game that offers a ton of strategy and challenge beneath the surface.","February 25","true","15.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","2"

But that's not fair, because it's actually surprisingly a good pc game. The gamestyle is casual, but has just enough RPG elements to make it interesting while not overburdening with complexity.\n\nRebuild3 is centered around managing a gang of survivors within a city. You control their equipment and assign them to missions. Each has five skills (combat, building, scavenging, leadership and engineering). Each member has an specific skill they are good at and can improve with the corresponding related mission. For example, you send fighters to attack zombies or builders to claim an empty buildings. Adding additional crew to a mission improves the rate of success. Over time, crew assigned to missions together may become friends or enemies (influencing happiness).\n\nThroughout the game, you are presented with decisions how to lead people (e.g. help strangers vs being cautious). Once you succeed in a city, you learn a little more of the story and move on to the next city, leaving behind most of your gang. There are different endings based on your decisions.\n\nCons:\nThere are too many cities and the campaign takes too long time to complete.\nWish it had a higher difficulty setting (impossible is very possible).\nOverall, I would recommend Rebuild 3 if you want to play something slightly casual or if you like management sims. If you prefer action, this game is probably not for you.\n","February 7","true","107.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I was playing Rebuild II again a couple days back when I realised Rebuild III was out. I bought it the very same day. I have to admit the game seems a tad harder than previous installments, love the added functionality though.\n\nI decided to start a new city, with a couple of my home boys. We were doing well, expanding to twice our size and the zombies came. We pushed them back easily, with the 2 new lads from the nearby apartment. I decided to send a group of these young punks to clear out the zombies and ya know gain some much needed experience in zombie killing. Well, one of them screwed up real bad and got lost in the mall, we never heard of him again. Then my 2IC went and got himself bitten, I thought, "hey, he should be big enough to know what to do", and left him be. He became a zombie the next day, injuring the builder midway through his rampage and we had to put him down. Then a couple days later, a young man came along, and asked to join us if we could feed him. I acceded to his request and decided to send him a couple blocks down to bring some more survivors in. He brought no one back, and managed to get killed in the process. I realise things were pretty dire, considering that we had 3 men guarding 8 blocks of our territory, We couldn't keep the zombies out, and now our territory looks like a jigsaw puzzle. Oh wait did I mention that the boys get hospitalised for depression? It's Day 102 in Farmsville, we are going to take our own lives.

There were a lot of additions in the new rebuild, the idea is old but what they have done with it is remarkable. They didn’t just make the game prettier, but more customizable and more of a story.\n\n+ The story of Rebuild is rather simple; zombie apocalypse, rebuild humanity, the end. But it is what you do to rebuild the city, your friends will die along the way, you will meet enemies or allies, an occasional visitor at your base, which might waste away your food, medicine or ammunition. They constantly give you circumstances which make you question yourself, ‘who should do the job?’ or ‘should you do it at all?’ Even the characters are given stories that you can choose which affect their specialties.\n\n+ There are a lot more things to do in the new rebuild, if you are near the coast, go fishing instead of farming, or if you have a plain, do some steady hunting. With more variety, you treat things differently.\n\n- The sound doesn’t need to be criticized, as this is a strategic game where music isn’t a big part; personally I play with the music off, as it is slightly distracting. But the sound effects sound great, the zombies sound proper but the game does lack sound, because the game is rather quiet and the music it provides feels out of place. I do not know how to recommend an improvement but maybe just add something to hear.\n\n+ Gameplay is quite smooth but you have to consider so many things the deeper you get through the game, because you have to face so many things and you have to choose the right people, or probably you have so many citizens but keep forgetting to use them. If you want a fast paced strategy game, this game isn’t for you, as it requires some thought. You can change the pace of the game, but when you set to the slowest speed for the game, the game feels so dull.\n\nOverallSince the game is in early access, and I am a fan of the Rebuild Series and have played it so many times on Kongregate, I think they are making well progress with the game and I expect great things to come with it, although I feel that there shouldn’t be a deluxe edition personally, because you don’t really receive much from it.\n\nAnd since it is still being improved, there are a few suggestions that I have been wanting for Rebuild since the second instalment, multiplayer mode. Much like Civilization, I want to see two random players go head-to-head as who can win and be the leader of the city, because a single gamemode can be rather dull. Also I think the title needs some work, “Gangs of Deadsville”…I think the developers can do better than that. I don’t know what else can be added but if they continuously add great content, I feel this game would be an amazing standalone game well worth the price. I strongly recommend following and possibly getting this game, even at early access if you love strategy games, zombies, and the rebuild series.","January 9, 2015","true","0.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It gets a 7 out of 10 from me.\n\nThe premise is simple - you're one of the survivors after the zombie apocalypse and you go from town to town, creating a safe zone in any given city. The game has some complexity to it - there are 5 different skills (combat, scouting, engineering, building and leadership) but NPCs can only have one of these. Their skill improves the more they use it. You, however, can use all the skills and you'll slowly build up where you want your character to focus.\n\nThere's equipment, from simple guns to swords to hammers to walkie-talkies, and you can assign this equipment to your survivors to make them more effective. In any given city, you start off with a very small territory and you slowly claim other buildings and recruit survivors. You'll meet other factions - none of whom are all that interesting - and you'll constantly balance all the needs of your colony. When you need to pull back, where you should expand, how you should react to certain situations...it's all up to you, grand leader.\n\nAnd it's fun, frankly for longer than it probably should be. You'll probably have a good time expanding your base, launching attacks into zombie hordes, keeping your fingers crossed as they storm the barricades, etc. The sound and cartoony visuals work pretty well here and the whole package feels fairly complete. It's a good game design that will keep you enterained and that's why it's getting the thumbs up.\n\nHowever, this is a 7/10 game for a few reasons.\n\n(1) A couple of the early scenarios throw in a few curve balls. They're interesting and it really helps the game. Except less than halfway through the game has run out of tricks and every single scenario is pretty much the same thing. Thus the approach, the tactics and the game become exceptionally formulaic and you'll probably sleepwalk through pretty much the last half of the scenarios (until perhaps the last one, which has a new curveball). I had to stop playing multiple times due to falling asleep at the keyboard due to boredom because the game had nothing new to offer.\n\n(2) The story, sparse to begin with, is basically hidden. To succeed you'll have to look up the Wiki and follow the step-by-step instructions. The game itself does an exceptionally poor job - actually, it doesn't do the job at all - of leading you towards a victory. It's a really poor oversight and if you're not reading the Wiki the only way you'd stumble towards any kind of positive ending would be 100% due to blind luck. There were plot threads that never, ever happened during my time in the game and thus any chance of a positive ending was denied due to bugs, RNG or whatever was supposed to trigger an event and didn't. That's just exceptionally poor execution by the dev - don't hide your plot or the threads that lead to a good or bad ending and expect people will just do the play-by-play from a Wiki because you can't be bothered to code it.\n\n(3) It's not that challenging. I started the first map on Easy to get the hang of it. The next one was Normal. The next one was Hard (and the achievement never triggered). You get the point. And with the exception of one early scenario I was never put back on my heels or afraid for my colony. I used the same gang tactics over and over again. Have one builder. Make your own character a combination of a scout/leader/soldier. Build up an engineer. Make almost everyone else a defender. Wash, rinse and repeat. That's the game, folks.\n\nI played the game all the way through but frankly the last 1/3rd of it was me forcing myself to get to the last city (Vancouver). But given what I paid (on sale) and the time I got out of it, I figure it was money well spent.","March 20","true","29.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

In it, you rebuild a city after a massive disaster. You have to balance survivor happiness, defenses around the base, and the other factions. This game is very enjoyable to sit down for a while and play, and then pick up later. Or even to go through one long run, as the game does not have to be very long. I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in an interesting zombie survival sim.","December 14, 2014","true","12.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Before I bought this I played the original flash version on a website, and that hooked me. So I got this game in early acess to support the development.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun. Managing how many farms you control to keep food supply up, deciding which block to reclaim next. Do you get a new apartment or do you get a hospital?\n\nYou start off with 4-5 survivors, usually 1 leader, 2 soldier, 1 builder, 1 scavenger. You also start off with 5 tiles that are yours. When you kill all the zombies in an adjacent tile you have the ability to reclaim that tile. This builds a wall around it and allows you to use that building. This is how you expand. You can also change any building into something else, such as converting a restaurant into a hospital.\n\nAfter a while hoards of zombies will start arriving and you will have to defend againt them. Did you recruit enough survivors to be able to defend and expand?\n\nI don't write reviews, but this one was good enough to deserve one.\n\nSide Note: At the time of writing, the main bug was a "lack of memory" pop up that forces you to restart the game. Usually just hitting ctrl+enter fixes it by shifting from windowed to full screen and vice versa. If that doesn't work a quick relaunch will start you off at the point where the game crashed.","June 29, 2014","true","22.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Used in Defense events and for crafting useables. as well as Materials, which you need to build building, build add-ons and reclaim new areas.\nWhile base resources can be crafted with the right know-how, you'll still have to scarvenge for them.\n\nNext change - where in the old games Materials not scarvenged were lost after reclaiming you can safely scarvenge reclaimed areas.\nAnd the next big change, which adds a lot more planning to the game - There are other cites in the making.

I realized that this fight was hopeless when I look at my little island comprised of a few unarmed but talented survivors that were able to keep the zombies at bay but could not expand the land. I would have to look them straight in their tear stranded faces and tell them that everything is ok, and our lord and savior debug will return.

Debug was a great companion that reminded me this world had hope for our future and that future was busty Amazon women with katanas. Now debug has left us, I have nothing more to do then pray in one of the many abandoned churches and pray to debug for his return.

It does what it does decently well, but there's absolutely nothing that's impressive, even if you are just looking for another Rebuild title. You kill zombies.

It will be better when it is completed. Though more cartoony than the last game, it still can carry the a serious tone. The addition of Factions make this game amazing. Instead of just worrying about the zombies of the area, you have to worry if you can handle the faction that you are next to.  The fact that each facion has these quirks, like the Luddites trading you mannuer for medicine or the Government claiming one of your guns as their own, just gives them this personality that is really cool. I will admit that there are some bugs but this is an EARLY ACCESS. I would be amazed if it didn't.

There are tons of things I loved about Rebuild and it might have been that I put my expectations to high, when those very expectations are being realesed in the Alpha version.\n\nDoing my best to keep it spoiler free.\n\nWhile I favored the animations of 1 & 2 over this one I still found the graphics "okay". The newest features of Ammo, Fuel, Materials, and Medkits I find near to irrelevent, howevor I can see it becoming more of a nessesity in the future. I wouldn't mid seeing uses of vehicles (I have no idea how that would work) for the fuel as throughout the game I found fuel to be nothing but a trading commodity. I'm going to have to slam Northway on an issue that has been brought too her attention time and time again and that is the ENDING! It's...just...so...nothing. I remember the days of Rebuild 1 & 2 when you would see a see a short cartoonish clip of the ending and while the ending are still being made up I REALLY don't want them to be anything like this. Its just dissapointing and I would like to see a short motion featurette similar to that of Left for Dead campaign endings.I now bring up the madman attacks. This crazy feature makes no sense of why and how to prevent and I would love to see some more information on what this event is. Alot of people have asked if this game is REALLY worth 15 bucks and to those people I say, "NAY". I find this worth 10 at a reasonable estimate based on the material inside.\n\nOverall I recommend this game (even though it doesn't sound like I do), it's FAR from finished and I hope the other half of Sarah Northway's book is FULL of material she will be pouring out into it.\n\nYours truly, Princess\n6/10 Would come up with a better ending again!","September 13, 2014","true","164.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scauthra/recommended/257170/","Scauthra","Sly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scauthra/","141 products in account","Like others, I first played Rebuild and Rebuild 2. I completely missed the memo that there was a 3 on Steam until the Winter sell happened. Oh boy did I get my immediate moneys worth.\n\nI'll start with the things I am not impressed with. The music. It's just not that fantastic in my opinion. I muted it and played my own music, which might have helped to increase the overall experience for me. I played this game in two four hour sittings already and I can say my own music helped immerse me far more than the games soundtrack.\n\nNow for the good.\n\nIf you ever played Rebuild 1 or 2, you can say good bye to the 'normal' flash graphics and welcome the same style, but more refined. The controls are super simple, and the ease of use between the GUI and the map is fantastic. I can quickly and simply execute any command I want without to much hassle. The only hiccup would be with quickly checking my survivors happiness. This minor annoyance is saved due to the fact all the menus open and close instantly, so I don't feel like I am bogged down waiting for things to load or transition.\n\nThe gameplay for the uninvolved is easy. You have 5 trades. Builder, Scavanger, Guard, Engineer and Leader. They all can do each others jobs, but whatever role they specialize in will yield faster and better results. You want your builders to improve buildings, reclaim territory, hunt or chop wood. You want Scavengers to scout, collect goods and farm. Guards to protect your settlement from hoards or mobs, or to clear zombie nests faster. Engineers to do your research or fix key buildings on the map. Leaders for trade, recruitment and negotiations.\n\nYou start with 5 'squares'. Your goal is to reclaim more squares to build up your settlement. You'll find survivors, supplies, zombies, and other factions along the way. Each square has a property to it that helps you in some way, or at least has some flavor to (like a movie theater. It serves no purpose, but you can rebuild it to be a farm or church). The balancing act is deciding what to reclaim first. What to rebuild. Who to assign to what. What items during your hunts do you equip to who?\n\nOne of the main driving factors of the game (besides the zombies) is the random events. You'll get prompts. Ranging from 2 or more options. Depending on the action, or skill of your character affected. You may get only 1 due to unfortunate events, or 5 with a great chance of rewards. Do you give food to that random stranger who showed up at your gates and let them stay the night? Will the rob you? Give you a chainsaw? Join your struggling community? Let the zed in?\n\nThe game can be as fast or as slow as you want it. The default speed makes the time bo by 15 minutes. I play an hour a second for my speed and I enjoy how fast paced the game can be when your settlment grows large. Of course you can pause at any time during your micromanagment. You can play at any pace you desire and should find enjoyment all the same.\n\nIf I were to really get you to take a chance with this game, then I feel you would havve made the right choice. Even if you waste 3 hours of fun with it before you give it up, I believe your money would be well spent. The personal stories of your survivors (new to the series) helps give it more life. The story mode is fun, if not rather normal for this genre. Customization is not stellar, but satisfying.\n\nHere. Consider this your free demo for the game. Rebuild 2. If you enjoy it, just imagine it with more options and fluditiy!\n\nhttp://www.kongregate.com/games/sarahnorthway/rebuild-2","December 23, 2015","true","13.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Combining both zombie survival and strategy, the player is put in charge of a small group of people who have fenced off a small part of a city, and must make their way to reclaiming it from the zombies.\n\nA great upgrade from the old flash games too, there are many new features that will help the player dive into the world, and try to protect their people. Whether you play as a kind person who will live harmoniously with the other factions, or a power hungry person who won't share with anyone, Rebuild will cater to your playstyle, and meet you with new challenges along the way.\n\nI definitely recommend this game for everyone, but definitely to those who love a good strategy based game.","June 15, 2014","true","61.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What are the actual consequences of my actions?" It has a silly style that really works well with the gruesome themes that you see throughout the 3 games.\n\nEven though I think there should be more choices/policies, and actual devestating/drastic alterations that should come from these choices, it is a pretty decent game overall, and I have tons of fun playing it.\n\n-IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THE OTHER TWO AND AREN'T SURE IT WILL BE THE SAME GAME YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH-\n\nIt is, it really does stick to the same concepts that the other games had, but with even more features.

You control several characters with different specializations: fighters, builders, scavengers, researchers and leaders. With these guys you restore a town building by building, fighting hordes of zombies, dealing with other human factions and occasionally making a moral choice.\n\nThe game is simple - it doesn't demand much of your effort to be played and, at least, several first hours of it are entertaining. Sometimes even tense. But I remind you that it's a CASUAL game. It has casual challenges that very soon become repetitive and lose all intrigue. It has casual story, somewhat spiced with the short personal stories of your team, that cannot make any big difference. I started to feel bored already in the third town (out of a dozen towns available).\n\nBuy it if you like games with shallow ideas and simplistic mechanics. I mean, it's really one of the most interesting games among the casual ones I've seen before.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ekleziast/recommended/257170/","ekleziast","ekleziast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ekleziast/","108 products in account","It's a casual strategy game about Zombie Apocalypse. You control several characters with different specializations: fighters, builders, scavengers, researchers and leaders. With these guys you restore a town building by building, fighting hordes of zombies, dealing with other human factions and occasionally making a moral choice.\n\nThe game is simple - it doesn't demand much of your effort to be played and, at least, several first hours of it are entertaining. Sometimes even tense. But I remind you that it's a CASUAL game. It has casual challenges that very soon become repetitive and lose all intrigue. It has casual story, somewhat spiced with the short personal stories of your team, that cannot make any big difference. I started to feel bored already in the third town (out of a dozen towns available).\n\nBuy it if you like games with shallow ideas and simplistic mechanics. I mean, it's really one of the most interesting games among the casual ones I've seen before. But for me it's clearly not enough to enjoy it for long.","September 2, 2015","false","15.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The difficulty level is high. This game is as challenging, as the graphics are simple. It catches you up into its storyline and before you know it you find the play as challenging as any hardcore game. Rebuild 3 is not casual!!!\n\n2). This game is balanced. Rebuild 3 is not a game where you can concentrate on one area of developement. Neglecting one area of the game will have consequences. The game is not linear, and you can't get through with a linear strategy.\n\n3). The theme is a whimsical countercultural romp with cartoonish noir graphics. I read one conservative Christian complain about how two of the "bad guy factions" were a fundamentalist motorcycle gang and the government. One of the "good guy" factions gets their name from combining the luddites with the hippies. This game was not meant to venerate Mom, Apple Pie, and America. This is a game where dressing up in "Free Tommy Chong" T shirts, and chowing down on a pint of Ben & Jerry's is a fun evening. I'm not going to knock the pledge of allegiance, but this is not the game to start with that.\n\nIf you don't like your funny games with a dash of hardcore play, or you can't enjoy post apocalypse games that don't espouse traditional American values. This game is not for you. Those of us who enjoy this game are freethinkers, who like playing with a sense of accomplishment. If you like your "funny" games casual, or think that the zombie apocalypse must reaffirm "traditional" values, This game will not make you happy!\n\nIf you like doing your own thing, playing a game that gives you a sense of achievement when you win, and poking fun at "The Man." This is your game dude(tte).","August 9, 2015","true","10.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

It's definitely going to be better than the previous Rebuild 1 & 2, but still needs some work balancing.  I really enjoy playing.

They distract you from the really creative character backgrounds.  Also, in the long game it gets a little unsatisfying.  There is not the balance yet between the large and small games to keep the mood going.  It's really fun to start the large games and get established, but while the "gangs" are difficult to beat back, there is not much story to that part yet, so it is not very satisfying to keep playing against the rival gangs.  It's much more satisfying to just bribe them into being friendly then end the game and start a new one.  There should be some more chaos to the way the opposing gangs behave.

This game has everything you'd want in a survival game:\n- Zombies are tough to defeat\n- You will lose buildings you've tried to reclaim\n- You'll have trouble getting all of the essential buildings you need\n- Survivors will die\n- There are communal pop-ups that actually matter\n- You can actually make a permanent shelter with regenerating materials\n- You can't win the game in just a few hours\n- You can lose the game in just a few hours\n- It's everything other zombie survival title tried to do, and some\nBut I cant seem to get past the "Super Zombies" feature.  It's a good idea, and is a tough mob to fight, but... you can't kill it without bombs (which destroys that building).  If you do try to attack them, you'll get 5/6 of the way done, and then they'll move to a different square.  They are naturally drawn to noise, also, so, if you're trying to reclaim a building, or scavenge somewhere, then they will one shot you.  Literally one shot you.  So at the moment, the game breaks if you have a super zombie problem.\nI really hope that they fix this problem so I can actually play the game, but once it does get a fix, I reccomend you get the game.  It has a lot of potential;  it probably has more than most early access games.  And they make updates persistently which is even more of a reason to buy it.\nI think it's worth the high price tag of 14.99 since it's basically a finished game, with few bugs, and very few exploits -- if any.  The price tag will raise to 24.99 undoubtedly.\n9.5/10 IGN  "Not enough 360 noscopes, don't buy, terrible title.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

That's not fair to the game or to the developer, but I just didn't have fun with it.  Zombie survival games are incredibly difficult to get right, because what people want out of them is different for each person.\n\nOne of the problems I had is that I feel like I didn't understand the mechanics very well.  What should I be doing?  Clearing zombies?  Recruiting followers?  What do my different supplies do?  Why can't I reinforce my walls to make my settlement safer?  Maybe it's the limitations of the story campaign that I didn't like.  Another problem is that if you don't get lucky with finding the right survivors the game is much harder than it should be.  Even on easy it's tough.","December 4, 2015","false","2.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Big campaign, at least 30 hours.\n2. Factions, diplomacy, trading etc.\n3. Perks and personalities.\n4. Definitlely has a lighter, more relaxing art style than the nightmare fuel called Rebuild 2.\n5. You generally win by building a city hall and allying/evicting all other factions instead of the different variation victories in Rebuild 1 and 2, such as Killing the Last Judgement Gang in Rebuild 2 and Closing the evil portal of zombies (whatever that was.).\n6. Modding support.\n7. More references to movies etc.\n\nApart from these points mentioned, it's very similar to previous rebuild games, but has enough new stuff that I could definitely recommend it, especially if you have not played the other rebuild games.\n\nIf you can't afford this game, just go play rebuild 1 or 2, that would give them some nice cash monies anyway.\n\n-IGN 80 Cultists out of...

Rebuilt 3 manages to do that. I feel like I'm playing an HD version of an amiga 500 video game. And this feels gooooood. You can feel the love put into this game, it has character and it is very refreshing. All these details and little jokes and witty comments everywhere, and that impressive amount of backstories written for no reason. You can feel that it wasn't made by 200 persons. (Well, it's Sarah Norway's Rebuilt 3 so, I suppose she mostly made it on her own.) It's the kind of game that is endearing and which makes you overlook its flaw and focus on all the things that are actually great.\nI love the musics, even if I turned them off after 50 hours of playing.

But then I decided to tell my friend about it, like a year later, which I let him play on my account so he didn't have to buy it, which also accounts for more than half of the hours spent on this game. He played until dawn (not the game, I mean the time) or until he passed out. I think he had more fun on this game than I did. But the reason why I am so appaled of how good this game is because, he gave up WoW for like a month, he loves WoW by the way, he never stops talking about it, never. But just reach the end of this review, 9.5/10 would maybe play again.","October 10, 2015","true","61.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Rebuilt 3 manages to do that. I feel like I'm playing an HD version of an amiga 500 video game. And this feels gooooood. You can feel the love put into this game, it has character and it is very refreshing. All these details and little jokes and witty comments everywhere, and that impressive amount of backstories written for no reason. You can feel that it wasn't made by 200 persons. (Well, it's Sarah Norway's Rebuilt 3 so, I suppose she mostly made it on her own.) It's the kind of game that is endearing and which makes you overlook its flaw and focus on all the things that are actually great.\nI love the musics, even if I turned them off after 50 hours of playing. And the writing style is really cool. I have this female voice in my head, because this couldn't have been written by a guy.

Removing that godawful "realism" style the second one tried and going a little back to its first title's cartoonish graphics style, this one introduces new elements such as rivers and rival factions.\n\nLet me explain gameplay to you... it's a turn-based strategy sim (or, was turn-based, but now allows either turns or pausable real time) where you attempt to take back a city during the zombie apocalypse.  With randomized cities and events, this game still has a lot to find in it.  You will find that your survivors have various skills, meaning they'll be better at certain missions (using the school can help you improve said skills, or even help them develop more skills).  By assigning your survivors to missions just outside the fort, you manage your city and attempt to run it while facing off against the occasional zombie attack and in this latest installment, other factions that can be either completely friendly, or absolutely want everyone in your fort to die.\n\nOverall, the $15 tag isn't bad, even through all the bugs that haven't quite been solved yet.  The developer definitely isn't giving out a dead game, as it already got 2 massive updates just before I got the game, and another afterwards.\n\nEDIT: The updates are still coming, and the bugs are being squashed.  I'm still having some semi-rare issues, such as the backstory not loading occasionally for a survivor\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=316133222\nbut other than that, the game works well and it's fully loaded with content.\n\nIt's definitely one of the best purchases I've made on Steam, but you should probably buy it from the official site[www.rebuildgame.com] so that you can also get a standalone and Android edition.","August 1, 2014","true","24.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Here I'm gonna just compare it to the second one which you can play and get a grand idea for.  In the third the only difference I can recall is before you were only fighting the zombies and not other clans, and if there was even a 1% risk you sometimes had a choice to use some items to better defend yourself while the attack is underway.  Also they give you the option to do real time strategy, however I went to turn based right away.\n\nPros\n+Just as fun to play though as the 2nd\n+Going to war with clans can be fun and stressful in the good way(most of the time, look at the cons to see what I mean)\n+You get more choices on who you are\n+The clans all have some personalty to them.\n+New lands and new uses for some of the lands in game.\nCons\n-This game is glitched to hell and back still.  My game is now unwinnable because I can't talk peace with a clan that I have destroyed, but the game refuses to admit they are dead when there are no zombies or that clan's color left.\n-The names and pictures do not match up with the style of speech half the time.  It may be a little nit pick but when the thing your using to keep me invested are story events you must make sure your he and she is right.\n-Everyone wants materials in order for an alliance.  This is a double con as it takes away from the personallty of the clans and also is that most annoying good to try and horde.  Even with five level 10+ builders going to work for materials you'll be lucky to see three a day, each clan wants 100.\n-Long in the worst way.  I love long games as they normally mean I'll get my money's worth and will find something I like in it.  The bad news is the thing that makes this game so long is fighting to crush the other clans or make peace with them, which in some cases is either actively fight the clans which is more fun but takes more time and goods, or wait to be buddy buddy with them, shorter but ten times as boring.\n-The cost of the game.  When I play this I was looking for something more than the 2nd which I can play for free.  Right now your just buying a better looking version of the game.\n-Religion vs drinking.  I don't personally care for either of these at all, less so the fact that they picked an actual religion over something like fallout 3's church of atom.  This one isn't something game breaking but if it's my city shouldn't I be able to at least pick our religion or make one up?\n*Other fact.\n*I'm not listing this as a pro or con just saying it's in the game.  In my play file I've had guys marry guys, guys marry girls and it may just be the luck of the draw, but no women wedding each other.  You can pick to deny them of course but your sure to take a hit in happiness.  I'd list this a tad more as a con as later in the game it should be something you pick to address when making your own declaration of human rights in the game.  Again I'm not saying it's good or bad, just not properly worked in, or if never intended, out.\n\nFinal score 33% Room for lots of improvement.\nWith the game breaking bugs, guys being called girls and vise versa, small number of events I'd say pass on this game.  It may be early access at the moment but if you want to jump on this game wait till it's under five dollars.","November 4, 2014","false","8.7"," 11 of 38 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","11","38","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crypticcat/recommended/257170/","crypticcat","Merdakah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crypticcat/","212 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDiscussion is based on the Impossible-difficulty.\n\nRebuild is not a new game in the sense that it is a new idea. Indeed, the developer has produced two earlier Rebuild games that  are floating on the Internet as a free flashgame and as a nominal fee mobile game. Those who have played either one of those games will be very familiar with this incarnation of Rebuild.\n\nHowever, dismissing this Rebuild because of that would be a mistake. Already in this stage of it's Early Access cycle it has way more to it than those earlier versions.\n\nGraphically, Rebuild is colorful and cartoony but does not venture beyond a pseudo isometric map on which icons relay the bulk of the information, supported by textboxes that in their information provide much of the immersion and feel of trying to survive in a zedpocalypse. Rebuild will not dazzle you with next-gen graphics, or offer you outlandish options and resolutions for which you need two Titans in SLI and several monitors.\nDue to this, Rebuild can be enjoyed by most anyone with a computer bought anywhere in the last five years.\n\nThe tone of the game is lighthearted, which does hide the fact that the game is actively trying to kill you. The tone of the game and it's graphical presentation makes it easy to underestimate the efficiency it can display in giving the player a false sense of security, leading to the player taking risks which appear to be calculated but will prove to be anything but.\n\nThe player has many option to taylor the gameplay. First and foremost there is the map, which comes in a slew of basic dimensions from tiny to gigantic. All of those basic dimension are however procced so no map is ever the same and no specific strategy will play out the same from map to map. In itself, the basic size of the map is somewhat of a difficulty adjuster in and on itself, as the number of zeds on the map increase dramatically the larger the map chosen is.\n\nThen the composition of your team will differ each time, though there will always a soldier, a builder and a scavenger in it. The Soldier, obviously, is your go-to survivor for combat duty. Nothing out of the ordinary with this survivor. The soldier kills zeds...\nThe builder is quite a talented survivor. Not only can a builder demolish buildings to provide you with the materials resource, the builder is also the survivor to turn to when you need to transform a cityblock into something else.\nThe scavenger.., well, apart from his/her obvious task of gathering food and resources from blocks not yet reclaimed, he/she is also the survivor to turn to to scout out blocks you haven't been to yet. You have to careful with your scavengers, they're not soldiers, though they can defend themselves if need be.\nThe scientist is your survivor who can act as a doctor and as a researcher, provided you can present the scientist with the buildings he needs to ply his trade.\nThe leader is your diplomat. Through him, you can recruit more survivors into your fort and conduct other charismatic things, like preaching in the church (if you build or reclaimed one) to bolster party-morale.\nAll survivors can do all tasks described, but using the right person for the job will see it done quicker or with more success.\n\nAs your survivors do the things they do best, they acquire perks. These perks buff their main talent. As of now, the player is not notified of this and the player has to scan the roster frequently to see if a survivor can activate a perk.\n\nThe player starts on the map in a five-block 'Fort'. From the very start, zeds are massing at the gates and the player can set the soldier to work as soon as turn1 is underway. The food-situation is dire and decisions about farming have to be made immedeately. Scavengers will have start risking body and limbs scrounging for food right from the get-go.\nThis pressure will not relent, yet your survivors will go mental if they can't rest up. So the player will constantly juggle a lot of factors that become increasingly harder to juggle. In order to remain functional, new survivors have to be recruited. More survivors means needing more farms, but also more apartments. That means that the player is forced to expand by reclaiming blocks. Getting bigger means a larger perimeter, which needs soldiers to defend... But next to the constant zed-attacks, the zeds can also mass into a herd which will be harder to defeat, forcing the player to make decisions on where to focus the defence. Next to that... ammunition is finite and needs to be fabricated.\n\nAfter a few turns the factions surface of which the subtitle of Rebuild hints at. If you thought that defending yourself from the zombies is a handful... prepare to deal with gangs that all have their own agendas which do not necessarily include being nice to you...\n\nBut in all this chaos there is you. You, the player, is represented in the game through a customizable avatar (limited customization right now) and you're special. Unlike the survivors who have one talent only, your avatar has all five and can level up in all of them. This versatality means that you can jump in and help out where you're needed the most, though that in itself brings with it a new set of decisions. Will you go and recruit that survivor holed up in the suburbs or will you lend a hand in transforming an officebuilding into a farm?\nIt's all up to you.\n\nWill you like Rebuild? Rebuild is a x4 RTS. It offers nothing out of the ordinary right down to the tried and tested zedpocalypse trope. Lopsided commentary in-game is there, the zeds are there, gruesome deaths are accounted for and decisions between a rock and hard place are thick as flies. There's even a research function and a tech-tree to explore.\nThe 'impossible' difficulty on which my review is based is suitably hard, but in my opinion still fair. That is, all my defeats left me with something I feel I can do different the next time.\n\nShould you buy it?\nNo.\nYou shouldn't buy Rebuild because it is an Early Access title. You have no guarantee that the developer will ever finish producing Rebuild to release-candidate status. You have no guarantee that the developer will make good on the development-list. There's a good chance that you buy a game that for all you know is abandoned already. The fact the developer is active on the forums means little, as there are examples enough where 'active developers' suddenly fell off the face the earth taking the money with them and leaving the players with an unfinished heap of alpha-code.\nBuying Early Access is a gamble I do not wish for people to make on my saying so.\n\nSo that leaves me in the weird position that I'm very positive about Rebuild. I like it very much and in it's current state it is most certainly perfectly playable and enjoyable. But I can't recommend it because it is Early Access and therefore is completely devoid of any guarantee to the buyer that Rebuild will ever be developed through and finished.\n\n-Merdakah","June 5, 2014","false","5.3"," 28 of 77 people (36%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","36","28","77","3","5"

For example 2 of my men overlapped I went to separate them in a currently awkward fashion and the game crashed. No probs its a alpha then I reloaded the game and the save was corrupt I had just spent the bulk of my time playing on that save and yes I tried the autosave and my manual save both were broke. I woke up the next day ready to start again and in disbelief I tried loading the save and it worked. Overall the game is not worth $15 maybe 10 with alot of updates but it is really only worth 5.","June 5, 2014","false","6.7"," 7 of 30 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","7","30","0","0"

Overall you are in charge of your faith. Fight, survive and enjoy.\n\nGangs of Deadsville is a great game. If  you are unsure if you like this kind of game... just google for the "Rebuild flash game" and test that version for free. You can play Rebuild II as well if you like, but you are better of jumping from the first flash version to this one I think.\n\nThe game is still under development, but Sarah is definately improving the game with every new version. She seem to work methodically and add something new, fix the bugs and then test. And then repeat. It is early access, but you can always play the stable version if you don't opt to go for the latest test version. So it is quite enjoyable and bug free, even if it's not finished.\n\nWhat is lacking is still some depth and ending. And all other stuff Sarah is planning to add that I am not aware of.

I thoroughly enjoyed the original Rebuild and Rebuild 2 on my cheap smartphone, and am loving all the new stuff in Rebuild 3.\n\nThe developer took Rebuild 2 and expanded on it in just about every aspect. More intricate survivor-survivor mechanics (you don't want to do missions with your nemesis), a neat set of perks and abilities you can put on your survivors as they gain levels in their ability of choice to make them better, and the addition of NPC factions that will also be trying to survive and thrive in the zombie apocalypse of NW America/SW Canada. There's also a pretty nifty Campaign that is still being worked on, but adds an awesome mode to the otherwise random map/random size of the first 1.\n\nThe game is almost 100% stable, I have had 1 or 2 crashes during Beta testing, and the amount of bugs/glitches reduces with every patch (monthly at the minimum, sometimes faster). A lot of these are cosmetic: him instead of her, using the wrong character name for an event, rather than gamebreaking.\n\nA couple minor issues I have (opinions only, nothing majorly wrong):\n\nThe UI can be a bit cumbersome, especially lategame when playing on an Epic map.\n\nNot a big fan of the music. I just mute and kick in a playlist sometimes. It's okay, but it can get a bit repetitive.\n\nPlaying on larger maps, there is a lot of micromanaging. It comes with the territory though. If you're controlling 30-50 survivors it's simple. When you have 100+ on 30-40 missions at one time, the message feedback and need to scroll continuously can get wearying.\n\n.... that's really all the negatives I have for it.\n\nIf you played 1 and 2, GET 3. GET IT NOW! It's that awesome.\n\nIf you are new to the series, I'm not sure what to compare it to in order for you to get a good idea of what it's like. There's a mixture of a dozen different games/genres, all wrapped up in these pretty neat graphics and some dry humor thrown into the bowl. You might try Rebuild 2 on your phone/pad, it's pretty cheap in the various app stores, and see if you like it. If you do, then get this game!\n\nMy Score: 9/10 (might go higher once the game is officially out and complete)","April 23, 2015","true","216.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They were fun flash games I had found on Kongregate. I was ecstatic to find out the second one had been released a year or too later. I played the living heck out of that game and was able to get all the badges eventually. I looked into the comments after I had played it for the first time in a year and heard that the 3rd one was being kickstarted. I was getting a bit skeptical at that point and found it on steam, it had already been a successful kickstart. I bought it the next day when I had time and started playing it. It didn't have all the nice features it had now but it was still a great start, and I was beginning to enjoy more then the second one. I played the game progressively, after every update, waiting every month to play with new updates. I have been finding some bugs and reporting them, hoping they get squashed! Recently, I have been playing campaign mode and finished it. I have yet to beat Trail on impossible mode, I wonder if it has been done. Overall, I love this game and hope to see it progress further!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_y8flY5SmQ\nThe back story of your main character in campaign, sorry for all the problems.","March 29, 2015","true","211.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

More intricate survivor-survivor mechanics (you don't want to do missions with your nemesis), a neat set of perks and abilities you can put on your survivors as they gain levels in their ability of choice to make them better, and the addition of NPC factions that will also be trying to survive and thrive in the zombie apocalypse of NW America/SW Canada.

Funny and interesting story line and the new factions make it much more interesting. The originals were great as well. As the game progresses it can become tedious though as the objective seems to remain the same. Ally or Eliminate # factions gets old. One level where you have to restore an old plane was a nice change. I wish there was more of that related to the story. Some factions reappear, but dont seem to remember me helping them much. Tried it on the hardest difficulty once(Moses Lake) and failed. I had to start over again on the next hardest difficulty, currently on my 2nd attempt at Impossible on Penecton. I hope it goes well this time.\n\nI jsut got Tiff and Wonko Married. They were my original people. On my first attempt at Impossible I lost Wonko and my best soldier, Beer O'clock. Damn good man.

If you leave it at that and enjoyed the previous two flash games you're going to be missing out on a suprisingly good game. While /a lot/ of the mechanics from the flash games are in this, they've more or less been improved on. The apperance of your survivors gets a little repeditive after awhile, but that's my only complaint. (Well, that and some of the games can run pretty long, but that's my own fault.)\n\nSerriously though, if you're on the fence about paying $15 bucks for it wait for it to go on sale but personally I'd say it's worth the $15 they're asking. If you want a "demo" just go to any major free-flash games site and give the first or second a try, most of the mechanics are fuctionally the same and it'll give you a good idea of what your basic goal is.","June 13, 2015","true","70.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is the beginning of my hopes for that game. The structure is basic: you start out with a few buildings and a couple of survivors and you have to slowly conquer back the zombie wastelands and build a new start for humanity. The survivors have specializations which allow them to do different things for your settlement and as it grows people end up in relationships, end up in fights, or end up dead. Your leadership determines how well your settlement does. I never played the first two Rebuild games, but I was very satisfied with this one. My only gripe is that 3 missions into the campaign and I'm already getting swarmed with 2 or 3 zombie hordes every couple of minutes, which makes trying to establish a settlement near impossible since you have to keep sending all of your people off to fight the horde or guard your turf. There's also no real way to tell where a zombie horde or enemy faction group is going until they're already there (or if you just keep placing guards at every building in the vicinity until the danger meter changes color). It's also fairly basic with only a few building types to construct, a few technologies to research, and a few specialties for the survivors. I really kind of hope the devs (who I think are a husband/wife team) get bigger and make an expanded version of this game with 3-D graphics and expanded mechanics. If this is the quality of their games at a small level, I would only wonder what they could accomplish with EA's resources.","June 18, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your goal at first is quite simple - rebuild - but there are also other matters that require your attention. You'll find out soon enough that your beginning supplies are only going to last you a short time and that, in order to survive, you will need to send scavengers out into the city to bring back precious resources such as medicine, food, ammunition, and building materials. However, time does not idly wait (unless you play turn-based mode) and there are still more things to be done during the day. You will need to research various technologies to improve your people's lives as well as constructing new homes for them to live in. Of course, you will also need to provide buildings to boost their happiness such as bars and churches but this extends to things such as pets too. Eventually, you will find that your survivors begin anew and form relationships with one another ranging from enemy all the way to husband/wife.\n\nSo what are the qualities of the game that make it something everyone should try?\n\nEasy to learn\nEasy to interact with the various elements of the game\nMay initially seem uninteresting, but becomes very addictive.\nReplayable\nThe campaign itself can be either fairly short or long depending on the difficulty, as well as how many of the side objectives you decide to pursue. The story itself is, for the most part, your standard zombie apocalypse drama. However, humour has been sprinkled generously throughout the writing in order to cast a slightly happier light on the situation. Many of the survivors also have their own stories which they reveal in bite-sized portions throughout the game after you've researched survivor management. These also come with the opportunity to select a new perk for your survivor which can include things such as Firearms Training, or being Stinky.\n\nThe graphics are a massive improvement over the previous two games, and quite interesting to look at although there is a little inconsistency between the faction leaders in terms of their graphical style. An example would be comparing Senator Davis to Farmer Bucket, although it should be noted that such a thing is negligible.\n\nThe sound effects are probably the weakest point of the game as there aren't very many of them at all. It doesn't detract too much from the experience, but it definitely would have been a boost to the atmosphere to have more sounds going on throughout the day.\n\nThe music of the game is fairly good and some of the tracks add to the atmosphere of the game quite nicely. It should be noted that there are several 'ambience' tracks which play in addition to the main ones which is an interesting design choice. However, it does pad out the time between each of the tracks playing so that the music doesn't become annoying too quickly. Overall, the music fits very well with the light-hearted atmosphere of the game.\n\nOverall, Rebuild 3 is a great game and one that I would recommend to anyone looking for a light-hearted strategy game snack. The game is interesting enough that you will get a fair amount of playtime out of it, and it is one that you will find yourself coming back to every so often.\n\n\nStory:                         4/5\n\nInterface:                   4/5\n\nGraphics:                   4/5\n\nSound:                       3/5\n\nMusic:                        5/5\n\n\nOverall:                      4/5","November 22, 2015","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I finally declared peace with them for a hefty price, they stopped stealing, and peace In salek falls was finally settled, three nations Inside a city, Utopia, Chaos, Electricity, one with the clouds...\n-badge overdose.\n\n8.6/10 this Is one of the better 4x games, and It has a strong following, so good luck northway games...and fix that text problem","June 21, 2015","true","160.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I would recommend starting with the second one of the series to get an idea of what you're getting into before you decide to buy the game or not.\n\nThe story in Rebuild 3 is much deeper than either of the first two games and is a more entertaining experience than the sandbox gameplay option even though the way you play in both are exactly the same.\n\nIt's a fun game to play and you can drop it at any time and come back to it knowing exactly what you were doing. If you forget what you were doing, the interface will give you a good idea of what's going on when you reload it just by looking at the screen, once you are familiar with the game.\n\nIt does get boring after playing for a long period of time so I would recommend taking a break every once in awhile.","August 5, 2015","true","53.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I'm really impressed.  It's faster paced than the first two, and is a fun balance between combat and city building.  Sucks hours out of my life...\n\nMy only complaint is that the upgrading system sucks.  You have to manually click through every survivor, talk to them, flip through pages, all to pick one trait.  Then if they have multiple levels, you have to do it all over again.  Breaks the flow of the game, but a minor gripe overall.\n\nBest part of the game is finding ways to optimize your build & expansion order.  With each passing city, you get to apply the skills you learn in a meaningful way.","August 13, 2015","true","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You do gain favorites among your characters, and the tendency of the game to make you think of The Walking Dead all the time is very cool. The first city kicked my butt because I didn't realize how food worked -- you build or liberate farms even if you don't have anyone to farm them. (They make food by themselves.) I love the variety of events that come to play -- I don't know whether the game will suffer from sameness over time, butt I'm gonna make it show me. Two cities into it I'm still loving it.\nI just got a character that looks for all the world like Scary Carol from TWD, and she got all the deadliest bonuses without my trying (or cheating). I love her. I'm definitely taking her to the next city! (You get to take three with you, and that's cool!)\nIt's amazing how serious a loss can feel when it's done in cartoons: I had a great leader in a cowboy hat, my Southern preacher. Leadership skill was up to 12 and he tried to talk some recruits into joining. They killed him. Wow. Yep. <sigh> Hit me very much by surprise. I can remember staring at the screen in shock decyphering it. Yep. The game has got me!\nEnjoy it.

Got early access to it as soon as I could and remember playing it when there were barely any models in. It is truely unique as no other game captures the nature of manging survivors in a zombie apocalypse. Truely fearing random events and hordes. Losing your ultra badass soldier on a routine mission and trying to cope as your defences faulter. The campaign is suprisingly good for an indie title, especially an RTS. The last mission, I'll try to avoid spoilers, is still one of the best build ups of tension I've played, and it was a strategy game.

I guess they must have listened to me, because it was added to this game. :D\n\nPros:\nYou can name the survivors in your group.\nThe art is a LOT better than the first two games.\nYou can choose the size of your city.\nYou can customize your character.\nYou can start off with a pistol (be a cop), which I do almost every time, because you get a free gun, which is a weapon that is hard to find.\nThere are limits to the materials that you use. Such as gasoline, ammunition, food, etc., making the game a lot more realistic.\n\nCons:\nStill some bugs, such as most of the time when it's talking about a girl, it says "he" a lot.\nAlmost every single time, all my people die because of malnutrition. Maybe it's just me, but I think food should be easier to find. I usually have to build 3 farms before my people aren't in constant need of food.\nIf you have a bicycle, and there is somebody attacking you, and you need to choose something to do, you can choose to put gasoline in your bicycle, and run them over, and then after you do so, it says when you were finished, there was nothing but bodies scattered on the ground. Although this is very funny to gas up your bicycle and then run people over with it, it is still one of the many bugs that needs to be fixed.\n\nOverall rating: 9/10\nValue: 9.99 $15 is a but much, but still worth it.","December 6, 2014","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was hoping for a city builder with event driven challenges.\n\nSo far I like it, and I find it a good time sink for a game that is an Early Access Release.\n\nPros:\n- UI isn't bad, it's not fully intuitive, but I've been able to figure out most things quickly\n- The events are neat. From figuring out what to do with a cache of discovered rabbits, to faith getting established within your community, to an inconvienent zombie uprising keep things interesting from turn to turn. Especially as you discover other factions that in turn activate new potential events.\n- The survivors are varied and some of them are interesting, especially finding children survivors.\n\nCons:\n- Tech tree isn't accessible until some point later than I've made it so far, unless you get some random event that teaches you an item on the tech tree (it might not even be something to be unlocked, or I may simply be missing something).\n- The survivors being restricted to a single ability level-up ability is annoying, as I always end up with a very disproporationate number of fighters, and not enough Scavengers or Leaders it seems. Even as the pace and number of attacks pick up, I still found a half dozen fighters that I wished were something else, so I kept just trying to kill them off.\n\nThat's about it. I find that I can easily put a couple hours into the game, and the cons aren't deal breakers for me. Just things that seem off.","December 28, 2014","true","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What I have played of the story mode though, I liked.\n\nSo... Changes from my last review:\nI still hate real time mode. I still think the turn based mode should be the default, but since it takes a second or so to fix in game it's not really an issue.\n\nThe tech tree still doesn't give hard numbers on what most of the items do. Anti-Zombie armor tells us it gives 25% more defense.  Improved Walls, however, better fort-wide defense. It's better, but I'd really like the information to actually be there on the tree.\n\nMultiple victory conditions now, which is a major plus.  Picking Politician at the start isn't the default choice for me anymore, since on a bad map it can quickly lead to starvation with the extra mouth to feed. Another major plus in my book.\n\nThe perk system is still in place, but I was hoping as the game got closer to completion the perks would become tiered and more powerful as the character leveled up.  Instead it just seems like they are based on class. (Though I could be wrong about this, seems like 90% of my guys end up being soldiers so they all have very similar builds)\n\nAll in all, however, the game feels like the next step from the first two rebuild games. While I regret my early access time with the game, I've been pretty happy with it since it launched","May 17, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","6"

It's also taken a step away from the "dark" theme the previous games had in a general sense, but in a narrow sense it's SO much darker... so don't let that put you off either. For people who are not familiar, this is a GREAT casual turn-based strategy game that is easy to learn but as challenging as you want it to be. I was constantly (for forever) just wanting to do "one more turn"... and that's a sign of a game that holds attention if ever there was one. I *REALLY* wanted to win the story, but failed hideously the first play-through and missed BARELY the second time. It'll be a while before I try again, and next time I'll be using a walk-through, because I found it  little punishing with how long it takes to get through the entire campaign that it is SOOOO EASY to miss a mall detail only to discover HOURS of gameplay later that your victory is impossible. So it's punishing in THAT regard -- but I loved this game, it's engrossing, brings good atmosphere and mechanics for a zombie apocalypse, and adds diplomacy, character progression, and a variety of other new elements that just make the game that much more fun.","December 16, 2015","true","114.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Got early access to it as soon as I could and remember playing it when there were barely any models in. It is truely unique as no other game captures the nature of manging survivors in a zombie apocalypse. Truely fearing random events and hordes. Losing your ultra badass soldier on a routine mission and trying to cope as your defences faulter. The campaign is suprisingly good for an indie title, especially an RTS. The last mission, I'll try to avoid spoilers, is still one of the best build ups of tension I've played, and it was a strategy game.
