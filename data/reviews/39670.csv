If you have patience, can enjoy a single-player shooter, and can enjoy pulp mass market science fiction writing, Chaser’s VERY LONG campaign will make you giddy and/or content. I would recommend the Easy setting, and I never say that about a game, ever. The visuals stay consistently interesting through the entire game, and the music will keep you company during the slow parts of the story. I found the ending to be worth it, and there were many novel sequences that I’m glad to have seen and experienced. It’s not for everyone, but it is worth a shot. Just don’t expect  Half-Life, and you might be pleasantly surprised.\n\n3/5","September 4, 2013","true","1.5"," 46 of 58 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","46","58","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kanan348/recommended/39670/","kanan348","Kanan348","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kanan348/","192 products in account","Hello everyone.\nBefore i start i would like to say that i have 50+ hours at least in this game off steam . So i have played enough.\n\nTo start with cons i have to first talk about glass physics,yes you heard it right since no one else seems to give a single F*** about this majestic system who has spent many days to make .This game has great atmosphere and visually still looks good even tho it came out in 2003 ,yes 2003 ,seriously it CAME OUT IN 2003 so no need to give it crap because of graphics . I saw some comments about visuals thats why i'm stressing that out . The atmosphere sucks you in and they nailed it because every new location you feel the change.I have to stress this out :The atmosphere is very very good .If you love that as much as i do you will like this game .The ambient sounds , music ,lighting and overall level design is great . This game has a lot of guns to offer and they all different and serve their purpouse . Gunplay is dated BUT it is good and you expect that from a old school shooter . Solid ,chrispy and precise . This game also has a storyline believe it or not . A good one for that matter . I strongly recommend this game to all old school shooter lovers like myself .Also this game is very well optimised and runs gloriously on new systems and supports fullscreen and it has very good chrispy fresh mouse input . No acceleration or any of that variable horizontal mouse sens BULLC***\n\nNow we come to bad stuff . There is no such thing as a perfect game . They all have many  flaws . And i think that actually adds to a game a lot . Let me elaborate. You see, this game was made by a small studio and a staff fueled by pure ethusiasm back in the days when all you needed was a good shooter to be happy in your life . So this game is missing some  polish and you can clearly see that in some levels more towards the end and you start imagining this level design guy working hard on this level and you see his vision of the level and see what he was going for . That is the most rewarding thing in a game for me .Some later leves do lack some detail but i think i can look over that because i'm sure they just didnt had enough time to polish everything . The other problem is AI .Its there its functional so you might ask what is the problem and the answer is  its kinda dull . Yes you can say that about the 90% of games out there but that doesnt mean you dont want the games to have great AI everytime . But writing AI is very tricky so this game i would say is ok . i cant think of any other drawbacks to be honest . I wanted to write this review for a long time ever since i saw Funhaus guys play it . Dont get me wrong i love funhaus and thats what they do,bash games to make funny content but a lot of people interpreted their show as a review of the game which is stupid and unfair towards the game which ended up giving this  game a bad name and that makes me very very sad. This is a good game . If you read this far i think we can be friends .on this note this review is done .\nTake care.\nKanan out.","October 15, 2015","true","8.4"," 40 of 49 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","40","49","6","1"

This game was considered old school at the time of its release. It is a raw diamond and if you don't enjoy games that make you rage quit and then start again in 15 minut, stay away.  This is a kind of game that was made for hardcore gamers, by hardcore gamers. The story is nothing special, animations are mediocore at best and sounds are...just to be there. The maps are huge and completing one level can really take hours, especially if you get lost and circle for good 20 minutes, enemies are deadly even on lower settings and you will learn to save before every corner. Yet, if this is what you are looking for in the myriads of modern games, you will love it. Guns feel real, environment is diverse and detailed. Completing every level will feel very satisfactory and you will be sad once it's over.","June 3, 2014","true","20.2"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","38","47","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/j_mezz/recommended/39670/","j_mezz","jasmezzanotte","http://steamcommunity.com/id/j_mezz/","46 products in account","Chaser is honestly one of the most innovative games of the past, present, and future generation. After playing over 100 hours of this game, it's obvious where the inspiration for Bungie's Halo: Combat Evolved came from. Sure, it came out two years after Halo, but that's because they only saw Jo Wood's amazing design. If the investors had given him his $17.26 before, Chaser could've revolutionized gameplay for PC and would've put the Xbox and PS2 out of business.\n\nMy favorite part of the game is how the enemies just run into the wall in such a beautiful way. Sure, some might call it a glitch, but I know that was there by design. When Jo Wood presented the concept for Chaser to his two cats and a parrot (RIP Jo Wood the Parrot), he wasn't just imagining another game, he was imagining the future!\n\nBy far the most interesting character is Thruster Man. (SPOILER ALERT) Thruster man is a deep and well thought out character that I know Jo Wood put hours into creation. His one goal is to appear for 30 seconds, shoot at you 3 times, then continue off into the sunset. You (John Chaser) must help him out by shooting him, otherwise he'll keep going, never to actually come back and do his one job, which is to kill you. The chemistry between him and John Chaser is one for the ages. I will be sure to tell my kids about Thruster Man when I grow up.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game, and look wish Jo Wood luck with his new developer team, Homeless Studios.","December 26, 2014","true","104.8"," 43 of 59 people (73%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","73","43","59","59","1"

It even has a useless pseudo bullettime mode.\n\nYou start off the game as John Chaser wakes up in some sort of cryogenic chamber on a space station with no idea who he is or why there is a small army destroying the space station in a rather over the top attempt to locate you.\n\nYou are immediately thrown in the action as the mindless hordes of enemies start attacking you from all sides as you make your way off the space station, through streets and sewers and even through a rather peculiar mini-submarine segment. It all feels very familiar though, it's all the same generic shooting you have seen before with nothing to set it apart.\n\nThe weapons all feel like plastic, the enemy AI is about as worthless as a blind guide dog and the maps are made entirely out of black and grey boxes.\n\nThe story is some of the most unbelievable manure you will ever encounter, not because it's surprising but because John Chaser appears to have no willpower whatsoever. Despite not know who he is, and everybody else seemingly knowing, he never bothers to ask. He also lacks the capacity to say no even when warned repeatedly not to go into the service of a particular sociopath.\n\nAll in all, this is one of those you can actually play twice without realizing it because it is all so generic and forgettable.

The controls and shooting are refreshingly old school and they are really tight.

In general, it's not a bad FPS game. If you like single player FPS games, you might like it, but it's a very average shooter in every sense, and a lot of the time it may also feel rather unpolished, so I can't really recommend it.\n\nOne thing that is commendable is that it has an actual story, something that FPS games normally lack, but the story is spaced out by overly long and repetitive linear levels, in many of which you only have a couple of weapons to use, and the same kind of enemy, so you keep ploughing through dozens of the same enemies in the same corridors. The progression through the levels also feels the same all the time. If you say come across 4 doors in the area, I bet you anything 3 will be locked and 1 is open for you to go through. And on a few occasions when every door is locked, means you just gotta find a good old vent.\n\nThe game also never really autosaves during the levels and there are no checkpoints. So if you've forgotten to save for a while and die for some silly reason, like falling off a ladder, then you'll lose a lot of progress. My very first death was in the first level, getting crushed by the sliding double doors. I've no idea who would build the doors to actually do that, rather than, you know, sliding back open again if someone is passing through.\n\nThe enemies always seem to be aware of your presence before you even know they're there. They'll spot you for miles and across the other end of a large map. Sure, it adds to the challenge, but it's also kinda cheap and annoying. If I am being shot at, I'd prefer to be able to see who is doing that without needing to squint my eyes.\n\nI had to leave the game on a sniping section, which is equivalent to an escort mission, except you're sitting in a lighthouse and have to cover your allies in a truck that's trying to make it through a military base with enemies shooting at it from everywhere. Not sure if I'd be willing to continue anymore.\n\nNot a bad game, but feels very rough around the edges and has a mediocre gameplay. I was only really liking the story. This game could've been better off as a first person RPG, akin to Deus Ex, in my opinion.","November 14, 2015","false","4.6"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","18","31","4","4"

You don't get much time to aim up before they get you  back, but it's still fair. You just have to do what is known as "trying" get unrelaxed, sit up right, widen your eyeballs, try to FOCUS really hard and think about nothing but the task at hand. Get through the level full of baddies who will kill you very fast. The snipers can kill you in 1 hit. If they don't get you in one hit, then you still have low health and die.\n\nI hardly pay attention to the storys in most games anyways.

The game has a very nice variety of weapons, and does a nice job blending near scifi weapons with relitively normal ones.\n\nCons-\n--  Jump hight. the MAX value for jumping seems to be right at or just barly below the hight of objects you need to jump over, such as crates or low walls. several areas of the game are irritateing if nearly impossible due to needing to 'jump over' items that are supposed to be average jump hieght. it seems whoever programed it didnt think to set it slightly higher. this gets to be more and more of an issue in later stages of the game when you need to jump over 'instant death' obsticles.\n--   Bugs. there arnt many bad bugs, but in a later stage in the game, their is a crawlspace that goes no where, and once you reach the far wall, there is an optical bugg that messes up the graphics. its simple to fix by simply turning around and leaveing the crawlspace.\n-- Jump Hight.\n-- The AI. The enimies are hard coded (cant think of a better way to put it) as there dosent seemt o be any way at all to 'sneak' up on or past enimies. as soon as you are in a set proxcimity they start attacking. even if you are out of sight sometimes. and while the AI fits the simple nature of the overall game, it can be 'slightly' disapointing that the most thought they have is move a little to the side, but keep shooting,\n==Jump Hight.\n==jump hieght\n==JUMP height\n==jump HEIGHT\n==JUMPHIEGHT.\n\nso as i said.. their are a few cons to playing this game (jumphieght) but over all its a straight up shoot your way through (jump) game that might remind you of (height) the first syphon filter on Play Station. graphics are relitively similar. though, sorry, no taser.\njust remember 2 words\nits (jump) great (height)","January 29","true","19.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Chaser is a run and gun FPS that is overly ambitious, and falls hard in just about every possible gaming aspect. I want to say it feels like a cross between Serious Sam and Red Faction, but to put this title in the same sentence as those other two is blasphemous.\n\nThere are just so many bad things to rip on: The graphics are decent for a 2003 release although they could have probably toned down on the shiny, over-glossed textures. The shooter aspects are bearable and the story is kind of reasonable, albeit extremely disjointed and severely lacking any depth due to the main character's case of amnesia. Voice acting is respectable, although the character graphics make for a stiff delivery.\n\nIf one thing stood out it's that Chaser is god awful too long. It took me over 15 hours to finish, but I'd say there's only 7-8 hours of real content here. All the excess fat is just mindless killing of never ending spawning AI in a maze of bland and boring visuals.\n\nThe AI just sucks, period. They spawn above you, below you, behind you and you never really know where they are until you are taking damage. Toward the end of the game, the AI difficulty ramped up exponentially literally requiring me to quick save after each kill which reminds me, there's no auto save here so save early and save often. There has to be at least 1,000 grunts that are trying to kill you and there's not a whole lot of variety in the bad guys.\n\nThe multitude of hidden passages and usable objects made it a chore just finding where you need to go next or what to do--no waypoints here. Some passages you even have to keep jumping until you get lucky enough to move on. But be careful because one wrong jump and you might end up getting your character stuck in that invisible crevice. Good thing you quick saved it just a moment ago right?\n\nToo many useless guns. Most of them lacked effective damage, especially the grenade attachments. Five grenades to kill one guy--really? Yet the enemy grenades are a one shot kill on me.\n\nI'm not even sure why I continued to press forward and complete it. I guess it was just a mind numbing case of hoping the next chapter would bring some clarity. In the end, I was left pretty much as clueless as when I first started.\n\nI'm going to go sulk in a corner for a while and reflect on the nonsense I just played. In the meantime may I recommend to you either Red Faction or Serious Sam instead of this garbage.","November 18, 2013","false","16.3"," 27 of 50 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","27","50","0","3"

It's weird because many of the other games developed by them ranges from "meh" to "uninstall right away", and most are just average.\nThat's why this one comes by surprise when you play it: it looks awesome, it's huge, has the old-school feeling that, even in those years, was getting lost, and has that something that makes you keep playing until you reach its end.\n\nIt's not perfect by any means, and it shows its age in many aspects, but once you get used to its bugs and the quick-save key, you'll be fully immersed in this fun, and very hard, classic FPS experience.\n\nThe main problem about this game is the enemies, that are able to see you and "snipe" you with any weapon they are carrying from any place they are hiding in. You always have to be on the lookout for them, and always have a cover spot to quickly use in case of an encounter (which, in most cases, is a multiple encounter). That isn't making the game impossible, but you gotta have a very good aim, even at normal difficulty, to take them down before they do the same to you (headshots highly recommended). You also need to save often, and I really mean it.\nThe good thing is that this game uses healthpacks and armor bonuses, so you can just not collect them until needed, like we all old gamers used to do back then.\n\nIt's easy to ragequit this game, because some enemies are simply unforgiving, or because you died and forgot to save close to there, but you'll come back to it until you finally complete it if you like old-school shooters. The graphics still are enjoyable to this day, in my opinion, because of the nice quality of the textures and models, the amount of the special effects (including the spectacular glass breaking) and the sci-fi setup. Good music and proper sound effects, though the voice acting is the usual B-movie kind.\nLast but not least, there's some variety in the levels. Not only in their looks, that are very different from level to level, which keeps the experience fresh, but also because of some different from the usual objectives, like sniping enemies from a tower, or diving underwater. This game has basically them all, just like in AAA titles.\n\nI have no idea if multiplayer still works or is populated. When I played this game ages ago it was basically dead already, but it felt fun when I actually could find someone online, with some different modes than just DM/TDM.\n\nI think that if you're a FPS lover, this must be in your library. I already had it from back then but I purchased it again on Steam while on sale just because it's worth keeping it around, forever.","June 8, 2012","true","6.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

As far as I know (unless I skipped it somehow) the game doesn't actually inform you of this and I only found out by pure chance when I spazzed on my keyboard trying to get away from an explosion...so yeah there's that.\n\nAnywho as far as the game itself goes although I'm giving it a recomendation it is a real mixed bag game design wise. This is probably a game you'll have a love/hate relationship with. Overall the gunplay is great. I really enjoyed the old school twitch based no iron sights shooting and good old fashioned health and armour drops. It's the level design that really starts to let this game down in the last few hours. The first level has you going through a space station with very linier corridors with very little room for deviation whereas the next few levels open up a little more. About halfway through the game the levels start becoming a little too open, with unessessary doors and corridors becoming accessible and some just plain huge open spaces with zero guidence or indication where to go next. This is bearable though and it's not until the last few hours that it just gets tedious. The game starts resorting to horrible half-life like platforming (crouch jump and all) and extremely obscure and hidden paths like barely visible vents and holes in the ground. The end mission is definitelly the lowest point of the game unfortunately. There's also a terrible stealth mission very early in the game but thankfully it's the only one and is over reletively quickly.\n\nIf you're looking for a game with a cohesive story I would look elsewhere as well. The plot is all over the place and the cutscenes and voice acting are laughable. It's a shame because the game takes you to some amazingly different locations like a space station, gang infested city slums, Russian bases crawling with soldiers and even eventually to Mars for the 'big' conclusion. The amazing variety of weapons is fantastic and they all handle differently making each of them very situational.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you're looking for an old fashioned shooter with some fun gunplay I would say pick this up. Even if you don't play it all the way through to the boring conclusion (honestly the story ain't worth it) it's still a lot of fun.","November 15, 2014","true","18.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","1"

There was no "cover system". There's no leaning around walls. There's just shooting, and occasional jumping, and puzzles, and more enemies. You started with no memory of who you were or what are you doing on a space station. As you fought your way out of the station and continue on your own path of self-discovery (and destruction), you piece together your purposes,but it may not be the truth, as everybody seem to know you as something else... Graphics are lame as this is an old game, but the action makes up for it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cucumbericepepsi/recommended/39670/","cucumbericepepsi","telos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cucumbericepepsi/","669 products in account","What a truly terrible game, good grief. I started writing down things I found wrong with the game after stage one and I filled over half a page in no time flat. I'm tempted to just list them rather than write a proper review.\n\nFirst things first, what few "plot" points there are are ripped directly from Total Recall. In this game you take control of Douglas Quaid John Chaser as he proceeds to get his ??? to Mars. The first part immediately after you land is kind of neat and has decent cutscenes, but once you actually start to head towards Mars everything just turns into a mess and nothing makes sense at all. Prior to landing all the cutscenes are heavy flashing lights and shaking camera, and after they're just boring until the end.\n\nBut people don't play FPS for the plot right? So the devs clearly focused on the gameplay! Right? Right?! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahah. Bullet damage and health spacing is reminiscent of the original Far Cry game  (that is to say very high and very poor) without any stealth mechanics or decent graphics. Further the AI is dumb as bricks and appears to be only able to open doors as part of scripted events. If a door shuts in front of them expecting them to be staring you in the face later. 99% of your damage taken will be from some enemy you never saw aimbotting you from above/below/behind/spawning out of thin air. There is absolutely no enemy variety, just guys with guns. And oftentimes it's only one gun per stage. One particularly badly designed stage only has one model for said enemy too (the rest of the stage is a tiny little area copy pasted about 8 or 9 times). The hit effect seems to be bugged or just not implemented right as well so oftentimes you don't even know if you're hit from things, especially falling or explosions.\n\nDid I mention doors? There are a LOT of doors. A lot. And the ones you can use and the ones you don't look EXACTLY the same. But you have to guess which one is right. I cannot emphasize enough how tedious this gets. There is a general lack of direction in the game that will have you wandering around aimlessly; everything looks the same in most of the normal levels. And some of the dead ends REALLY are dead ends; you can't get back. And the levels that attempt to mix it up... well... One of them is generic sniping mission where the graphics are mysteriously downgraded to N64 tier. You get to protect a truck with non-moving wheels as it glides along a port. There's a 'stealth' mission where you instantly die if you fail. But the worst offender is an underwater one with 6 degrees of freedom and seriously screwed up controls. I swear I spent 10-15 minutes where to go on one part of it.\n\nUnsurprisingly there are tons of bugs too. I:Got stuck on geometry\nSaw enemies spawning on top of each other\nCrashed several times\nFell through the level attempting to do a required jump to progress\n\nAbsolutely disgusting/10\nThis game is not worth it even for a dollar.","January 9, 2015","false","10.9"," 44 of 88 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","44","88","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JZemlinsky/recommended/39670/","JZemlinsky","Josh Z.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JZemlinsky/","154 products in account","Before we start i just want to say; Chaser is by no means as bad as people make it out to be.\nIn fact, this is actually a GOOD game. Not SUPER good, not mediocore. No, it simply is GOOD.\n\nWith that out of the way, we can begin.\nWhen i got this game, i went in, expecting a mediocore, if not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ experience. However, what i got was a lenghty, entertaining and mostly well executed game.\nFor a game that was released in 2003, it both looks and plays very well. What is very obvious to me, is that Cauldron set out to make a visually impressive and huge game, rather then a story driven game.\nWhat i mean by this, is that the game's dialouge is completely off, and so are many sound effects, aswell as plot points.\nBut, the enviroments, the characters, serval other visual elements and the shear size of the game, are not only amazing for the time, but also make up for the cons.\n\nI also want to add, that the screenshots on the Steam page for this game, are mostly from the same level, and are very misrepresentive of the game's overall look and design.\n\nPersonally, i love the setting and design of the game, now it does use alot of grey and brown nuances like so many games do.\nBut the fact that the setting and level design is a combo of futuristic and present day architecture is making it all the more appealing. It also sets the tone for the game, humanity beat down by political and global crisis, rebels, savages and mafia scum all fighting for dominance, all helps to give the game a very distinct and depressing feeling.\n\nOne thing that most absolutely be commented individually, is the amazing 'breakable' glass. The glass will not break in one single point, it will break where ever you shoot it. Try it yourself, find a big juicy window and shoot out the corners and watch as it breaks as you want it to. Effects of this quality have not been matched by many games since, and Chaser defintly needs commenting for this. It is amazing\n\nGameplay wise it's pretty solid, nothing too special or underwhelming here. It functions as any good FPS game should, you also have the ability to slow down time using "Adrenalin Mode" this especially becomes usefull at later stages, when you run into many enemies at once.\nIn latter parts of the game, everything becomes far more fast phased, and i had a short moment of throw back to the days of Doom.\n\nThe cutscenes are a real joy, as they have some truely funny dialouge, and often awkward yet funny situations. The main protagonist's look at the world is truely funny, and makes me believe he is not right upstairs... That making him even more awesome then he already is.\n\nAlot of people probably want to know "Does the game have many bugs? Is it unplayable thanks to them?" the answer is; No.\nThe game does not have any bugs, that hasn't been disregarded completey in other "cheerished" titles. The only annoyance, and this is not a bug, is the fact that you do not recieve any kind of 'response' when you take enviromental damage, or fall from a ladder.\nThis can often cause you to die, while you thought you were beefed up on health. But it is a small thing, and incidents with it, are far and few between.\n\nOverall, this is a good game, and defintly one i had alot of fun playing. The game is insanely long, and this is done very well, as it manages not to drop in quality the further you get. (Though some levels are abit repeatitive.)\nThe game also holds a nice challenge to it, even on the easiest difficulty, it can still be very hard.\nIt is essentially worth every penny, of the 5€ it costs. And if you are looking for an old shooter, that has aged well, Chaser is one to go for. (with that price, you got no excuse)\n\nThanks for reading, i hope this review has hooked you on getting this game.\nI am really saddened by the amount of hate that is thrown towards it, as it hardly deserves half of it.\n\nI hope you will enjoy it as much as i have.","February 13, 2015","true","15.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","1"

You said a "trilby is a fedora."\nIs it also a hat? Yes. No one's arguing that.\nAs someone who is a classy g[ent][le]man who studies classy headwear, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls trilbies fedoras. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.\nIf you're saying "hat family" you're referring to the categorical grouping of brimmed hats, which includes things from bowlers to homburgs to tophats.\nSo your reasoning for calling a trilby a fedora is because random people "call the big ones fedoras?" Let's get westerns and pork-pies in there, then, too.\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how fashion works. They're both. A trilby is a trilby and a member of the brimmed hat family. But that's not what you said. You said a trilby is a fedora, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the brimmed hat family fedoras, which means you'd call bowlers, homburgs, and other hats fedoras, too.

To anybody. from what I played this game is very confused as to what it wants to be, especially in the first part of the game. Either it wants me to play it stealthy, but then it throws encounters at me that I have no chance of completing. Or it wants me to be rambo, but the only gun they give me is burst fire and has the recoil of a sniper rifle throwing my aim halfway to the ceiling every time I pull the trigger. Or it wants me to just run through the encounter, but I don't have enough health to make it through anywhere especially since they gave my enemies stronger arms than me so they can actually aim their guns.\nIf you want a retro shooter, pick up something like doom or duke nukem 3d where they bothered with the guns, if you want a running game go pick up mirror's edge, if you want a better stealth game try thief or deus ex.

The shooting and the movement have the right feel to it. The music has the right ring to it. You even have a decent plot line with lots of skippable cutscenes. The maps are huge and range from cities and skyscrapers to space stations. Even the graphics are good enough for a game from it´s era. Sadly these things are not enough as Chaser has some *serious* flaws.\n\nWhen a map starts, you don't have any enemies anywhere. Instead they get spawned each time you hit a preset location. At best this can mean enemies spawning to a room you just cleared a few seconds ago. Naturally these spawns make no sounds so you will simply have an enemy taking a free shot at you from behind. Very annoying.\n\nThe other major annoyance relates to the huge maps. Sometimes you have no clue where you are supposed to go or what on earth you are supposed to do. At least 1/4 of my gameplay time was simply running around checking which door can be opened in order to go forward. The best indicator of being on the right track is that enemies are still spawning around you. Otherwise you need to start guessing. To make this worse, it is possible to get stuck in some maps after which you are forced to restart the map. You can also get stuck in a lot of textures. Mostly this is just a minor annoyance cured by hitting your jump key a few times. Sometimes this means going for your last save. If you have no quick saves, this means restarting the map.\n\nChaser claims to have "Highly developed AI". In practice this means that AI always knows your exact position aiming at you in advance. Enemies don't always run straight to you though so I guess we need to give some credit for that. Instead they try to do some sort of flanking manouvers. The enemy also knows when you reload and will atempt to attack you during these moments. In other words you can sometimes draw enemies from cover by simply reloading your weapon. The AI always aims at your torso even when it is behind a cover. This made some fights quite hilarious. Another hilarious thing relates to scoped weapons. They make more damage with the same bullets when you have your scope on. Very logical.\n\nTo wrap it up, Chaser has some enjoyable moments but they are wrecked by aimless searching and enemies spawning from thin air. Add a few crashes with no autosaves and you will be feeling great for actually paying to play this game. Good thing it only cost me a few dota items. I'd give it a 6 ½ / 10.","June 15, 2014","false","10.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I learn you can use adrenaline by YouTube near end of the game.\n- Dubbing. Mother of f★★king god. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night had horrible dubbing. Chaser cross that border. it's horrible² or even horrible³.\n- Sick hit system (ex. Enemies dies by hit their legs with pistol, but they can simply survive 3 sniper riffle headshots... Or they survive 2 rockets but we die by single hit that exploded 10 meters away).\n- Music. One song per stage, looped, slighty different from previous stage. BORING.\n- Lots of illogical things (ex. you open cells to let prisoners escape... You simply make prison break. In return - all prisoners attack you. Just like that).\n- Horrible labyrinth. Do not approach without video guide. I tried find the way by myself. I lost around 3h of playtime because of that.\n- Escort/Protect missions. Holy Madoka, just f★★k this s★★t. Characters run and stop whenever they want and just get killed.\n- Later parts of the game (on Mars especially) is a "Love Story of Keys F6 and F9". Quick save, quick load, quick save, quick load over and over. 30+ times per mission.\n- Underwater mission - FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU...\n- Bugs. Lot of bugs. Your character can freeze anywhere and if it does - you have two ways with same effect. Or kill yourself by granade and load game or simply load game.\n\nYes, game had interesting (at first glance) story. It does. And I enjoy it at some point. Then I reach underwater mission when I finally clear it, I pray to Holy Madoka "Make this stage last one..." And no - Underwater stage is somewhere around middle of the game.

Long levels in which you might even get lost in your first playthrough but even though it's a shooter you will have lots of different experiences in this game.\nSome examples - you flee from a space station, fight your way through mafia goons, defend a truck from incoming enemies and even have a long underwater level in which you have to fend off sentry u-boats while navigating through boat wrecks.\nThere's also a very big range of your weapon arsenal that changes throughout the game.\nAnd, even though its from 2004, the graphics are still pretty good (if you turn your resolution up enough).\nAside from shooting itself you have a Adrenaline-slow motion function that you can use against your enemies.\nAnother important aspect of the game is the story about the Protagonist John Chaser and his amnesia, which is carried on by cutscenes and dialogues throughout the game.\nI give this game 9/10 because it was one of the first real shooters I owned and I'm never getting tired of the plain but awesome shooting mechanics in this game.","March 2, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

In this game there is no regenerating health, no automatic cover, and no rushing through the level. Crosshair doesn't take half of the screen and you can't play it with the controller. It's all about skill and precise aiming. Most enemies fall after one precise headshot and good aim and reflex is far more important than how full is your armor or health bar. The gameplay feeling is almost like that of good old Counter Strike or Rainbow Six. In short this is more of a tactical shooter - Call of Duty fans should just skip it.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are familiar with this type of games, you will be treated with very satisfying gameplay and you won't have too much problem going through levels. Graphics stand through test of time and game runs pretty well on modern systems. The storyline reminds of Total Recall, but can get pretty nonsense at times, and Mr. Chaser's choices are sometimes like those of 4 year lobotomized child. However the levels and  gameplay just gets better the more you play it.\n\nWarmly recommended for oldschool gamers, especially considering price of few bucks!","November 28, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Cauldron pulled off some interesting effects in the engine like dynamically lit particle effects, tesselated water surface that reacts to gunfire impacts, hybrid static/dynamic lighting and shadowing, realistic glass/wood breakables engine, environmental effects (environment impacts scope ring [fog, ice, dirt, etc], emissives from bullet impacts (shoot pipes or pressured glass windows), etc. A lot of these things are absent entirely from modern games/engines. It is a sad testament to the negative impact of console gaming.\n\nThe engine also is capable of rendering very large areas with long viewsheds with minimal performance cost. They did some really awesome things behind the scenes in the CloakNT engine, which is made even more impressive by the fact that the engine was created in-house from the ground up.\n\nCombat is pure oldschool and twitchy; good stuff.\n\nMusic is superb, visual style is great (if inconsistent), and levels sprawl!

In fact, I had some fun with this one, and I figure with a little more polish it could have been remembered as a classic. However, there are two really big problems that prevent me from reccomending (or finishing) this... two problems that suck the life out of what could otherwise have been a decent shooter.\n\n1) Bad Level Desgin:\nIn this game, YOU WILL BACKTRACK A LOT. For every path forward there are twenty dead ends... and most offer no reward whatsoever for exploration.\n\nIn a linear, story-driven game, this is an extreme indictment! Huge chunks of gameplay waste the players time and only bring boredom and frustration.\n\nBut there are also little problems to level desgin as well... things you would not normally think about until they go wrong. I will use an example from this game:\nThere is this level with a HUGE arena where a battle takes place. That is fine and well. But after the battle I ended up spending nearly 15 minutes searching for the way forward. There was this pile of rubble you are suppsed to climb up  and then a ladder above that. However, THE LADDER'S TEXTURE BLENDED INTO THE WALL TEXTURE. I ended up climbing that rubble no less than four times trying to get out of the arena and it was only on the fourth that I saw, just barely, that damned ladder.\n\nLinear story-driven games, especially, cannot afford this kind of BS.\n\n2) General Shooting Brokenness:\nThe second major problem involves a lot of minor issues with the shooting itself, but which add up to make a mediocure shooter downright frustrating. I will simply list them out:\n-Enemies often point towards you and are ready to shoot at you before they have line of sight. Not only does this not make sense, but it also give them an unfair advatage.\n-Enemies, thier weapons, AND THE PLAYER can clip through walls and doors, leading to many a BS damage (and the occational getting stuck).\n-When one enemy knows of you... all do (think about the point at the top and see what problems that causes).\n-Lack of varety. Enemies almost always consist of the same type (man with machine gun) with minor variations (now man has sniper).\n-Samey corridor shooting. Rather than challenge the player with novel situations and varied, complementary ememies... 90% of gameplay is walking down a corridor and shooting the samey enemies.\n-The game seems to depend on random health and armour pickups from enemies to sustain the player. Given how rapidly 100 health can go to 27 (which in most cases is as little as two shots from death) this turns certain portions of the game into peekaboo nightmares.\n-Finally, there are rare enemies (man with genade launcher) which can one-hit-KO you. This is OK in shooters provided there is enough warning and enough chance to dodge. In Chaser... you get no such chance and have to simply eat a couple of deaths.\n\nFix the p i s s-poor level degisn and tweak the shooting? And you have something fun I would argue. But alas, Chaser has these problems, and I cannot reccomend it.","December 6, 2015","false","9.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paul_snow/recommended/39670/","paul_snow","LoveJesusHateTheGovernment","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paul_snow/","947 products in account","Well, I'll say one thing for Chaser: You definitely get a LOT of game for your money, especially considering that I got it on sale for a little over a dollar. This game is perhaps the longest FPS I've ever played. I finally completed it on medium difficulty after 36 hours of gameplay, (I know it says above that I put 47 hours into it, but I started a new game with 11 hours already clocked in). In addition to being long, this game is also extremely difficult. In fact, you will find yourself quick saving and quick loading A LOT; over and over again to get thorugh many areas and still maintain enough health and armor to advance further into the game. I don't think it's how the developers meant for the game to be played, but it's what needs to be done in order to complete it.\n\nChaser is a very well done  futuristic, sci-fi FPS with a bullet time mechanic that tells a very interesting story through well written cut scenes, has a good musical score, (particularly on the Siberian levels) and will take the player from a space station, to various points on the globe, and finally to Mars. Ammo and enemies are plentiful, and there is a terrific variety in both weapons and level enemies, from space soldiers, mobsters, ghetto trash and punks, to Japanese buisness men. All are out to kill you. There is one level fairly early in the game called "Kabir" that is in my opinion the worst mission in the game. You have to defend a truck from waves of enemies but they keep coming and coming relentlessly, and it is so difficult, that I actually quit the game and didn't pick it up to try again until several years later. Aside from that level, the game is pretty fun.\n\nI recommend this game. As I understand it, it has quite a cult following, probably thanks to Inside Gaming's unfair treatment of it, (that youtube channel ripped apart some very brilliant games in my opinion - especially "Legendary"). But I will tell you that by far, the biggest flaw in this game is that there are WAY TOO MANY times in the game where you have absolutely no idea what to do. Ya, it's one of those games. Even after you've killed all the enemies in a level or a certain part of a level, you will almost always be wandering around forever trying to find that one tiny switch, or that one elusive ladder or hole in the corner that is too easy to miss, to advance into the next area. A few times there are level puzzels such as a board blocking a door that you have to shoot from a distance, so that you can open that door later in the level, but if you happen to not see that board, you will be wandering around forever trying to figure out what you're supposed to do. Every level of the game is basically like this and it gets old really quick. You will be scratching your head until you finally figure out what to do, or have to resort to a youtube playthrough. Also, I should note that the game has a very interesting twist at the very end with a completely unexpected ending. It's a challenging game that is best completed if, for nothing else, bragging rights. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it.","November 20, 2015","true","47.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In this game, they are literally five minutes long, often being slow and burning as much time as they can get away with. The first cutscene showed loads of action that the player is not allowed to participate in. The next one shows a space station breaking apart as slowly as possible, taking time to show off what is now laughably obsolete graphics. (Their attempts to show off their graphics are even more hilarious when strippers and cleavages appear.) In one cutscene, the character was warned against a danger that got him in the very same cutscene.\nBut enough about stupid cutscene/gameplay ratios, lets talk about the gameplay! Fairly early in the game, I met one of those stupid mandatory stealth sections where an enemy seeing one square inch of you results in an instant game over. The irritation there is enhanced by the game's complete lack of stealth mechanics. Not to mention that this section opened a plot hole; if the character is so valuable to his new owners, why are they so quick to murder him?\n"What about the combat?" What about the combat! It's boring and irritating. It feels like you are playing counterstrike against an army of murderous bots, but with less strategy and worse gun mechanics. You die quickly, which would be fine if enemies didn't regularly spawn behind you. This game basically demands that you save scum through it.\nAll in all, Chaser promises a mediocre experience, but delivers far less than that.","June 26, 2014","false","4.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Every door looks the same and often lacks visual cues to tell whether or not it's accessible. The game frequently leads you into deadends full of enemies with no rewards, the bodies disappear instantly, the guns are all flat copies of modern weapons with no variations despite being set in the year 2044, the protagonist and his mafioso friend have garbage voice acting, the subtitles do not follow the actual dialogue, the game often subjects the player to seizure inducing flashbacks and finally, the tutorial instructs that if you want to jump higher you should jump, then hold down the crouchbutton.

There are only two good things about it; the guns and the music. The story and voice acting are so bad it's painful, and good gunplay dosen't excuse many deaths that felt cheap. Additionally, I've become stuck in various objects that lay directly in my path, forcing me to reload from a past save. On multiple occasions I 've encountered horrible graphical glitches that made the game completely unplayable (see my screen shots for this game if your curious). Anything unrealted to shooting, such as a biref stealth section, is so poorly designed that I have to wonder why it's in the game at all.\n\nThe gunplay itself is a lot of fun. There are several guns, and all behave more or less effectively. There is usually only 1 or 2 good weapons that you'll find yourself using throughout a level however, so there really isn't much point in the decent array you have to choose from.\n\nThe terrible enemy AI is compensated for with a reduced ability for the player to take damage and a high level of accuracy on the part of the AI. Any single enemy can kill you if you arn't careful, and there are a lot of enemies, but the enemies themselves die so quickly that getting through a level without using the time-slowing feature is a completely viable option, provided you have good reflexes for whenever the enemies start popping out from behind corners. The time slowing feature itself is hugely dissappointing, as it recharges too slowly to be any fun.\n\nI've seen estimates of length that go up to 50 hrs of playtime and higher. I'm over half-way through the game at 5 hrs. Excluding deaths, I doubt this experience is longer than 8 hrs.\nLots of people love this game, and while the shooting is good, the stealth section and an underwater section where I literally CAN'T SEE have me wondering why.","December 20, 2013","false","17.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

The game isn't garbage, but it's not even close to being good, nor would I recomend it to anyone.\n\nThe graphics look horrible, even for 2003 standards. Devil May Cry 2, Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness, Silent Hill 3, and Max Payne 2 all came out in 2003 and look amazing compared to Chaser. It's true that graphics aren't everything, but this game looks so much worse than it should. More than a couple of times, I've walked into rooms that don't even look like there are textures on the walls or floor.\n\nThere was even an instance where I was watching a cut-scene where my partner was driving, and my character was sitting in the drivers seat just talking. My parnter was steering from the passegner's seat, only to have the characters switch places back and fourth two or three times during the cut-scene.\n\nI'm about 2 and a half hours through the game and I have NO idea what's going on. The story is jumping around like the developers/writers had a severe case of ADD. Characters are being introduced, only to have them die at the end of the cut-scene. In one instance. a commander was whispering to his boss while they were the only two people around, and his boss was speaking like the commander wasn't whispering.\n\nAlso, the AI is pretty dumb.\n\nThis game is just... really weird. And not in a good way; but the gameplay is at least on par with some shooters from 2003.\n\nI plan on finishing the game, so... maybe the story will come together by the end, but usually if a game doesn't seem at LEAST promising within the first couple of levels, I don't have much hope for it. Maybe the game will become a little more fun and cohesive, but I highly doubt that.\n\nAs it sits, I'd give the game the benefit of the doubt and give it a 2/5.","April 7","false","11.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The UN establishes MARSCORP (Martian Security and Economics Committee) under the leadership of Samuel Longwood. In the years that follow, the UN gradually loses control of MARSCORP, mainly due to the non-transparent licence policy of its director. Longwood uses his autonomous status to create vassal relations between the corporations and MARSCORP. The unshakable power position of MARSCORP is supported by the companies and thus they acquire additional rights and licenses. Longwood and his consortium become extremely wealthy from this arrangement. However, dissenting voices in MARSCORP begin to challenge Samuel Longwood's authoritarian policy. They demand his dismissal as director and a complete redistribution of the mining rights.\n\nBut Samuel Longwood keeps an ace up his sleeve for occasions like this…\n\nChaser awakens on board the spaceship H.M.S. Majestic. He doesn't know who he is, what he's doing here, why he is being sought by men in black uniforms and what they will do to him when they find him…\n\nThe player's goal is to find out who Chaser really is and why he is being hunted. The story leads the player from the H.M.S. Majestic to Montack City on Earth, then on to Siberia and finally to Mars, where the trail ends and hopefully the truth can be found.","December 9, 2013","true","80.3"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","9","26","0","0"

It was in no way built for gaming, but I was determined to play on it anyway.\n\nI browsed the net for games to play for free, and I found a multiplayer demo of Chaser. I downloaded it, waited several hours for it to load, and installed it.\n\nFor being the first ever fullscreen multiplayer FPS I have ever played, this game was incredible. It was like Call of Duty to me as with kids today. I played every. Single. Day. From what I remember the multiplayer being like, it was fast paced, VERY strategic, had amazing level design, and a wonderful array of weapons to choose from. Every time I see a FAMAS-designed rifle in any other game, I am instantly reminded of Chaser. This game even taught me how to type at 80/wpm. I still often set my keybinds in other games according to Chaser's default keymapping.\n\nNow, I know you're probably thinking, "Well this is a review from memories of a 9 year old kid. Of course it's going to be over-exaggerated." Well, it's true this is the first ever actual game I played on a PC. And it's true I had really no knowledge of what kind of game mechanics are good or desired. I never even touched the campaign because it was a multiplayer demo. But, if I could have compared the multiplayer in Chaser to anything today, it's very close to Counter Strike and Halo: CE. There's no extra crap. It's just you, some guns, some grenades, and an gritty and intelligent level design. It's simple, awesome, fast, and intense.\n\nI love this game to death and I wish I could still play on multiplayer. If there are any graphic/multiplayer mods available for this game, PLEASE let me know.\n\nEdit: I FOUND THE MULTIPLAYER PORTAL :D\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=202720122\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv00Eb5JDOY","March 18, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed it at times and other times i just wanted it to end.\nYou start the first level on some type of space ship fighting futuristic type soldiers that aren't seen ever again until you get to mars.  Then the beginning of the game takes place on  Montack City(Probably my fav) which is pretty much a big ♥♥♥ city that's sorta Asian style with the  yakuza and stuff. Then later on you get to Russia which is the middle point of the game i guess and it's meh. Then you get to the final point of the game which is Mars and it's sorta fun but also at times a pain.\nMusic is good i guess. The weapons are awesome. You get a good variety of weapons. Level design at the beginning is amazing. Really i love the Urban city stuff but Mars's level design is meh and Russia's level design is awful.\nGunplay is good i will give it that.\nStory is well in short you start off the game and you don't remember much so you know what this means.\nThe difficulty is uhmm BS at times.\nGameplay is solid too.\nSo in short i'd give it a 7/10. It's decent but not good or bad. Many flaws like level design and difficulty curves(Even 1 enemy is enough to kill even if you have 100 everything. Both health and armor)\nI don't know who to recommend this to to be honest. If you're a modern FPS gamer then this game is a real treat for you.\nIf you're looking for decent gunplay then i'd say pick it up. Plus it's only 5$ so you aren't losing much.\nBTW check out inside gaming's videos on this game.

It's very difficult to navigate the huge and confusing levels, enemies kill you extremely quickly even on lower difficulties, and it suffers from severe ending fatigue, dragging out it's final levels with more and more locked doors and tough enemies, sometimes with one-hit-kill capability. I actually didn't bother to finish it, it had become such a chore to play. I read the ending and it sucked anyway, and the whole thing turned out to be a take-off of Total Recall gone wrong.  It reminds me of Goldeneye 007 in a bad way, a game where finding out where to go boils down to trying every damn door and tunnel until you find one that isn't blocked. People complain about "pipe shooters" and being railroaded everywhere nowadays but I personally don't mind that. Chaser at least lets you carry every weapon you can find, and health and armor pickups are plentiful enough.","June 23, 2012","false","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a game where you need to "jump crawl"... God knows how stupid that would look in real life, and there are more than a few jumps that feel more like glitching the game rather than playing it as intended. Crashes were also reasonably often (probably had about 10+ crashes) at random times. The acting is also so bad it is almost funny with the lead character being the most dreadful of all delivering line after line of god awfulness. In later levels, the level design goes off the chart weird, and I have to start questioning what the developer was thinking.\n\nAnd that ending...one of the worst endings within a game.\n\nStill, it was strangely compelling. The graphics were pretty good for a game of that age (weird upscaled resolutions, that looked kinda good) but the overall art design was lacking and boring. AI is almost non existent, along with rag doll effects. And the enemy can see you and shoot with 100% accuracy, even when you are miles away and hiding in the shadows. Despite all of that, I completed it, so can't be all bad.\n\nCan only recommend when you are really running out of ideas to play! 5/10","March 15","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Found the story moderately interesting... Game play was straight forward... Game is visually good for the era. It was worth the "on sale" price. The game was obviously not well tested as there are many areas where you can get stuck... It also crashed about 6 times and I tried many compatibility settings in Win 10...  Save often...\n\nOverall rating 6 of 10","February 9","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonstomper/recommended/39670/","moonstomper","Puddy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonstomper/","86 products in account","The problems with this game are the voice acting, the ♥♥♥♥ story, the difficulty and the level design.\nThe voice acting had minimal effort put into it. It sounds like the voice actors came from a ♥♥♥♥ Nickelodeon sitcom. The story makes no sense. Your an ex-space military thing person guy that was also in a space-ship lab that was raided by people from mars. You get into an escape pod that crashes into some crazy ♥♥♥ city or something and stuff happended with the mars people that did things with water. Some gang puts a evil chip in you so you can't leave the city and you have to do the things to do good for thing and stuff, and the mars people are trying to find you so they can do the things. Also, robot ninjas were tied in for some reason. The game is super hard even at the lowest difficulty setting. The level design is overly large for no reason and is confusing. Also no servers are open at all.\n\n\nMy favorite quotes are: I'm sorry chico, Get him, Behind you, Watch out, Idiot, and much more that I can't remember off of the top of my head, probably for a very good reason because its ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\n+The gameplay is good and the same can be said for the graphics.\n\nEDIT: Gameplay is all that matters.\n\n10/10","February 27","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
