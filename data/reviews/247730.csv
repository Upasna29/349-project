DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!! POSTED 10/9/14\n\nLet me start by saying Nether is an extremely fun game and sadly a very frustrating game as well. The high points in this game are a ton of fun especially if you enjoy open world pvp or survival pve. The low points usually make you turn the game off to cool down. Hackers/Glitches/Devs have ruined this game. As i type this it has been 2 weeks of Servers crashing until today where there are no servers left to join except for Last man standing PVP servers which let me stress is not the game you buy. I have checked their web site and they have not made a post since late August despite tons of people begging for help with servers being down and bugs that stop them from even opening Nether. It has now been 24-48 hours of no one being able to play the game and still not one word from devs as to what is happening with the game servers. It would be one thing if they posted saying server maintenance but it has now been 2 weeks of servers dissapearing with 0 communication. Steam should probably stop selling it as people will want there money back for this awful experience. So again I stress DO NOT BUY THIS. I will ammend this review if the Devs ever come back from their vacation.\n\n","October 9, 2014","false","087.3"," 1,670 of 1,841 people (91%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","91","670","1","68","86"

Do you love guns?? Does the idea of having no fear whatsoever of horrifying monsters send a tingle up your spine? Then this is the game for you! In Nether you can find an assortment of things to do such as: Getting killed by a monster! Starving to death! Blowing your brains out over your keyboard!\n\nWelcome to Nether, where our slogan is, if you see it, shoot it! We'll get you hyped up over Co-op and helping eachother out, while showing you that you can be betrayed at anytime. But ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥! If you loved getting tied up and force fed a rotting banana in DayZ, you'll love mercilessly getting shot every time you spawn in Nether! Don't want to get shot? We introdue a brand new feature of spawning in a safezone! But guess what, ♥♥♥♥ you because it will be breached by Nether and will infact be a terrible place to spawn!\n\nYou'll be thrilled when you finally lose your ♥♥♥♥ and join in the murder frenzy! Kill on sight and loot corpses then discover that you've paid $15+ for the biggest game of Call of Duty ever made! Minus the assortment of guns and perks you're prety much just trying to kill other humans.\n\nBut wait, there's more! The totally no existent story will leave you in tears begging for more, and the newly added tribes will make you wish you had just spent the extra $15 for pretty much any other ♥♥♥♥ing game!\n\nDid we mention all of the special features? Boss battles that totally suck, nether surges, which you'll just avoid because ♥♥♥♥ that, and cosmetic items!\n\nLast but not least, the player base! All 300+ of our regular players will swear up and down that Nether is the greatest game ever and there is nothing more fun than sitting outside of a safezone and sniping new players. Because who wants their favorite game to be successful? Not our playerbase, that's for sure!\n\nSo if you're a homicidal maniac who sucks at Call of Duty and feels the need to kill people in an indirect fashion; then this games for you! And if you're on the fence about giving it a try, here's some words of advice: Don't waste your ♥♥♥♥ing money.\n\nEdit: Games you'd do better spending money on-Dark Souls, DayZ, Dark Souls 2, Demon Souls(PS3), State of Decay, Banished(Hardest/most enjoyable game I've played after Dark souls, oddly enough).","June 11, 2014","false","14.7"," 4,256 of 4,889 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","256","4","0","161"

Whilst this game was in Alpha, it was excellent. The ambience was top notch and the sense of lonliness was exactly how it should have been. Of course, every game comes with it's flaws but it wasn't too much of a deal given the game was in alpha and the bugs were only minor. A texture not loading here and there and a few sounds sometimes dissapeared. Everthing was going great untill the big updated started to happen.\n\nWhen the motorbike was implemented through an update, it was obvious that this game was going downhill... and it did. Now what we have is more or less a focus on PvP to the point where it is now possible to play as the Nether (The creatures that inhabit the city). This removes all the ambience and idea of "It's them against us". Furthermore, the game began to degrade in quality. More bugs began to grow and the game began to just get more laggy throughout each update. They had also removed the ability to scavange the variety of weapons but instead replaced it by forging weapons together using the body parts of the Nether. Who knew that a demonic, spine, brain and eyeball makes an M9 pistol? Also, around the time that this game made it's movement from Alpha to Beta, all of the inventory, characters and accounts got reset. This also included the in-game money which some people paid for in the form of the Believers pack. All of the people who purchased these packs were going to be re-funded on the in-game money they may have spent. Now this is me speaking from personal experience so I don't know if anybody had the same issue, I had purchased the Believers pack back in the Alpha stages for £22.99 which means I had received about 20 of the gold coins or whatever the currency in-game was. After the reset, I was dis-heartened to find out that I actually was never refunded this in-game which I paid extra to receive.\n\nIn short, it shocks me that all those who paid for this game in it's Alpha stages now have a game which they didn't pay for and may possibly never pick up again.

I enjoyed this game for about three hours. I think I was getting lucky. I WAS also very excited about the prospect of completing missions in a survival game. Here are some things that ruined the game after the initial glow wore off.\n1. Big missions seem more or less impossible to beat in games with random marauders running around.\n2. Courier missions (sounds fun, right?) End with PCs camping the goal zone. So you run for ~ 15 minutes and get shot.\n3. Camping PCs have crazy/scary equipment that they bought with real money. F@#$ off. Get the F@#$ out of here. Unnacceptable.\n4. Stuff spawns into the world randomly and without logical placement. I realize this is a genre standard - but it is a pathetic genre standard.\n5. The world is too small for the style of gameplay. I saw the whole thing.\n6. The buildings are SO similar that they may as well be proceduraly generated - which would massively improve this game BTW.\n7. Here's an important one that nobody seems to mention - the Nether (monsters) TELEPORT and are UNESCAPABLE. I understand that this may be a clever way to prevent them from glitching but it also randomizes and renders unrealistic combat with them. It is ultimately annoying to fight them as a result. You run backward while they teleport toward you over and over - It's neat that they're dangerous but it is sad that they TELEPORT.\n8. The level system is . . . uninteresting and seems not worth paying attention to. I think it'd be much better to just start everyone out fully leveled because 1. my fat cousin can run farther than my "survivor" and 2. My "survivor" eats loads more than my fat cousin. WTF. If there MUST be leveling, I'd like it to be under-the-hood pracice based leveling.\n9. Prey or Pray is a dumb slogan - was before I bought - just throwin that in here. Please just stop saying it.\n10. The masks that the serial-killer veteran players wear are. . .juvenile. I wound up hating all of them. In the time I played I remained a noob and the game felt VERY much about vets mercing noobs. To me that seems like a poor design. Noobs dont want to be bullied and vets dont (in most games) enjoy bullying noobs. These guys do it anyway - which makes me hate them. The juvenile masks make me hate them more. I don't want to spend my free time with these people.\n\nI know the game is in Alpha and that's why I've left out coments on glitches, completion, lame lighting effects and so on. These gripes are deep design issues and. . . well they aint likely to go away. Sorry.\n\nHere's some things that could improve it for me:\n1. Non PVP server for doing some of those sweet lookin missions. Also a no paid-content option would be nice. I feel like paid add-ons in a PVP game is a bit of a deal breaker for me.\n2. Bigger (Way) map, preferabley proceduraly generated - I know it's too late for that.\n3. More sensible item spawning, perhaps mildly instanced item spawns - i.e. if I'm hurt it'd be nice to find bandages in an ambulance - ever.  I should be able to make logical descisions about where to go for what.\n4. No lame outfits. Lame means - anything 13 year olds think looks cool. Just do a test group and delete everything they like.\n5. Some way to punish Vets for mercing noobs. If there is some system for that it isn't working.\n6. Color. The apacolypse will not dull the color of leaves. Leaves will be leaves. Paint will not dull inside away from UV damage. The post-apocolypse will be in full color spectrum color. Please stop this idiotic mistake. Thanks Bethesda.\n7. Make the Nether escapeable. It WOULD be more fun for EVERYONE to be chased by big scary stuff and have to hide.\n8. Make it so players can run. Like a real person can run. Most adults could run across this map in one go at a good clip. It's like four city blocks on the long side.\n9. Get rid of safezones.\n10. Share rewards within vicinity with cooperation thus encouraging teamplay.\n\nOut of 10:\nGraphics - 9 <- point off for the lame old post-apocolyptic color pallette blunder.\nSound - 6 <- good but thin and repetive.\nCommunity - 2 <- Vets mercing noobs with "Manhunt" style Jason masks ruins this game for me. How about some goggles or some scarves or something. . . why phychopathic serial killers?\nConcept - 7 <- In theory this game could be good. In practice most of the ideas aren't realized at all.\nDesign -5 <- The monsters are great, the city is pretty good, the People are REALLY lame. (bright green napsacks?) Where are these halloween masks coming from? I actually saw witch hunting hats like the ones from Warhammer 40k. Seriously, they're in there. hahahahaa.\nMechanics - 2 <- Game mechanic integration ruins this game for me. It just isn't fitting all together. Random spawns. There isn't much to do - or you don't get to do it with jerks randomly killing you.\nFun - 6 at first then on down to 1.\n\nGame over.","January 25, 2014","false","9.3"," 1,519 of 1,786 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","519","1","0","40"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/filmfanatic33/recommended/247730/","filmfanatic33","filmfanatic33","http://steamcommunity.com/id/filmfanatic33/","208 products in account","Now I'm usually really lenient when it comes to reviewing a game, so much so that in the most case I feel it best to avoid doing so, so as not to "put off" players from playing a game. But in this case I am really sad to say that I almost feel obliged to write a review. Now the game itself is pretty fun, I won't take that away from it, but frankly there are major issues that need sorting and frankly they aren't the kind that can just be ignored:\n\nThere are a lot, and I mean A LOT of hackers in this game, to the point where you can be merily sauntering around the swamps of the game map, and then suddenly completely out of the blue be shot from across the entire bloody map by a person that can not and should not be able to see you. This literally makes the game unplayable at certain times and destroys the immersion.\n\nGLITCHES AND BUGS EVERYWHERE! Many a time have I had super gear and then found myself falling quite ridiculously into a non existant hole in a highway, only to get stuck and either drown in inivisible water or just have to walk around aimlessly in a trap hole. Not really what I imagined for a post apocalyptic death scenario.\n\nThe map is huge, and this is not a negative. In fact I think the map is brilliant, the choice of either open fields of death or narrow streets and high rise buildings to be sniped from. These elements add a real sense of fear to the game and I believe that is what makes me keep playing the game.\n\nThe PVP aspect, oh god I hate this bit. Unless you intend to play with a group of over 5 bazillion people, don't bother trying to be friendly or nice to other players. They will gun you the f*** down without a moments hesitation, steal all your stuff and then get shot themselves by someone watching from a far off place. PVP sucks in this game, and even with friends, you aren't safe. BUT, credit where credit is due, this again adds a serious fear element which I can really appreciate, a proper struggle for survival in a world where no one gives a ♥♥♥♥ what you do.\n\nThe AI monsters (or nethers) are pretty f****** scary, and when you encounter the wrong type, wow can you be killed quick! They are exactly what they should be, something to avoid rather than something to attack. The benefit though is when you have the right gear to fight them, because then you can reap the rewards of your triumphant kill, sell off their body parts and make money or items haazah! That is of course, unless you get sniped by someone 5 miles away....\n\nServers is my last issue now, seeing as when I started playing this game, to even get to the server screen was awful. You had to wait over 15 minutes just for the main menu screen to load! But now I look back fondly at this time because at least back then there were servers! Now you are handed a pathetically small list of servers, of which the main ones are the god awful new gamemode last man standing (don't ask). SO if you want to actually play this game, I wish you luck trying to find a bloody server to play on....\n\nOkay so that is pretty much all I have to say, I wish it wasn't so negative because I am still adamant this game has massive potential, and it really is a shame that it was released in such a s*** state, because I do enjoy it. YES! Despite all the terrile bugs and the terrible gameplay, and the not so great textures, it is still a fun game. Why you ask? Because in its errors and faults, there is a weird charm that just makes me keep playing it. And yes I cry and damn near wreck my room when I've spent 3 years trying to get this one gun and then suddenly *SNIPE* and all my progress is gone, but that just makes it all the more challenging, fighting for survival in a world where you start off as an underdog and remain that way for the entirety of the rest of the game! So my advice to you potential player, don't go into this game with high expectations, because it won't meet them, but rather see this game as a continuous work in progress, or even as a very human version of an apocalypse. My reason for the "No" recommendation? Merely because I am hoping if enough people downvote this game they may actually fix it, and then we can all go about sniping each other legitimately!","October 20, 2014","false","47.8"," 456 of 518 people (88%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","88","456","518","13","2"

It's a broken, buggy, confusing mess of disparate elements, hastily cobbled together with little thought, ugly mechanics obscured with pretty graphics and buzz-words like "sandbox" and "hardcore survival" thrown around to lure in the unwary.\n\nPros:\n- This is a good-looking game, at least from a distance.\n- It sports a fairly large game world which feels lived-in and real.\n- Excellent atmosphere replete with background noise, harsh wind and insect buzzing. It pulls off that desolate post-apocalyptic feel better than any game I can think of besides Metro 2033 and Last Light.\n- Good overall sound design\n\nCons:\n- It's poorly optimized and chokes even the highest-end PC's and lowering the video settings to minimum doesn't help much. It tries to compensate by un-rendering many props at a ridiculously short distance.\n- Confusing everything. You get a "tutorial mission" the first time you play, which explains a few things, but not nearly enough of essential info. Hours into the game, I still didn't know what I was doing. Something's wrong when you don't explain why there are invincible, immobile enemies spawned in clusters throughout the world.\n- Enemy encounters are surprisingly rare outside of periodically attacked outposts. That said, when you do encounter more than 1 or 2, you can be killed within seconds. Because AI pathfinding is hard, the enemies always teleport behind you, and warp away when attacked because they're also dumb as rocks, so the devs had to make them as cheap as possible so that they wouldn't be just cannon fodder.\n- NPC traders only accept specific combinations of items, so you're stuck lugging around meaningless junk for much of the game.\n- Randomly generated "quest" system which is nothing but deliver box A to shop B. This wouldn't be so bad if getting around in this game didn't take an eternity. Oh, and of course they have weight values and clog up your initially tiny inventory. Also, each random quest box can only be turned in at one NPC. This is literally the most half-♥♥♥♥♥ "quest" system I've ever seen in a game.\n- What makes this worse is you lose everything when you die. That's fine for players who want to feel super hardcore and macho, but that's going to turn off a ton of new players who aren't even given a chance to get comfortable with the mechanics.\n- Random health pickups strewn throughout the world aren't enough to keep you alive and health regenerates excruciatingly slowly.\n- Only a handful of servers, usually just one per game mode and region, most of which seem buggy as hell.\n- Unwieldy, confusing UI. No way to track other players or friends... unless they have to join your tribe first, and in that case, F that.\n- This game seems to have been either abandoned by its developer or they just don't care. Controller support has been broken for months, private servers were promised since the beginning and still haven't surfaced, hackers are running rampant and unchallenged, etc. Apparently, they can't even do something as simple as send a forgotten password email... 3 times.

I don't intend to revisit Nether. I did not enjoy my initial experience and (from what I can see) things have changed, but the game itself hasn't met anything I wanted it to. I recommend you look into various sources before you buy this game.\n\nEDIT: In light of certain comments, let me make a few things clear:\n\n- Yes, I realize this is Early Access. I say so at the very beginning. No, that does not mean a game that is -SELLING- is immune to criticism. Early Access or not, this is a product that people are capable of purchasing. Therefore, we are free to offer our take on whether or not we recommend it -- and I don't.\n\nThat being said, to everyone: Please, take my review with a grain of salt. Feel free to investigate anything I say on your own. Make your own conclusions.\n\n- While it looks like my playtime is insufficient to make any judgments on the game, I can assure you the amount of time I spent was enough to confidently state the points I made.\n\n- Given that this is Early Access, this review -MAY- change drastically, or even be removed if the points I had an issue with are fixed/addressed. I'm not here to nab popularity votes or some ♥♥♥♥, the only intention of this review is to warn people who are expecting more than this game can currently provide.\n\n- My opinion might differ from yours. Simply pointing out it's an opinion doesn't negate ♥♥♥♥. It's entirely possible that you enjoy the game as is, and if you do, more power to you. However, that doesn't mean I am wrong to think otherwise, nor does it mean anyone who agrees is also wrong.\n\n- If a recent patch fixes any of the issues and I haven't adjusted my review, please let me know in a comment. It is possible (and likely) that I am not aware yet.\n\n\nOriginal Review Below:\n\n========================================================================\n\n\nLet me start out by saying that the game isn't bad. It's a great concept, and it looks pretty great. Further, the game is still in Beta, so don't view the game -too- harshly.\n\nBut it has a long way to go before it's worth buying.\n\n1. Too much emphasis on PvP, to where ultimately the game feels like a chore to play. It's impossible to rally any sort of human cooperation a majority of the time, which while fine in a game like DayZ, is a serious flaw in a game like Nether (where safe areas have to be defended and survival typically is best in groups).\n\nI'd suggest making two (or more) seperate teams/groups, of which the player has to choose from on character creation and cannot change unless they rejoin the server.\n\nOne is the "survivor" group, in which members of the group cannot hurt other members, and people inside gain exp boost (or some other form of incentive [maybe hunger slows down?]). The other group is the bandits, which is the free-for-all side of the game, offering no incentive beside being able to hunt whoever they want. The two groups should be easily distinguishable.\n\n2. Safe areas are not safe. People often camp the entrance of a safe haven and shoot anyone approaching. The ideal solution is extending the area of safe havens and giving combat a cooldown (10seconds?) upon exit.\n\n3. The level system feels pointless, as it resets after every death. It should be account bound, much like how gold-items are. Or removed. Either way, as it stands, there is no reason to level up.\n\n4. Collision issues are everywhere. Crouching often gets you stuck on objects, especially while on a roof.\n\n5. Name tags are displayed when you hover over another person, which is a real big issue when trying to hide/avoid other people. This feature should either be removed or it should be changed to only display in extremely close encounters.\n\nThese five issues, amongst numerous other glitches (gun delay, scenary bugs, etc), make the game not worthwhile yet. I hope to see these things changed very soon, so that it feels like playing the game is worthwhile.","November 25, 2013","false","7.6"," 2,248 of 3,117 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","248","3","0","132"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bingawombadoose/recommended/247730/","bingawombadoose","shing teyan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bingawombadoose/","196 products in account","Short Version:\nThis game sucks and I want my money back.\n\n\nLong Version:\n\nThis game has a multitude of problems that are being paid no attention to despite the outcry on the forums to deal with said problems.  The developers have basically abandoned the game and left a small team to use it as their little playground as they release 'fixes' that don't fix anything we NEED fixed.  So many silly things that make this game either impossible or boring and just plainly rob you of your experience.\n\nPros\n- You can be the exact thing you might very well be hunting in the games.\n(Golems, Watchers)\n\n\nConsYeah, didn't see that coming, did you?  That was the only redeeming part of the game for me.\n\nSurvivors\n- The 'About this Game' section is full of complete ♥♥♥♥.  There is no life-saving decision because there is no way to save your life.  The game is riddled with hackers that seem to go unnoticed by the developers.  This, combined with numerous bugs pertaining to weapons, stamina and the game's skill system make it impossible to play.\n\n- The servers are constantly down or screwed up beyond all relief.  There used to be between twenty to twenty-five servers, and now there's ten at the most with about three or four of them being US East and a similar number for US West-  One not monitored by Steam VAC [which doesn't work with Nether by the way] in each category.  There's currently a bug going about that makes it impossible to join servers.  You click to join, it loads you in, then sends you back to the server select screen.\n\n- None of the weapons are balanced in any way and all of them can kill you in a few meager hits, or even one.  The game's enemies- the Nether -pose absolutely NO threat unless you try to intentionally get them after you by running into screamers,  hordes lead by reapers or dropzones.  Otherwise, there's barely ANY Nether around and they can be killed so easily that it's not even funny.  It may take a bit, but odds are you'll leave unscathed if you follow the basic tactic of [W], [Mouse 1], [S].\n\n- The game is VERY Pay-2-play.  Some may disagree but your Nether Gold can be used to buy weapons, food, ammo and Nether Potions which allow you to turn into weak Nether that die far too easily.\n\n- The only vehicles in the game don't work and actually explode or fly into the air on you if you try to get in them.  I know this from experience, and it was a painful experience.\n\n- As expected, the only people who you can really trust in that game are the people on your friend's list in Steam who you probably knew before you bought this trainwreck.  Tribes mean nothing and hold no value as tribemembers will still gladly slaughter other tribemembers- even during location takeovers so their negativity with their tribe is entirely abolished once they capture it and make it out with your hard-earned items.\n\n- Spawn locations for weapons and ammo aren't too far in between as a shotgun can be just a few steps away from an SMG or sword that does about 225 damage per swing, not including the game's skills.\n\n- Hitboxes in this game are VERY poor, as well as the weapon system.  Instead of a simple animation to slightly lean in to focus your aim, the game immediately changes your field of view, forces your perspective forward and puts the sight of the gun directly into your face in the course of a millisecond.\n\n- Safezones can be attacked, and disabled for up to an HOUR unless players can band together to reactivate anti-Nether arrays in the safezone.  People often hide in buildings around the safezones, an example being Lakeside, the biggest and most common safezone, and snipe down at anyone who walks in.  Even if they killed you once, they will continue to kill you until you give up.  This makes the game unfun and unfair.\n\n- Medpacks and energy boost items can be hotkeyed, but they have absolutely no cooldown.  You can keep downing pills in the midst of battle.\n\nNether\n- To be a Golem or Watcher, you have to pay in the game's 'funbucks'.  You can pay with in-game money, but it costs $1,250 just to be a Crawler Nether- only 1250 HP with about 125 damage output.  You can also get a single one from completing the beginner tutorial.  You only get three lives and do minimal damage whereas the human survivors get weapons that do up to five-hundred damage per shot.  That's six shots to end your life just for you to spawn miles away from the actual players.  You slowly die if you don't kill anyone to refill your food bar and have minimum damage output so this makes it impossible to do properly.\n\n- As a Nether, you can get caught in a LOT of things in this game, especially the stairs.  Trying to go up them often results in you being trapped in the stairs, and unable to move.  While it is possible to get out, it's still ridiculous how traversing stairs seems to be impossible.\n\n- As a Nether, when you teleport, your physical entity is still above ground.  If you disappear and move around- you can still be killed by spray-pray.\n\n- As a Nether, if you go to an outpost currently under attack and wait there until the outpost is secured, you can keep the Outpost in an 'attacked' state.  Players may fire, Nether may still enter, but not spawn inside, and as long as YOU are within the Safezone as a Nether, it will remain this way, whether you're shooting or not.\n\nNote\nI just wanna throw this out there as well.  I bought the Chosen edition-  When it was $40, thinking I was about to have one of the best experiences of my life.  A week later, the price dropped and the game was still total ♥♥♥♥.  The developers don't try to talk to the community or interact, they just do what they want.  Even as I typed this, they've released a DLC that forces you to fight other players, something that already happens day to day in the game if you can even get into it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers.  I guess I should have expected this coming from guys who make mobile games chock-full of pay-to-play bonus ♥♥♥♥ that's similar to Farmville or Candy Crush.  On their website and even their Twitter, there is nothing about Nether, only 'WARP', their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 6v6 mobile-MOBA.  Nether so much potential and I can definitely see it going somewhere, but with the people working on it as it is who seem to think they can scrape by the bottom of the boat with such horrendous features running it, it's doomed to die and may have already died.","October 11, 2014","false","47.9"," 210 of 265 people (79%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","79","210","265","16","3"

This review is strictly for January and before.\n\n**TRIPLE EDIT: My review is no longer relevant, as I've seen about 5gb worth of updates since the last time I played. I may pick it up again in the future, but I'm too jarred from my previous experiences with the game. If you plan on buying this game, please put a lot of consideration into it. You may very well be disappointed with it, as I was.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLike every other survival MMO, great concept, poor execution. The community is worse than the DayZ community.\nIn my 4 hours, I've died at least 15 times.\nAllow me to recap all I can remember.\n\n-First spawn. Walked around for 10 minutes. Got sucked into the atmosphere. I was geniunely enjoying sneaking around these empty buildings. I saw a guy, but he hadn't seen me. He had no weapon, he was a new spawn like me. I chased him and tried to introduce myself, we both got shot from no where.\n\n-Second spawn, open up the map, start heading towards safe zone. Get shot within 30 seconds.\n\n-Spawn. I'm at a beach. Pretty cool. I go to the end of the warf and jump into the water, only to find that instead of swimming, I plummet to the ocean floor and die.\n\n-Spawn. Started heading towards the safe zone. Cross a bridge, get shot at, narrowly escape, head further towards it, get shot by someone else.\n\n-Spawn. Finally make it to a safe zone. Get shot just before I can enter.\n\n-Spawn. Finally have my first encounter with the Nether. There's four of them, I kill one or two before they kill me. (Finally a fair death).\n\n-Spawn facing another newspawn. "Hello?" I ask in my best 'Please for the love of god give me a ♥♥♥♥ing break' voice, he starts stabbing me with his knife. I can no longer take it. I let him kill me and take a few days away from this game.\n\nI come back a week later.\n\n-Spawn with only 550 health for some reason. Climb up a three story building. Check the roof, there's no loot, I glitch off and fall to my death.\n\n-Spawn. Sneak through some buildings, find a hatchet in the back of a big truck, my very first piece of loot! Things are finally looking up!. I crawl in going as slow as I can. Hear a growl. I figure 'he can't hear or see me, I should be fine'. Turn around, some giant ♥♥♥♥er teleports in and smashes me to death.\n\n-Spawn. There's a giant cool building in right in front of me. "Sweet! This is gonna be-" I get sniped within a few seconds of spawning.\n\nA few weeks pass.\n\n-Spawn. "Hey dude." I hear some guy say, I scramble for the P2T button, but I can't remember it. I turn around, he shoots me.\n\n-Spawn. I walk to an alley for a moment before I tab out, google the VOIP button, and then tab back in and I see a person with a gun just looking at me, as if inspecting me. I say "Hey dude!" He replies with "Yo.". Finally, a friend!\nWe walk together for a few moments, he asks me how new I am, I tell him I'm brand new since the only thing I've ever done is get shot. He tells me it's a bit harsh, and he explains how he's among the top of the leaderboards for something, though I can barely understand him since the VOIP is so laggy.\nAfter a moment, we come across a subway access stair case. We venture down, hooray! I'm actually exploring and having fun with a stranger I've found! We walk through the subway tunnels. We're attacked by four or five monsters all up, but together with team work we make short work of them. Haha! I'm on top of the world! We find the exit to the subway, and as I venture up, I spot a shotgun. I pick it up. 6 bullets. That's enough to-\nSuddenly I hear shooting! Oh no, we're under attack! My friend covers one entrance to the subway while I cover the other. He's shooting, I look over and to my dismay, he's been killed! No, my only friend! You ♥♥♥♥ers! I sprint over to his body, set myself up tactically, and as one of them moves in I blow him away (miraculously, as when I try to shoot there's a one second delay). I look back up to the only other entrance, and then bam! A spray of bullets. I'm dead. A completely different player had come the way we came, and killed me.\n\nSo that's it. Those are my Nether experiences. Beta or not, this game is nothing but frustration. It's going to take a lot for me to ever want to play this game again.","January 14, 2014","false","8.4"," 126 of 164 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","126","164","0","7"

Just 5 servers still up, no words fro the new DEV team, no more hope.  ;(\n\nNEW EDIT: MONTHS AFTER THE FUL RELEASE\n----------------\nThe game still broken, can't map all controls, there are less and less servers, hackers, almost nothing changed from alpha stage, .... all the hope about this game getting better is gone.\nAs a lot of people said when was in alpha, this game is nothing more than warz 0.2   :  just another unfinished mess to try to make money from players looking for a good open world survivor game.\n\n\n-----------------------EDIT : REVIEW  AFTER THE FULL RELEASE-----------------------------\n\nThis game feels like an Alpha, run like and Alpha and didn't change too much in 9 months.\n\n- key mapping is not complete (just some keys can be changed, to know what the rest of the keys do, you have to search in the forum for clues)\n\n- To change settings (controlls, video, audio) you have to connect to a server !!!!!  I'm serious\n\n- Server browser don't show the servers ping or location (lag, desync, ecc ecc) and sometimes freeze the entire game.\n\n- This is a huge pvp map, the Npc creatures are done well but the melee combact doens't feel smooth at all, the firearms action can be fun.\n\n- Character animations are the same from alpha, they need a lot of work. (other players are actually fun to watch moving around the map).\n\n- Characters costumization: almost none, some clothes and mask and they all looks terrible.\n\n- bugs, bugs and more bugs (ex: invisible walls where the map isn't finished)\n\n- Hackers, (due to the impossibility to see the server ping sometimes they are not hackers just people desynching so badly that you see them flying, passing trough walls , ecc ecc).\n\n- The atmosphere of the game at least is good, I love the big teleporting monsters called Nethers.\nIt's a shame, this game could have been so good but I don't see it going in other directions than a big death match map.\n\n- The new way to find stuff by always open boxes, cases, it's really done bad.\n\nAfter more than 9 months of developpment the game still the same buggy, unfinished mess that was on alpha.\nUnfortunally, the DEV team behind this game can't deliver simple basilar mechanics like a normal server browser or full keymapping, so I don't think that they can do anything better with the actual game.\nThere are some good ideas behind this product, but the execution is just not acceptable.\n\nedit: Good news everyone!!!!    Now they are addings keys that you can buy with real money to open box inside the game to have good loot!\nYou can even play as a Nether, guess what? to do this you have to buy a potion on the store or buy a key to open a gold box that may have that postion... smooth!!!","June 6, 2014","false","7.9"," 104 of 140 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","104","140","0","3"

I started it up and entered the world. I had only a knife. I fought long and hard for survival but I died several times. After a while I had gathered alot of guns. And I mean ALOT. My whole storage was full of different ones. Some I had crafted, some I had traded and some I had found. Now that is when the fun started. Knowing that I could take out a gun and, even if I died, i would have another one I started doing daring stuff. Teamed up with equally good players. Had alot of fun. I still remember this game as a fun, immersiveand beautiful. I had a great time.\nThen came the dark times.\nThe games development was taken over by some other studio that I don't remember the name of. They implemented a system that allowed players to pay real money for in-game gold. Basicly you had to pay to have fun. I still played tho. With my armory of guns I continoued to have fun for a while. Heck I even paid a bit myself. But after a while everyone had better gear than me and I was killed over and over and over again. Me, not wanting to use alot of money on a game that I'd already bought, played less and less and less. Untill I played nothing at all. Started playing other similar games. (out of which Miscreated is the best one, which I recommend). The game is uninstalled to clear space and about a year later I think back to the good old days playing Nether. I think "Maybe I should check it out again. Maybe it's changed". So I research and it turns out. Phosphor (the original developers) are back working on Nether. They remove the in-game purchases, and everything was looking brighter. I download and launch. The game runs ♥♥♥♥. I can't even tell you how bad it runs. At the lowest settings it was unplayable. I was trying with the same computer that could run medium to high without problems a year and a half ago. I don't know what happened but I'll say this: If you don't have a good PC you should not buy this game. Not in the state that it's in. My PC specs are Ok. I have a ASUS GeForce GTX 660 ti which, as I mentioned: Ran the game at medium to high before.\n\nTo sum it up: I'll give the game a 7/10... one and a half year ago.\n2/10 when it had other developers (pay to win)\nand 4/10 now.

This is required if you bought your game via Steam." Pretty sure I bought a log-in simulator 2014. 0/10 for survival game. 11/10 for log-in simulation. Great release!\n\nEdit: Managed to get past the log in screen ^^\n\n@Sneeker I don't expect a game to be perfect on release but I expect a fully released game to not freeze at the server list for over 10 minutes, and after getting into a server I have to fly around in spectator for another good 10 minutes in order to spawn. The game has so many problems at the moment I can't consider it out of beta. I play with a squad of friends and not a single one of them haven't experienced a crash or freeze, when a game is considered a full release the MAJORITY of players should not be experiencing such problems.\n\nGameplay wise I don't mind the developer's hardcore style of survival. I love the thrill of getting safe zone camped by players or raided by nethers. It's ok to lose all my items and levels when I die as a punishment for getting killed, this aspect of the game creates an early to mid to late game feel giving the game a great degree of replay value. The idea is great but was executed poorly, I constantly find myself clipping through solid objects, taking fall damage for no reason as the rock I hopped on is apparently a sprite and I fell right through it.\n\nThis review isn't for people who have already bought the game and managed to get in and enjoy it. It's for buyers who are deciding whether or not to purchase an enjoyable experience, and I don't think it's ready yet. All of my buddies agree that the game feels lacking and we would have a better exoerience when it is "done".

Sounds easy, all one had to do was not release a game long before it was finished and stay out of stuff such as microtransactions to unlock exclusive content for a paid game. Unfortunately, Nether failed in both aspects, and in my two minutes of actually playing the game (the rest were trying to get the game to run in the first place), I regret spending $3 USD for this garbage.\n\nNether had a lot of promise, a load of ideas that sounded like a solid plan, such as quest moments to really get players to aggro to one area and make things more exciting, and enemies apart from zombies. But none of these ideas come to light, thanks to being greeted by microtransactions from the get-go, cosmetic or otherwise, game breaking bugs like being stuck in a spectator mode which isn't even part of the game, the random moments where you're not capable of swimming despite it supposedly being possible (and roughly 50% of the game world is covered in deep water with no bridges), and moments where characters spontaneously die.\n\nI have no idea what game the official reviews were playing, but if it was Nether, then I'm going to hazard a guess and assume they were paid for those results. Heck, one review even opens up how great Phosphor Games is.\n\nNether has one thing going for it, and that's much nicer visuals than either DayZ or The WarZ, but that's as far as it goes. All in all, the game is basically a spiritual sequel to The WarZ, and it's made readily apparent from the moment you launch the game.

So you all can downvote this negative review but it doesn’t change my opinion about it… I have always written honest reviews and so I do now!\n\nGenre: Nether is a first person survival shooter game.\n\nMy FIRST DAYS with this game:\nFirst day I tried to play this game I had to register an account for Nether… That was bothersome but okay… (By the way the small box with “Remember me” seems not to work because I always have to fill it in again.)\nAlright I was ready to play then but the game just crashed. I saw a white screen and wasn’t able to close the game. Even ALT+F4, ALT+TAB and Taskmanager haven’t worked… So I had to restart my computer what really wasn’t funny anymore. Same happened 3 times. So I decided to try it another day maybe…\n\nMy NEXT DAYS with this game:\nOne week later… I tried the game again and YEAH HELL NO WHITE SCREEN! I was so happy to see something. But my happiness went into sadness when I joined a server and crashed after 1 minute back to the desktop. With the Error “Nether has a problem”. Yeah I see… Nether has a problem. <.<\nAlright, alright… I don’t wanted to give up so I closed the game and started it again. I see the servers, join one and this time I see a blackscreen… This diversification is really amazing. :c\nUff.. Then I saw something – DRUM ROLL – ………………………………..the server list again. :> Wait… wasn’t I connecting to a server? Hmmm… okay.. let’s do it again. We try another server.\n♥♥♥♥… I ended again in the serverlist. Alright NEXT SERVER…. serverlist again. I tried this with 10 servers then I closed the game again. ♥♥♥♥ it!\n\nTODAY:\nToday I was really, really lucky. I had the glory to REALLY PLAY this game. Yay!\nAnd and and… wait what is this? This looks terrible… The graphic is a brashness not more. I would give the graphic 2/10 points. But just if they pay for the headache pills I had to take. ;(\nI have to mention that I sometimes get an headache when I play a game with a really terrible graphic (I think there have been 4 games which were able to do that from my 350 games =D).\nI still don’t wanted to give up so I played it for a while. In the safezone I wanted to look for the map first (where I have to go and what I maybe have to do). So I jumped into the cargo area of a truck and opened the menu. After seeing where I have to go and finishing my settings I met some amazing players. <3 “Oh HI MY FRIEND!”… “Uhm could you make a step backwards that I can leave the truck?”… “Uhm.. no?”… “Oh great… yeah blind me with your ♥♥♥♥ing green light and don’t let me leave the truck… really funny”.\n5 minutes later: I was able to leave the truck. <.< So I continued my way and left the safezone. I met my first enemies… some uhm.. what the ♥♥♥♥ are they? Teleporting aliens with no bones? They don’t even look a bit scary… urgh.. alright… killing one after the other I reached level 10. Walking always straight on (pressing 30 minutes the W-button.. yay… funny) I met players from time to time… who were not much different to the creatures. They also looked bad ( the 3 human characters look really similar and the girl has no hair... <3) and like the creatures the humans also tried to kill me. Good thing they had such a terrible aim that I killed them.. okay I just killed one.. the other players were  running away. Hmm so following them? Urgh ♥♥♥♥ no.. I want to ♥♥♥♥ing see something in this game… Sometimes I asked myself why I have to hold the picking up button for so long to get my drops… even in reality it doesn’t take so long to do this. O: Especially when there are 3 things on the ground and I want all…… I don’t even know why I want those bones and blood… Because I haven’t got any instruction into this game. :3 Hmm so my travel through this buggy and laggy world was kinda boring… so boring that I sometimes wanted to commit suicide. I really tried… but my jump was so buggy that I saw everything dangle for 10 seconds and found myself back on the position from where I jumped… Great. Alright God wants me to play further this game. After 10 minutes pressing the W-Button (for walking straight on) again I was still alive, still bored, still had an headache and burning eyes… and yea I gave up. I just opened menu and pressed EXIT… like PLEASE LET ME GO! Q.Q\n\nConclusion:\nI really regret that I have bought this game. ;( At least for now… I MAYBE try this game again… but some months later. MAYBE they need some months to make this “Early Access Game” to a game. Or WAIT! This isn’t an “Early Access Game”? Why the hell… WHY?!\n(Add: Even if it was Early Access for a short while it isn't E.A. in the shop anymore and still full of errors.)\n\nDate of Review: 4th July 2014","July 3, 2014","false","1.0"," 53 of 70 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","53","70","0","22"

There never was and still not is any effective cheat detection or protection in this game.\n\nA game that could be extremely addictive and fun, intense solo or with friends, able to pull out the most multifarious feelings out of your synapses - suddenly turns into the complete opposite.\n\nFor me as a “veteran” of Nether it feels like the developers were parents that gave their own beloved child heroin as a 13th birthday present and then sitting down and watch it passing away.\n\n\nJust.

On top of that, you can play "lets-find-everything-but-a-gun" for 45 min straight, and then get killed by some guy on a roof with a sniper rifle... real fun right? You also get hungry, but you might as well just die and reset because food is overpriced too, along with healing supplies.

Nether is basically just a heavy retooling of the same, tired, boring, unbalanced and unforgiving genre of "survival" concepts. There's little to no incentive to co-operate with other players therefore there's little point to survival. Treat each game more like a disposable burn session, there's no long-term here.\n\nAll-in-all, if you're just in it for the mindless combat, trolling players or exploring a post-apocalyptic wasteland which resembles Chicago bordering Detroit with some of the crappiest suburbs in-between, then you might enjoy it just for that. Otherwise, don't expect any spectactular story, end-game or goal-driven gameplay. If the Enemy players or AI aren't trying to kill you, then don't worry. The surrounding environment will do a great job to make up for that as your character can't swim in waist-deep water and despite being above water will begin to drown or take damage anyway.\n\nIf you're still not convinced then don't let the screenshots deceive you. Even at the highest quality settings, the game looks NOTHING like what you see in the screenshots or video. This game looks worse than Fallout 3 at the lowest settings even if you have the newest fanciest card. At one point this game did have promise and potential, however it doesn't appear to have lived up to any of it.","October 27, 2014","false","1.8"," 92 of 138 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","92","138","0","0"

Good price for items in stores. Diversified items and crafting. Yes it is a survival gaming experience. Actually it just like a death match mode. The feel when you spent more than 6 hours trying to survival, kill all those monster and then dead just because someone shooting you with a sniper and you don't even know where they are or get killed by a group of people or someone telling you that trust them and follow them and after that they kill you. And you lost everything, even level, skill tree. Start over with nothing, i mean you don't want to play anymore. The game still have many bugs, and i don't even know how the cars work, obviously the game still early access so it is fine. I'm really enjoyed when play this game but i hope it will be better than a deathmatch mode, no more bugs, hacking, in someday. Easy to find interesting at the beginning. You will get bored when you maximum level and weapon because there are nothing to do unless just to kill people and it being like CSGO or CoD no longer is a survial game.","May 26, 2014","false","33.6"," 63 of 90 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","63","90","0","2"

It does update rather often, so you need to be installing new things quite a bit, but honestly, the updates only make the game that much greater, so the updates are worth the wait.\n\nThis is a strict Multiplayer only game, so if you don't have good enough internet to play online, I don't recommend getting it just yet. Multiplayer is quite amazing in this game, and really gives the player a more intense experience when exploring and surviving the world, because now you aren't just fighting mutants, you are also fighting real time players around the world. You can either team up with friends, or be a lone wolf, the choice is completely up to you.\n\nThe graphics in this game are absolutely incredible, are give the game a whole new depth to surviving. The game features a full day to night system, moving water simulation, grass and tree movement, and actual structure movement in certain objects. The games graphics can be turned down if it is too much for a weaker computer, but if you have a beast computer, I definitely recommend playing this game in all it's glory, because it truly looks amazing.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics in this game are also quite cool, such as the combat, movement, and interactions with other things. First off, the combat system is very well made, and gives players the choice of certain weapons they'd like to use. More of a close combat fighter? go with a deadly hatchet or a baseball bat. Want to snipe from atop a building? Find a sniper rifle to pick off your enemies, the combat choice is all up to you. The movement in this game is very nice and fluent, and has just the right amount of bobbing and motion blur, just enough to feel real, and not enough to annoy you, so it's very well balanced and playable. Interactions with other things is a very cool thing in this game. Finding random objects such as a sowing kit is actually important, even though it doesn't sound like it. You can find and interact with so many different items in the game, and it really gives the player a bigger survival feeling, instead of just having no hunger or thirst.\n\nFinally, the most important thing, this game is VERY fun. Games are not just about fancy guns and graphics, which this game has, it's about the fun in it. What's a game with no fun? I found myself staying up until three in the morning, running from monsters, and exploring the vast open world. There were many jump scare moments, and awesome fights. I realize that not everyone enjoys the same game, so that's why I'm about to put a conclusion of what kind of gamer would enjoy this game.\n\nThis game is meant for the people who enjoy exploring an open world, with not any objective except for surviving. It's a First Person Shooter, which means you are seeing from the perspective of a man's eyes. This game is scary in a lot of ways, and can scare people who are not good with jump scares, or very ugly and scary monsters. This game is also violent, and has killing of mutated monsters, who spray blood when hit, and die in a pool of blood like goo, and also the killing of other humans, who will fall over when dead, but only drop their items, and not lay in a pool of blood. This game is also Multiplayer only, at the moment, and requires that you are online at all times, possibly on a server with no people, or on a server loaded with people, so you will, most likely, be playing with strangers most of the time on this game.\n\nI've had a lot of fun playing this game, and I hope a lot of other people will help support this game to help make it even better!","November 25, 2013","true","26.3"," 789 of 1,323 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","789","1","0","16"

The team over at Phosphor Games has got some great talent and I was actually amazed to see such great scenery, graphics textures, and lighting as soon as I entered a server. Altho the game is still in an "Early Access" state, It feels solid and runs great. The survival aspect has greatly been captured along with the feeling of being in a apocalyptic world. Almost every building or structure can be entered and searched for food, water, and weapons to help you survive against the dangers lurking around every corner. With the world being so vast with buildings to explore, it can become quite exhausting looting at times.\nThe alien creatures know as The Nether were designed fantastically. They are somewhat difficult to fight and kill at first but once you get the hang of it, it becomes much easier. Altho you do not want to find yourself up against more than 2 or 3 them at a time as that can result in a very quick death with how much they teleport around you and even spit at you to block your vision. Stealth is definitely the way to go in this game. I found avoiding them completely made the game alot easier, especially at night time.\nAs for the PvP in this game. I've only come across a few people and most were easy to kill if I had a gun of some sort. You do sometimes get your lone range camper who's window shopping the hotspots for guns waiting for someone to come walking by so they can get a cheap kill, just like you would any survival game though so watch your back entering military zones and popular spawn areas. The whole game is played in a first person view and I really hope it stays this way. I personally think 3rd person has ruined alot of other survival games with PvP combat in them. Aiming down the sights in this game may come off a bit different than other games giving that it has that "Real" feel to it. You will have to make up for gun sway and your stance you are in. Also as of now there are no hit markers to confirm to you that you have actually hit the person you have just shot at. You will have to have a good aim and patience to get the kills here. Unless of course its just some lvl 1 guy that spawned in with a kitchen knife right in front of you.\nOverall I highly recommend this game right now. It is one of my most played and most enjoyed. The developers also seem to have a great bond with the community about the game.","November 26, 2013","true","54.2"," 661 of 1,107 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","661","1","0","8"

The game was downloaded and I had to create some stupid other account for something. So I did that and launch the game. I quickly notice the game is at a rediculous resolution I would never use as default and cant change it. I saw no menus AT ALL just a list of the game servers. and even this part of the game was ruined, as I found the game freezing and I was having to wait several minutes before gaining any accessibility (the game also froze 3 times in this menu.) So I join the first server I see, I thought maybe it would get good from here on (I was wrong, so wrong) I join in the server expecting to be able to press esc and be flooded with valuable graphical options and other adjustments. I was again dissapointed. Esc did nothing. Like really. Nothing. So I hold "w" hoping I can walk forward, to find I am flying. I thought it was yet another bug so waited for a few minutes to see if it would resolve itself. Can you guess? It did not. I tryed to reinstall my game to see if it would fix it. But no. Nothing has changed. I cannot see why it is acceptable to release something so useless, and charge money for it. To summarise this I payed money to spectate a basic city with a poor resolution at a less than optimal framerate and a company whoring money from me and the community. Oh and on top of this I heard that this game has micro-transactions. And what is worse is that the devs will do almost nothing that inproves this, they can try but it will always be broken and bad.

Below is my updated review based on the game-- which is now playable (you can log in). Steam did not give any refunds for this game so please keep in mind that with potential future log in issues, you will not be able to receive a refund.\n\nGraphics: 9/10 - the graphics in Nether are pretty amazing considering it's a first person MMO. The environment is filled with skyscrapers, subways, deserted cars and debris. When you walk through the devastated city, you really get a good sense of lonliness and the need for survival. The nether are violent creatures that can warp all around you and the animations are done very well. The first-person perspective looks really great when running; changing weapons and using the various different melee weapons on nether. There's really not much better in terms of graphics on an MMO, in my opinion.\n\nGameplay: 7.5/10 - Moving around the city is pretty fluid. If you've played shooters like call of duty, the controls will certainly feel natural to you. If you're hoping to use an Xbox game controller, as of right now it seems phospor has only half implemented the controls for it. You can shoot, run, and move around using your controller; but access to the map, inventory, and quick-slot items are not available. The movement seems well thoughtout, in that it is pretty simple but effective. You can jump  over obstacles, climb ladders, sprint to outrun nether or bandits, and crouch/prone for the stealthly approach. There is an option when leveling up to increase your jumping height so that you can access higher areas, which I thought was very cool. The melee system is pretty good. You can block and power attack when leveling up the melee skill. Often times you'll find yourself wanting to melee nether, so that you don't have to make much noise -- avoiding other confrontations. The nether themselves can be downright scary! If you're wearing a pair of headphones and walking through one of the cities subways in the dark, you'll know what I mean. I found myself more than once turning around to see a huge Golem Nether charging right for me. The nether aren't perfect, though. They tend to get caught on things when dealing with elevation, like scaffolding. You won't mind too much though, since you can beat the heck out of it without it warping behind you then. There isn't a huge amount of Nether roaming around; maybe a few per block. The real danger, as with any survival MMO is the other survivors. There are multiple Safe Zones, in which you can trade(courier missions from 1 SZ to another), sell, and store some items in a global inventory. When you die, if you can make it back to a safe zone, any items that you put in your global inventory you can have access to. The problem with these safe zones is that they are very easily campable. Make it to a high-level and just pull a nice sniper rifle out of your bank? Step three feet outside a safezone and get stabbed by a level 1 hiding in a bush. But this sort of thing is to be expected in these type of games. Really the only gripe I have with gameplay so far is that the current playable zone is quite small, there isn't a lot of variety in loot, and the game gets pretty old - fast. These are all good complaints, considering this is in fact early access. The adrenaline you can get by finishing courier missions, while fighting off bandits and nether is pretty awesome.\n\n\nAll in all, I still can't recommend this game, yet. Despite the high gameplay & graphics review, this is too early in development for MOST players to really enjoy. I've spent a lot of hours playing alpha & beta games, including DayZ, and this one is certainly well polished, but not as well developed. I think most players would play this for a week and move on, and I'm feeling mostly the same way. With the account sync problem taking a while to get sorted out, it worries me for the future - sync or swim. The good news is that phospor games seems really into asking the community what they want for future updates (motorbikes!?) - so stay tuned.","December 20, 2013","false","16.6"," 150 of 242 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","150","242","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mapkocthecockman/recommended/247730/","mapkocthecockman","Marcosgmunoz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mapkocthecockman/","115 products in account","TL;DR: At the end of the review.\n\nFirst of all, I'll bust a few myths about the game for you\n1-Anything you heard about this game bein pay2win is complete BS. This game has one of the best microtransactions systems I've seen, since everything you can get is cosmetic like character skins and hats. The few things that are not cosmetic can be easily obtained with in-game money too. Oh, and cosmetic items are not lost upon death, so that means you don't need to spend more money after dying with that pretty hat on.\n\n2-It's only a big open PvP Call of Duty game if you want it to be. If you get into a full server and go around the hotspots OF COURSE you will be shot to death all the time. It's the same in every single multiplayer survival game, since most people are still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s regardless of the game they're playing.\n\nI have too much to say about the game, so I'll just pick a few things to explain it.\n-I think the game is already worth it for the scenery alone. The city is extremely accessible and detailed, and the graphics are good. It's hard to explain, but the place is just so beautifully made and immersive. I can say it's one of the best post-apocalyptic landscapes I've seen in games. It really lets you see the chaotic mess a decayed metropolis would be.\n\n-The inventory system works well in my opinion. Won't go into a lot of details. You also have a global inventory with limited space, where you can safely keep things. Kind of like a bank. Nobody can steal from it.\n\n-The skill system is character based. That means every time you die, you lose all of your character progression. Some people don't like that, but I think it's awesome for a game like this and works perfectly. First of all, the skills are not OP at all. They simply increase your odds. Your actual gaming skills still matter a lot more. It's simple stuff that you deserve to get if you managed to stay alive that long while risking yourself to get xp. Second, it doesn't take long to level up. You just have to know how to do it. A bit of the XP obtained goes into the account progression, which gives you some persistent bonuses you don't lose at death. Those are even smaller, but still useful.\n\n\n-EDIT: according to someone that has been playing recently (I haven't because of overheating problems),\nhackers seem to be mostly gone now from the game, either because they got tired or because VAC is getting them.\n\n--A little storytime with a lesson--\n->>Yes, one person can change how a lot of people behave. Most people are hostile in the game, but I realized most of them are bandits simply because everyone else is. I decided to try something one day.\nI got up in a rooftop with a sniper rifle and helped people by killing the monsters chasing them. There were lots of bambies trying to get to the safezone. Then I would see in the global chat "wow, who did that? Thanks man, I thought I was dead". In about ten minutes, people were talking about the "guardian sniper" on the chat, and saying "why can't everyone be like that?".\nAfter a while, I spotted some geared guys coming up my building. I thought they would kill me, so I took a defensive position. To my surprise, they just asked if I was the sniper guy, and told me to keep up the good work after giving me a ton of ammo for my rifle. That day, everyone started talking on the chat, asking if anyone wanted to team up, helping the noobies. Hell, they even cleared out a safezone breach together. So yeah, if you're friendly to someone in need, they will likely do the same to the next person.\n\n\n--TL;DR--\nOverall, the reason I think people are harsh when reviewing this game is because it has a learning curve, and they don't see that. They expect going in, getting the big guns and ammo and becoming max level without any difficulty. One of the reasons I like this game it's because it's neither simple nor easy. Just because you play other survival games doesn't mean you'll be good at this game immediately.\n\nYou have to learn how to survive. How to travel safely(using the metro tunnels, for example. Another amazing aspect of the game), how to loot effectively, how to defend a compromised safezone, how to level up and get money doing delivery missions and picking up airdrops, how to hunt nether and defend from bandits. ♥♥♥♥, it took me a long time to learn how to get guns(it's easier to find parts then craft the gun at a safezone than finding them).\n\nIf you're in doubt about it, buy the game. It's really cheap right now. Try it for yourself a bit. If you keep dying, remember what I said about the learning process. Look for tips online. Try to make friends at a safezone. Join a tribe. Go hunting together. Get them to teach you about the game. Explore the map.\n\nTrust me, you'll have a lot of fun.\n\nEDIT: A nice stranger told me about some technical difficulties I didn't know about, so I'll explain some of them here:\nYou need a 64 bit computer to run the game.\n\nYou are likely to run into a few problems here and there on your first time running the game, like logging in, joining servers... but I believe they aren't hard to come around when you look for help online.

Every level up gives you a stat point which you can invest in any of your six skill trees, all of which give a perk at level 1, 4 and 10.

I really hope they can bring the game back to life and give me a reason to change this reivew to a positive one!

I truly love this game (or rather, what this game could be) and I wish it was developed more and with much more care and attention.\n\nThe gameplay is your standard survival genre, scavenge for food and weapons while hiding from monsters called 'Nether' and other players. The nether mechanics are buggy and frustrating to play against, giving everything a teleport mechanic is just a lame way of saying "we don't know how to make different enemies so we'll just re-model the same enemy and adjust it's health and damage". The guns are good and have a nice feel to them, ammo is a pain to get put into one stack and the weight limits are just too restrictive. You have a global inventory which acts like a bank but again, you can only store a certain weight and size limit of items meaning you feel the need to keep your best weapons safe by leaving them there instead of using them, making them rather pointless. The graphics are actually very good considering the state of the rest of the game and the lighting is great apart from metalic surfaces being a bit too reflective in my opinion.\n\nOverall, this game is 10% of what it could have been and that's a damn shame.\n\nIf you have a couple of friends who'd buy this game, it's worth the small £7 price tag but otherwise - as much as it pains me to say it, I'd stay clear of this game.","September 14, 2015","false","34.8"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","31","42","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/almightydonut/recommended/247730/","almightydonut","SexyDonut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/almightydonut/","229 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have been wanting to review this game for some time and now is that time. First off I have to start this with saying I DO NOT recommend this game to any one. Throughout my review I will make several key points as I compare this game to Arma 3 Wasteland.\n\n1. Lack of teamwork and ability to make teams. As you look at the screenshots and read the description you have this idea that Nether is about working together to reclaim our planet that has seen somesort of an alien invasion, very much like Command and Conquer Tiberium Wars when the Scrin invaded, however, that is false advertising. Nether is all about gathering as many weapons as you can and camping several locations as a lone wolf. The game allows you to get a group of survivors together to recapture the safe zone once it is lost but that is extremely rare. You CANNOT create any sorts of team to work together. Now, comparing to Arma 3 Wasteland the gamemode allows for three different teams; BluFor, OpFor, and Independent (lonewolves but can create a squad). Arma 3 Wasteland also allows those teams to work together and fight for objectives such as supplies, vehicles, and bases, whereas in Nether every one is against each other and no team system exists.\n\n2. With the PvP there comes the issue of people camping outside and inside the safe zones throughout the game. With the lack of a cooldown timer to protect those coming in or out, the safe zones become a place to camp for amazing supplies. There is no safe place in Nether. No bases. In Arma 3 Wasteland teams can create bases with supplies such as T-walls, concrete barriers, fences, etc.\n\n3. If you thought Nether was going to be a "realistic" game with amazing combat, you're wrong. Nether is currently suffering through a ton of lag issues which prevent any decent combat especially with the gun delays. This mean the shooter will pull the trigger and the action is delayed by a second. Another issue is with how cartoony this game really is. The best way I can compare this is to Combat Arms or another one of those Korean shooters. The game lacks any realism with the weapon systems, they have horrible iron sights, and optics. A big issue I have is with the Aimpoint Patrol on the DR-15 rifle. It zooms in like an Trijicon ACOG and the reddot is so blurred out it makes shooting almost impossible. The shotguns have a zoom of 3x with irons which doesn't make sense for any close quarter action. Another issue is the clothes the suvivors wear and can purchase. Players can purchase green gas masks, carry green back packs, have antlers on their heads, and so forth. Again, this is starting to sound more like a free shooter. Arma 3 Wasteland allows players to purchase gear for themselves such as a vest, combat belt, etc, and not look like a giant green blob for everyone to shoot at.\n\n4. Horrible collision across the whole map. That pretty much sums it all.\n\n5. The level system is a flaw in the game. Although I do enjoy leveling a character, the game will reset all of your stats as soon as you die which is about every 5-30 minutes, depending if you're the sniper or not. The stats should stay wih that character even if they die or get rid of the system overall. Also, why do I need to rank up to be able to block with a melee weapon? This creates issues with fighting with Nether as soon as you spawn in which doesn't really matter since people will kill you before then.\n\n6. Really, name tags show up when you look at someone? So much for the ability to hide.\n\nI can continue to go on and on about the issues with this game and some will say, "YEAH WELL IT'S A BETA." This game should not be considered a beta. If should be an Alpha at most and for the price of $29.99 USD, it's a bad Alpha. Arma 3 had an early release at Alpha and the game already had all of the weapons, gear, factions, and Stratis. And that is a full game. Nether is nothing more than a game similar to Combat Arms. If you are looking for teamwork, or if you're a lonewolf, and you want to fight players and A.I. while searching for supplies and enjoy a big environment, Arma 3 Wasteland is for you. If you want to find all of the big weapons, sit on a roof on a bulding near a safe zone and sniper people trying to get into a safe zone, then this game is for you. Save your money and wait until this is a real release. It may get better, but at this time this game is near unplayable. It's plagued with a terrible community who will not acknowledge issues with this game and praise it like a God.","November 27, 2013","false","16.0"," 78 of 127 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","78","127","0","0"

Nether is essentially "another survival game" in the vein of DayZ, but with more varied enemies and more focus on trading and missions. But while everything looks better at a glance, the monsters are only loosely functional, and instead of doing any real animating or pathfinding for them they just make it so that most of the monsters teleport right in front of you every time they need to move, making all of the combat one big pain. It's also still fairly buggy, even retaining some bugs that seem to have existed for months despite being obvious things like flashlights being disabled entirely when the player rebinds their keys. But above all, the damning aspect of the game is that there just isn't anybody playing. The only server that I've seen regularly have more than 20 people is a PVE server, which removes the tension of meeting another player in the field and not knowing if they're friendly that makes the genre so appealing to a lot of people. The only way I could really recommend Nether is if you have a bunch of friends who can't afford much better games like Ark: Survival Evolved and have to make do with buying this for $1 on sale, because that's really all it's worth right now. This is pretty much an Early Access game disguised as a full title.","January 29","false","2.9"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","30","42","4","0"

After the 5th time or so you make a new character in 30 minutes after dying constantly to players, you'll realise that the spooky creatured, huge mapped MMO you thought this game was, is nothing more than a cheap, oversized 4 player deathmatch in a cheap city, with a few cheap missions that wont matter because your character will NOT exist 5 minutes from now unless you play when no one is online.

It's one of those games where, it could be so much more if not for the rushing the devs had made. I actually paid for the chosen bundle as a preorder, because of the atmosphere, and the new approach of an enemy, rather than a simple zombie game. You get these, mutated human beings which can actually teleport right around you, which is actually pretty stressful if you have no idea how the A.I. Works. The envrioemnt is my style of a wasteland, you got chicago "My hometown, in which  I still live in" with a whole bunch of overgrowth, nature has claimed the city. And it's also got realy tall bulding, up to 6 or more floors high, which is actually pretty cool, considering it is an alpha game. The weapons are pretty limited, a pistol, a deagle, a sniper rifle, a auto rifle, a smg, a ar, you get the idea. All of this stuff was in the first release, and i must say, at the time, it was amazing despite a few glitches here and there. However, when the game sneaked out of early access "Litterally just out of no where, POOF, game is done." It really feel behind on what it was meant to deliver. But this isn't even the worse part. A friend of mine, namned -T- on my friends list was actually BANNED, for not only killing a hacker, but when he picked up his loot, which was normal except the money, "He gained like, over 9 billion ingame $" he was then banned for the following reason "It's impossible to kill a hacker, without you yourself using artificial means, aka something like hacks." Which honestly blew my mind! I dont know what happend to you devs, but thats just messed up, you coulda just gave everyone a wipe, or even himself not only a inventory wipe, but a cash wipe. What would be so hard to do that for one individual?\n\nIn the end, something had happend, perhaps bankruptcy, and the game was ultimately rushed. Is the game worth 10$? Honestly, its up to you. But I presonally feel that the game just isnt worth it right now.","October 21, 2014","false","90.9"," 33 of 49 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","33","49","0","0"

There is no real reason to play other then to download the speed hack and camp players coming out of the safe zones.  And this game runs like total crap, horrible frame rates.

But thats about the only change ive noticed.  Oh and the server log in seems to have been fixed.  It doesnt take 10 min to load the server list.  Other then that this game still is in a horrible form.   And when you die you lose all your xp, all your loot, everything!  Theres no real missions, no incentive to even really play other then to hack, camp, and anger the newbies.  And to top all this off they want you to spend more of your real world hard earned money to actually purchase in game gear like hats, weapons, and characters.  What a load of total Horse $%^T!!!

Besides the lighting bugs and other various bugs, the raw gameplay was phenominal... then ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan. I couldn't log in for about 3 weeks due to an update. once that was resolved, i met my best friend John. We played a LOT! Tons of fun just picking up guns and doing pvp. That was it. IT WAS THE BEST GAME EVER! Made 2 groups of 8 and we had a blast. It finally came to an end and we took a break for about 8 months. This break led to some interesting changes to the game.\n\nThe game had tribes, crafting, and NO GUN SPAWNS! This was horrible on top of the hacking that the new VAC didn't stop. I reunited with 5 of the 8 including John to play again for old times sake. We all died literally instantaneously by hackers and we were hunted with esp and aimbot. It was aweful. Ill never forget the last words of John saying "Wow.... They ♥♥♥♥ed this game up."\n\nIN CONCLUSION, Nether WAS a good game, but the newer updates and new content trying to mask the bugs dosent make their situatuion any better.

I am not a native speaker.\n\nI am going to start with the fact that I do know that the game is in early access. This is why the game is choppy with bad optimimization (A 7970 should be able to handle this game 60 fps on highest settings fine right? That is not the case), with really bad server lag. You can also pretty much fly over uneven terrain.These are problems I am sure will be fixed in the full game, but here comes the part that is unfixable. The community is pretty much the worst i have experienced. I am talking MLG 1337 pr0 h4X0rz call of duty levels here. Its mostly a bunch of 12 year olds who could not afford dayz, or it was too complicated maybe? Dont expect this game to have complicated mechanics. Anyway the game is absolutely unenjoyable when you get killed on sight, especially when you lose all your loot and levels on death. The only real way i see of getting rid of this problem is either making a way larger map and not have safe zones , but player houses or some ♥♥♥♥ like that. Or straight up Pve servers. And as a final minor gripe I would like to get different bars for hunger and thirst since that would make the game way more challenging.","January 10, 2014","false","17.9"," 47 of 77 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","47","77","0","2"

The game itself is okay with some surreal bugs, however there are some albeit few good aspects to this. Hackers are rampant, the game has third party "sign in" bullcrap that can hang up and screw you over, you can fall through the ground at any time, and walking in a puddle can drown you.\n\nNext. The guns are fun and versatile, the monsters are predictable in attack patterns but their ability to teleport is what shakes things up. Players are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and hackers 9/10ths of the time, so shoot on sight if they're not in your clan. I once killed a hacker who had 10 people's worth of equipment pour out of him on death. Took me and a friend 5 trips to bring it all back and sell with the largest backpacks.\n\nOh, so the best part? The Developers are no longer supporting this game. It's been removed from alpha/beta in quick succession so no refunds could be given through steam with their pre-release clause, and since then the updates have absolutely stopped. Asking about it in the forums on their website gets you banned, and you should not give them any more money for this game. It's not worth the $10, to be honest.\n\nSo please, I implore you, do not buy this mistake. It had promise, and the developers put JUUUUST enough in to make it seem like a good thing.

I've played it and it is basically a post apocalyptic death match. Like call of duty with monsters along the way. Just stupid. enough with pvp. I am tired of it. we need to work together instead of killing each other all the time. There has to be something in the game that would motivate you to work together and there isn't. Just garbage in my opinion and I am allowed to have one. I truly don't see a difference between this and WarZ. ON top of all things, when I bought it I was promised beta keys for my friends and they lied to us by telling us something about server load or some crap. In the mean time more people were buying the game. Bunch of liars.

Don't bother buying the fancy edition with the extra gold. Might want to wait till this game is "finished." Give it at least a year.\n\nFirst, I'll write about the experience I have beginning the actual game, then I will go over some other things about this whole thing overall.\n\nSo, skipping all the issues with the servers...\n\nGet in a medium player count game, find some ammo and a can of food... kill 2 nethers with a kitchen knife, Either they are easy to kill or the hit indications are may be bugged or you simply dont start with max health. level up a few times. Start looking at options... oh, no key mapping... so no key ref either... figure out chat... its a bunch of kids and people who speak like they are gay russians. No one wants to coop, or even respond really to anything... I realize my "thirst and/or? hunger" indicator is getting low... getting chased by more nether, not finding a damn thing. Glitchy movement, gets stuck in crouch on all kinds of edges... sometimes auto-runs? Idk, he just starts running and I have to jump and press all the movement keys to stop.... So, Im thirsty I guess... ok Ill run to the safe house on the map... it does after all have a market... I run there, map is annoying, no minimap, can't move in menu. I get there, all the while Im worried about some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sniping me so Im happy to see we are unable to attack in safe zone... wheres the damn store im thirsty?... A message comes up, safe zone under attack? Ok crap... ok... Well, nether all over the place just like that... don't know from where but they teleport so w/e... (surely the game designers didnt just spawn a hundred nether on top of me) So I repair one nether fly catcher dumb machine, then 2. Think to myself, sweet, everybody will be all over this place to help me and I can figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on in this game. I go to chat, and am totally ignored by a gay russian who, as far as I can tell, is just talking to himself about people wearing scary masks... I say hey who is coming to help out repair the crap... gay russian responds telling me not to go there cause its under attack... DUH. I just said... nevermind you nub... I ask where is the water. No answer... so I repair all 6 of the things, level up from sneaking (i think the nether glitch out, some will look at you as you sneak past them.) Yay all the dumbass creatures are gone. Lets get some water... I'm losing health now... ok... store is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... good luck figuring it out for the first time(another little annoyance.) I'm not worried im losing health I got 50 nether coin... and they are resetting nether gold and characters here in a week... shopping spree... Ok heres a bottle... Oh... wait a minute here... really? No water for sale, just an empty bottle you fill up at a "spring" which cost 75 bucks(not special coin)... well I got 50 nether coin... o? I can only use nether gold for a gasmask and some other dumbass ♥♥♥♥? ok...\n\nSo yeah... Maybe if you have like 5 close friends to play with and they update the ♥♥♥♥ out of this games system and website... go for it...\n\nalso\n\nloading it up is tricky, website is just goofy programmed... no real confirmation email a day later even tho it says it sends you one...

If not then don't get this game. Nether focuses too much on PvP and there is no such thing as ''friendly'' players unless you are playing with an IRL friend. Safe Zones? There are none because other players kill you the moment you leave.\n\nDying in this game is what's going to make you stop playing the game because every time you die you lose ALL the gear you have on your character as well as all of your skill points, and you WILL die constantly. I got to level 30 ONCE which is pretty much only possible if you play on empty or low populated servers, don't even try and reach level 30 on a full server let alone level 20 because you won't. As i reached the level 20+ levels i thought to myself: ''What now?'' I had the best of all the equipment so there was literally nothing to do, had i gone out of the Safe Zone my character was in i would've been instantly sniped by players from every side all while attracting 100s of Nether Monsters.\n\nThe only pro i have is the Graphics Quality the game though was decently optimized.\n\nLastly: I played this mostly at release but from what i'm gathering the Game hasn't improved or changed other than adding a Bike and a Glider and some Sub-way stations underground.\n\nDon't buy this game because it's already dead.

You can also team up with friends or players who are in the same clan, to capture territory, which serves no goal whatsoever.\n\nThere's no goal, meaning or sense of accomplishment in anything you achieve in Nether.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/247730/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","VERDICT: Nether brings together an amazing graphically detailed post-apocalyptic world sprinkled with some addictive PvE elements like: skill leveling, quests, trading and weapon crafting and tops it all off with an optional PvP component that allows you to stalk and kill other players on top of the A.I. controlled nether.\n\nIts STALKER aesthics meets Fallout (3 & NV) style gameplay.  Singleplayer content maybe a little lacking for someone who enjoys both games however.  Yet this has to be one of the best "unfinished" games Ive have the pleasure [and frustration] of playing.  There isnt that much the game needs to take it from being very good to great.\n\nThe learning curve at the beginning is pretty tough.  So much so that I almost gave up playing the game.  Gameplay diversity is fairly limited but conversely addictive as you try to build-up your character and their equipment.  Once you've played the game for a while you may perhaps miss features that other survival games provide like base-building.  It certainly doesnt have much of a dynamic past completing missions and boosting your equipment, other than staying alive ofc.  The game has also received a recent re-boot by the original developers, so content and features have been reset to an older build.  They intend to add modding and possibly PvE but what exactly, remains to be seen.\n\nThat said if you can look past the shortfalls in content diversity, the yo-yo development tract, the customary spawn-campers, kill-on-sighters and cheaters there is a veritable enjoyable post-apocalytic, survival experience to be had.  In single-player or PvP. But are you brave enough to try?\n\n\n... More info below ...\n\n\n01. GENRE: Online open-world, sand-box, survival PvP FPS, with optional singleplayer.\n\n02. SETTING: A decimated post-apocalyptic Earth where most of the population have been transformed into mutated forms called the Nether, by some otherwoldly event called 'The Cull.'\n\n03. STORY/BACKGROUND: These monsters hunt the vestiges of humanity who try to survive in technologically protected safe-zones, as they attempt to kill as many Nether as possible and scour for loot across the once majestic cities of civilization.\n\n04. GAME MODES: Predominately PvP but most of the gameworld mechanics are PvE.  There is a single-player mode but some of the gameworld features are not balanced for this mode.\n\n05. GAME/LEVEL DESIGN: Nether boasts a wonderfully conceived and well-designed gameworld. It possesses a raft of features and artfully incorporates them into a beautifully atmospheric, greatly detailed and extremely immerisve gameworld that is not only a joy to play but addictive to.  There is one map of a large city containing safe-zones. Dynamic events such as escort missions, air-drops, and hostile Nether surges occur to mix things up.  Anti-nether devices can fail rendering safe-zones ineffectual.\n\n06. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: The game uses a common gameplay cycle: Equip yourself. Explore.  Fight. Kill. Loot. Undertake missions.  Earn money.  Buy better equipment.  Rinse and repeat.  There are diversions which spring up dynamically: Escort packages to a safe-zone, take packages from A to B, sell junk combinations or nether parts at the appropriate vendor.  For which you receive a combination of XP or credits.  XP levels your character, credits enable you to buy the equipment required for prolonged survival in the wastes.  You can also craft better firearms to kill the bigger threats: players and reapers.\n\nYou can level up your character skills: Guns, Stamina, Survival, Strength, Stealth and Melee.  There is a max level so not all aspects can be maxxed out but you can customize the character to the way you wish to play.  PvP just adds another layer of gameplay by forcing you to fight to stay alive.  Where its kill or be killed.\n\nThe game expects you to die and lose you characters skills.  Unless you had a buddy you will respawn with only a knife, whatever is in your global inventory (which is not much) and the game bonuses that your account level gives you.  It is this cycle that will frustrate you at the start but it what ultimately keeps you playing.  Indeed the account level is critical and makes a huge difference the higher it is.  To increase it ofc you need to keep playing.\n\n07. ENEMIES: Has only a handful of distinct enemies from low level dog-like hunters, to alert screaming sirens, brutal golems and spine firing hunters.  Biggest threats are Reaper.  The name says it all.  Dont go hunting these brutes without the firepower or manpower to bring it down.  In PvP however the main threat is from other players.  Some of which wont even give you a chance to draw your weapon.\n\n08. A.I: There is a reliance on having mostly fix spawned enemies so the A.I is fairly limited. It does an able job however for once you are spotted you will be attacked by any local Nether.  Get a screamer near you and it will alert many more Nether than you are able to deal with.  Once alerted unless you can outrun them to hide or get to a safe-zone they will not stop coming after you.\n\n09. CONTROLS: Standard mouse and keyboard.\n\n10. GRAPHICS: Attention to graphics detail is what brings Nether to life.  Even though they may not be top notch I found skulking through the gameworld during the day or at night sheer bliss.  Unless I was too busy running away from Nether.  The ruined cityscape is hauntingly beautiful.\n\n11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: There is no real soundtrack but a low continous haunting humming sound provides a constant companion as you trek through the post-apocalyptic environment that perfectly adds to gritty atmosphere.  Nether enemies have their own distint call, wail or roar.  Weapons have decent sounds also.\n\n12. VOICE ACTING: None.  But those of you with teamspeak can listen to some banal player communications in your head-set! :p\n\n13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: Has a painful learning curve at the start of the game but once you start playing and understand that equipment and weapons equals survival you can make dying that little less painful.  At least in single-player.\n\n14. PROBLEMS: Slight lag on my Core i3 at 1280x720 with most options off. Issues are minimal with some interface design and game-world clipping issues.\n\n15. ACHIEVEMENTS: There are no achievements for this game.  No need to distract players from the enjoyment of staying alive.\n\n16. DLC: No dlcs currently.\n\n17. MODDING/ONLINE PLAY/COMMUNITY: Havent experienced much of cheating since the early days of this game when there were many hackers and cheaters that culled alot of eager players such as myself.  There are fewer now but that doesnt mean they wont come back with a vengeance.  Safe-zone campers and Kill-on-Sighters are also present but its hard to know how many.  Admin capabilities are being added so servers can be policed.  But unless you are prepared to put up with dying and restarting alot dont try PvP.  You will hate it.  The biggest plus is modding being added to allow servers to be customized.\n\n18. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: Single-player will appeal to anyone who enjoyed playing Stalker or Fallout out.  At least to some degree before too much repetition of gameplay sets in.  If it does those of you bave enough can try PvP.  Anyone who enjoys survival games or hunting other players in a sci-fi setting would enjoy this.\n\n19. PLAYTIME/LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY: Unless you are a pro survival game player it will take you upwards of ten or so hours to get to grips with the early game, 40h to get self-sufficient if youre me.\n\n20. VALUE FOR MONEY: Im not one for much PvP yet in single-player it has an underlying addictive quality that compels you to one more safe-zone to safe-zone run.  On balance I think it has just enough content and features to be worth £7.","November 8, 2015","true","52.3"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","26","41","0","0"

I'll give you my version, including... let's just say EVERYTHING ELSE than gameplay too.\n\nAt start, the games registration was a pain in the butt, I waited 2 days for the registration to go through for my account. But after that, I got into the world, spawned inside the safezone. There was no tutorial, no friends, nothing to lose. So I did what I usually do in survival horror games: Into the wild!\n\nAfter 10 minutes I find myself on the ground with a rifle-bullet through my head, which is where most people give up. But f*ck most people! I thought to myself and thought that would be a bad orgie, ANYWAYS! I respawned, went out again, found guns, ammo, food, drink and I killed Humans, Nethers and Demons. and yes, I made sure the humans were hostile first. for example by asking in chat and not getting a response after stalking them for 5 minutes. Or they shot first.\n\nI went back to safezone and throw some extra guns and ammo into my stash (aka global inventory) and I had a good career start as a survivalist. I also played with some friends later on, which was amazing too. Group survival, killing Nethers, hunting humans. All the more fun with a group of friends, as long as you remember one of the golden survival rules: Don't trust anyone you don't have on skype or teamspeak. -Or other voice communication device.\n\n----------\nNow for judging:\nGraphics: 7/10 -a bit over-glossy water, some weird grass-patches on pavement. But everything is clear and nothing is over the top or under the bottom.\n\nLevel design: 10/10 -Very nice world, lots of buildings are open, lots of multi-level buildings, good for sniping, hiding, ambushes, hunting and scavenging.\n\nAtmosphere: 8/10 -Very eerie and semi-scary. Works well with both humans and nethers being enemies or friends. Trusting the right or wrong people? Is there a nether around the corner? you may never know.\n\nGameplay: 9/10 -Yes, I like the gameplay. Even if I died at the start, I still came back and I got to experience all the awesome things of leveling up, getting skills and abilities, gathering loot for the sweet tooth and racking up kills. This is one of the only PVP and PVE games that I actually enjoy, due to it NOT being zombies, there's fewer hackers than most other survival horror games (atleast to my observation, I don't have statistics on it.)\n-The shooting works perfect, aiming and reloading, never experienced a single flaw, maybe except for the little variety, but the balance is very good.\n-The melee system works very nice, if you use your first skill in the melee skill tree that let's you block, you won't regret it. It will block weak nethers attacks so you recieve much less damage and no, it does NOT block bullets. You control a human, not a ninja. (to the observation ninjas are above humans.)\n-The health, food and drink elements are well-implemented, though simple, they work as they're supposed to.\n\nOverall: 8/10 -Yes, I really like Nether for what it is and how well it's done. It's a Survival Horror game. (no sh*t.) but it's so well done compared to other survival horror games out there. Yes, you WILL get killed, but seriously, try and name a PVP Survival Horror game that hasn't killed you... yeah? thought so. Oh? Really? Then don't use hacks, silly b*tch~<3\n\n----------\nAlso... I played since early access, everything else than the cheapest price just adds cosmetics and easier access to some melee weapons which you can get in the wild in... under 10 minutes if you're lucky, so no need to waste money, it isn't pay to win.\n\nBack then, in Early access there was ONLY ONE SAFEZONE, BUT! They have added more since then, the playable area has doubled since early access and the loot is in containers now rather than lying on the ground, which I like a lot.\n\nOh, and it's easy to gather teammates, just write in chat on the server and get some skype names or get together for some voicechatting. THEN you can trust them a bit more than down the barrel of your 12 gauge...","October 8, 2014","true","32.7"," 33 of 54 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","33","54","3","4"

Wish the devs hadn't abandoned it. For $10, not bad. That's $10 less than most other games of this sort. $10 less because we're not paying a dev team, or customer service team, or any team at all for that matter, it seems. I say give it a go. Now, all the negative reviews are true. Load screens are horrible the first couple logons, and without some manual graphic optimizations, it runs poorly. (And yes, if you neglect to read the bit where it says "REQUIRES A 64 BIT OPERATING SYSTEM," it will not get past the launcher for you. PvP is horrendous, but fortunately the devs DID make a PvE server branch. (rather than banning hackers, cause that takes consistancy.) If the game developers were to become more active, I'd gladly pay $20 (regarding roughly that as average price for your average survival game.) Now, the cash shop option is not nearly as bad as people make it seem. 9/10 items you can buy with real money, you can find in the world, or buy with in-game money. Now, character skins is where the real money comes in.... There are a lot of (rather lackluster) skins for your character, and all fairly cheap. BUT, the only way to get more than the standard 3 skins (two male, one female.(all bald...)) is to spend real money. However, given this game has no 3rd person camera, the only options you really need are provided; male, female, skin color, and the color of your clothes so you can choose to blend in to different environments more.\n\nAll in all, look at it this way. Average game price as stated at $20, this game is half the price, for half a game. Take it with a grain of salt.\n\nAnd again, as a footnote... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOUR COMPUTER IS 32bit. That being said, if you have 64bit with low system specs, there are plenty of forums for optimizing it to run on the crappiest computers. (like mine.)","May 7, 2015","true","35.1"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","0"

Instead of zombies, you're facing inside-out beasties, which is a fresh new twist in an open world survival.\nHowever, this is where the good stuff ends.\nThe game is overpriced, considering it is a useless hunk of crap.\nThe load times take over 5 minutes.\nWhen you join a server, there is a 15-30 minute wait time before you can spawn, and this repeats each time you die.\nWhen you die, not only do you lose all your items and gear (expected, not a huge issue) but you also lose all the EXP and levels/skills you had aquired (ok I get losing gear, but my EXP shouldn't be affected) This essentially makes playing the game entirely pointless.\nWhenever you type, the camera begins screaming around as if on a rollercoaster. If you are spectating a game, waiting to spawn, it freezes your camera. I spent over 26 minutes staring at the ceiling.\nThe community is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and trolls, yes this is indeed the internets but it's as if the scum of the internet scum league have all congregated on this one game.

This is my first review and felt because of the overwhelming bad reviews I wanted to add some good/bad points of my own.\n\n1. I've heard a few times that people can pay to win...this is just not true. You can't buy weapons or any item that will give you an advantage over another player. Now if a freaky looking mask is your idea of pay to win then yes...people will be able to purchase masks in game for real money but these items have zero stats.\n\n2. Teamwork! This is key in a survival game...I've heard time and time again where people hate this game because they get killed while starting out. To be quite honest I love when I have nothing on me. I'll go out of my way to find people and stab them in the back to take what they have. Find people to play with...plan out where you are going and what you are gonna do if "X" or "Y" happens. Will this prevent you from getting killed? Nope...YOU WILL DIE. There was a time I kille four people with a shotgun in a building and got over run by Nether and died myself. That is the way of this world and if you can't handle the loss of items then do not pick this game up.\n\n3. For awhile I stopped playing the game because of hackers...mainly aimbotters who ruined it for me but since the update I've not run into any WTF moments of people turning 180 to headshot me in 0.2 seconds flat.\n\n4. No storyline stuff is in the game yet from what I can tell.\n\n5. Nether invasion of towns are freaking HARD to clear out considering the massive spawn rate of nether but one would assume that they would swarm a town like that if given the chance. Again if you have a few guys with you and people who know how to play then you can do it.\n\n6. Did I mention you will die? Cause you're gonna die...a lot and my best advice...learn to laugh about it and understand you're...gonna....DIE! You will not have that bad ♥♥♥ DR-mag forever. You'll round the corner and have a TFC special smiling at you as it all fades to white.\n\nSo would I reccomend this game? Depends on what type of games you like and if you have a rage issue when it comes to getting ganked. If you rage like a little 6 year old girl.....no...don't buy this game cause I don't want you getting your rage on in chat after I ♥♥♥♥ you with a katana while you spray and pray with your mac9.

You spend your time running packages from point A to point B. Along the way you'll run into Nther infested outposts and a few of the Nether creatures scattered about the world. The world is  immersive and has an impressive soundscape.\n\nWhere Nether fails is in its lack of polish. It has gone through a lot of development and passed to different development teams along the way. It's not the fault of Phosper (current team) but the fault of those who have employed them.\n\nThe community feels very shallow in terms of player count. However when I did make contact with other players, they were very friendly and a bit stacked (stacked = had A LOT OF GEAR). I received the top melee weapon and backpack immediately upon joining a PvE server thanks to some fellow players. I probably could've turned it down but I was not looking to invest more than a few hours into the game.\n\nI can not recommend the game in its current state due to the lack of a community and more quantity than quality when it comes to content.\n\nI am definitely impressed by the scale of the game. The city feels desolate and worn down. The empty subway tunnels echo your foot steps and it is an incredible experience. But those are the only moments I felt immersed in the world.

But it's still quite generic\n\nCONS :\n\n*Severe dropage of frames right when you start the game\n-Well this makes me want to stop playing already! This happens to pretty much  EVERYONE  ive talked to who has "played" this game!\n\n*Terribly confusing to start\n-Ok well it'll get better right? Nope. Tutorial sucks at tutorializing (don't care if thats not a real word)! Still more confusing then AAA devs these days.\n\n*Terrible performace\n-Ok so my PC isn't the best out there but it's still pretty kickass, now please tell me how im getting 30FPS with a GTX760 4gb... Like what... even on low my game still runs like crap! One of my friends runs a 290x and also gets terrible performance... I don't understand. Something in the game makes everyone bottleneck to garbage standards.\n\n*Overall still buggy\n-So this game coming from "Early access" you'd think i'd be nice and polished! And your right! No im just kidding. The walking mechanic is even buggy, like movement is about the basic fundimental thing that a game needs, (unless your playing Guitar Hero that is) combat feels  OK  but overall there is still so much that can, and should, be fixed.\n\n*Objective\n-Im still not very sure what the point of the game even is... To survive? Well all you need to do is sit on a rooftop or camp newcomers spawn. To thrive? Why? There is no insentive to even survive in the game! To play with friends? 1 bug plus 1 bug doesnt make the experience any better...\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I don't "hate" the game per say but I just don't see the life that a game should have in it. You could have fun with friends if you could overlook the terrible bugs that make them not want to play this game.

I remember nether came out. It was hyped as fu** but this didnt helped much. After the early access came out the publisher decided to change the developer to PureFPS which was yeah.. the end of nether until now. Small updates, many bugs and a Pay 2 Win system was hard to stay with. But the worst thing were the thousand of unbanned hackers everywhere. God mode, cheat weapons, gold key and duping of items was the normal day of Nether. But even with that it was fun to play some times with groups. Some weeks ago PureFPS closed the servers and shutdown the game. Now Phosphor Games the first dev team got the rights to work on this game again and for now we are back at the early access state from 2014 i think. Well for now we got singleplayer back and multiplayer is on its way. I hope Phosphor games can repair what the other team broke with the players of this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ititititititit/recommended/247730/","ititititititit","DeeblowAce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ititititititit/","203 products in account","I would suppose the most popular analogue for games such as this is Day Z, and justifiably so for it is the first truely successful open world apocalyptic experience as far as I know. Nether is quite similar, and though in its early stages demonstrates an already seemingly expansive world to explore with an overgrown nature engulfed city being telegraphed with such an immersive execution. The ambiance of the desolate city scape only further ensconces the player in the shoes of the survivor as both natural and unnatural sounds coalesce in echoing harmony. Combine this with post apocalyptic often fully explorable structures, and the perpetual looming animosity of other survivors then you can have a rather tense survival experience. However, the current state of the designated enemy is rather at times frustrating. The teleporting variants of the predominant enemy known as the Nether seem to teleport consistently throughout an engagement, however they do so in such imbecilic and interspersing fashion that during the course of the conflict they will at times simply not be visible. Teleporting a floor above you, in the room next to you, outside of the building you are in are common occurrences. This problem is largely absent when fighting outside, but many battles take place around structures or inside of them (hence city). Aside from this obvious blunder there are other problems which I'm sure will be fixed or reimagined as time progresses toward a completed product. Disconnecting from a PvP engagement will also pose a problem, as in the current state it is an overly viable strategy which is only propagated by the reset of all level progress upon death (and of course the loss of all items on your person). The latter I hope remains apart of the game for it adds the edge all games of this sort require to remain suspenseful. I believe this game will resolve most of these, and other problems as I said for it is still quite a work in progress although a worthy one for any of those interested in an immersive apocalyptic experience.\n\n- I haven't touched the game since this review which was made around when it became early access. I stand by my opinion concerning the ambiance of the game, but the gameplay simply wasn't enough to hook me for more than 8 hours of play.","November 25, 2013","true","8.2"," 201 of 373 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","201","373","0","1"

This game is still ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nThe lag is wild and this lead to a boring gameplay where you often have to stop because you don't know where you are going and it gets you in SERIOUS trouble during the fights with nethers. The video you see above It's a dream of how the game SHOULD work, you get an insight of how the game work FOR REAL pausing every second the video. Many times the lag was so wild I couldn't even get inside servers and got kicked out :( . People said it was ♥♥♥♥♥ier before but believe me when I say I can't even imagine how this is possible. Another complaint It's the inability to move your character left and right. I can't figure out who is so stupid to create a game in which you have to fight and leave you free to move only up and down.......while your enemies can even teleport behind you! I could add It's unrealistic too. In the end another annoying bug It's that the traders in the safe zone don't take your boxes and so you are prevented from having lots of EXP to power up your character leaving you with the only choice to fight nethers to upgrade yourself.\nTo summarize:\n1) Phosphor Games you HAVE TO fix the servers' lag because It's nearly impossible to play.\n2) Phosphor Games let the character move left and right and not only up and down.\n3) Phosphor Games fix the traders' boxes bug.","December 27, 2015","false","2.6"," 28 of 47 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","28","47","0","5"

These devs never actually listend to there customers in the first place, thats why they all jumped ship and ran away. We begged and pleaded with them to get some sort of anti-cheat into the game during the first year, instead we got mini-bikes, and new monsters. They would have polls on thier website forums asking what we wanted as new features, and never reveal the results... This Dev team had some of the worst communication I have ever seen in a game. Either they didn't care or had no idea how to fix the issues we were having, they relayed all their information through a community manager, who eventually quit.\n\nObviously there was some apeal as I have logged over 400hrs of game play, most of those hours were hoping this game would get better, the potential was obvious, but the deves never came through for us. I for one will be very surprised if many vetrans return to this game now that Phosphor is back in control, as many thought they were a crappy company to begin with.\n\nMy point to this review/rant is that things may have gotten worse after Phosphor left this project (BTW they never actually posted that they left on thier forums, only here on steam, it was months after the fact that I found out they were gone) But it was never a great Dev team to begin with. Don't assume that them being back is going to make this game great, they had an oportunity to do it right the first time, and simply walked away when it started to go bad.\n\nSo don't pull out the trumpets to celebrate the return of Phosphor just yet, this was thier mess to begin with.","December 11, 2015","false","514.5"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","23","38","0","0"

First off this isnt a survival game....you will simply die.  I went throught he entire city map area and found not much of anything.  So basicaly once your food meter runs out you lose 1 health per second...basicaly that means 1000 seconds and game over.  Players do kill other players....but what is the point?  They will die anywise...as there is nothing else to find.  I found hte controlls not bad...sound and ambience of sound not too bad either...graphics where only ok...as it seams like everything was a cut and paste and the areas where empty.  game play was boring....as you literaly had nothing to do....my meter of food ran out after a few hours and that was it....game over.  I dont recommned this game to anyone because its pathetic.  Why do people pvp inthis game....becasue htere isnt anything else to do for one thing.....and becasu eits easier killing another player then killiing the nethers.  Now i am good at games like this...so i easily killed the enthers...even the hard ones...and all i used was the starter kitchen knife.  i never for once found anything besides ammunition and some healing items.  I htought there would at least be more stuff to find....boy was I wrong.  basicaly because of the fact they have nothing to find you will literaly just die.....yes this is a city area with nothing in it.  I recommend people avoid this game right now becasue there is no point to play it or test it.  You dont put a food meter in a game with pvp especialy one that runs out fast. Someone said inthe game....but its a survivor game....no thats not survivor...survivor is being able to kill the nthers for food or players for food....or killthe rats and birds for food....you cant do anything of that sort.  The rats and birds are cosmetic...as is most fo the game...basicaly the entire game is a bunch of textures with notheing else...they look neat....but nothing else.  Perhaps if they do some fixes this game willbe better...but i highly doubt it.  COnsidering they put in a fast going food meter...no real things to find...no rewards for killing nethers....i find this a waste of time.","December 6, 2013","false","2.4"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","24","40","0","2"

When you start up Nether, you'll realize that you have froze.  You literally have to wait up for 10 minutes for the game to flippin' load (depends on your computer).  Also, this happens when you leave the game, unless you task manager.  Nether has great graphics, but that's all it has.  The game is so god damn glitchy.  I can't even swim in the water.  One time, I walked through the walls of a tall a$$ building.  Basically, the game takes long to load/long to exit, and is glitchy as hell.

The pictures looked cool, The idea sounded fun, but other reviews kept me from getting it. Then I saw that the developers had changed and I went under recent reviews, saw alot of thumbs up, saw the game was 5 bucks and said time to try it.\n\nHow the game works: You start the game and must deliever a package,..about 3 in all for the tutorial. These packages are randomly throughout the safe zones (a place where you cannot kill or be killed by other players, monster etc) Delievering packages earns you expeirence and money. The XP is used to make your character stamina, strength, stealth, etc higher. The money is used to purchase guns, ammo, gear, backpacks, etc. Its basically grinding to make your character stronger. Like some kind of world of warcraft game these safezones have NPC shop keepers, who never move or say anything. Once you have what you need, guns and things of the sort ( you can essentially carry 1 ranged weapon, 1 side arm, and 1 melee weapon) you go off to kill other players and monsters of the world. WARNING: If you die, you lose it ALL. I mean EVERYTHING..your character was level 30 and you could run fast and far, not anymore..level 1. Cant run for ♥♥♥♥, and have lost all you worked for.\n\nThe NETHER\nThey are something not of this world, they sound great, there seems to be about 5 or 6 different types, and they teleport around while you shoot at them. You have your flyers, bosses, screaming one that charge right at you, some spit, goliaths that look like the Hulk, Wierd zombie ones that explode and arent fast. There is a variety. Safezones can become under attack by hordes of them if the anti nether devices in the safezone fail. (they are electronic thingamajigs that prevent the Nether from being able to come into the area) It will require teamwork in order to get the safezones back up and running. There are Nether surges where they become more frequent in certian areas. Some areas of the map have them all over the place and they never stop comming. No matter how many you kill. Other parts of the map, you may not see them at all, or will see them randomly. If they hit you, it can be devasting, you get around 1,000hp and a single hit can bring you down 300 to 400hp. So get smacked 2 or 3 times and your done. However guns are very effective often requiring 1 to 5 shots to kill them.\n\nLOOT\nYou can find loot in the world, just like any other survival game, If something has loot in it like a car, it blinks and it shiney, I do not like they way they did the loot, Im use to actually hunting for items, checking under beds etc, and at first it was a turn off, and it felt odd, but after you get an hour or so under your belt, you just get use to it. And it doesnt matter as much anymore, Im sure they will change it later on in the alpha. Loot can be sold at traders for pennies on the dollar. Hunger system is 1 system, so rather you drink water, or eat canned food it all goes toward the same thing. There are alot of different helmets but as far as your body, it cant be changed much. The small amount of body customization will be done at the character menu not in game. Also at the moment whatever you get (like a new helmet or mask) you must log out and then log back in for it show up on your chracter.\n\nMAP\nWhen you first look at it and are new it looks huge. However alot of it isnt accessible at the moment. And so it slowly shrinks as you figure it out and increase speed and stamina to cover distances quicker. The city is done really well. I praise the visuals. Small things like grass overgrown on the roads, abandoned cars parked in traffic jams for miles. Giant skyscrapers that you can get to the top of. Its the small things..going into a room and seeing 2 dead bodies on the ground clinging to one another showing their finals moments spent on earth holding each other in comfort. Its a great atmosphere, black smoke billowing from building that can be seen for miles. Downed resue choppers still burning. Police barricades no longer in service. Its all there, its all really cool. I praise the draw distance, something that I cannot say for a game like H1z1. There is a city area, its decent sized, bigger then any city in any other game including arma/dayz. But as I said the map itself is smaller. The other area would be right outside the city, some kind of marshes, or lowlands. Its not as interesting to me, but its a change of pace and still not bad. Ambulances have lights still flashing, and some signs still flicker like at gas stations etc.\n\nMechanics\nGun play is suprisingly good. Its smooth, its solid, and it feels out of place because I am use to crappy gun play like h1z1. ( I like h1z1 btw) shooting is actually fun and you feel as if you have full control. Another interesting concept is tribes. You can join a tribe, there is around 10 tribes. This gives you allies in the form of your fellow pvp killers. There is a PVE mode aswell, I recommend starting there until you udnerstand the game. There is enough in it to make it worth while without getting bored right off the bat becuase the NETHER can be fun to fight. There are buildings that you can capture, and take from other tribes. If you do this, the surrounding area becomes your territory. The benifit of this, is you get extra rewards. Example...find 30 bucks in your territory and get an extra 15 dollars intop of it as a bonus. Find 30 bucks in an unfriendly territory and you only get 30 bucks. There are random world events that take place such as Nether surges, bosses, and ofcourse safezones being attacked. At whichpoint you can enter the safzone guns ablazing. Something you are robbed of when it isnt under attack. There are vehicles in the game, But I know nothing of them I didnt even see or hear one til hour 10 of gameplay when I heard the roar of an engine looked out a window and some dude rolled by in a buggy or something. So, apparently there is a way to get a car.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nFor 5 bucks...snatch this game up!!!!!!!! Micro transactions and alot of the things listed in the negative reviews when the other developer had it are GONE. And I quote the new developer (who was the original developers and sold it then saw the abomination there game had become and took it back) "we got rid of that microtransaction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t" I like when somebody refers to it in such a way. I never played or owned it during the bad times, so I dont know what was going on with the game then, But I hope this review makes it to the top, to negate the other reviews that were accurate at the time and good reviews but are now no longer relevant.

So me and a couple friends purchase the game during the sale, upon trying to login we are hit with errors from Mber (A client thingy you have to link your Steam with), after retrying I got in, 2 of my friends not so lucky, they have been trying over an hour to get a chance to play with no success due to this highly common error it seems.\n\nAfter the game launches your hit with the server browser, for which you can't even move your mouse for several minutes while it loads all servers. There are no settings options or even a main menu for that matter, you have to sit and wait for the server browser to load before you can do anything.\n\nThen, when your finally in game and created your character you have a choice of spawns, safe zone or world. I haven't tried world yet although that seems like the good idea because these 'safe zones' are far from safe. You could spawn in the middle of a safe zone being raided by Nether which at that point, you can attack in safe zones and people seem more bothered about killing you and not the monsters. If your lucky, you will spawn in an actual safe zone but as soon as you walk out, you get killed off other players straight away for absolutely no reason, knowing you probaly don't have any loot worth taking or knowing you have just spawned in.\n\nGraphics are somewhat OK in places, but really unoptimised. Solid objects like fences, bin bags, drums can be walked through for some reason and when climbing up rubble and stuff it seems the invisible barrier, thats supposed to be under the texture, is actually about a foot away from it for another strange reason.\n\nBottom line is to say this game has left the early access program is ridiculous, it clearly should still be in there and DO NOT believe the reviews that are on the game's store page rating it 4/5 and stuff because the Nether they played, to get that kind of score, is clearly not the Nether I or anyone else is playing.

We all know the formula and want one them to not flop. Sadly this game is one of the many that's failed thusfar.  I'm glad I got it for a steal but I could never recommend it.\n\nHere's a list of issues:\n\n1) The PVP aspect is ruined due to hackers.  I ended up not spending much time with that for obvious reasons.\n\n2) There's like 10 guns in the whole game.  The best are unlocked with crafting (rather than the P2W shop thrown in) which is kinda cool but such a lack of variety gets boring fast.\n\n3) Storage space is far too limiting.  Storage and cash are the only things that pass onto your next characters after you die.  That's nice in theory, but the largest backpack you can have gives more space than storage does.  That makes it so you can only get a small arsenal together before you've maxed out.\n\n4) There's basically no loot or monsters.  It is pretty easy to go for hours at a time without finding a single lootable item or monster.  Loot is global which means when one person searches a spot its gone for a while.  Therefore, you need to go to unpopulated parts of the map to make looting better but even then you're getting 1-2 spots per every other block max.  The spawn rate for enemies is also pretty low so you very quickly abandon any notions of stealth and, more often than not, will find yourself sprinting across the map in the hopes you encounter anything to fight.\n\n5)  It's really poorly optimized.  I have a decent computer that runs games like Rome 2 on ultra settings without problems but I found myself needing to be on basic graphics for this game to be the least bit playable.\n\n6) There's really low incentive to keep playing once "end-game".  I can't say if I ever hit there, but from what I'd found through others, I'd hit a point where I had the best gun(s), a backup set, and enough money to buy food until the end of time.  From then on, all I could do was kill things to increase my account level.  Account level adds perks to new characters, but if you're already maxed level on a character I don't see why I'd want to make another.\n\n7) Bugs.  Horrible game-ruining bugs.  It's easy to tolerate the lighter ones... Whether it's the dragon-monster that doesn't flap its wings and just skates through the air for no reason, enemies clipping through walls because Why not, or not being able to loot items that give you the prompt.  Bugs like THAT are tolerable, although still disheartening.  However, the reason I quit this game and wrote this review was because of what just occurred to me.  I had died and lost my primary set of gear and was onto my second set.  No big deal since it was my fault I died.  However, the game crashed on me while I was looting to replace my primary set.  When I logged back in, I was shocked to find that the crash had led to my character being reset to level 1.  Lo and behold, my storage was missing my secondary set of gear, so I had effectively been robbed of all my useful gear and all the items I had tried to loot back.  Effectively, I was brought back to square one because this game failed on me.\n\n...And all of this still occurs in a game that has been deemed "stable" by its developers.  Do not play this game or buy from the company who made this game.","February 23, 2015","false","27.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I RAN OUT OF KEYS.\n\nTHIS REVIEW IS MASSIVELY OUTDATED. I HAVE NOT PLAYED THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE GAME AND I AM UNABLE TO GIVE YOU A CONSTRUCTIVE REVIEW ON THIS.\n\nThe only reason I leave this review here is because it shows you my experience with the game before it got released to what it is right now.\n\nOkay, lets actually write an honest review why YOU should buy this game.\n\nNether.\nNether is NOT your generic DayZ survival game if you already thought this was something like that.\nNo, I believe Nether offers you a complete different view and style on a survival game.\n\nThe game goal is pretty simple. You spawn in an apocalyptic setting in Burnam. It is you. A survivor of an unknown event called "The cull" The cull created human mutations and abominations.. called the Nether. You have to survive. Simple as that.\n\nHowever, you will find that this 'survive' I am talking about is pretty hard. There are many Nether out there in the world. Big ones. Small ones. Flying ones. Stealthy ones and even ones that make a bloody shriek to call in other Nether to let you know your funeral has arrived. If you think that the Nether already scares you off then let me tell you. The players are worse. If it is not a Golem that is smacking your face in it will be fully geared up player with all the weapons you can only DREAM of having. This game is completely filled with tension till the very end. You know ♥♥♥♥ is about to get down when you hear the roar of incoming Nether.\n\nNow, Patchy, I thought you were going to tell me what WOULD make me interested in the game?\n\nWell the thing is, the game offers you quite a unique experience in a survival game. You have some generic things. Health, hunger and stamina. Of course you need to eat to stay alive. But you can also level up your character. You gain experience by killing Nether, doing tasks or objectives and even just staying alive gives you experience. You can adjust and suit your character in ANY way you like! And trust me, you will die so many times that you eventually have tried out alot. This game has also some crafting methods. Can't seem to find a good gun? Don't worry! you can craft it by finding the right components or even trade Nether bones, skins, and blood for good ammo and guns at the misterious Nether cult in any safe zones. Oh yeah! The safe zones! In safe zones, you are safe. That is untill they are randomly attacked and are not safe anymore for 60 min. Enjoy your not so safe zones!\nAnother fun feature they recently added are Tribes. In game you can join a Tribe. Tribe offers you rewards, quests and other alliances with other tribes. The rewards will be GREATLY. You can earn reputation among your tribe and get cool loot. HOWEVER they recently added it and have not really been working on it alot. This game is in BETA. They are constantly updating it and adding more and more content! In the next update they are expanding the map, adding a wasteland and actually adding terrorial control to Tribes, offering hourly incomes of cash wich you can spend to upgrade your gear or resupply.\n\nBut Patchy, this DOES sound like my avarage survival DayZ game!\n\nI will tell you what.\nThe graphics are stunning. (The lightning and shadows are a bit iffy still)\nThe gameplay is really tense and exciting. (you never know whats around that corner!)\nThe level system is fun and challenging! (God I love the Melee skill tree)\nAnd the game challenges mentally to prepare for decisions along your path. (should I make it to the next safe zone? Should I camp around here? I dont know!)\n\n\nLongest ♥♥♥♥ I've ever wrote.","March 31, 2014","true","30.1"," 187 of 352 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","187","352","0","11"

So let us get one thing straight, this game is still pretty good but it was so much better. Back when it was in Alpha it was a strong game with a lot of potential. The concept was good, the mechanics i.e. looting, crafting where all good, the nether (the main enemy) was and still is a good idea. So why then does it feel now that it is unfinished, glitchy, buggy and too some degree just a broken game full of people killing each other.\n\nThis game has become less about killing or surviving against the nether and more hunting other players down and killing them again and again and again. Some players in this game, dont want to fight, instead they want to do what made Nether good; loot, craft, survive and so on. The game makes not attempt to ensure that it doesnt become a cluster of death. The nether are barely in it now, it is literally whoever has the biggest gun wins, and in truth that doesnt appeal to me.\n\nShould you buy and play Nether? I would say no, dont buy this game, really dont, it is frustrating on a few levels. The mechanics are still there just not emphasised enough, the concept of the ganme; survive, pits you against players more than it does the nether (this is usually done in a situation when you get shot at repeatedly without knowing where your shooter is OR when you have a lot of stuff or no stuff). The game just feels rushed and broken. It WAS good, really it was. It could still be good but because of the rushed nature of its development from Alpha to release it still has a lot of broken parts to fix.\n\nI hope this review has helped, it's a shame because it used to be a good game.\n\nOne more thing if you choose to buy this game here are some tips from 65 hours of playing, stay away from Riverside Trading Outpost as this is where you will die, if you have a gun and you see a player with a gun...shoot first as this is where you will die, dont sprint that much as this attracts the nether as this is where you will die and if you have no loot or items go to the subways as this is where you can find some stuff,","October 26, 2014","false","68.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The XP leveling design is complete garbage. You die, you reset to level 0. Regardless of how long you play, you always respawn with a kitchen knife.\n\nEnvironment: Pretty decent construction of the world. The environment feels good. However, trying to actually find anything in the world is near impossible. You might as well sit in a corner and starve to death. After walking around for 2 hours straight to find containers to loot, I found one can of beans and a bag of chips, which I immediately was forced to use for fear of starving to death. Monsters are sprinkled all over the place in what seems to be very evenly placed and set locations, like they measured each spawn location exactly a set distance apart from one another.\n\nMonsters and Player Enemies: Monsters are decently detailed. They are a little bit more than a nuisance if you get spotted, depending on the monster. Most of the time, melee weapons are alright to use if you can hit the monsters. Half the time the monster dodges attacks either because of lag, hitboxes, or whatever, so you take more damage than you should fighting trash. Player enemies are basically the equivlant of shooting fish in the barrel, but you're the fish. You spawn, you walk outside, you die. You spawn again, you grab a box to deliver for a quest, you walk, you get sniped outside city limits, and the guy that shot you takes your box and gets free XP.\n\n_________________________________\n\nI bought this game when it first was out in early access, but nothing seemed to really change in the core gameplay. It's still the same piece of crap when it was released. Not recommended at all.","September 5, 2014","false","2.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game provides players with a strong atmosphere, reminiscent of Metro and STALKER.\n\nThe setting may be fantastic, but the gameplay is far from perfect. While gunplay is acceptable, melee combat can only be described as wonky. There’s a fairly well done stealth system, but this does not help you level in any way.\n\nWhile Nether’s creeping around, looting and shooting down monsters in a post-apocalyptic world sounds good it does not hold up well in practice.\n\nOn a technical level, there are a lot of issues both in terms of performance and bugs. Frame rates regularly drop too low to be acceptable, even on a high end rig.\n\nHowever the biggest problem is the multiply player, no holds-barred, survival experience. Nether was hyped as a co-op experience, but unfortunately that is rarely the case. More often than not you will die at the hands of another player. Sometimes a random player you don't see coming, but also from players you thought were joining in the co-op spirit and who you thought had teamed up with you. They have a habit of backstabbing you and robbing you when you don't expect it. You may say, "all's fair in love and gaming" but consider this: when you die you re-spawn at a random location with only a knife and have to restart your skill tree from scratch. Yes, every time you die. While I'm sure some people will love this it gets old very quickly.\n\nTo make this even worse, just getting out of the spawn area can be a nightmare with other players camping about picking you off when all you have is a knife. Worse is the fact that there seems to be absolutely no control over cheaters. Lots of people using aim-bots and hacks spoil an already marred experience.\n\nThe real shame of it is, I think that there is the basis of a really great PVE co-op game here.\n\nWhere is the co-op game I was hoping for?\nWhy are there no PVE only servers?\nWhy can't they stop the hackers?","October 1, 2014","false","13.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

This is only the case in the 'safe zones' where PvP is off, in the safe zone you can talk to people and often work together and deliver packages, they might shoot you in the back and be complete ♥♥♥♥♥ but even if they do that you have a global inventory so when you die you don't loose everything you ever owned.\n\nMy  biggest  gripe is that the map is so  flat and plain  . There are no hills or any natural height differences like that, without climbing a building, but even then the buildings are dull and  all identical  ...\n\nMy  next biggest  gripe is the fact that the game has  micro-transactions!   woopty ♥♥♥♥in' doo"!  Because the best thing you can add to a  P2P  game is micro-transactions... That's why I avoid most F2P games, (with TF2 as an exception) so I don't have to feel like other players have an advantage over me because thay are sad enough to put money into a f2p game.\n\nOh yeah, and the developers don't do anything to the game, and it is buggy as ♥♥♥♥ and often will crash on launch, but in game it is stable. It just feels like a stupid money spin.\n\nBut for some reason I  really, really  liked this game, maybe because I had just got sick of my xbox, built a PC, and this is the  first  PC survival game I played (if minecraft doesn't count ;P).\n\nSo I would recommend it, If going purely on memory... I might even update and boot it back up again.\n\nEDIT: I recently helped my friend build his PC and when we were done he had a 20 pound steam voucher, we sat and pondered for awhile trying to decide what games to buy that are co-op / playable together. That's when I remembered nether, it is only 7 quid so he picked it up and I have to say this game is so much fun with a friend. Unlike dayZ it takes no time to find each over and you can join a group so that you can see each over on the map. We collected some parcels and escorted them through tones of nether and pulse raising PvP encounters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealjon_/recommended/247730/","therealjon_","Forgot about Dre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealjon_/","530 products in account","I bought this game based on a RPS article detailing how it was an open world survival game with goals and pve scenarios to complete.  Well that really wasn't the case at all.\n\nThe world is pretty amazing, and the Nether are frightening to run into.  Besides that though there isn't much to the game.  The developers made this amazing looking world that occasionally has an enemy or a base to go to, with like two objectives no one does because either they are afraid to get picked off, or are sitting outside the objective waiting to pick people off.\n\nMost weapons are locked behind a paywall, and why exactly would you pay for something you will lose 3 seconds after leaving your base because everybody kills you on site.  The whole objective system is completely pointless if everyone is just using that opportunity to kill the other players and steal their items.  On top of that hackers are all over the place, and you can just be exploring or hiding and magically die from somebody far off in the distance.\n\nI think I paid about $13 for this game and totally regret it.  They probably should update the description of the game, it's misleading.  The game is just chaos and is only fun for the hackers.  They need to pick a focus and build the game around it.

Quite a few are outdated and patches have already fixed the problems!  I started playing this on a guest key from a friend who bought it on a whim.   The game is fantastic when it comes to optimization, visuals, exploration, and environment.  The map is somewhat restricted even with it's fairly large area, after playing for ~20+ hours, you learn what routes can be safer and where to avoid players (or hunt them if that's your style).  Graphics settings are very simple and can change your experience in the game drastically.  For you who may not have top of the line computers, don't fret, this game's detail can be dropped low enough most computers can play it easily!\n\nThere aren't many servers, and can't be made by players sadly, but each has a capacity of 64 players maximum, the more players ingame, the less nether seem to spawn, and vice versa.  Grouping up with friends is very easy with the group option, and even has a /group chat to keep your messages private, as well as a local area VOIP built in.  The compass/map allow you to mark waypoints and get to them easily, which is a tremendous help in the environment when you need to make detours or get disoriented from combat.  Gunplay is nice, recoil is realistic (Military experience) and there are a fair amount of guns for an early beta game.  Contrary to other reviews, there is NO pay to win system.  The only purchasable items are cosmetics and keys, the keys only are used to unlock chests containing various items.  Almost everything in the game can be bought with ingame currency aside from a few cosmetics, and guns are not purchased, but crafted or found.\n\nThere is a storage system that allows you to save items in a "bank" that you don't wish to lose or can't carry.  Through my experiences playing, I have not seen any hackers, and only one exploit another player used, which was a way to gain massive amounts of money, which has already been fixed with the latest patch.  Little to no server lag, and quick start up for the game.  Easily played solo and fun with groups of friends if you have the resources to do so.  The variety of nether is nice, each type having it's own way of performing combat and sets of abilities adding variety to the combat.  Unlike games such as DayZ, the community here is pretty good, it's not hard to make friends and allies, and not everyone is out to KOS you.\n\nThough I've hopped around here and there on subjects briefly, the game brings something to the table for everyone.  If you like combat, it's balanced and interesting, if you like stealth, it's easy to do, and a viable playstyle.  The skilltrees are nice, and no, you don't lose EVERYTHING upon death.  You lose the items you were carrying, your character levels, and 10% of your money you have.  Yes, it does sting, but you also earn an account level, which gives you permanant boosts, varying with your level, making it easier to regain those temporary levels to get that edge.\n\nAnywho, to wrap it up, if you are looking for something different than the other survival games, give this a try, it's cheaper than most, constantly being worked on, great customer support, and finds ways to keep you interested, solo or in a group.","June 16, 2014","true","12.6"," 66 of 122 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","66","122","0","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daemon111/recommended/247730/","daemon111","Daemon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daemon111/","313 products in account","So, I got this game for about 3 bucks, and for that much, I don't know how much I can really complain, but seriously, if it said early access, I could have excused a lot, but being sold as a finished product? Not sure if I can really say the same thing.\n\nRight off the bat, I get to wait for the launcher to load, then I have to register for another ♥♥♥♥ing account, then I have to wait for the launcher to accept my login… then wait about 10 minutes for the menu to load… so I can select a server to join… then to wait again for it to load in the world. The time it takes to get in game is like 20-25 minutes in total, which for a game being sold as “finished” is just inexcusable unless you are a grand strategy game and that’s just how long it takes for you to read the novel of instructions. Then when I start in a server, I see right away “oh there are going to be micro-transactions, and Jesus, is there a way to turn off that vignette? And is there another color to this game besides brown?” I then spawn in, and get a nice little pop-up letting me know that this is the tutorial and to deliver the package to a person in the safe zone. Awesome I thought, this should be easy, get some early loot, then head off and adventure. Nope. Take two steps forward and get absolutely wrecked by about 10 monsters. I spawn in again, same safe zone, thinking “Well maybe I stumbled out of it, or maybe it was just a glitch”. Nope. Get wrecked again, turns out that safe zones can be invaded by monsters and the apparently you can fight them off, but good luck figuring out how to do that with the kitchen knife you spawn in with. The game has no issue with spawning you into un-safe “safe zones” when there are perfectly tenable safe zones elsewhere. It does give you the option of spawning randomly, but it almost has the same problem, “great now I don’t get to die instantly, I just get to either starve to death, or I get to take my chances with the flying things, hmm decisions decisions”. A few deaths later the random spawn actually placed me within distance of a real safe zone, where I was able to finally see those NPCs I was supposed to be turning the quest into. And apparently this game takes place in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R universe because every NPC on the planet wears a black or brown hoodie and scarf, it’s almost as if modeling faces is kind of hard. Anyway, after turning in the first quest, I was given another, and the quest description pointed me back towards the city, however I was able to just walk to the next shop over and turn in the quest, and I was finally rewarded with an actual weapon and water for once. Now at this point I was given a quest to go join a tribe, and instead of doing that, I decided to go out into the world and explore now that I was decently equipped with something other than a kitchen knife. The first few buildings I found were nothing special but I soon learned that the glowing containers were the ones containing loot. However, the game thinks “loot” means “the same two useless ♥♥♥♥ing items over and over again”, and while I understand the whole survival thing, this implies that survival might be possible and that you have some sort of higher goal, and now mine was “join tribe” and when I finally found the place to join one, I had officially won the game, time to exit out and uninstall. Seriously, the only thing to do once you get a gun and join a tribe is to shoot other players and possibly other monsters, if you get bored, which will probably be very fast since new players are few and far between in this barren landscape. Oh and speaking of landscape, I know some games have issues with clipping on tiny terrain objects, so the developers put in a jump button, or just make them inaccessible, this games idea to fix this issue is to just make your character float about 15 feet above any major obstacles, which breaks the immersion somewhat, but I can say of the many problems with this game, getting caught in clipping wasn’t one of them. But then sitting 15 above ground also gave me a nice view of the scenery, and hint: it wasn’t much to look at. Seriously, just get a brown piece of construction paper, eat some taco bell,  then take a messy ♥♥♥♥ on it, and bam, you got the world map for Nether. While I really didn’t expect “Skyrim with mods” levels of color and creativity, they could have spiced things up a little, maybe not copy pasting the same 4 or 5 buildings over and over again would be good start, and possibly making some interiors to random shops, so it would feel more like scavenging than playing hunt for the helicopter. And then why stop there, maybe make loot really mean something, other than a means to acquire shotgun barrels, seriously I feel like the apocalypse in this game was caused by raining shotgun barrels more than monsters. In the space of 20 or so minutes I had acquired 11 shotgun barrels with no purpose other than to sell at the shop for more water bottles. And thats basiclly what the bulk of my time was, flooding the shotgun barrel market and buying up shares in the water bottle industry.\n\nI’ll stop ranting, but seriously this game needs work or a few rounds in the back of the skull. Probably the latter.\n","July 9, 2014","false","2.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I have been plaing this game during its first phases and have to say that it is improving by every update. I am writing this review upon seeing many bad and insidious reviews during the summer-sale.\n\nNether:\n\ncons:\n- like I said, its still under development. Some parts are still being worked on. some areas in the game are glitched, you may get stuck (however you can get out if you have a glider). The cars are also glitched so driving them is at your own risk.\n- there are some hackers in the game, but the Nether-Team is trying its best to resolve the situation.\n- as a new player you will have a bad time. You do not know your surroundings and a lot of Players are killing you on sight, rather than staying friendly. But this is part of the game, getting to know the city and the areas that can be a threat and where to find usable loot. If you have a bigger backpack and some good guns on you, other Players will make you their target just to get your equipment.\n\npros:\n- the athmosphere of the world is breathtakingly scary. The post-apocalyptic scenario is done very well.\n- this game is not a pay-to-win! You may buy ingame currency however this only gets you different clothing and no advanteage whatsoever. Everything else you can get in the game by collecting loot.\n- looting the areas/ crafting the guns is very rewarding.\n- you can level up your account and not lose your progress. However you lose your character level upon death. I like this hardcore aspect of the game. If you die, you loose your gear and start over again.\n- playing in a group or with friends is a lot more fun than sinlge player. However as a group you may not always have the upper-hand. You can always get into an ambush and a sinlge player can take out your entire group. So the aspect of tactics and communication is very imoprtant.\n\nthis is not a game you should take on lighthearted. It needs your full attention or you just might see yourself shot in the back or a group of Nether chasing you down the streets.","June 24, 2014","true","444.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","2"

It may not sound so bad, but it is in fact ruining the game to such a point that it rewards the camping behaviour - If you're first on a server and can rush to get a gun (ranged weapon) then all you need to do is sit down and wait for other players to do the work for you and you get to kill them and pick their gear. It is not much from the rookies, but well worth it as you don't have to play the game or make anything of it.\n\nThe concept of this game is likeable, but the players are incetivised to ruin the game by camping and killing new gamers.\n\nMy recommendation - Do not buy this game until they can come up with a viable model that allows new players to get at least a fighting chance - At the moment you are given a Butter Knife and expected to fight camping players geared with Sniper Rifles.\n\nNote for the developers - How about enticing geared players to go further away from the safe zones but having more/better loot and challenges, so that new players can at least get a little sporting chance of maybe getting a ranged weapon?","August 15, 2014","false","8.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"

The games is indeed a sandbox mixed with your survival. Yes the Cons being hackers and the devs left. The Pros are the PVE servers where you don't have to worry about hackers. The only thing they can do is speed hack, infinite inv and one shot. In PVE it doesn't matter, but the speed hack provides an unfair advantage. That being you get places slower. Other than that you can benefit from other players, find new friends and the community is good from what I've seen.

I really should have looked more into the game on youtube, or even better, read the reviews below the store page. I couldnt even play it. I know, why write a review if you havnt played it? Well it didnt start, thats why. Exactly why it didnt start I dont know, but I know that whatever was causing it wasn't suppose to be happening. I'd log in and the only thing that would happen was there would be a large black square on my screen. It would also force me to restart my copmputer entirely. But why be suprised, right? So many games are being released on Steam that are barely working. This game is just another piece of garbage on Steam that some how qualifies to be sold to the public.

After starting the game up to a black screen that would need to be closed by task manager and trying again to only get a completely unresponsive or barely functioning menu. When i finally was able to get into the game, It was in a 'specatator mode' with a completely crappy environment which i was told was a bug and went to take a shower until it worked, which was 20 minutes later. Upon playing the game, I found out that there was nearly nothing to do, All the mechanics blew me away how bad they were, like falling out of a 50 story skyscraper and taking no damage, or holding 'e' as prompted which got no response. On top of all this, the AI is utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I could barely squeeze out 30 fps on minimum crappy settings (which actually looked laughable), on a PC that can easily max most demanding games.

This makes the game annoying and frustrating too, after you spent like hours to find and collect items to survive and craft new and stronger weapons, then comes some idiot who shoots you even if you are in a safezone... wow I really needed that, I can't live without shooting other people in safe places too.\nSpeaking about other aspects, the game is still a lot broken, there are many crashes, and many times you can't even join the servers.

Hra není plně propojená se Steamem a když se chcete připojit do hry, musíte se registrovat na jejich webu a přihlašovat přes externího klienta. Neumí si zapamatovat heslo, takže při velmi častých pádech hry které budete zažívat vás to začne štvát.\nMenu je primitivní, skládá se jen ze serverlistu. Aby jste mohli hru jakkoliv nastavit, musíte se připojit do hry. Severlist je sám  sobě zalagovaný a nebýt fixu, který si musíte udělat sami, čekali by jste dlouhé hodiny jako já dříve.\nServery vás z nepochopitelného důvodu vyhazují zpátky do menu bez jakékoliv chybové hlášky a vy tak ani nevíte co se děje (a ano opět se znovu načítá pomalý server list). Když se připojíte na server, nemáte zdaleka vyhráno. Dost se stává, že se bugnete ve Spectator modu a nemůžete nic dělat. Pomůže jen alt+F4.\nVe hře máte i magickou schopnost, která vám umožní procházet skrz textury, stoly, skříně, kameny a dokonce i ploty.\n\nHra má velký potenciál a skvělou atmosféru (noční procházka v hrobovém tichu - boží), ale příšerně ji ničí lagy a bugy. Bohužel jsou to věci, které nejdou jen tak přehlédnout. Doufám, že na tom vývojáři rychle zapracují, protože hra se chová jako ve stádiu Alphy.\n\n#English\n\nI don't recommend buying this game at full price right now. This game looks like alpha version. Nether have great potential and awesome environment but he have a lot of bugs (you can run through tables, cabinets, fences or even rocks). Menu is primitive and have only lagging server list. If you want to customize setting you have to login on server.\n\nI hope that developers will repair all these bugs and lags because Nether could be great game. For now I don't recommend you this game.","July 4, 2014","false","8.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaZenMaster/recommended/247730/","DaZenMaster","Da Zen Master","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaZenMaster/","77 products in account","So, I'm writting this review as an attempt to put some brakes on the hate bandwaggon that was kind of formed through time. Wether it happened due to popular opinion or formed by player's own experience I do not know, but I trust it's the first option and not the latter cause negative opinions can trully be contagious, and they are in most cases from what I observed.\n\nAbout the quality of the game itself, it has some performance issues, I do have to tone down the game a lot even though I have a pc with substancial performance, and sure it had a past heavily marked by hackers and people who eventually bought or somehow got the hold of hacks to even out the playfield.\n\nThat of course created a somewhat negative experience, cause after some hours of fun grinding with friends of mine, I would be eventually be carrying an item that I absolutely did not want to lose, just to get it wrongfully taken from me by some ludicrous one shot from hell that I had no idea where and how it came to happen, and it would be in parts/manners that would be somewhat hard if not impossible to pull off such a shot due to the place I was situated at the time.\n\nThose were my personal views on the negative aspect of the early days of nether, now for the good ones.\n\nEither being wishful thinking or not, I have yet to encounter a hacker these days since they implemented an anti hack system, if they exist, they exist in such low numbers that I've yet to meet one, result being I have characters that last above 5 hours, and I either die due to trolling a bit too hard or just by fair engages from a player who had the advantage.\n\nAs for gameplay, sure this game could use refinement, does it have performance issues? Absolutely. Does it stop it from being fun?  Not in the slightest.\n\nI remember the early days when I first got the game, whilst going about in my solo explorations, that feeling of isolation and loneliness was heavily marked by the constant paranoia of every sound I heard, not very long after that first impact I meet my first nether, and boy was I feeling those chills down my spine. When it spots me, it unleashed such an unexpected roar it had me trembling, but eventually it fell to my trusty kitchen knife. Short moments after that, I meet 2 players running about in the middle of the street, and I go out to salute them, probably join them in their ventures, but I was saluted with a bullet salvo that ended my life quite prematurely. Both those moments, had my body spike with adrenaline, and it was a feeling beyond wonderful, and that feeling carries on to this very day.\n\nAs for my final points for this review, should you hate this game? No, it's ridiculous to hate a game without trying it out yourself, from a personal experience, as this game improves with time, I grow to love it more and more despite it's fall outs.\n\nWith time hopefully some sort of friendly behaviour bonus will be implemented cause at the moment the encouragement is very low if not none, but that shouldn't stop you from trying to be a solo ninja style survivor trying your luck in this world of abandonment. It is a very satisfying experience with much to offer, from feelings of joy to the sorrow of loss, and it's all very good.\n\nAnd on a finishing note, trust only the friend you're playing with, other than that, enjoy this fantastic game.","June 30, 2014","true","146.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It puts you immediately on the offensive, and unless you are playing this game with your friends you will die and loose your progress.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CanadianWolverine/recommended/247730/","CanadianWolverine","Wolvie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CanadianWolverine/","296 products in account","UPDATED REVIEW Sept 9, 2014:\n\nJust under 2 and 1/2 weeks later, this and another issue (Gold Upgrade Fail) that made the game unplayable for me, whatever was going on server side behind the scenes has been fixed. I was messaged on Steam that the game was playable again and can confirm that is the case for me as well.\n\nI am leaving the original text minus the "Do Not Buy" message for this review just so other gamers know the game can go down pretty much exclusively to server side issues on the Developer's/Publisher's end, something my fellow Steam users should know before purchasing.\n\nThe short and sweet of this game is that it is very atmospheric, significantly because the stakes are so high because so many mistakes can end your character that you have been leveling up in a heart beat. I'm way into games with tension like that, sneaking around wondering when the sword of Damocles will fall - so if you're not into that kind of high tension, low throtle scene ... apparently there are LSM modes one can play instead that were recently added to the game. Hmm, I still consider the Survivor FPS RPG stuff to be the meat and potatoes of this though, so I stick by that this game is only a consideration if you're into that sort of thing, that's my impression so far anyways.\n\nBe warned though, some of the stuff like going to the traders is for lack of a better word janky or understanding the compass indicators in a world where some pretty significant obstacles can be in the way so you don't bee line for your confusing way point marker or getting stuck while sneaking can be annoying and impresses upon me the sense this game is not polished aka had the equivalent of a QA Tester pass.\n\nFor what it is worth, I find myself playing this in roughly 30 minute sessions, where I either do one mission of some sort around or between the Safe Zones or turn in a bunch of loot I found while sneaking around the Nether Monsters and wondering if some other survivor is going to shoot me dead for my pitiful belongings - which hasn't happened yet, sneaking around seems to be working out quite well and I have reached Character level 16 (thus I have been enjoying spending skill points) without dying for the first time, yet. This is in part due to that sneaking feels like all I should do so far until I find a better weapon but so far its mostly been just bandages that seem to drop out of loot containers.\n\nI hope this has been helpful and if you want to see the original impressions, see below.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nSeriously, it worked for all of an hour, while I made my way through the tutorial missions, when suddenly the game was convinced my character was still in the Safe Zone when it was not, this being the second safe zone I left after creeping about avoiding Nether monsters. As long as you are in a Safe Zone, you can't fire or swing a weapon, so you can see how this would put my character in a bad way if attacked by the monsters. So, I logged out.\n\nBig mistake, apparently. The game did not log me out but instead continued to starve my character to death, only now, none of the keys would work, no menus could be brought up. I had to bring up Task Manager to kill the game.\n\nSo I start it up again and log in to a server. Only, what's this? My character is stuck in place, no keys responding to input (so I can't exit the game normally, again), and my characters weapon and stats have changed to 999/999 HP Assault Rifle 02 99/999. And this happens no matter what server is logged into and I have to kill the program with Task Manager every time.\n\nWhen I went looking for when this game would be fixed on the day of my first play of this game, this is the official response on their forums I found:\n08-20-2014, 01:58 PM\nOriginally posted by KPopp:Sorry for the issues and thanks for your patience.  Developers and server team is working on fixes that should roll out today.  We will keep you updated as we learn more.That was a week ago.\n\nEdit/Update Aug 31, 2014: So I tried again after following some instructions from Steam Support, since I am trying to get help from them, only to be greeted by this Gold Update Failed BS every time I try to play now:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/CanadianWolverine/screenshot/559891575264135504","August 27, 2014","false","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The first dev's did a patch that created more bugs and some wierd lag issues occured. Then the glitches and hacks started to appear. They never corrected it, rumors went around talking about bans but they never happened. They passed it onto another Dev's and they did a few patches. Nothing occured after that. More hackers started to appear after they knew nothing was going to happen to them. Then the 2nd Dev's passed it onto the third dev's. To my knowledge the 3rd dev's are the ones who created the Nether Arena, etc. The amount of servers are down to I think a hand full. And no one plays the game anymore. Hackers run the Nether world rather than looters and Nether monster. Would I recommend this game? Hell no, its been broken for awhile with many false promises. Was it fun while it lasted? Yes it was very fun. The good times hanging out with friends, hunting people that felt they wanted to mess with our crew was a blast.

Now an entire month later....I'm finally able to get thier launcher to work correctly.   I had contacted the developers about my issues of not being able to download a working launcher from steam or from thier website.  I had tried ALL of thier recommended solutions, including uninstalling Steam and cleaning my registery settings in Windows, and re-installing from Steam...for the 10th time.  Well, after a month of this, I installed the game again last night, and now I have a working launcher.  I was able to log in and get into the game...and started loading up a server...then got kicked out to the server screen again.  Tried again and I was able to load into a game.  I know this is an early access game, but this is so not worth $9.99, let alone the insane price they were asking for before the price drop.  From what little I played, the UI and options are minimal at best, I iniated some quest and was given no direction as to what I needed to do or kill or any obvious waypoint marker or quest log.  And I'm fighting monsters with a chef's knife, I get over whelmed after a few minutes and the system tells me to create a new character or exit the game.  On top of that I needed to turn down the settings just to have a stable frame rate.

Monsters - Ok. So monsters have the ability to teleport, and sense you pretty easily. Sounds realistic right? The only problem is you cannot hide from the Monsters, they always get to you. If you get caught by one as soon as you spawn, your either going to get hurt a ton, or die. Also just to add, there is a flying monster that is almost impossible to hit with a melee, so enjoy trying to hit it with a knife.\n\n2. "Co-op" - I use the term Co-op loosely. This is the only time that Dayz is good to me. In dayz, you can say friendly! and have a chance to meet a friend, although in Nether, they shoot instantly before you can speak. You cant meet new people, and helping people wont happen. If you go to drop a gun for a new spawn, they will either kill you with a knife (or attempt to) or take the gun and shoot you. Co-op isnt really a thing in this game.\n\nSo all im saying is dont buy this unless they fix monsters, and your prepared to hide for 6 hours.","August 1, 2014","false","14.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is definitely a work in progress but as my experience goes, It has been enjoyable enough to keep playing as I see the potential it has.

I've already got used to play bad games, and some of them are enjoyable: This isn't.\n\nMy gameplay until now:\n-Initiated game, created Nether account, launched it.\n-Got stuck on the menu, Ctrl+Alt-Del and stoped it\n-Launched it again\n-Got stuck on the menu, closed it... again.\n-Launched it once more\n-Mouse cursor doesn't showed up, had to do Alt-Tab to put it to work\n-Menu works at 0,2FPS God know why...\n-Initiated server\n-Waited 3 minutes, didn't spawned anywhere. Esc, Tab, nothing works, closed game\n-Launched it\n-Same process, etc. etc.\n-FINALLY could play something\n-Server almost full: can't see no one\n-Killed some monsters\n-Got tired of it\n\nThat's it. That's what this game is about: kill some monsters, kill some humans, get killed by both\n\nThis game is just an offense to the consumer. In fact, most of Antecipated acess games are. I know that they are not complete yet, but there's no excuse for the lazyness of some projects, and this one is just one of them. The game is completely broken, barely works, and everything in it is terrible.\n\nGraphics: 3/10\nBesides some good details, they are completely uninspired, pop-ups everywhere, textures always show up in front of you, just ugly as ....\n\nGameplay: 2/10\nLag. Lag. Lag, so much lag. Most of the actions like crouching, opening the menu, etc, takes seconds, I repeat, seconds to do. Not mili-seconds, not immediately, but 2-3 seconds to do that.\nThe character creating is minimal, you dont have many options.\nThe crafting system is strange and I didn't see any tutorial explaining that.\n\nSound: 1/10\nIs it there?\n\n\nFinal score: 2/10\n\nThis is a complete garbage, and the least we, players, ask from the creators of games that are in antecipated acess is that they are, at least, functional and works. The game was launched in Fall '13 (almost a Year ago) and it's inadmissible that it's still in this condition, dysfunctional, I'm still looking where can I spend my 50 Gold coisa, because I can't find the store (Yes, I, being a complete idiot, bought the "Chosen" edition ((Well, at least it was on Steam Sales, 6€...))\nThere are so many bugs I can't even count anymore, with just 1h of gameplay!!! The game doesn't start, the game doesn't close, the menu freezes, buttons that doesn't work, glitches everywhere, enormous quantity of time required to join a game, so, so many bugs, it's attrocious.\n\nSo, don't buy this game, at all.

The trailer had me hooked looked great. And i honestly tried to give this game a chance, and after i screamed and cursed i put it down and came back to give it a couple more chances. But in the end a game is only worth playing if it gives you some sort of positive entertainment. The map is not that big, but they compensate by making you move irritatingly slow, you have a sprint but it only lasts a little while until you get a penalty for sprinting to long and cant use sprint for a short time. Monsters are irritating to fight because you cant use terrain to run from them, you cant out run them at all, and if there is more than 2 you probably dead unless you have a great weapon. Why? Because the monsters in nether can teleport... thats right, they dont run at you, they just teleport to the rooftop your on because you aggrovated them from the 2nd floor. If thats not bad enough, they disable safe havens from time to time so its not safe there either, one moment your looking through your inventory, next your getting gangbanged by elite nether monsters that teleport to you as you run for dear life. And thats not even the bad part, people just sit outside the safehavens waiting for you to leave so they can blast you in the back of the head. Take all your stuff, and guess what, all the exp you earned to level up your character is now reset. You go back to having your butter knife no items and level 1. Whats the point of even having levels if the guy who has a sniper is going to one shot you back to lvl 1? I'm actually upset, this is the first time i bought a game, gave it a real honest go, and been thoroughly upset i ever spent money on it.  All the items you can get in the store, you can also spend real money on. And the prices for a someone who bought the standard game is rediculous, played the game for 8 hours and had 1000 bucks, a paintball mask costs 10000.....really? You bet your ♥♥♥ spending 5 dollars of real money would be easier, and not as much of a waste of time. I would expect that kind of thing from a free game though.... oh wait, i spent 15 bucks on this game. And i need  to pay more to unlock the rest of its content? Garbage.

Teleporting zombie alien creatures really don't fit in the game although they are quite terrifying because if you agro more than one your chances of survival are small. Sneaking around them proved almost impossible. Sneaking didn't do much good. The fact that you lose everything that isn't banked is a huge incentive for being cautious but costs a lot of what could be fun risk taking gameplay because as you progress further you become more and more reluctant to venture farther. It puts a real damper on exploration for long periods of time and adds a lot of monotonous walking.

I really did.\n\n*Damn Vet's with squeaky voices keep sniping you at safezones (which every few hours are not actually safe) and weapons drop points.\n*Tribes was supposed to encourage team-play. So far, not so much.\n*Perma-Crappy-Death. I like the idea of that, but I don't actually like it, at least not here, not in this implementation of a game.\n*Nether that can be outrun - if you sacrifice everything and end up out in the open... snipe. gg.\n*I love the idea of a more 3D world than Day-Z (by that, I mean it's got more vertical elements to it - high buildings).\n*I've had this game for a long time. They changed some stuff in a a recent update. Turns out it's pay-to-win now.\n*Screenshots of well equipped teams working together.... I only ever saw that once, on my 1st day in the game.

Then tell all their players about it - especially us, the disappointed leavers. It will fill up, 1st day. They will go "Oh crap this is popular" and it will be 90% PvE Servers within a week. Either that, or they will keep Their current vision alive until it dies this time next year from lack of funding... Because the "Community" (mostly 13yo ♥♥♥♥♥ beaters) will keep killing off the newbs that would keep coming back - the newbs with the money. Don't believe me? Look at the community. Most of the actives have a max of 10 games on their accounts, 4 of those being CoD. Go figure. The people writing these reviews are the ones that have 100-400 games on our accounts. Where do you suppose the money is? Why, it's leaving to find a game with PvE servers, of course.\n\nIf you want the full gripe-sheet, just keep reading the other comments.

I've never been one to enjoy or understand the enjoyment of killing people you have nothing to gain from. I've played plenty of DayZ and Rust and these games wouldn't be the same without PvP in my opinion. But those two games seem to do something that Nether has never done for me. Give me hope. Both of those games are full of dread, am I going to survive my trip to loot things, is someone going to bring a backpack full of C4 and blow my doors in and take everything I've worked so hard to collect? But they offer the chance, that slight beautiful chance that you could possibly survive and thrive in this dark, and terrible place. You do find friends sometimes, who give you a bite to eat when you thought you would die of starvation so you might make it another day.\n\nThere is none of this in Nether. Nether never offers a ray of hope even for a moment. It is simple devestation, from the game play, to the game's programming. You'll die before you get anything worthwhile, probably 10 times over. And then when you find that shiney new rifle and you think now you'll be able to live a little longer you fall through the road, or get stuck in some random spot that doesn't make any sense at all.","October 31, 2014","false","2.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Do you like being shot to death 2 mins after you leave the safe zone by other friendly players? Do you like not free to play, pay to win MMO'ish games (that can only seem to support a fairly low number of players per server) where you can buy fake currency with real currency to buy life saving items like melee weapons, health water, gliders, backpacks,  clothes and character emotes (like dancing, gesturing etc)? Do you like droppimg those things on death for assumedly any one to raid (you get to keep your clothes if you are wearing them and I assume the gestures)? Do you like losing all your levels and recreating your character everytime you die? Do you like delivering boxes through empty desolate (but also very pretty - the graphics in this game are nice) landscapes? Do you like a total lack of worthwhile NPC dialogues or character from you NPC's?  Do you like a minimal variety in your monsters?  Do you like not being over inundated with too many servers to choose from (not many left).  Weird glitches when ever you go through water (being able to live under water, having watery distortion follow me while on land)? Then this is the game for you, otherwise take the above in to consideration.\nIt's not that Nether is actually bad as such it's just the over combination of factors can leave a bitter taste in a new players mouth.\nThe landscape looks breathtaking when you first log on to it (although it is difficult at first to determin what you can interact with and at what angle you need to be on in order to get the vehicle or whatever to give you the option to do so) though variation is a lacking.\nThe people all look a little like characterless mannequins (players and NPC's alike) however what few monster desgns there is do look good on close inspection if a little derivative. The monster noises are also quite good if repetitive. From the trailer and from playing the game  it seems to want to deliver what we love from the Last of us (minus the scripted parts), Borderlands series (minimal RPG elements), DayZ (survival with teleporting fleshy monsters things instead of zombies) and Minecraft (the reliance on item crafting).\nIt makes for an interesting soup of ideas that sort of works but at the same time sort of feels like it misses the mark.\nIf you have a crew of players I'm sure you can get more out of this, though I suspect  that most of the fun will be had fighting against other groups of players for dominance of the map (though it has to be said that there are a host of other games that can offer this same experience or better).\nIf you want to try this solo, this game may try your patience.","December 28, 2014","false","2.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

All in all I am HIGHLY disappointed with this game. It had a ton going for it but you're told nothing and expected to know everything and survive.\n\nLet me start with the Game itself, You're essentially a courrier that is tasked to take packages from Point A to Point B and earn rewards for doing so. Keep in mind, when you first start off, you're only armed with a butcher's knife so if you die you'll be stuck with that as your only weapon. I have no problem with this except for with the fact that the main safe zone is occasionally attacked and vulnerable to monsters who can then spawn in the zone. If this happens you have to fix the Anti Nether machines in the zone to restore it.\n\n"What's that? You want to know what the machine looks like?" The game says as you're suddenly surrounded with only a knife by enemies that will kill you in 4 hits "♥♥♥♥ if I know, figure it out yourself" is the last thing the game says before you die and you lose all your collected items. So you're essentially in a situation where you're constantly outmatched against enemies when you first start out.\n\nUnless the Devs decide to overhaul everything then I would stay away from this game unless you enjoy getting screwed over constantly or just like an insane challenge.","January 16","false","11.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","4"

Even if you die the game invites you to try it again, death won't weight on you heavily like in dayZ, you'll just start again your journey to survive loosing a 10% of the cash and all the xp's you collected (but you can rely on shops to access your global inventory where your valuable loot is stored). At the end of the journey, after a few days of gameplay, (10), i realized that NETHER is much more balanced and way funnier then DAYZ or many other survivals i tried, (Rust, 7 days to die, Planet Explorer, Starforge just to mention a few), focusing more on pvp and exploring elements,(like in DayZ), but encouraging you to team, (so funny played in teams), less in crafting, game's still going to be improved, there are fresh ideas in the game, included the chance to drink a potion that transforms you into a nether, i'd give a 10 out of 10 if it wasn't for the bugs issue.\n\nas a keen game-survivalist as i am my personal temporary rating in terms of fun at the moment would be:\n\n1: NETHER\n\n2: RUST\n\n3: 7 DAYS TO DIE\n\n4: DAYZ\n\nTrust and give it a go!","April 4, 2014","true","327.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","11"

A map with locations which you can waypoint to, to take on missions. Bugs, and monsters, 'nethers' for you to fight off with your butter knife ... an ultimately death .,..\n\nIts a game which you learn through death ... i was losing interest due to the lack of scavenging ... i've looked everywhere and found squat.. on a server... not even an old gun without amo, a tin of beans. But when i played singleplayer I lucked out and found some good weapons fast, so there are probably different drop rates / settings between servers.\n\nThere's a few servers, with a few people on them so its ok, i was thinking for the price to lan play it if nothing else ... Scavenging is hard and realistic.... The more you put into this game, the more you get out of it. For a buck worth a try i guess... and its just a case of learning the actual gameplay mechanics before losing interest.... then there is tons of content, just not some of the mechanics im used to being a 1000 hour arma 2 dayz vet.\n\nThere is a single player campagn as well, you will find it at the top of the server list. Works ok, found Nether hoard almost straight away which was fun. Just played it again, quickly found a 'surging' hoard of Nether's ... when they surge .. its like they teleport in right next to you ... the fighting is realistic with realistic damage inflicted and recieved. Over time my health recovered. Killed a couple ... also found a bunch of weapons at the top of a building, in some metal crates ... Its panning out to be a lot of fun.\n\nwill update as i put time in, but for a buck or even $5 not on sale its not a bad deal really","December 23, 2015","true","1.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's a great concept and it works for most of the part, but there's one thing that completely kills the experience.\n\nThe Pros:\n· A fun crafting system that'll allow you to craft weapons from weaponparts you've collected.\n· The Nether mutants look disgustingly good, which gives them an additional sense of threat.\n· Knowing that both other players and Nether mutants could constantly be watching you will keep you alert and immersed. Nether mutants will teleport behind you and challenge your skills in combat, whereas other players can gun you down at any given second (except when you're in a Safe Zone). I found that this shift of threats kept me adjusting and finding new tactics.\n\nThe Cons:\n· The open world is linear and rather dull. The detail of overgrowing vegetation and crumbling buildings is gorgeous, but there's so little loot that there's no real purpose to search for it. Just kill some Nether mutants and sell their spines and blood to buy things you need, or kill other players and make good use of what they dropped. Dozens of old stores and abandoned cars, but rarely is there any loot nearby. The world is like a delicious cake, but it's filling is pure mud. Everything feels like a useless prop rather than being part of the world.\n· The community kills the game... literally and figuratively. If you spawn, you have the option to spawn in a Safe Haven or just in the world. If you choose a Safe Haven, chances are you won't be able to leave it. Other players are constantly covering the exits and entrances of Safe Havens, leaving everyone who comes out look like a sitting duck. Plus, nine out of ten times, the loot dropped by killed players won't even be picked up. If someone's running over to grab it, he too gets shot, and so on. This literally wastes a ton of what the game has to offer. The objectives will have you delivering packages in a Safe Haven, but it's pure suicide.\n\nThe Visuals:\n· Gorgeous lighting, stunning detail and disgusting Nether mutants. Nether is a visual beauty.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n· Nether could be one of the top survival ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes currently out there, but its community and poor delevoping choices make it merely a dumbed-down shell of what it could have been. Fun is to be had though, as long as you're on the good side of the gun barrel. 6.5/10","June 9, 2014","true","1.8"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

Playing on a crowded server can be very dangerous. Though it is hard to say wihch is a bigger threat, the Teleportang-sound-attracted-Nether, or The Humans Killing the Teleporting-sound-attracted-Nether. The first time I was ever killed by another player, I had already teamed up with another player, and we were going for a loot drop zone (which was suicidal but we were a bit greedy at the time). When we arrived I spotted someone and we hid for almost 20 minutes. Then we went out into the fog, which we crouched in for no more than 2 seconds, when suddenly, out of no where, my friend in front of me is shot and killed. Somewhere out there was a man with a Sniper, I had no idea where though! So I ran for cover and went prone only to have bullets shot inches in front of my face, I could even see dust fly up where the bullets had gone into the dirt. Sadly, I panicked ( HEART RATE 100,00!!!) I got up and RAN! But was shot and killed.\nTIPS!!!:\nRemain alert!!! Shoot first, ask questions later! More fun with friends. Listening skills are key! as is vision. It helps to wear headphones for "surround sound". Make Friends when possible!. STEALTH!!! This is a GREAT game, I can't wait to see it released complete.

They held my friend hostage and told me if I don't give them all my stuff, they would kill him. Naturally, I did. But like the ♥♥♥♥♥ they were, they shot him and I took off running. I didn't give them my pistol because they didn't know I had it. I opened fire on them. They shot back and hit me, I was down to 70 HP. My friend was dead and his captors had all our stuff. Eventually, one of them caught me. He and I looked eyeballs. He looked right into my face, and as I looked into his. I almost for a second thought he'd let me go.

This can not be denied on any level. Many of these bugs will irritate you and sometimes hamper a game experience for a fair amount. But what you have to realise is this game IS NOT a finished product. It's released as a premium game (no longer alpha/beta on steam) because if i recall (95% sure) due to legal / development restrictions, and changes the devs wished to make in the near future.\n\n~~ Pro's: ~~\n\nOne of the only survival games on the market I know which still becomes a challenge when in a group of 3-5 players. This is a very rare achievement of any survival game. Take a second to think of the titles you know, and i'll bet there will only be maybe 1/2 others.\n\nOpen world but not to the point you spend 3-4 hours grouping up with your friends. You can pretty much enjoy the experience from the word go. (Has a map system etc for quick location)\n\nCurrently the game is receiving a lot of attention from the devs (i.e. VAC support, Map extention - twice its original size, playable Nethers, Tribe system, Territory control, Tribe reputation system and A Crafting system All added I believe within a year)  -  forgive me if my timeframe is a touch out.\n\nRPG elements. You have a character level, and an account level. as you go through your time in the game performing certain tasks or doing particular actions will award you with EXP (also selling items) this EXP will go towards your account level and character level. Long story short, if you die your character level goes back to 0 (max 31) but your account level will remain. Now at first it seems "oh right if you have max account level I have no hope of survival" however this is not the case, the bonuses are noticable but not game changing. Which surprises me greatly as having this system and trying to keep an equilibrium of balance amount new and old players, isn't an easy task.\n\nFreedom to play how you like. Now for me this is a must have for any Survival game or multiplayer game, to let the players dictate their own style of how THEY want to play the game. If you want to sneak around the wasteland and hunt players? particular tribes? wage a war? that's your call. Or wether you want to try help people or just amass a crazy amount of firepower? play it pretty much strictly PVE. Go ahead.\n\n~~ Cons: ~~\n\nAs previously mentioned, yes it is buggy. The vehicles added (now I believe only available from one location) are pretty much unplayable and I have to say now I never see feature (driven around) which is a shame, but I can bet my bottom dollar this will change.\n\nHacking, this can become an issue, but hell. It's an onlineFPS game. with 10years of Counter-strike behind me through its many stages and with what you have played, this will always be an issue (since the VAC update, the amount of hackers I see is very few thankfully)\n\nIn game currency. Now this is a really touchy topic, in game currency does not hinder my experience in any way. I only put it down as a con because quite simply, I dont agree with it as I am sure many others also do not approve. But it is strictly put in place for cosmetic things (i.e. some outfits, masks etc.) in no way does it give me an advantage over the next average Joe in the Wasteland. (also to note I would say 80% of whats buyable via the in game currency, is also available via the free in game money system)\n\n\nThat pretty much sums up the most important things i'd say you may need to know. To summarise for those who want to play an FPS survival game, very atmospheric, and doesn't lose substance despite playing as solo or in a group, which is easy pick up and play with a nice implementation of RPG elements. Then I recommend you give it a shot.\n\nBut as before, if you buy this title expecting an already done finished and polished product, then you've come here to early.\n\nOtherwise I look forward to seeing you in the wasteland :)","June 24, 2014","true","302.3"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","5"

An open, large, urban landscape with items to scavenge for and monsters to be wary of. And not to mention, other players to watch out for.\n\nAnd on the other hand, the other players are absolute ♥♥♥♥♥. Unlike DayZ, the people who play Nether tend to be more childish and instead of Bartering deals and murdering only for the sake of safety, they kill to just kill anything they see. It becomes harder for new players or new characters to get settled into things.\n\nAnother issue is the looting. The items are not found in drawers, beneath tables or any sort of hiding spots. They're floating above ground and illuminated by God's light. Now, yes that makes it easier to find, but that then means they have designated spawn points rather than truly being scavenged items.\n\nAll in all, rather than a survival MMO, this basicaly has the feel of a large world Unreal Tournament death match game. You run, pick up items, find money, buy weapons, and kill other players. You do this for the entirety of the game with lack of true Survivalism.\n\nEither I only had this experience because I've played mostly by myself, or this truly is how the game is run.\n\nDisappointing, 4/10.","December 1, 2013","false","7.2"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","19","35","0","1"

I remember, as I started playing last year, we only had the options of looting and doing package runs, so walking from one outpost to another. Since then, we got a map two times as big to control, tribes (think of factions in WoW) to join and fight for, a new looting system, escort missions, permanent account levels and many more options to trade. After 220 hours, it never gets boring, because the whole game gets overhauled every few weeks and new stuff gets added. I would fully recommend this game, even if it would be just for the content to come. At this state, we got a few nasty clipping bugs (and I can't use my flashlight for the last 2 months) but it gets better every update :)","May 10, 2014","true","243.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But i ll can t make an objective critic about this game.\n\nThis because kill an another human being is pretty hard, they have auto rifle or they re so desesperate they try to kill you with the beginning knife. The looting and the roaming in the map is fun but it don't work with my skype or teamspeak, so the fun just disapear when you re dommed to speak alone, fight alone, die alone.\n\nThe Pk is common and everybody do it. I'm not an angel, i tried too, but i'm not verydone for that and my lone pvp kill is on a poor knife guy attempting to cut me in half. The Pve seems to be fun, but, the knife or most powerfull contact weapon have their limit with big big things. And the problem with guns, is the noise they do, just you didn't want occur, others players heard that and go kill you without any reason. It seems if devs added a rabbit orphanage where you ll have to bring stuff, people would make it always, saying... But man, it's a feature, it s why i do this all the time !

Now Nether does have Safezones and it doesn't take long to find a weapon or food, making it easier than DayZ or Rust.

As I munched, I heard a thunderous roar outside of the gas station where I sought refuge.  A man was being beaten to death by a hulking purple monster. "Should I help him?" I wondered to myself.  But, I was too late already, the man was demolished in mere seconds, and the beast walked away.  I looted his bag he left on the ground and found myself some nether skulls.  Traded them for a pistol at the local cult store and went on a hunting spree.  After killing about 6 nether creatures, i took pause to eat an energy bar.  Bullets rained down from above me.  next thing I knew, I was down to only a quarter of my health.  I saw my attacker, but I only had 1 bullet left.  I snuck through the bushes to get a better shot and BAM!... I missed!  He however saw where I shot at him from and returned fire, clipping me as I ran.  He chased me down several city blocks, that is until I finally lost him.  My luck then turned and I found a medkit and some bandages along with more food.  I stopped off in a nice little apartment building and observed the sun setting outside.  *STOMP STOMP CRASSSSHHH!!!*  A hulking nether appeared behind me, and I ran down the stairs as fast as I could.  I could see the safe zone just down the road!  and who should show up but the man who had shot me before.  A swift dose of lead to my skull cap ended me right then and there.  I guess no matter how many times you cheat death, It catches us all in the end.\n\nOverall point: Nether can be and is a great game.  I bought it for $2.99 and love it.  May not be worth $15 however.

I remember, as I started playing last year, we only had the options of looting and doing package runs, so walking from one outpost to another. Since then, we got a map two times as big to control, tribes (think of factions in WoW) to join and fight for, a new looting system, escort missions, permanent account levels and many more options to trade. After 220 hours, it never gets boring, because the whole game gets overhauled every few weeks and new stuff gets added. I would fully recommend this game, even if it would be just for the content to come.

At other times it just kicks you out. Your inventory can be a little buggy too which is frustrating when you're kicked and then all your ammo disappears. The terrain needs some work as I tend to get stuck on small differences in height, I've been stuck a few times, and there are some gaps that really you should be able to get through but instead you just hit an invisible wall. Also annoying is the fact that there are no PvE maps, and it only takes one aggressive player to ruin the experience for people like me that like to stealth around the monsters and aren't interested in griefing. Once these issues are resolved I can see myself spending a fair bit of time on this. For today at least, my server has either frozen or kicked me three times now so I'll wait a bit before I try it again.","July 14, 2014","true","10.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are many ways in and out of a safe zone and any route could be taken, althought some safe zones are limited to 2 entrance/exits such as the camp in the north. thats what sprinting away really fast is for and also you must make sure you are aware of your surroundings and not just running into a bunch of nether creatures haha xD imo most of the stuff such as pvp, trying to sneak away from safe zones etc is what makes this game intense and adds to the environment and fun of the game. leveling just adds to the tension as it makes you not want to die so you can keep all the perks but it only helps a bit and doesn't make you invincible. you need to try and enjoy the game without triyng to take out all the fun, try and get someone to play with. it's even better when you get a full inventory full of stuff you just found and ending up in a gun fight in the middle of no where with another group of survivors LOL. everyone wants to survive and tensions are high which makes people trust others less as they are scared of dying and losing their levels and equipment.\n\nBut when me and my brother played, it didn't have the group system or the other updates which i've seen in the updates, but there still was a negative to killing just anyone as if you killed a lot of people, you would end up attracting a ton of nether which would just literally tear you apart no matter how geared up you are. unless of course u had lots of stamina and one of those nether bombs to throw in a different direction or one of those machines that make nether creatures flee for a little while.\n\nReally they should add more stuff like a roaming boss as i don't currently like that reaper thing that sits in the middle of no where in a random park in the north. they should have a large slow roaming creature which would add so much tension and excitment into the game. and it could also create a small area of fog around it so it cannot be seen very well from a distance. oh how that would be amazing! and also it could grant a decent peice of equipment or something for the people who helped slay the beast but ofc that shouldn't be easy. so much things could make this game better.\n\nI have nothing against other peoples opinions as this is just my own opinion of some and i respect your opinions.\nBut i find this to be an excellent game which could be so so much better\n\nBut anyway this game is really not friendly to those who honestly play alone. you should definitely grab a friend or someone trust worthy to play with and atleast have voice communication with. When getting into game, you should always expect some sort of pvp encounter unless you are lucky to avoid such things but they are always quite fun if it ends up as a group war,\n\nItem spawning is terrible as some have said, needing food and health and not getting any while still loosing it in a safe zone is just rediculous but then again force you to go out and look for items to survive on. there should be something such as go out and kill some nether and depending on how much nether you kill, you get a reward for going back into a safezone or even just going back into the main safe zone as there is a large shortage of supplies for people just getting into the game. maybe even some supplies for a first time visit into the main safe zone just to help someone who has nothing, but won't give to those who have obviously stored food and health supplies into their bank.\n\nThere can be so much going for this game yet. maybe in the future this game would show its true colours and what it can do and hopfully a great game like this doesn't go to waste.","March 24, 2014","true","41.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This makes sense because it feels like half a game. The mission list is quite limited. You can:\n-Scavenge\n-Make deliveries\n-Join a tribe and capture territories\n\nAnd thats about it for missions.\n\nOther things you can do:\n-Use the global inventory to store your spare katanas so you can restart your game with a game breaker\n-Make guns\n-Hunt things and trade bits for xp, cash, and supplies, which can than use to survive longer, hunt more, get more things...\n-Buy junk from a shop that largerly breaks the game by making exceptionally powerfull melee weapons cheap.\n-Buy cosmetics from a shop\n-Kill other people\n-Explore the large, empty, incomplete landscape\n\nThere are microtransactions, but it's not overwhelming, and you can pay with in game money as well, and money in the game is very easy to come across, so, of the many game breakers found within the game, actuall money is not one.\n\nThere is no real story, and you don't feel like progress is being made no matter what you do.

As I munched, I heard a thunderous roar outside of the gas station where I sought refuge.  A man was being beaten to death by a hulking purple monster. "Should I help him?" I wondered to myself.  But, I was too late already, the man was demolished in mere seconds, and the beast walked away.  I looted his bag he left on the ground and found myself some nether skulls.  Traded them for a pistol at the local cult store and went on a hunting spree.  After killing about 6 nether creatures, i took pause to eat an energy bar.  Bullets rained down from above me.  next thing I knew, I was down to only a quarter of my health.  I saw my attacker, but I only had 1 bullet left.  I snuck through the bushes to get a better shot and BAM!... I missed!  He however saw where I shot at him from and returned fire, clipping me as I ran.  He chased me down several city blocks, that is until I finally lost him.  My luck then turned and I found a medkit and some bandages along with more food.  I stopped off in a nice little apartment building and observed the sun setting outside.  *STOMP STOMP CRASSSSHHH!!!*  A hulking nether appeared behind me, and I ran down the stairs as fast as I could.  I could see the safe zone just down the road!  and who should show up but the man who had shot me before.  A swift dose of lead to my skull cap ended me right then and there.  I guess no matter how many times you cheat death, It catches us all in the end.\n\nOverall point: Nether can be and is a great game.  I bought it for $2.99 and love it.  May not be worth $15 however.  But as a side note, I have over 100 Hrs. on DayZ standalone, and this game is still quite unique and fun in its own way.  8/10","June 23, 2014","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Aswell with DayZ, you will be slaughtered by teamates, and die by the zombies that no one seems can fix. But as for Nether, its as if they programmed it using a module from 2001. I mean the backspace doesnt even work when trying to make an account. How can you miss that!!! Thats even built into the calcualtor in the accessories. Not only that, but when loggin into the game, all seems good, besides the fact that the chance the game will actually work is 1/20. Considering the moment it launches it crashes, freezes your computer, or the mouse just doesnt appear. Once in game ur fine, enjoy, but getting to that point is almost impossible. So trust me, dont get any more early access games, the game has been out for almost a year, and still nothing. I can say the same for the DayZ Standalone, nothing has really been changed or modified. I mean, the zombies still run through walls, and attack you from 20 feet away. Its a simple fix they dont crack own on, just program them to basicly act as if they were a player... not being able to noclip through every wall. So trust me, it seems alot of these early acess games have been abandoned for a while, so please dont waste your money! And for the forrest, good luck trying to play that game.

If your dumb enough to run into a safezone will loot without scouting or covering your back you deserve to die. I have yet to crash from an engine error and had no issues connecting my steam account to my nether account. As for features, guess what? THEY WORK! This game has a grouping and faction system so you can find your friends with ease. Hang gliding is awesome and you can find dirk bikes to drive (yes omg a vehicle in a survival game jaw dropping). I have not died from a stupid bug or glitch like fall damage or walking through wall's zombies. The games graphics are very well done. As of now the games eating/drinking mechanics are very basic, you eat you drink your happy. Player/Account skill don't seem to be to overpowered at the moment in PvP, but are very handy in PvE. A couple of issues I have had are being able to walk though some object, maping for walking around is a bit buggy in some places, and some gun noises dont seem to work when swapping. Yes I have been ganked from just outside of the safezones, but since then I have learned and have yet to die from the same means. Nothing seems to be completely game breaking like a few other games of its type *cough cough*.\n\nIf you can't handle the harsh environment of a survival realism game or can't adapt to its play style maybe you should stay in the safezone. These games try to be as real as possible but you people still have to relize its a GAME it has to be fun, if its real to the point where its just like an apocalypse im sure no one would have very much fun.

After some looking into it I was glad to see there being a global inventory so you can save something between lives. The game looks pretty good and it’s refreshing to see it in an unreal engine which meant movement was really easy unlike dayz. It is also more straightforward to understand health and consumables than in dayz.\nHowever, the cons for me make it unplayable:\n\n	You can spend a good while transferring a package from one safe zone to another and make a small amount of money, however if you die a fair percentage of your money gets taken from you, this accumulates greatly after a few deaths from just trying to leave a safezone.\n\n	That brings up the campers, endlessly I have left a safezone only to be immediately shot from god knows where.\n\n	The game does not let you see ‘killcams’ of any sort, so you really can just die and have no idea why.\n\n	I have seen a few other players sprinting around the map at ungodly speed which I’m sure isn’t a perk or upgrade of some sort, so the game is completely unfair.\n\n	You can finnaly be enjoying yourself to be shot down by another player\n\n	All the nether creatures I’ve come across so far can all teleport around you making killing enemies a little crappy and unskilful\n\nOverall if these problems persist even with many updates I don’t see the FUN in playing this game.\n","November 26, 2014","false","6.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Lots of ingame items you'll eventually be forced to buy. Yeah, I guess you don't have to, but the game is very empty without them. Nice graphics, but they're gross. Everything is covered in overgrowth, everything is gloomy, and not attractive to me what so ever. It's like someone stripped the beauty of Crysis 3 out of it, lowered the resolution of all textures, then let out an explosion of green diarrhea all over everything.\n\n\nAlso, I don't like the idea of running around for 6 hours, getting a shotgun with no ammo, running around for another 4, getting two slugs, running around for 3 hours more looking for something, and then I get ♥♥♥♥♥ by another player and lose what I have. If it wasn't another player that did this to you, there are overpowered aliens that you need a gun and lots of ammo to kill. These things are everywhere, and I mean, everywhere.\n\nStoryline isn't that great. It's honestly..     one of the worst I've played.\n\nJust go buy Rust. Rust is much, much better.

Especially if you spawn on the map at night and you go into the subway. Everything is dark so that you can barely see, the music is aggrieving, you hear nether screaming from above you and maybe gunshots from other people defending themselves against other nether.\n\nI like the scavenging in this game, you can enter pretty much every building in this game and the fact that loot is... at least most of the time relatively common. At least in terms of food and melee weapons.\n\nThe little side-quests in this game are fun. You basically go to a safe zone, you pick up a package that you have to bring to another safe zone. If you do that, you get money and lots of xp. That's a pretty cool feature, because that way you actually have a goal than just "surviving."\n\nThe only negative point i have is the pvp system. I mean yeah, it's a survival game, but as soon as you find other people outside of the safe zones, 90% of the time these players have either a pistol or a rifle and 99% of the time they are hostile and shoot on sight. As i said, i understand it, because it's a survival game, but it's massively pvp based and pretty much everyone is hostile. I think i have encountered about 7 players outside of the safe zones and every single one of them shot on sight.\n\nAll in all i enjoy this game. The atmosphere is awesome. Fighting nether (especially with pistols) is a lot of fun as well as scavenging the area for food, weapons or ammo. I would definitely recommend this game.\nBut as i said: Be aware that the game is heavily pvp.","March 12, 2014","true","100.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are graphical bugs here and there, but they are working on them from the looks of it. Sound is also good too, and extremely important to surviving in this game, both are tweakable to optimize your playing experience.\n\nThe gameplay itself, is very geared towards a certain audience, the high stakes of death will keep you feeling nervous in your gaming chair, and trying to keep calm and smart is as important as it has ever been. You will die, probly a lot, and you will lose everything you have on you every time (there is a storage system. It is limited, but anything you put there is always safe there untill you take it out) so if your easilly angered or just need that feel of progression in a game, this is probly not for you, as there is no storyline, only surviving, and starting over when you fail. There are also various events you can do around the world, such as escort missions or capturing locations for your tribe.(your team, basiclly) Though limited, they can be a nice way to take a break from your normal routine.\n\nAlthough you would think that a crisis like this would bring humanity together, in this game, 95% of the players you encounter will try and murder you, mostly just for fun, so it would be strongly advised you start this game with real life friends and a chat program, or you may miss out on a good portion of fun due to looking at respawn screens.\n\nA huge part of this game is searching the world for things you need to survive, whether it be food, gun parts, ammo, healing items, or things to sell to a vendor for cash to buy other usefull items, you will find yourself scavenging buildings for a good portion of your playtime, so there is a lot of exploring. The rest of the stuff you will collect for various reasons is Nether parts, which you get by, you guessed it, killing Nether, giving combat against the creatures purpose.\n\nThe combat in this game is pretty simple, you got melee weapons, which do what you think they would, block and hit, and guns, which of course go pew pew, Unfortunatly the simplicity of it carries over to fights against the ai and doesnt leave them as entertaining as you would hope, but its not too boring, just slightly repetative, since enemies typiclly behave the same way everytime you encounter them. Players on the other hand, are where the fear comes in. Players camping buildings with high powered rifles is extremely common, and though there is a tribe system to encourage teamwork, the slightest hesitation can be the difference between walking home with more ammo, or not walking home at all, making player interactions typiclly difficult. My personal oppenion, go in with a real life friend or one you know you can trust, because making friends in this game is very challenging, due to the trust issues survivors tend to have.\n\nOverall, id say this game has greatly improved. There is now healing over time when your food meter is filled pretty full, so you always have a chance to come back after a good scrap. The map has doubled in size, and appears to have the option to do so again in the future, the looting system is fixed so you can bust into those crates and dumpsters to get your goodies now, and i have yet to see hackers since they got the VAC going. My biggest complaint about this game would be that it has a team system, but when you see other players it doesnt show their name or team until you are almost touching them, a distance that you will NEVER get to with another player before they unload on you, almost making the whole system pointless. This game is still defenatly for certain people and not for others, but if a survival simulator with high stakes and no pushy endgame to work toward is for you, i think its finally time to say, your gonna like this one.","January 6, 2014","true","87.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","51"

I don't have hundred of hours poured into it, but I have owned and played it for over a year atleast. It's not a long haul game. Atleast not to me.\n\nTo me the fun is in logging on every now and again just to see how long you can survive. The atmosphere is creepy. The monsters are scarey in sounds, appearances, and in how they fight you. It has a perma-death feature so once you die you loose all of that characters items and stats and must start over with a new character(though you can re-loot your old body if you're quick enough). You also have an account level that is constant. It takes a little longer to level up but grants bonuses to your character when you start out. This does provide some longevity to the game.\n\nHowever, eventually the atmosphere gets dul and you adjust to the sounds of the monsters and it becomes less scary/creepy. Maybe this game is meant to be more survival oriented, but the horror atmosphere adds a lot to the game. Once you get over it, however all that was added is lost. It is a FUN game. Don't get me wrong. The only tasks to do though are running errands. Your goal, most of the time, is to run boxes from one outpost to another and stay alive long enough to see how many runs you can do.\n\nThis game is fun until it isn't. It's not that it's a bad game. It just fails to keep your attention(or atleast my attention). If it had a more obvious plot line and relevant missions it would be solid and I would play it for hours at a time. Maybe the point of the end of the world is to be pointless, but until then It's a game I will gladly play and enjoy playing for a few hours every month or two when the atmosphere feels fresh to me and I forget how panic inducing the monsters can be.","March 2","true","13.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Human beings being what we are, the rush of players from Steam has now turned the game even more deadly, and with the developers' parallel commitment to increase the number and deadliness of the Nether, there isn't anything to do except put on a couple pieces of bread and become someone's sandwich.\n\nIt is disappointing: I was learning techniques, enjoying the map and the systems, starting to stockpile some goods... Now, I have been killed so many times -- first my high level chars and then unable even to get launched again -- that I will abandon Nether until there is a general exodus from the game because it near unplayability unless you have friends in a death squad.\n\nI guess I don't understand a mentality that is just focused on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and pillaging everyone in sight. The developers also need to keep playing this game themselves -- or better -- to watch some player teams and see what the experiences of players are. I'm not a noob. I've got over 20 hours in the game, have watched  dozen hours of video, and have long gaming experience. But, trying to level is now like swimming with a million dumb carnivorous fish that hunt in packs of 2 or 3. I hate to lose a good game because of a stupid gaming community. It happened in Guild Wars, and it rules in Nether.\n\n*** Previously Written About This Game Before It was Screwed ***\nI've just finished my 10th hour and I've discovered what this experience can be. Boy, what a trainer on survival this is! I just had a run of 3 hours without dying and am currently an official BA until something kills me later. Staying well fed via convenience stores and gas stations, and avoiding Nether critters every time I see their smoke. I avoid safe zones when they are under siege as if they were The Plague--they instantly becomes hives for monsters and marauding players. I've learned that this game is a blast when you start to "get it" and your pockets are full of gun parts, and you come out of a functioning safe zone well heeled. At its worst, the game is simultaneously frustrating and addictive, a bad combination, sorta like a sexy girlfriend with personality disorder. Death can come continually. When the safe zones fail, which they do too often (check my screen shots)  and suddenly you turn into burger. You learn that most players in an unsafe safe zonekill anyone they catch. Then again, you may also have a hoard of Nether invading through the same gate you're leaving through. At that moment, kiss your grits goodbye: You're toast...even if you've been magical enough for two hours to have a shotgun. But, if you can learn, you may eventually get some success in courier runs, manage to stay alive for a while, and your levels and goodies start to stack up -- never forgetting you can still die in a heartbeat. Then, you feel glad about what you managed to accomplish this time ... but, dang, when you buy it because of one skilled PvP bandit or a pack of leapers, there go all the plans you had. Simple truth is, I'm writing this end of June 2014, and the devs have some more work to do. If life were as fast and deadly as Nether, there'd be no people left. There's some terrible clipping stuff, and a brutal learning curve. You'll have to google for the chat and voice keys -- for some reason, they don't show up as controls. Plus, if you end up West of the streets, the open spaces are almost pointless at this time -- neat buildings with nothing in them. But, with all these negatives, I can't quit playing and the environment is beautifully done. It's an intense, driven experience, with a simple RPG system that's fun, and an interesting little economy. But, you may quit to play something less likely to provoke you into running over pedestrians or kicking your dog when you're finished. Good luck!\n\nPS -- By the time I had 15 hours in, I was able to play another 4-hour stint without dying and was level 32. But, let me tell you how savage the PvP is here: One player sent me a tribe invite, and two members of that tribe immediately began using my newly displayed map position to converge on me! Wow! I dropped the group as soon as I saw them converging on me and they chased me for blocks. What a chase! As I said, this game is a trainer in survival, and you will learn to run / crouch, run / crouch. Have fun, if you've got the heart!","June 26, 2014","true","76.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

I checked the map and saw a loot area, so I went there. A weird guy only wearing underwear I saw on the way started following me, and when I got to the loot area he just sat there watching me grab everything. I gave him a bag of crisps. I adopted him as my new pet. 10 seconds later a big gorilla thing killed him. I took revenge and mourned his loss. Then some guy shot me in the back of my head...\n\nbest first 20 minutes I've ever had, 10/10 would like my pet back.","April 7, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Aswell with DayZ, you will be slaughtered by teamates, and die by the zombies that no one seems can fix. But as for Nether, its as if they programmed it using a module from 2001. I mean the backspace doesnt even work when trying to make an account. How can you miss that!!! Thats even built into the calcualtor in the accessories. Not only that, but when loggin into the game, all seems good, besides the fact that the chance the game will actually work is 1/20. Considering the moment it launches it crashes, freezes your computer, or the mouse just doesnt appear. Once in game ur fine, enjoy, but getting to that point is almost impossible. So trust me, dont get any more early access games, the game has been out for almost a year, and still nothing. I can say the same for the DayZ Standalone, nothing has really been changed or modified. I mean, the zombies still run through walls, and attack you from 20 feet away. Its a simple fix they dont crack own on, just program them to basicly act as if they were a player... not being able to noclip through every wall. So trust me, it seems alot of these early acess games have been abandoned for a while, so please dont waste your money! And for the forrest, good luck trying to play that game. And i doubt they will fix that for another year... or two!","June 24, 2014","false","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Enemy hit-boxes are misleading for melee attacks and guns appear to send bullets flying at odd angles to the direction of the barrel, at though the bullets all have ADHD or something. Trailers and hype seem to encourage players to spend most of their time killing eachother for energy drinks and bullets, but I didn't seem to have exceptional trouble staying supplied. While unfinished, it may be a better game in the future, but for now Nether probably isn't going to turn a whole lot of heads.

Granted, I didn't do much research into it and assumed it was your regular FPS RPG. Not really relavent but hey.\n\nAnyway, I then noticed it again while it was on sale and impulse bought it because I thought "why not". Honestly, I wish I had read reviews and looked into it more as the reviews you read are true.\n\nThe game as a whole feels very unfinished even though it quietly came out of Early Access who knows when. I started not knowing at all what I was supposed to do, with a really badly set up tutorial which didn't help me at all, so I ended up not knowing what I was doing by the end of my first session either. I got past the tutorials and onto exploring, which just seemed pointless to be honest. Granted, I've onlt played just over an hour but I seriously doubt playing any longer will enrich the experience any further.\n\nAlso, if you join a server with more than fifteen people on, you just get stuck in spectator mode and can only fly around doing nothing. There's also your classic problem of everyone losing any moral understanding of life and just shoot other players on site, irrelavent of the fact co-operation against a greater evil is probably a more fun option.\n\nI don't know why the devs haven't put any more work into it as I believe it really had potential (maybe it still does), but in it's current state I really can't recommend it. I probably won't even play it again until I here someone give it good, reasonable review.\n\nGraphics are good. There also might be some other hidden gems to add to a 'pros' list which I never discovered.

Many people compare Nether to DayZ. In my opinion DayZ pales in comparison to Nether which is far more action packed and has way better graphics and enemies. The map in Nether is great and you are never bored, unlike in DayZ where you spend hours on end running around only to be sniped from above. Now Nether does have Safezones and it doesn't take long to find a weapon or food, making it easier than DayZ or Rust. If you are new to the survival genre or think DayZ takes too long or is too hard, I highly recommend this game.","June 28, 2014","true","59.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Beware, this is almost certainly still in a testing phase.\n\nMy first launch was alright, and I wandered the wasteland until promptly being killed by another player. No big deal, I play DayZ as well. People are always ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. But then I selected the option that wasn't "Change Character" which promptly removed all menu options and controls. I had to exit with CTRL-ALT-DELETE. All further attempts to play the game have ended in failure. I can no longer get past the menu screen.\n\nA couple of friends bought it with me, one of them couldn't get past the menu screen, and the other was able to get past server select after it eventually started responding again. This took roughly 2 minutes.\n\nAnother minor annoyance: When making an account it will say "Login name already in use" or something to that effect. What it really means is "Display name already taken". Misleading, and very annoying.","June 24, 2014","false","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Granted, I'm not into survival mo's but this one is fun for a few days until it gets old. It's pretty much the same, live, die, repeat. The other problem is that this game was never really completed. The game is laggy, buggy, glitchy, full of hackers, and the world is incredably small and the gear you find can be great to absolute crap. They tried to add interesting things but by the time you get better gear your dead and its all pointless. Plus the main point is that the devolpers never fixed the obvious huge flaws the game has which shows that the game was a useless model to begin with. This should have been a free to play game, it is not worth a buck. The only reason I have it is because a friend bought it for me to play together and even he admitted that the game sucks.

All your invested time and effort into obtaining the most basic foothold in the world is squandered with a single mistake and it's back to square one with an extended middle finger in your face.  I really wanted to participate in pvp, but I don't see the point if your skills and gear get wiped on death, you barely get any action in a firefight before you or the other guy has to go off, grind up skills again and try to get something halfway decent to fight with. Then there's always the chance you'll get capped from nowhere, then you have to try to regear and grind up skills again...I understand that this is supposed to be a survival game, but come on.

Some parts of the game are great while others are incredibly lacking, and in the long run the negatives far outweigh the positives.","March 14","false","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is abosolutely great. There are it's good things and bad things, but every game has that. I will get into detail.\n\nI love survival horror games, and this is my favorite game of all. The map in INCREDIBLE for this type of game. It's a big open city that has been apsolutely trashed and demolished like it would be in real life. The map is small right now, but it is in early access so I'm certain they will expand the size in the near future.\n\nThe RPG features are pretty sweet. You can level up your character in 6 different skills at the moment. There may be more levels and skills to be added later on but at the moment there is Melee, Guns, Stamina, Surival, Stealth, and Strength skills. I have not yet been able to level all of them up completely as I end up dying when I'm near level 14. The whole RPG style is great, I can't wait to see what they add later on.\n\nAlso, I LOVE how people can't mass murder other players in this game. Well, they can but if they do there is consequences. Everytime someone kills another player, there is a blood meter that pops up in the bottom right corner and tells how many people you have killed. The higher the number, the more creatures and stuff can "smell" you and come after you. So, if you are a mass murderer in video games, I'm sorry to tell you this.\n\nI highly recommend getting this game. I rate this game an honest 10/10.  Pros and Cons below\n\nPROS:\n\nPerfect Map\nNot as much Mass Murdering\nGreat RPG System\nPretty big map\nScary creatures\nAwesome ways to make money\nSafe Zones\n\n\nCONS:\nThe global inventory doesn't have much space in it, I think it has only 20 slots. Seems like a lot until you get in game. (EDIT: THEY FIXED THIS)\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading my review, please get the game, you won't be disappointed!","February 5, 2014","true","73.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

From pictures and some videos it looks like this game would be great, as if it would have an I am Legend sort of feel and it does, it is just poorly executed. For one I would much rather prefer some sort of enemy or zombie that is just there in a world instead of randomly spawning out of who knows where and who knows when, it just never made any sense and wasn't alot of fun. I didn't like the fact that when you die you lose everything, it didn't bother me in Dayz because it felt more like a Walking Dead you better watch your back and who you trust esque game. But this just wasn't like that. Instead of safe zones I wish they could have made it where you have some sort of safe house where you can discover, or build yourself and upgrade (Board windows, set traps etc..) safe zones honestly seemed really stupid and uncalled for, the sense of urgency and need to survive completely goes away not to mention vendors weren't all that great. The graphics were pretty sub par as well as the overall controls. Overall the premise of the game itself just wasn't very interesting. I never felt like I was working toward anything or working to improve my character, loot or my safe house.","September 27, 2014","false","5.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The Devs were too greedy and instead of having an amazing end product, you have a bug ridden world that doesn't promote anything fun and welcomes hackers. The most fun i had in this game was the exploration - hidding with my rifles in the tall grass avoiding other players. Searching for loot that would potentially keep me alive. But in the end, we all die and the frustrating part is to start all the way over losing all your gear. To buy new gear you can spend "gold" which is obtained via your credit card. Its the easiest way of getting the best gear - or you just spend the in game money (which you would lose 45% of it upon your death...). After sinking a bunch of personal money into the game, they revamped the inventory system causing me to lose my gear. All my money that was put into the game was for nothing. Maybe I'm a bit to bitter, but there definately isn't enough depth in this game to make me forgive the loss and I'm honestly not willing to spend anymore time with the game unless there are some major, major improvements.","October 2, 2014","false","64.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

As a player of cut-throat PvP titles like DayZ and Rust, Nether's PvP system scares me. As a player entirely new to the game, dealing with dozens of blood-thirsty demons rampaging after you is enough. I'm sorry, but standing in a "safe zone" when the "safety" turns off and getting bludgeoned to death by a mob of trolling, crowbar-wielding noobs just shouldn't be a thing.","July 14, 2014","false","0.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gnomelock/recommended/247730/","gnomelock","Ancallan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gnomelock/","305 products in account","So, Nether. I initially picked this up and played it during the beta and would not have recommended it then (as seems to be the general opinion, judging by the Early Access reviews).\n\nMy two major complaints were simple. First, the movement felt wonky and made gunplay in PvP feel incredibly odd. Secondly, it was hard to be immersed in the atmosphere when most things were decorated with nothing but trash bags. If you've looked at whether or not I've recommended this game, then you might surmise that these issues were rectified.\n\nThe game does have its issues, no doubt. However, what's really doing it for me is the atmosphere. There is a lot of detail, a lot of tall grass to hide in and plenty of places to hide from enemies. As far as post-apocalyptic survival goes, this does it for me.\n\nLet's go over some of the main points!\n\nSafe Zones\nThere are zones in the game that are totally safe. You cannot kill people in these zones, you cannot even bring up your ironsights. This very well might put some people off of the game, especially those wanting an experience similar to DayZ or perhaps Rust, where you want PvP all the time, anywhere. However, I appreciate the difference. It's nice to come back after a courier mission and take some time to relax and plot your next action.\n\nThis is made a little more interesting by the fact that these safe zones periodically... well... become unsafe. You can kill people, you can kill invading monsters. Watch your trigger finger... or keep an eye out for someone that looked at you funny early on.\n\nSurvival Aspects\nThis game is not detailed when it comes to survival. You need to eat, you need to drink, you need to keep your health up. You won't bleed out, you won't get poisoned. It keeps this aspect of the game simple. If you've eaten enough food, you regenerate health slowly. Very slowly. But it is a nice reason to stay well-fed.\n\nYou'll find yourself scavenging for foodstuffs, weapons, ammo, cash. You'll kill monsters and get their skin, claws and skulls. Honestly, if you're after something super-detailed here, probably not for you. But if you don't mind the simplicity and just want some reason to eat food while hunting for people/monsters/etc., then it does the trick.\n\nMonsters and PvE\nRight, so there are monsters in this game. They're called 'Nether', but that always makes me try to come up with some inappropriate innuendo. Either way, what is the AI like? Not great, but surprisingly... not bad. They'll run at you, they'll call for nearby monsters to help and... they'll teleport and try to get behind you -- yes, teleport. It's a thing they're meant to do, not a buggy weirdness. They can chase you fairly effectively, handling the inside of buildings well enough to pose a threat and even able to climb stairs after you.\n\nOn their own, they're really nothing to worry about. If you have a knife, you can likely kill one no issue. It's when they're in groups that they're a danger. But there's more than just the AI to worry about once the shots start ringing out as you desperately try to cling to life...\n\nPvP\nOutside of safezones, it's free reign. Kill whomever you want. The game has a mechanic where you can join a 'Tribe'; pick one out of several colourful, but standard, apocalyptic factions and fight for them to take territory and earn rewards. Don't worry -- you can still kill fellow tribemates! There is a reputation system that discourages you from doing so and wanton fratricide will see you kicked out from your tribe.\n\nThere is an interesting mode of gameplay I'm fond of. Playing AS one of the monsters. You can buy a potion for relatively cheap (with in-game money), drink it and get the option to become one of the creatures. Some clunkiness to be had here, you have to log out and log back into the server, then choose your character as a monster. Monster mode, however, is fun. You don't lose anything on death, you're fast, you're nimble and you're practically blind. It changes up the experience in a way I quite enjoyed. What I like most about this is that you're always left wondering if the monster over yonder happens to be a player... and if they have a pack of friends.\n\nOh and you can group with friends pretty easily, if that's something you like to do.\n\nOverall, PvP is perhaps limited when compared to other titles. You won't be kidnapping anyone and sacrificing them to volcano gods, you won't be forcefeeding them bleach. But you will be feverishly glancing up at windows and wondering if someone is watching you.\n\nLevels/Progression\nOne thing that puts people off is that you can gain levels, build your character... then you die and lose all the hard work. The developers have mitigated this with an 'Account Level' system. You get perks that persist... nothing huge, but nice perks that give you some overall accomplishment. The game keeps track of your overall PvP and PvE kills, which is a nice touch. Thankfully, rebuilding a character is not a massive undertaking and you can get the primary perks you want in an incredibly short amount of time. Does this maybe kinda cheapen it for the more-hardcore crowd? Maybe. I don't mind it and I have other games to get my hardcore gaming cravings satiated.\n\nIssues\nSo, there are some problems. I don't feel it's gamebreaking, but it's worth noting. Technically speaking, the graphics are nothing special and perhaps a bit dated. I feel that they make up with this with a great deal of atmosphere -- this is something you'll have to decide on your own after checking out some videos or screenshots. It might be a little hardware intensive for what you get.\n\nSounds can be a touch funky. Especially underground. You're never sure if the gunshots you hear are just around the metro tunnel bend or... actually just above you on the street level.\n\nTerrain can be odd. There are cases where you're moving over some ruined rubble and you suddenly start levitating in the air. Like, way up. You continue on and you find yourself sinking into the rubble. Odd stuff like that -- thankfully, it's not the norm.\n\nThe UI is... mreh. Kinda funky. Backpacks don't 'equip', you have to just have them in your inventory. And sometimes you have to drop them and pick them back up. The skill menu doesn't tell you exactly what stuff does, so you end up having to look up what the mysterious %+ boosts are actually doing as you level up your Survival skill. Similarly, crafting suffers from odd menu stuff as well... functional, but not pretty.\n\nConclusion\nAll in all, I just wanted an atmospheric survival game in a post-apocalyptic setting. And yeah, this does that pretty well. Honestly, the atmosphere is just fantastic by my reckoning. I would compare it to a bit of Metro 2033 mixed with DayZ's openworld PvP. It has issues... but it has a lot of fun, if you're a fan of the setting and the genre. Will it last you in the long run? I'm planning on playing it for a fair bit more, at least. I think it's worth a shot and can keep you entertained for a good amount of time... and that's something I definitely would not have said for it in Early Access.\n\nIf you've tried it out before, it might be worth taking a second look.","June 11, 2014","true","18.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Nether has a good theory behind the design, but the game's execution does not take into effect the inherent tendency of many gamers to grief, troll, or all around twist the gameplay mechanics to their liking. As a player of cut-throat PvP titles like DayZ and Rust, Nether's PvP system scares me. As a player entirely new to the game, dealing with dozens of blood-thirsty demons rampaging after you is enough. I'm sorry, but standing in a "safe zone" when the "safety" turns off and getting bludgeoned to death by a mob of trolling, crowbar-wielding noobs just shouldn't be a thing.","July 14, 2014","false","0.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its VERY similar to WarZ. Controls don't feel quite right. I play on ultra and have a gtx 780ti oc but graphics/textures/weapons/characters look like a 2004 game. Increasing the draw distance to MAX doesn't give you less fog (too much fog) it only cuts out distant buildings. Textures spazz out. When you get in the water...i dont know what happens. Maybe it's toxic. Either way, it's too glitchy to know if water is toxic or glitched. Feels like the WarZ guys put this game together quickly to cash in again on the survival horror genre. It's Early access, but I don't think this game can get better unless it's redone. If you must try it for yourself, I recommend not buying the chosen or belieber pack. Get the cheapest watcher pack.","April 27, 2014","false","2.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I took a box from point A to B, then another from B to C, killed a few basic NPCs, and got some basic starter loot as a result. There wasn't actually a tutorial, just some tool tips telling me I could craft a gun or sell things I didn't have to nondescript merchants scattered about. One of them gave me a crowbar. I got excited to use it but for some reason, I couldn't actually equip it. Disappointing. When it was time to start playing for reals I left the safe area, found and killed an NPC...and then just I died for no reason as I was collecting its loot, with all of my hard earned tutorial loot falling to the ground. Did a player kill me? Was it a bug or a fluke? Did the game not like my attitude and mark me for a summary execution?\n\nI don't know the answer and I'll be damned if I'm going to open the game again to find out. The sad part is that the concept and environment seemed cool, but none of that matters to me now. I don't think I can be bothered to play the server-list-waiting-game again just to have a chance at randomly dying.","June 25, 2014","false","2.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

On day 2, they responded back to me telling me to do what I already did, which didn't help (open Steam and the Nether launcher, version 24 or later, and they'll autoconnect). On that same day, I e-mailed them back my SteamID like they asked so they could link the game to my account. It's now day 4, and the game's still not working for me, no response from support.
