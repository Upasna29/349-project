Smudged Cat Games have created a game with heart, intelligence and a mansion-load of well-applied ideas.You'll get their money's worth and more with this game. A puzzle/platformer that's not only challenging and addicting, but also adorable, Adventures of Shuggy is a title that gamers of any age and ability are sure to enjoy.If you're a fan of games like Super Meat Boy and you're looking for some interesting twists to the platforming genre, The Adventures of Shuggy is worth checking out. Smudged Cat's first entry in the big leagues is a promising start, and has me excited for the studio's next project.A short campaign is the only downside of this otherwise amazing platformer.","June 27, 2014","true","63.5"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","1"

It has a lot of content. At release, there were already a single-player campaign and a few dozens of co-op levels, but a free DLC was added that adds new single-player levels. All in all, there are almost 200 levels to play through (156 solo and 36 co-op).\n\nOverall, the difficulty is well managed; some levels will prove to be challenging but none are impossible to beat. I was rarely frustrated by my failures as they were never due to a broken mechanic but rather to errors on my part. Level completion is timed, so you can compare with other players through online leaderboards. It took me about ten hours to complete the single-player levels.\n\nAs for the art, the visuals are cartoony and well-done. Cutscenes are present in the form of comic strips which complement well the game's graphics. The music is enjoyable, though it becomes repetitive by the time you've completed the game.\n\nTL;DR: Buy this game, given the price you don't have much to lose.\n\nIf you want to read a more thorough review, check out my blog post[gaming.jlcdk.com].","January 14, 2014","true","12.1"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldfrog/recommended/211440/","coldfrog","coldfrog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldfrog/","386 products in account","I got this game from a free key and am glad.  I would not have been happy paying for this.\nThe game isn't incompetently terrible or anything, but it lacks focus and originality.  The only really original thing in the game is the rope which has some pretty interesting uses, but I would have been really happy if they had built a game around that mechanic and explored it deeply.\n\nBUT ANYWAY.\n\nEvery aspect of this game feels thrown together fairly without thinking about the other parts.  There are a variety of level mechanics that are in the game, but they don't seem to tie to anything beyond what the designers wanted to make that level about.  The visual design is not bad but basically is just a pasted-on theme on the same kind of levels.  Level progression is weird and unclear - finishing levels unlocks other levels, but there's no real clarity on which levels will be unlocked next, nor is there a sense of progression necessarily.  One level might be extremely hard, but it might unlock a very easy level.  Some levels are challenging only because they are incredibly long and, since one hit kills, you have to redo the entire level when you die, which can be tedious.  (there are maybe three or four levels I can think of that stand out as poorly designed this way)\n\nThe music and sound effects: again, just functional, but for some reason there is a sound when your character lands (I finally figured out what that noise was!), the gem-collecting sound is exactly the same every time, no modulation at all, and the music is mostly in tune with the game, but one particularly goofy-sounding song (the main theme in fact) just did not seem to fit at all.  I would not be at all surprised if the songs were just public-domain tunes that they used because they were free.  (still nothing WRONG with that, just a more effective use would be nice).\n\nThe controls are kind of floaty too.  I mean, I think that's intentional because you have a cape and that's kind of floaty (also this is a mechanic later, surprise surprise) but sometimes momentum seems off, and lets not even start on the different sized characters.\n\nOne last note - if you don't do the levels in the order they want you to, you might show up in a level with a mechanic you're not yet familiar with and have to figure it out yourself.  Not too bad really, but poor design nonetheless.\n\nI mean, there's nothing that really makes this game exceptionally bad, but nothing that makes it very good either, and in fact I feel like it turns out to be less than the sum of its parts, simply because it is put together in such a way as to feel disconnected and just bland.\n\nI don't really know why I finished all the levels.  I guess getting it for free makes me feel some kind of obligation or something.  Whatever.  I would say that if you have to pay money for it, pass.","August 1, 2014","false","4.2"," 32 of 52 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","32","52","0","0"

Adorable little bat...thing Shuggy inherited a mansion from his uncle, but it's all haunted and stuff. To get the place in order he has to collect gems (it is ALWAYS gems) through more than 100 puzzle rooms and beat up some equally adorable bosses along the way. It's standard fare for a puzzle platformer, but what makes Shuggy shine is the variety in the puzzles. The devs took every gimmick they could think of short of an actual portal gun and mixed them up to round out the rooms. There are rooms with low gravity, reversed gravity, rotating gravity, rooms where you can fly, clones you can switch between, time travel, a personal teleporter, and my favorite, the magic rope. The rope trails out from a box in the room and you can use it to tangle up machinery, swing around like a monkey, and other neat tricks.\n\nIn addition to the 100+ puzzles in the base game, there's also a fully separate co-op campaign and an additional level set that gives you an extra teleporter on top of the other gimmicks. All this comes in a charming package with sharp, colorful graphics and some sweet jazz accompaniment. It hooked me hard enough to finish all the levels in the base game and try my hand at the achievements, some of which are surprisingly challenging. For the money, it's well worth your time if you love adorable platformers at least half as much as I do.","September 10, 2015","true","4.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

It's not that it's a bad game, just that it's an average game in a sea of much better games.  Shuggy is a platformer with a couple of unique tricks.  Unfortunately, it's marred by terrible controls that just feel off/ slippery.  The number of times that I died not because I did something wrong but because the controls failed me added up to a lot of frustration.  While the teleporter levels were fun, the timer levels were like pulling teeth.  Add in the resolution problems that this game has, and I was already on the fence.  The tiebreaker for me though was the fact that every single time you exit this game, you are presented with an ad for one of the developer's other games.  If you hit the wrong button, rather than exiting the game you are taken to the website for the game in the ad.  I'd just like to point out that a game I paid money for in Steam acts like a game I got on mobile for free :S  Not cool.

The entire section of local coop levels is a nice addition too.\n\nSome of the other reviews talk of lousy keyboard controls, I cannot vouch one way or another because I used a USB Xbox 360 controller and it felt well suited.

It's just forgettable. The game has bite-sized levels ala Super Meat Boy, but where Meat Boy rewards a continual progression of skill Shuggy throws a lot of new gimmicks at you and never devlops any of them. Some levels require platforming, some are puzzly, and while that sounds good on paper most are so simple you just pass right through them first try. You don't need to play most levels to beat the game so realistically you can finish off the final boss by the hour mark. There are 100+ levels and I cleared them all (barring the local only co-op) in roughly four hours. I rarely felt like I was being asked to explore the mechanics in a meaningful way.

There's plenty of challenge here, in the mould of some of the older NES games - albeit not quite as tough - with the most fragile vampire outside of Twilight. Shuggy has a variety of tricks at his disposal to help negotiate through the levels, and these assists change depending on the level. Teleportation, rotating the level itself, ropes, multiple Shuggys and even time travel are options open to you throughout the game.\n\nThe genius of the game is that it challenges casual players, but is also designed around making life difficult for speedrunners. Many of the hazards seem to clog the optimal quickest route through a level, so if you want to replay levels and go for your best times, you'll appreciate the quality of the level design on display here. Throw in a very fun local co-op mode and a bunch of additional teleportation levels, and you have a game that can certainly keep you occupied.\n\nSmudged Cat have made a bit of a gem.

Adventures of Shuggy is a simple but challenging platformer that has a huge amount of levels for you to work through.\n\nThe controls are solid, sometimes feel a touch floaty but it's quite easy to adapt to. There's a good 20 to 30 levels per room, and you need to complete at least two-thirds before you gain access to the boss level and then unlock the next room. Each level has a gimmick associated with it; being able to rotate the entire level or sections of it, clones that spawn and carry out what you did within a specified time limit, rope machines that allow you to swing down and even up through levels, embiggening/shrink potions etc. They keep it fresh and as you advance you're expected to tangle with more complicated variants.\n\nOn a personal note I just got sick of the game; I loathe time-clone platforming and I am particularly awful at it ('sup Gateways!). It's probably best played in short bursts rather than trying to slog your way through in a single shot.

After taking the first few steps in the game it shows that it really feels like a port, the menu can only be navigated with the arrow-keys and although the ASDW-keys are responsive in-game the Enter and Ctrl buttons are used and it feels kind of awkward, although this doesn't really hinders you in-game but it is something to get used to if you don't change the settings.\n\nThe game:\nThe levels/rooms are nice and small and the game consists out of multiple worlds/locations, almost every room has the same objective which is to collect all the green diamonds but the way you do it varies. In some rooms you can rotate the level, in others you go back in time a'la Rose and Time, help the npc's, take so called Shmu's to the other side of the level since they can unlock cages etc. The game has a lot of variety, music fits perfectly, good effect's and is quite addicting.\n\nVerdict:\nAfter my first play session of about one hour i rate it a 7,5/10, the music fits perfectly, the style is great, gameplay varies and later levels need a lot of thinking to complete. Although this is a port it doesn't really intervenes with the game accept for in the menu and when you use the default controls.","December 11, 2012","true","1.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Obviously this is not a full review, but just meant to share an experience of someone who played the game until they no longer wanted to play it and quit playing it.\n\nThe controls felt a bit off to me, making me feel like I'd rather play Mario or some other platformer instead. Getting nearly all the crystals in a level and dying is frustrating in a bad way (as opposed to something like Bloodborne). What made me quit was a level where the character stands sideways and gravity is flipped 90 degrees, but you have to press up and down to control him rather than left and right. Usually I like flipping levels like this, but just found it disorienting.\n\nNot a bad game, but didn't find it to be a good one, either.","May 11","false","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The music are annoying after a time, you can still mute it in game. The levels are wide and unique, and the puzzle are unique too. That's why the game is great !\n\nThere is plenty of gadgets, environments to use in many levels such as : teleporter, block of stones, rope... The are also several powers : several shuggy to switch in a level, turning the level of 90 in wanted side, unlimited jumping, zombie walking, time traveling and much more !\n\nBut you need to know that the level have the size of the stamp, meaning that some ennemies (rats..) and some environment (spikes, spiky balls, some plateform) are very small so it can be stressful to find your way through them. Also, as I said it, the co-op is only playable in the same computer with a keyboard.\n\nTo talk about the issues I got (*) :\n\nThe first achievement didn't unlock for me, for an unknow reason. Well that was the only issue about the achivements.\n\nI disabled the steam cloud, then started the game and reseted my save file to have the last achievement.\n\nWhen I got it I closed the game, turned on the cloud and started the game. Was so suprised to see that the game didn't synced my savefile, so I ALT+TAB to turn off the cloud and close the game. I tried another time but the game crashed on startup and then synced the new file instead of the perfect savefile.\n\nSo if you wish to do that, I would recommend you to make a back-up instead of doing what I did.\n\nThe save file is in the steam userdata folder.\n","March 12","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's actually not half bad? ...you sure? Huh, so it is. Adventures of Shuggy is a puzzle platformer whose main attraction is many stage gimmicks. One stage may have you rotating the entire stage, another one may have you teleporting all over the place, another may have you be zombified so that you can jump and only jump... there's a lot of gimmicks. There's a lot of stages as well; 112 stages in the main game and 40 extra in the teleporter-focused mode. Out of all these levels, there were only seven or eight that I felt were legitimately kinda terrible. Fortunately, there's a lot more than that for levels that are really quite clever with, y'know, actual puzzles.\n\nThe platforming itself isn't bad, and in fact there's really only one complaint I have about the platforming, and that is inertia. Shuggy actually has a lot of inertia, meaning that you can very easily end up falling off of a ledge due to your own inertia. You can kinda deal with it after a while, but it's still kinda obnoxious even once you get used to it. Another thing that could be a problem for some is that Shuggy is actually pretty dang fast. There is a bit of precise platforming here and there that could prove tricky for some due to how fast and how inertia-laden Shuggy is, but it never was the top speed that gave me any problems.\n\nThere's also boss battles in the game, although they're more akin to boss battles from a game like Donkey Kong '94. I did quite like all of the bosses, and they all took at least some thought and careful planning to defeat. Again, they're, y'know, actual puzzles. It's hard really to talk too much more about this game's gameplay, as the core mechanics are quite simple, and the complexity of the game comes from these gimmicks. There was one gimmick that I enjoyed only about half of the implementations of (Shuggy temporal cloning) and one gimmick that I didn't like at all (wall-crawling Lemming carting around). Apart from those two gimmicks - and they're largely toward the beginning, so if that's causing you duress, just push through; it gets better - I had a great deal of fun with this game. Some other reviewers mentioned a lot of waiting around, but honestly; it's not all that bad. Unless you have super-ADHD, it's really not going to ruin your day. Unlike a lot of puzzle platformers, I can see myself coming back to this game in the future. For $5, it's a great deal. For the $0.49 I picked it up for during the Winter 2013 sale... that's highway robbery. 8/10.\n\nStory: There's not much, really. It's all told through a faux-comic book style presentation. It's honestly not worth rating, as it for the most part stays on the backburner for the gameplay to shine through.\n\nGraphics: It takes a bit of a hit here for two reasons. Reason one is that this game either windows in 720p or fullscreens in 720p. The portiness of this game is quite obvious here, since the 360's maximum resolution for gameplay was 720p. As for the art style... it's alright, but it really does have that "XBLA-look" to it. I'm not the best at pinning this sort of thing down, but I think it has to do with how the XNA kit handles gradients and sprites in general. It's not bad, but once again, it shows that this was once an XBLA game. Kinda disappointing, honestly. 2/5.\n\nSound: Sound design isn't the biggest deal for this game; it's mainly some obvious sound effects and that's about it. As for the OST, it's not a thing that I'd get to listen to on my own time, but it's good enough in the context of the game. It's a decidedly jazzy OST which is partly why I'm not too keen on it, but that's because I'm 2dumb2jazz or something. If you're into that kind of thing, maybe you'll want the OST for yourself. 3/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 8/0/2/3; 6.5/10. A game with great gameplay design that is unfortunately hindered by some less-than-amazing AV stuffs. Again though, for $5 (and especially for $0.49), this game is a great deal, and will provide you with a day or two of mostly good times.","October 19, 2014","true","6.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The main character "Shuggy" is a little vampire, who inherited an old Scottish mansion full of various monsters. To clean the castle, he has to go through 5 different areas: The Dungeon, The Boiler Room, The Gallery, The Graveyard and The Clocktower. AoS offering over 150 levels to beat, each level can be done in 3 minutes or even faster. In addition to the single-player campaign there is also co-op and “Shuggy’s Teleporting Troubles” - 40 levels with second teleporter to use.\n\n"Easy to play, hard to master" - that's how I can describe this game. I would recommend it to casual and hardcore players, everyone should be happy. I completed AoS without any troubles, even tried to master one level (3rd place in "Rappel" in The Gallery at the time of writing this). “Shuggy’s Teleporting Troubles” was a little bit harder than single-player campaign, but also didn't take a lot of time to beat it.\n\n4 euro is cheap for this enjoyable game, but I recommend to wait for sale, when you can get it for only 50 cents (ATTOW developer giveaways free copies of it).\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nPS.

Some levels, required to see THE END screen, are so small and simplistic it makes you re-check the game info (was it addressed to elementary school?) while others are annoyingly difficult with nothing in between. And believe me that's the worst kind of difficulty there is. You wait, wait, wait... make a jump that is not 100% precise, fall and wait for the right sequence to happen again. Annoying and boring - the perfect mix. Rarely it challenges your mind. Most of the time you know what you need to do in order to succeed but game mechanics stands in your way. Too primitive to be called puzzle and with levels so small (one screen - early 80's Donkey Kong style) and actions limited by one ability at the time game lacks drive to bring satisfying action.

There are only two problems: Mosquitos and the time warp puzzles.\n\nDear dev, if you think your game is too easy then adding enemies that move in random directions with random speed to make it harder is NOT the way to go. It makes the game more frustrating, sure, but not more challenging. Solving some of the levels is purely based on luck since you can't predict where those annoying mosquitos move next and sometimes they just hit you like a homing missile in the worst possible situation. Overall the game is relatively easy and thus it's still very possible to solve all the levels, but every level with a mosquito in it is a wasted opportunity for an interesting level since it's just annoying. Unfortunately there are quite a lot of those, especially in the later areas.\n\nThe other problem are the time warp levels where you play with Shuggys from different time zones. This is a really nice idea and works very well, but there is no way to plan properly what you're doing - and that is all this game mechanic is about. If you pause the game the main menu comes up and covers the whole screen, making it impossible to have a look at the level to plan your routes. And you don't know what the buttons in each level do either until you push them, so it's trial and error all the time.\n\nStill, overall it is a good game, which could have been great without these flaws.","April 29, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Thought I may as well try it. I know my play-time isn't much (judging by the amount of levels in the first 2 chapters alone, absolutely dinky), but a review's a review.\n\nNice cartoon puzzle platformer, using multiple gimmicks to help Shuggy (that's you!) go through his ancestor's haunted mansion and collect keys to progress. The art-style is reminiscent of a kids' comic book, although with a certain narmy charm to it.\n\nAs puzzle platformers go, it's a bit more on the "puzzle" side than the "platformer", although that doesn't mean dexterity isn't required from time to time (hello there lava fishies). The gimmicks I mentioned earlier include stuff like a time loop, herding little critters called Shmus into cages to unlock the gems (no idea how exactly that works), or rotating the level itself.\n\nIf you want a relaxing puzzle platformer, this will fit the bill nicely. If you're aiming for a more intense platformer, go get Super Meat Boy.","May 7, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has a bunch of interesting mechanics ranging from fairly standard tried and tested ideas like rope swinging or a super jump to more unique mechanics such as the time travel levels in which an echo of your past self follows along your exact path and kills you upon contact, forcing you to consider your steps so that you can come back later without bumping into yourself, normally with multiple past Shuggys running around at once making it fairly hectic. New mechanics are introduced at a healthy pace rather than throwing them all at the player at once, allowing for a fairly intuitive game experience. Boss levels are also mostly well designed with only minimal exceptions. You will die repeatedly and frequently but rather than cheap, frustrating deaths they can normally be learned from and then avoided. The soundtrack and art style especially give it a lot of character too, and you are not required to 100% the game in order to complete the main story which given the difficulty of some of its hardest levels is a blessing. Overall a fun little platformer with plenty of content and personality.","May 24, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game places you in his shoes as you de-haunt the mansion. The main part of the story in this game is done through cutscenes comprising of comic strips. This does a good job of conveying the story.\n\nThere are a wide array of platform levels of different types, with different quirks to each level, be it time travel, teleporters or level rotation. This wide array of quirks makes for a very varied experience, which does a good job at preventing it from becoming monotonous.\n\nI played using a keyboard & mouse setup. I found no issues here, and the controls are re-bindable as you wish.\n\nThe video overall seems good, but at some points in the level selection area the screen did flash white occasionally. I'm not sure if this was a glitch or supposed to be lightning, it was a bit jarring. However, this only affected the level selection area and did not impact on gameplay.\n\nThe music is very high quality and fits the moods of the different levels well, the sound effects don't go too over the top, which is good.\n\nThere are many different ways of playing this game. There are the main story levels, levels with extended use of the teleporter & co-op multiplayer levels.\n\nI found no game-breaking bugs while playing this.\n\nShuggy is a fun platformer game in the casual horror genre. Give it a go if you like that sort of thing.\n","August 3, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This puzzler pits you as a young vampire who has just inherited his grandfather's problem riddled mansion and it is up to you to fix it.\n\nThe graphics of this game seem reasonably polished although there is not much that's animated besides the main character.\nUnlike VVVVV with a driving soundtrack that kept you playing, the music feels like a bland set of fill tracks that do little for the ears.\n\nI'd like a brief description of the gameplay but I can't get more specific than saying it's a puzzle-platformer because I feel this game suffers from the ADHD of gameplay. There are a lot of mechanics in this game, I mean a lot, and they vary per level and there doesn't seem to be much of a logical progression. More doesn't always mean better and in my opinion this game would be better if it focused on a limited number of mechanics and developed them better. The vast amount of mechanics in this game made the experience feel disjointed. It didn't seem like the levels were too carefully designed as many of them were unsatisfying and some even boring.\n\nIn a level in the third area I found an obvious bug that was very easily reproducable. This bug ended my time with this game.\n\nThis game does feature controller support and local coop with levels especially designed for two players.\n\nIf you are a huge fan of these types of games, and you've exhausted all your other options, you may derive some amusement from this. Otherwise I would not recommend getting this game\n\nScore: 4.5/10","December 8, 2013","false","1.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Not aesthetically amazing, the music is kind of meh, but it's quite fun on a gameplay level. Each level is a rectangular room, most of them able to fit on a single screen even. And there's a huge variety in gimmicks to keep the levels diverse. Plus, aside from the main game mode, there's also a teleporter-based mode and a co-op mode (that, amusingly enough, is entirely beatable with only one player, though assuredly more difficult that way than it would be otherwise.) The jump physics can be a bit wonky at times though, and there's an enemy time (mosky) that strikes me as a bit unfair, often ruining otherwise good levels with its presence.

Shuggy, a little vampire thing, has to collect all of the crystals in each level. Unlike most of these novelty-platformers, where the hero has one power, Shuggy's powers vary between levels -- in some he can teleport, in some he can rotate the room, in some he has a rope. The most interesting are the timed levels: every time the stopwatch gets back to zero a new ghost-Shuggy spawns and does whatever it was the main one was doing for the past 30 seconds; most of these puzzles require standing on 3-4 buttons at once using the ghosts but ensuring that the main Shuggy never collides with his past self.\n\nGraphics are OK, music is repetitive and horrible. Level design is so-so. Difficulty is usually from platforming obstacles rather than puzzle strength. This is a package I should like more than I do, but it's just charmless and soulless.

Shuggy is a darling vampire who inherits a haunted mansion. You collect gems to clear levels, and are obstructed by the usual suspects. Shuggy dies in one hit, but the level restarts instantly.\n\nYou get a jump button, and an action button that sometimes gives you a unique ability. There are some great mechanics, like time-traveling clones (death to meet yourself), a rope for spelunking, level rotation, size changing, multiple Shuggys... and one that made me ROFL. Mechanic introductions and combinations are paced well.\n\nOnce you've beaten a level, you can replay it in time attack mode, with your best time counting down. There are also leaderboards.\n\nThe platforming controls are a little finicky. It is hard to hit the key lightly enough to make small jumps.\n\nThat's a pretty small quibble with a very solid game.

The story is simple, but is animated nicely through several comics. In addition to the story mode, there are dozens of co-op and extra teleporting levels for added challenge and fun.\n\nUnlike many puzzlers, I found the difficulty curve for the main campaign fairly nice and not overly difficult, but still presenting a decent challenge. You do not have to complete all of the levels in a certain order -- you only have to unlock and beat the boss level in each of the five-ish rooms, as well as beating a certain amount of levels total. Of course, its more fun to beat them all. You can try levels again for a better time and to compete against players on a leaderboard, which for the most part doesn't seem hacked yet like many other games.\n\nMost levels after the first few have some sort of "trick" and/or puzzle elements with switches you have to activate in a certain order. Some examples of the tricks are using a rope (sometimes with gears), getting little ball creatures to a certain point, rotating the whole or parts of the stage, and the enemies and a harmful version of you traveling back in time. Other tricks are infinite jumps and long jumps with a hover ability.\n\nTry it out!","January 4, 2014","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's not too long for a veteran player of platformers, but still enjoyable.  The story is light and silly, but I felt it was perfectly suited to the overall feel of the game and the general difficulty.  Probably a decent entry level puzzle-platformer as well, particularly since you aren't required to complete every level, you can pick and choose and skip those that stump you.  There's definitely some mild challenge for the veteran as well in completing all of the achievements, which I completed in less than 8 hours (except for the multiplayer one).\n\nOverall: I'd recommend it if you are either new to puzzle-platformers and want to give the genre a try without the punishment of games like Super Meat Boy and They Bleed Pixels or for completionist veterans.","January 11, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The movement mechanics are slow and sluggish, deaths (level restarts) are quick and unforgiving, levels and puzzles are somewhat uninspired.  I was surprised by how good of ratings this game got after installing it and playing with my family for about an hour.  Almost felt like I was playing an old black and white, hand held Tiger game for a minute there.\n\nI'm just not sure who the target audience was for this game. It's way too difficult for younger kids, but much too basic and repetitive for adults.

I've spent few nice moments playing it. Unfortunately, that's the end of good part. Even if game is quite enjoyable, technical problems with game bothers more.\n\nGame is hard. It's not exactly bad thing, but floaty, annoying controls are. Sometimes you feel like your character goes totally with his own life and you can't do anything because you pressed button for 0,1s too long. And there goes your whole level. Again and again, untill you rage quit.\n\nGame options doesn't give much choices. You can't change anything about graphics, you're stuck with only one, unchangeable resolution. You can change only music volume. Even this feature doesn't work well because if you turn off music in game, while starting game next time, you'll hear intro music at least for a few seconds anyway.\n\nOf course, I can't forget about Alt+Tab which... of course doesn't work too. If you try to use this function, you'll see only one thing - crash message.\n\nGame doesn't support using 2nd screen too, you can forget about idea of watching something in background from one PC, you can only watch your black screen there.\n\nThis part bothers me less, but it's uncommon. Every time you want to exit game, you have to see advertisement of other games. If you decided to exit game, it should be the end, not time for watching ads. They work exactly opposite in this matter - I take care to NOT check advertised games, I don't know if there waits for me more ads.\n\nIf you're extremely bored, you could check out this game, but I don't recommend buying it and wasting time, you can find better platformers around.","September 28, 2014","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While there are occasional frustrations for someone with such meager platformer skills such as myself, an inability to finish a puzzle doesn't prevent you from moving forward in the game. It's a great way to allow players to progress when they encounter a level that's got them stumped. I never needed to look up any walkthroughs to get through any levels -- if there was a level I had problems with, I just came back later, and more often than not solved it the second time around. There's a great satisfaction to being able to solve things on your own and not needing to resort to outside help!\n\nIf you like platformers, and even if you don't, give Shuggy a try. It's an amazing game for the price. I've more than gotten my money's worth, over ten hours playtime at this point, and I'm still working at improving my times. You'll probably get less play time out of it if you're good at platformers, but the game has a lot of appealing features that will make it worthwhile to platformer fans, I think.","April 13, 2013","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've spent few nice moments playing it. Unfortunately, that's the end of good part. Even if game is quite enjoyable, technical problems with game bothers more.\n\nGame is hard. It's not exactly bad thing, but floaty, annoying controls are. Sometimes you feel like your character goes totally with his own life and you can't do anything because you pressed button for 0,1s too long. And there goes your whole level. Again and again, untill you rage quit.\n\nGame options doesn't give much choices. You can't change anything about graphics, you're stuck with only one, unchangeable resolution. You can change only music volume. Even this feature doesn't work well because if you turn off music in game, while starting game next time, you'll hear intro music at least for a few seconds anyway.\n\nOf course, I can't forget about Alt+Tab which... of course doesn't work too. If you try to use this function, you'll see only one thing - crash message.\n\nGame doesn't support using 2nd screen too, you can forget about idea of watching something in background from one PC, you can only watch your black screen there.\n\nThis part bothers me less, but it's uncommon. Every time you want to exit game, you have to see advertisement of other games. If you decided to exit game, it should be the end, not time for watching ads. They work exactly opposite in this matter - I take care to NOT check advertised games, I don't know if there waits for me more ads.\n\nIf you're extremely bored, you could check out this game, but I don't recommend buying it and wasting time, you can find better platformers around.","September 28, 2014","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While there are occasional frustrations for someone with such meager platformer skills such as myself, an inability to finish a puzzle doesn't prevent you from moving forward in the game. It's a great way to allow players to progress when they encounter a level that's got them stumped. I never needed to look up any walkthroughs to get through any levels -- if there was a level I had problems with, I just came back later, and more often than not solved it the second time around. There's a great satisfaction to being able to solve things on your own and not needing to resort to outside help!\n\nIf you like platformers, and even if you don't, give Shuggy a try. It's an amazing game for the price. I've more than gotten my money's worth, over ten hours playtime at this point, and I'm still working at improving my times. You'll probably get less play time out of it if you're good at platformers, but the game has a lot of appealing features that will make it worthwhile to platformer fans, I think.","April 13, 2013","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adhartma/recommended/211440/","adhartma","Your Potential Friend","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adhartma/","356 products in account","This is a puzzle-platformer broken up into a ton of different short levels. The levels each use one of several different mechanics: pressing a button to rotate the level, trying to get little circle dudes to run into boxes, making clones of yourself to step on switches. The constant variation in mechanics gives the game a WarioWare-like feel, particularly in the shorter early levels. Much like in WarioWare, my enjoyment of the levels has varied and it feels like a game that does a number of different things decently rather than doing any one thing well.\n\nPerhaps the worst levels are those with roving enemies. Usually in a puzzly game like this, the enemies follow a set pattern. You analyze that pattern and figure out how to avoid the enemies. This game elected for seemingly random movement, which can lead to essentially unavoidable deaths when an enemy unexpectedly moves into your or traps you in a corner. Thankfully most levels don't have enemies and you don't need to complete every level to progress.\n\nIt is worth noting that while I would call this a puzzle-platformer, the puzzle aspect of the game is much less prominent than in something like Braid. Perhaps only half of the levels have puzzle elements, and those puzzle elements generally boil down to stepping on switches or rotating the level.\n\nThe game has support for an Xbox 360 controller and that is how you should play it. Playing with a keyboard is awful.\n\nThe music is kinda bad and the sound-effects don't add anything. Mute the game and put on your own music.\n\nFor only $5, I would recommend Adventures of Shuggy to anyone who enjoys short bursts of platforming with relatively light puzzle-solving.","February 1, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is time travel, clones, rotating gravity and much more. The closest game would be Braid, but where Braid takes itself maybe too seriously, this game has a very cheerful, humorous approach. The graphics are cute, and the music is in "feel-good" style, reminding circus attractions and theme parks.\n\nThe only thing I really didn't like is the platformer-typical challenge to manual dexterity such games usually present atop their puzzles. Namely, even if you already guessed how a puzzle level needs to be solved, it still can take many frustrating attempts to execute the solution without a mistake to the very end, especially with this game's 1-hp instant death rule. Also the character here has this annoying "sliding animation" which makes him slide for a while after landing on a platform. This may make the simplest task of jumping across a series of small platforms surprisingly difficult to perform for a new player. You either slide over the platform after landing and end up on spikes below, or you try to slow down while in mid-air, press the button to move in the opposite direction, but hold it for just a fraction of a second too long, and end up falling straight down, not reaching the platform you wanted to land on. This inertia is actually not very typical for 2D platformer games and probably shouldn't be in this game at all.","December 15, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You unlock two levels for every level you beat so you can skip some if you're stuck, a welcome feature since some of them are surprisingly difficult.","January 4","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a nice soundtrack, colorful animation, and cute characters. Unfortunately, it seems the developers put too much effort into the visual look and not enough into the actual gameplay. What good there is here is unfortunately ruined by annoying enemies and too much flash over substance.\n\nShuggy's controls are way too floaty and it never feels like he's going to actually respond to your commands, even though he does. Despite having a fairly standard jump height, The vast majority of jumps will have you diving into a platform, getting two pixels of your foot caught against it and losing all forward momentum, then BARELY managing to float up with the rest of your vertical momentum.\n\nLots of minor optimization issues exist here. Every time the level starts, there's a burst of particle effects as all of the enemies and elements appear, but you maintain full control of Shuggy during this time, so it's entirely possible to run into an enemy or spike and die before the level has even fully appeared, which is especially noticeable in levels where death and restarting is not only common, but expected.\n\nEnemies same tailor made to ♥♥♥♥ the player off. There is no way to kill them; they must be avoided, and the developers took careful action to make sure to put them in the most obnoxious place possible. Most of them move in predetermined patterns, so avoiding them is simply a matter of pattern recognition, but the mosquito enemies called Mozzies are the absolute worst. Their movement claims to be random, if the meaning of the word random has been changed to "in the worst possible spot and right up your ♥♥♥ every second they are on screen" and I wasn't informed. Also, they make a buzzing noise right in your speakers every time they get nearby. Lovely touch, developers. Isn't that what everyone loves? The sound of mosquitoes buzzing around your head when you're trying to play a game?\n\nThat's not to say Shuggy is completely without its merits. The real key to this game is the wide variety of powers and gameplay features that change up in every level. Each section of the game  has a different theme and seems to focus on one or two mechanics for most of its stages, but the problem is that there is no rhyme or reason for where or when these powers exist. The stages aren't laid out in any particular order or categorized beyond their visual style, so in some levels you will have an infinite jump, then in the immediate next level you will have no control at all, only being able to rotate gravity. The only indicator of this is a rather obtrusive text box that appears on screen and seems to be more interested in wobbling awkwardly than responding to your spamming of the A button going "Yes, I know, go away!"\n\nUnfortunately, while Shuggy has a wide variety of gameplay mechanics, it never feels like any of these are used to their full potential. In a better designed game, every mechanic and power would be given the spotlight and levels would be designed to showcase all aspects of these powers. Instead, each level seems to be randomly placed, with a random arbitrary action assigned to the Right Trigger, and the developers just decided to roll with it.\n\nBut the REAL nail in the coffin is this: Whenever you close the game, you get an ad. Yes, an ad for another indie game. I don't know if it's by the same developers, but I don't care. This is absolutely inexcusable! This is what pushed the game firmly into the "Do not buy!" category. I already bought the game, and you're going to use it as a platform to sell me more of your crap? Maybe if you focused on making a great platformer, your studio would have a more positive association and fans will actually want to seek out your other work. Shoving it down our throats is just plain offensive.\n\nWithout the more annoying aspects, Adventures of Shuggy would be slightly above average, but when you add in flashy effects that distract from the gameplay, annoying enemies, and obnoxious, poorly optimized menus, it falls into the mediocre-to-bad category. And the ad at the end just clinches it. Avoid Shuggy if you like good games, but REALLY avoid it if you hate pop-up ads.","April 15","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, there are a lot of mechanics. But you only need to deal with one or two at a time in any given level so it's relatively easy to manage.\n\nWhat I liked:\n-Good bang for your buck. Doing everything will take 6-10 hours\n-Variety\n-Almost no downtime. Level resets basically instantly when you fail\n-Decent challenges that never feel impossible. (minus a couple rooms that aim to misdirect)\n-The rare AI helpers will never mess up a level for you. Well done there.\n-Controls equally well with keyboard or controller\n-"Stupid rope" Can use the rope ability to pole-vault and climb flat walls. Not how rope works but fun anyway.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n-Controlling Shuggy takes some getting used to. He has unusual acceleration for this type of game and slides a bit. Caused many a death, let me tell you.\n-Mosquito enemies are garbage with their random homing AI. Many levels that feature them would still be challenging without their annoyance.\n-Smoo levels are slow and boring in general.\n-There's a bug where if you exit the game while in fullscreen, it might not open up properly the next time you turn it on. Play in the default windowed mode to avoid this.\n-Strange lag in levels. It's rare (maybe once in 20 levels) and not persistant but unusual for a game of this type. Never actually prevents completing a level but certainly annoying during an otherwise solid run.\n\nOverall, pretty fun.","January 19","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
