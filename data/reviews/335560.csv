Minimalistic funky graphics with great touches and nods to things like space invader inspired floating jellyfish background ambience, weapons that have sound effects at times that seem like a nod to Defender. (the Nova weapon). Wacky characters. Even the character selection screen reminds me of the Ninja Turtles arcade character select screen (in a way). What seems like a simple shoot-em up quickly turns into "one more game". Great soundtrack by Gloom also. All around great package. Totally reccomend as a party game if you have multiple controllers :D","June 8, 2015","true","2.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","2"

I've lost a few hours at a time playing this one (on multiple accounts).","June 22, 2015","true","3.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It's simple yet challenging.  I believe this came in a bundle, and it overall it put me back about 50 cents.","December 24, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game play is extremely simple.  You can even play 4 player split screen which makes it a must have for us nerds with the large screen experience in mind.  10/10 for the indie game that could!","July 6, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have played the single player yet. ... if you ask me a comparison, I would compare it to the feeling I have while playing Binding of Isaac. You know you will die, but you will try your best to move those extra few inches over last time.","July 9, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But then 2 days later I played it and it was a new game with new levels and nudity in the loading screen. (Flailing ♥♥♥♥♥ and a graphic depiction of slug on caterpillar penetration)\\n0/10 for releasing a game that traverses parallel dimensions and changes completely. Highly reccomended by most Jews.","August 15, 2015","true","2.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"
