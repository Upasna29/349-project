I loved Disciples II, and I really wanted to like the third version, but the longer I played the game the more I kept asking myself "why?" The story is drivel. You have to fully watch the 20 second animation for every spell you cast. The user interface is a completely overwraught, tangled mess. Worse there's no gameplay to speak of. See, all the difficulty is frontloaded. The first ~20 turns are just unreasonably hard, even to a veteran of the series on normal difficulty. Worse, after you level up basically once, you are just coasting on easy mode with an unstoppable army.

At the end, I was just leaving the computer resolving automatically the fights... well, that's not really what you expect from a game.\n\nSo recommended for a short time and as a starter if you cannot bear teddy-bears high-fantasy worlds, but unfortunately quite fast boring.","November 26, 2013","true","32.2"," 49 of 56 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","49","56","0","1"

I pride myself on not resorting to easy modes as a general rule, but this game makes it nigh-on impossible to get past the first couple of enemies on any higher difficulty.  After that point I was disappointed to find I couldn't raise the difficulty, meaning the rest of the game I was auto-battling every fight including bosses with little to no casualties.  The only input I had as a player was clicking from fight to fight, following a relatively linear path until completing the map.  But still, near the end of the game... I may as well see how the (bland and generic) story plays out.\nFinal map.  I'm tired of this game now and just want it to be finished.  I level up my party to their highest ranks but then I ignore all treasure in favour of getting to the end.  I reach the final gate, get a cutscene preparing for the final boss, and...?  That's it.  A script error causes a new objective to come up to destroy the city you just destroyed.  Some say they fixed it by downloading a revised script, but no luck for me.  161 hours of gameplay (half of which was actual playing as I'm afk a lot), only to reach a brick wall at the very end.\nNevertheless I'll be playing the expansion, as I paid for it as part of the bundle, but seriously- don't bother starting the same journey as me.","April 23, 2015","false","161.5"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","36","41","7","0"

Disciples III is a turn-based strategy game, utilizing a combination of point and click movement when out of combat, and a turn-based game grid whenever combat is initatied, each featuring varied terrain. You can play as one of three races; The Elven Alliance, The Legion of the Damned, and The Empire. It seems like an interesting game. The visuals are not bad, and there appears to be a backstory, for those interested in an all around experience. It isn't a bad game by any means, but probably not one I would go out of my way to play. It feels generic to me, but that could be because I've seen dozens of other games all with a similar premise, and varying degrees of similarity in graphics, movement, and style. Disciples III is well done and deserved a thumbs up, but make sure before you buy it, that it is the kind of game you are going to enjoy.","June 1, 2015","true","0.7"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","1"

After I did everything to finish the last level, there was supposed to be a portal to enter to fight the final boss.  This portal did not appear, so the game just left me stuck on the map with nothing that could be done to finish the game.  I got this game in a bundle deal so it we very cheap, but it was a waste of time to play.  You play the same battle on the same battle map over and over as you walk down a 1 way path that has encounters closer together than the old RPGs and you can see the enemy on the map, but you have to fight almost every one since the path is too small to walk past them.  All they did was reskin the battle map and enemies and units on your team and they have you relevel your units each time you get to a new level even though it is super easy because they put in buildings you can click to buff your party and spells that basically let you cheat in game.  When you get to a certain point, you can buy unlimited stat raising items and make an invincible character.  I'm not sure if this was a glitch since on some levels the stat potions were limited, but others they were unlimited.  I also had a glitch on a few levels where the game would freeze if I ended my turn.  I could only play by using editting my movement points so I could complete the level without ending the turn that would freeze the game.  I liked the music and the artwork.  The story could have been good if it was fleshed out more and had longer cut scenes.  The game plays just like King's Bounty or HOMM, but you have single units instead of the moronic stacks that the other games have, so I had hoped this would be the first tactical game on the PC that is similar to the console games like FFT, Fire Emblem, or Shining Force.  All of those game had single units that you developed, maps to fight on that changed shape between levels instead of just randomly laying some rocks and bonuses on squares, and could be played through without a game breaking bug.  Maybe I should give up on ever having a game like that on the PC.  I just wish I had my time back.\n\nDo not buy this game on Steam.  If you get this game in a bundle, save yourself a disapointement, and just never play the game.  Maybe have Steam hide it or file it to your junk games group.","November 22, 2014","false","69.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

Maybe that's my advantage, because so far I like it.\n\nWhat you certainly should not expect is a challenging strategy game of the good old days. This is a dumbed down version with a lot less freedom and strategic variety and you possibly will play the campaign only once and possibly never touch multiplayer at all because the game does not really allow enough strategic options for that and the gameplay by itself is not as compelling.\n\nThat said: what you should expect is up-to-date graphics (with a darker theme than the Heroes series), charming musical themes and a nice story with some twists. The story itself is not new I'm afraid: fallen angel trying to take over the world (again).  To do that the dark overlord needs a "Mc Guffin" that in turn everybody chases after. That's it.\nSame old story of the devil taking over the world that has been told so many times now that it's hard to tell which game is a rip-off of which. However: it's nicely told and has some compelling bells and whistles and twists.\nThree factions are available in three campaigns that build up on one another. Cutscenes (so far as I have seen any) are rare and are mostly zooming in and out of hand-drawn black and white still-images with (really good) voice-over.\n\nOver all the game will keep you busy for a few days.\nIt's not brilliant, it's not perfect. But if you are looking for an entertaining, easy-going distraction with simple (not too complicated) gameplay, it is worth taking a look at. If you are a looking for any more than that, this game is not for you.","January 5, 2014","true","1.2"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","20","33","0","0"

Turn based, somewhat interesting combat, and all kinds of fun mechanics to learn and optimize. Disciples III seems to have precisely one thing in common with the previous games: the name. I guess the turn based combat is also shared, but is vastly different. Indeed, this entire game feels more like someone saw the gorgeous art of the first two, and thought, "Hey, we own this franchise. Let's make more gorgeous art, and redo everything else! They'll come crawling for it!" The only real positive I can say beyond how pretty it is is that I didn't pay full price. The engine is .... stupid. The world economies are 'smoothed out' to the point of being stupid. Now, suddenly, you can only control parts of the world with strategically placed control points: there are no 'holy person's to drop a control rod to annoy the opposition. The inventory system is atrocious (Really?? I have to scroll to the right one column at a time, after I select the right interface screen, just to consume the potion I just got??) as is the advancement system. I'm all for advancement trees, but this is just ludicrous. And the story is .... shallow, to say the least. Oh, and thank you soooooooooooooooooo much Game Designers and Developers for not allowing me to turn off the spell animations. Sure they're pretty once or twice, and I admire them for that. But EVERY TIME???? Come on!\n\nEDIT: Oh, and I entirely forgot! I've watched the CPU's heroes literally walk through encounters to take over resources. Walking through encounters applied to my own avatar, so they could just go about their thievery and bypass me completely. And let's also not forget that not only can the computer target you with offensive spells when there is Absolutely No Way It Could Know Where to Target the Spell, but their low level attack spell does damage AND removes my ability to cast a spell that turn as well. You know, because it's "fun" and "challenging".\n\nTrust me. Save your money and get Disciples 1 or 2. They're much better games.","August 25, 2014","false","44.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/recommended/33670/","Somnambuls","D.Cosmos [lv]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/","233 products in account","I was among those people who waited release of this game with excitement! However, as many other fans of Disciples II, I was disappointed.\n\nI completed the story with the Empire (Humans) and started to play with the Legions (Demons), hoping that I will find something that will get me going, however I didn't. Although the story is quite interesting and I wanted to find out what will happen next, the battles are so repetitive, that I just caught myself thinking: why do I even play this game?\n\nI guess it's faster to just watch the intro in Disciples 3: Resurrection - it gives a pretty good summary of what happened in Disciples 3: Renaissance.\nI feel too much influence from Heroes of Might and Magic V in this game, which, in my opinion, is not a good example of turn-based strategy. I think the developers should have sticked to their own principles as seen in Disciples II.\n\nThis game is not all bad, there are also some good things and improvements, so to be fair I'll list both pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n- Great graphics, although sometimes there are so many details, that it is hard to distinguish objects.\n- Zoom in/zoom out - missed that one in Disciples II.\n- The player has very specific choices about how one can develop his character. I particularly liked that you can develop your leadership up to 7 (and even 8 with specific items). Also transform, revive and other additional leader skills come quite handy.\n- It's much easier to conquer enemy capitals. In Disciples II you had to use whole arsenal of potions, artefacts and spells to atleast have a chance against defenders of the capital (and not always it was enough).\n- Node guardians is a good idea. They are strong and most of the time they are able to defend themselves, so you don't need to worry about loosing your resources and burdensome rod-planting character management as in Disciples II.\n- Achievements. Atleast for me they provide a bit of extra motivation.\n- Thief is a fully-functional leader with initial leadership of 3. In Disciples II, Thief had no leadership.\n- You can carry all you items to the next act. In Disciples II, you could only take five items with you.\n\nCons:\n\n- Battle system is the worst aspect of this game. The battles are long and repetitive. After few level ups, when it's not possible to lose anymore, I think everyone finds himself pressing the Quick resolve button. Also I found the obstacles annoying. They needlessly limit the movement of units. Also I'd rather prefer the static battles without tactical map movement as in Disciples II. Thus the initiative actually had some meaning.\n- No shortcuts, except for Space (End turn)\n- Camera rotation and zoom level in battles also are far from perfect. It's not possible to rotate the battlefield 360 degrees and zoom level is not sufficient - all units look small. The lower corners are almost out of reach. If an enemy is hiding in the right lower corner, you have to turn camera to that corner on every attack to actually perform it. And that is annoying.\n- Sometimes it's hard to find the way, because there are trees or building covering the field of view.\n- Not only spells are limited to once per turn (twice for Archmage), but this limitation apply to whole of the spellbook. In Disciples II, this limitation applied only to a particular spell. So, spells are not actually that important for victory and it's not worth to research them all. Most of the time I used only healing and damage spells.\n- I never had a need to use a thief. I don't actually know what is his special trait. So Guild as a building is useless. Atleast for me.\n- Due to spell limitations and lack of Thief actions, it does not make that much of a difference which gameplay style you choose (Warlord, Archmage or Guildmaster).\n- Also the interface is not very intuitive. It took me about 45 minutes to understand how this game works.\n\nMy overall rating is 5/10.\n\nI think I will return to this game just to enjoy the story and graphics, when I will have nothing better to play. And perhaps my opinion will change. But for now, I can't recommend this game to anyone.\n\np.s. Disciples 3: Reincarnation is out, which is sort of a remake of Renaissance and Resurrection. Perhaps it is better. So if you are considering to try Disciples 3 afterall, perhaps you should buy Reincarnaction.","September 1, 2014","false","36.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

After first being disapointed when comparing to the classic D2 this game rocks and still brings on the table what made original Disciples II + expansions such classic games. 'Good ol' Disciples!' is what a scarred veteran would say.\n\nIf you are experienced with the series you will dislike the tactical map and some bugs/balance issues as the game was rushed to production. Game contains some 'press button to win' -type of strategies but cranking up the difficutly and maybe using some iron man rules will ensure that the AI will beat you so hard your (unborn) kids will get bruises. As is normal to the series. Not kidding here: this game series is known to be unfair. ganking AI, tough fights, extremely hard boss fights is what made D2 a classic. D3 is on the same track but more accessible and easier - if user so wants so no more going through all missions and then getting stuck on the last boss. A very good thing actualy as this part was usualy the last straw before a rage quit in D2.\n\nWhat game newbies should play is harder to say. This game series is incredibly tough on newbies as this is not HOMM.  D2 has no bugs and is extremely streamlined and hard as hell. D3 is easier but with bugs/exploits and easier on the eyes.\n\nNevertheless newbies should expect nothing but hard missions and a very, very unhappy ending once you finaly reach the end of a campaign.

The Disciples series was something of a cult hit and Disciples II:Dark Prophecy was one of my favorite turn based games. The series has always been noted for its beautiful gothic art style that reminds you of Arthur Rackham's illustrations.\n\nThat said the artwork in Disciples III is what one would expect from the franchise. The maps, units, buildings are all detailed well enough. However the gorgeous art design can't hide some of the game's shortcomings when it comes to gameplay.\n\nThe story is ok but the narrator lacks the dark tone that the narrator in Disciples II had. And it ultimately feels like D3 drones on for far too long before you even get into the mission. There is also a distinct lack of the short animated cutscenes that punctuated each mission in Disciples II.\n\nOne change that I do appreciate is that when you equip your hero with items those items are displayed on said hero. Its a small cosmetic change but it is appreciated.\n\nThe new gameplay mechanics have you moving your units on a hex grid which is alright but ultimately does little to add any sort of meaningful depth to the series. Part of what made Disciples and Disciples II so appealing was that while simple; there was a surprising amount of depth in what unit types faced off, which units were in the front, which were in the back.\n\nAlso curious is the omission of the Mountain clans and undead hordes as playable factions.\n\nDisciples III was terribly buggy upon its initital release and some may still be found now though I found it to be fairly stable from my playtime. In the end I would recommend the game if you are a fan of the series; but would suggest waiting for a steam sale as the price of admission is too high for what you may be expecting from the franchise. I can't help but feel part of that may stem from the change in developers from Strategy First to Akella.","January 19, 2015","true","26.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazerniel/recommended/33670/","kazerniel","kazerniel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazerniel/","625 products in account","TL;DR: >> Go play Disciples III: Reincarnation instead! <<\nDetailed:\n\nI played Disciples 2 through the whole of 2014, and loved it. Disciples 3 is a modernised, but overall worse game than its prequel.\n\nThe Good:+ The core gameplay elements are the same as the previous game, aside of learning the 3D controls and upgraded battle mechanics, it's fairly easy to get back into the game if you played D2.\n\n+ The graphics have been updated for the current decade, everything is "shinier", the capitals look awesome.\n\n+ Very atmospheric and catchy background music.\n\n+ The new interactive objects slightly enrich the experience.\n\n+ The battles are more interesting with the added tactical movement map, though with manually controlling the movement of each unit they also take longer.\n\n+ You carry over most items in the leader's inventory between campaign acts. Also the shop in the capital is quite handy for selling all the junk from the previous act to boost the starting budget.\n\nThe Mixed:~ Removing the rod-bearer unit is an interesting choice. Being able to conquer territory with the main team certainly makes the game flow smoother. On the other hand the vulnerable but essential rod-bearers added an extra tactical layer to D2.\n\n~ The times of the day alternating each turn is interesting, though I wish there was an option to just leave it on daylight. The others add atmosphere, but make the various items and enemies on the map harder to see. This leads to...\n\n~ Tons of achievements, but quite a few are unlockable without editing files or even with that. (x)\n\nThe Bad:- The movement map is prioritising looks to the detriment of usability. Often interactive objects are only noticeable if you highlight them with the Alt key. Similarly the enemy units are mostly unnoticeable on the main map, and not even get highlighted by Alt.\n\n- Inconsistent stat names, eg. a potion says it gives extra Dexterity, but when used it actually increases Agility instead of Dexterity and vice versa.\n\n- The inventory feels a lot more cluttered than in D2 with the huge icons and no way to sort the items.\n\n- Only 2 hotkeys (for passing turn and highlighting map objects), even though many functions would sorely need it.\n\n- Buggy and not-user-friendly UI.\n\n- You can only carry over your beginning Leader between campaign acts, and most plot triggers only unlock with him. This basically forces you to play the whole campaign with a melee leader :(\n\n- You can only cast 1-2 spells in total per turn, instead of being able to cast 1-2 of each types of spell per turn as in D2.\n\n- Each time the players casts a spell, they have to wait for the whole 10-11 sec animation to finish before the game becomes responsive again. This makes the spells giving extra movement mostly useless, as passing a turn takes a fragment of the time compared to the spell's animation.\n\n- The Dwarf and Undead nations are missing. (Though at least they added the Undeads in the Resurrection edition, but we never get to play the Dwarves again.)\n\n- When you type a space in Steam overlay mode, the game passes a turn.\n\n- Way more so than the maps in D2, there's no feeling of open spaces, the maps feel very linear and railroad-like, robbing the sense of exploration.\n\n- The tactical maps are randomly generated, and their layout can significantly affect the battle.\n\n- The game doesn't show any more what percentage of land is controlled by the various factions, instead it shows the resource incomes in two different places. Also it's hard to tell apart the Empire territory from the Neutral lands, it was a lot better in D2.\n\n- Clichéd story and mostly badly written dialogues.\n\n- The narrator's voice acting is quite bad, he's trying, but his voice has no power or majesty to it, instead sounds like a slightly bored office worker. Also the elven unit voiceovers are horrible, instead of the previous game's "elven language", they speak English with a cheap "metallic" effect to distort their voice. Ew.\n\n- Some pointlessly sexualised female outfits.\n\n- Some of the sound effects are quite funny and unfitting. (eg. Peasant & Acolyte attacks)\n\nVerdict:I wanted to love this game, but I have strongly mixed feelings about it. It still provides some fun, but that's probably due to me loving the basic gameplay concept and its prequel. For someone else, who is not that much in love with these, it's probably a more frustrating than enjoyable experience.","February 4","false","39.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Like others said. Save your money and buy the Disciples 2 set.  The maps were a series of linear paths, the campaign was pretty tedious for me and the difficult curve pretty damn crazy.  The first two scenarios were not particularly tough even at the highest difficulty.  The last one I found brutal even on easy.\n\nOh and the magic? Pretty worthless and unimaginative.  Pretty much all of the sides have carbon copy spells, the only difference is how much it heals or damages.  Which for any veterans of the series know that all four of the original races had clear advantages in one area or another with some overlap between the respective good or evil sides.\n\nI'm sure I can think of other negatives but I really don't want to.  The positives was the fancy graphics and the music... which actually still pales in comparison to the previous games in my opinion.\n\nWhich reminds me of citys/capitals... you might as well not bother leaving your people at them because they do not function as effective fall back points or R&R sites. Partly because the basic units are so weak and the other side because any stationed armies can still get blasted back into the stone-age.  All in all I found the game to be deeply disappointing, to say nothing of the node guardians or lord bonuses... Don't play anything other than a warlord.  The mage is pretty pointless and so is the guildmaster.","August 9, 2014","false","167.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you're interested in the boring story, then just read the summary. And even that is an absolute waste of time.\n\nGood things:\n- the graphics\n- long gameplay (something truly rare nowadays)\n- stats & skills of the heroes (+ the playful upgrade mechanism)\n- the final battle (absolutely epic!)\n- the second chapter is quite interesting :)\n- the story teller has a really great voice (+ the truth behind the character is a nice surprise)\n\nNeutral\n- battlesystem (90% copy of homam battlestyle)\n- the design of the races & units (some designs are spectacular & inovating, some are just plain copypasta or, compared to previous series, totally downgrading)\n- side-quests (mostly the same, but still better than nothing)\n- the first chapter (eeehhh… kinda boring, but it's fine for getting used to the mechanics 'n stuff)\n\nBad things:\n- plain characters (3 main heroes, who are all swordsmen? annoying simple villain? a damsel in distress with superpowers? one of the main heroes is actually bad & interesting, but you have to FORCIBLY turn him into a good guy? are you even trying??)\n- shallow & unnecessarily long story (15 chapters of obvious & cliche tropes)\n- uninteresting plot-twists\n- not so surprising ending\n- the same neverending soundtrack (I seriously had to switch to my own music after a few hours… it was incredibly annoying)\n- where the dwarves at?? (hopefully in another dlc, if it ever comes out)\n- unit quotes (absolutely uninteresting, underwhelming & mostly boring; only some of the characters have good quotes, otherwise they're totally lame. Example: a unit gets cursed: "THIS IS A CURSE?!1!" or "THIS is a SPELL!!!")\n- the third chapter (don't even get me started about this…)\n- the ♥♥♥♥ing glitches… (I had technical problems with the last battle, thus I had to browse for hours to find help & fix it)\n\nThe game & the ideas had a really great potential → the cliche beginning was actually fine & could have been really nicely thought out through the following gameplay, the way the plot was passed from a race to race, the heroes skills, even the battlesystem (although totally copied).\n\nBut goddammit, it was absolutely wasted & killed by the cliche story, characters, missions etc.\n\nThe gameplay is like "OMG! This thing is absolutely SERIOUS!! We gotta save the world!!1!", so you get pumped about doing the ♥♥♥♥, following the side-quests, building your army, leveling your heroes & then BAM! The cliche stuff totally kills the mood. I've never felt so demotivated about finishing a game in my life. I've wasted 70 hours on this garbage…\n\nSo please, be wise & don't repeat the same mistake. It truly isn't worth it.","March 12","false","70.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Similar games that come to mind are King's Bounty or Heroes of Might and Magic VI. Personally I enjoyed this game more than those, and one of the features I really liked about Disciples III is that instead of just having 'stacks' of units like those other games, you create squads of units (you can hire multiple leaders) that will stay with you and level up, advance in ranks, and learn new skills. If you are familiar with the Ogre Battle series then this has some more similar aspects to that. There is a fair amount of depth to this game as you build up your castle, learn new spells, level up and choose your skill and class advancement paths, explore the world, and get involved in the story that spans 3 campaigns.\n\nThere are some minor bugs that I ran into quickly such as the right-click tooltip system not always working properly (only happened once or twice and restarting fixed it) and the Esc key not always bringing up the game menu (you can use the mouse to click the menu button instead), but these were not enough to hinder my enjoyment of the game.","March 16, 2014","true","71.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #48 - Disciples III: Renaissance\n\nI'll start with a disclaimer that I've never played any of the other Disciples games, so I didn't have any particular expectations coming into this game.   But, having played some turn based fantasy strategy games before, I kind of had an idea what to expect.\n\nI can't say my immediate first impression was that great, as the game opens up with a narrated cutscene that sounded like they just asked someone in the office to record rather than spending the money on an actual voice actor.\n\nThe game offered a choice of game modes when I started a new game.  For my review, I stuck to the Campaign game mode, and started with the tutorial, which acts as an introductory mission to the overall campaign.\n\nGameplay seems pretty similar to the other turn based games I've played, with my party moving around on an overland map gathering resources.  When running into encounters, the game will then switch to a tactical hex based map where turn based combat takes place.  It didn't seem like there were a lot of options in the actual fight.  Each of the party members has a basic "attack" which varies based on the type of character it is.  For instance my main character did a melee attack.  But other character types can shoot arrows, cast an offensive spell, or heal other party members.  Characters can also go into a defensive stance rather than attacking.\n\nAnother hallmark of these types of games are the towns that you can upgrade to add other building types, which in turn unlock other types of characters that can be recruited into your party.\n\nThere is some customization you can do with your main character.  As you progress and get experience, you will end up getting skill points which you can spend to buy skills.  You also get attribute points which you can use to up your main attributes.  Treasure can be found on the overland map and certain items will be equippable by your main character, which generally serve to upgrade stats.\n\nI got through the tutorial and played about 30 minutes into the first mission.  It never seemed difficult to me at all, but I was playing on easy, so that is a reasonable expectation.  I'm just not sure if it's supposed to ramp up in difficulty in later missions.\n\nThe UI is servicable but felt a little clunky at times.  I didn't like the fact that I couldn't hit Escape to bring up the options menu.  Instead you have to click the gear icon at the top right.  In fact pretty much all of the menus in the game are accessed by clicking a particular icon, but it wasn't always obvious from looking what icon did what.  It took some getting used to.\n\nI did like how right clicking on anything of interest would give you a popup with details on whatever you clicked on.  At a minimum the popup will tell you what the item is and what it does.  I also liked how if the item was 'recharging' (such as a well that you can drink from every 4 turns), it would tell you how many turns left until it could be used again.\n\nOverall I found the game to be a bit simplistic for a strategy game, but reasonably easy to pick up.  I do think there are much better turn based strategy games out there that I would recommend instead of this.  Still, I had fun in the time I played so I can give this a lukewarm recommendation.","January 1","true","1.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

And that appears quite strange and opposite compared to all the reviews I read on Steam.\n\nThe big flaws of the game, in my opinion, are three:\n1. the fact you can't decide whether to attack or retire from a battle when you come across an enemy;\n2. you can't use shortcuts (at least, I'm not able to use them on Renaissance while I used them all the time on Reincarnation);\n3. battles can be a bit confusing if you don't pay attention when deciding every move: for example, if you click on an hex too far from your player he will go there on the next turn, but you can't set him on defensive status.\nMoreover, I didn't like the fact that range attacks can hit everywhere on the map, even on most distan hexes. I way prefer Reincarnation battle mode on this sight.\n\nAlso, it's never clear which charachter got a level up, there's no sign to notify your hero can learn new abilities and so on.\n\nAll in all, I'd surely suggest Disciples III - Renaissance to anyone fond of the Disciples trilogy, but if you want a more challenging, refined and precise game experience then you should definitely go for Reincarnation.","May 6, 2014","true","56.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrippedSociety/recommended/33670/","TrippedSociety","NaSt1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrippedSociety/","232 products in account","Disciples Sacred Lands and Disciples II .. are some of the best turned based strategy games out there to date and they are .. old.. almost as old as Tactics Ogre, FF tactics, or Kingdom Under Fire. Not a lot of game companies can completly screw themselves out of a winning formula.. but they did it.. boy did they do it. If you ever played Koudelka another turned based game also made in 1999. You will see how they flip flopped the entirety of the battle machanic to something less desirable than the 2 original games from 99 and 02. I personally considered the static grittiness and archaic battle system far greater than most others.\nAnd where's my flags? The genius of simplicity in the originals far outweighed the more advanced or presentable offerings than most current turn based games at that time. However the Hex design is done quite well. Even better than most Heroes games. What really irks me is the way the combatants hit eachother.. and theres no blood and guts.. like it was in the old game. When the enemies struck eachother..  it almost felt as if you were being struck or shot or blasted.. this just has a very poor way of illustrating a strike to an enemies body compared to the old game.\nA Town a TOWN my kingdom FOR A TOWN .. where is it? .. i could barely stomache 15 minutes before quitting on the second mission. I'll just hold it down and play through it.. but wheres my towns?.. I guess that's the price we pay for such stunning graphics.. oh well.. I really hope this game series.. GOES BACK .. to the original design that won them praises from even the most hardcore turned based strategies.. guess I'll just go play Xcom.. or Massive Chalice.. or maybe even reload that old campaign from Disciples 1 or 2.","January 31, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
