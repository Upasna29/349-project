Theres no story nor are there gameplay mechanics. The entire game is spent wandering aimlessly in a maze until you either run out of oxygen or a monkey kills you with jump scares in one hit.\nThis game also experiences major frame rate drops with ocassional bugs depending on the computer your playing on. That is especially true if your using screen capture software, mine froze up several times. The sound and music is way too loud and there's no in-game option to adjust the volume. Speaking of the lack of options, it has the worst UI i've ever seen for a game menu, theres no save feature, no adjustments, or anything basic that all other computer games have. Stay away from this game, it's a glorifyed prototype and nothing more.","March 19","false","0.7"," 63 of 76 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","63","76","0","10"

Apparently free movement has been added. So not everything is accurate in my review. I already refunded it so, yeah.\nI honestly do not know what I think of this game. It's like one of those rail shooting games, except you are being hunted by a monkey. Basically gives the same vibes as Five Nights at Freddy's but with it's own little twists, which could be a good thing depending on your preference. The fact that the Unity logo pops up in the beginning does not help either...\nIt does not feel like a game that should originally go for 3.99 euros\n\n\nHere is how it looked when I played it without the free movement:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99gIkTR5vEE","March 16","false","0.2"," 42 of 56 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","42","56","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tasukiofflames/recommended/448540/","tasukiofflames","TasukiOfFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tasukiofflames/","","Edit: Ok i gave this game a chance, it at least had some scares to when i first started playing it on rails, the walking update helped a bit but the AI was unchanged, then this newest update adds music that is more comedy than anything for a horror game, no back story as to why you are there or who is after you. The new map is bigger but just as generic, the flashlight can barely see anywhere at all, and the new enemy is a reskin of the monkey into a zombie thing and u can barely see him when he gets you. Whish they still just run at you, no suprises no coming out from the ceiling, just sprinting, unless they change this up, there can be no horror to be had, it gets boring, this is supposed to be a finished game not early access and its so bad. check my new vids on the update below\nhttps://youtu.be/EDoVBe6jnl4\n\n\nThis is a interesting game for sure, but it needs a new way to move around wasd would of been fine but it is a on rails style with the mouse buttons choosing where you go. You have 3 systems to deal with along a short path, oxygen, to keep on, audio to keep off, and the generator to keep on with it getting harder as it goes along, u can use a flash bang to run off the mutant monkey which can give some good scares but right now its very limited. Check out my play of it below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/z9T7grJa8fc","March 16","false","0.4"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/448540/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","To be honest, I did not expect to find a game that is on par with Cargo 3 and Devil's Share in quick succession, yet, I managed to do so. Interestingly, of all 3 this is the one that can be considered the "best" as it does not have any floating enemies nor does it give you the impression of being able to make progress while keeping the gameplay very repetitive.\n\nHere you do not make any progress. You start out at the very same place in a barely lit maze all the time without any hints as to what happened to you and why you are there. Cargo 3 at least tried to include a "cutscene" by including some artwork telling you some basic background story that made you think the devs had spent a decent amount of time with the development. What TL gives you is exactly what the store page synopsis says - no more, no less.\n\nWhile the videos showcase a monkey (in fact, most of the gameplay videos on YouTube have this antagonist) during the 20 minutes or so I spent with TL I only encountered the so-called "Doctor" and his "Wife". While they look decent their one-hit kill makes the game very irritating and next to impossible to complete (if there's a chance to do any walkthroughs here, that is), yet, the dev (in one of his most recent updates) claims the difficulty is now perfect. Now, this one-hit kill practically consists of a scary voice / sound effect coupled with the close-up view of the antagonist's face who suddenly turns away and is on to his / her business. I guess what they want to say is "Tag, you're it!" instead of killing you - either this or another famous playground game is used here: Hide & Seek.\n\nYou are given a couple of minutes "free roam" when there's a sudden music change indicating your dearest friends started coming to look for you. This also means that they will definitely find you - the AI is programmed in a way that it will find you regardless of what you do. Except for one thing - if you hide behind two machines they cannot go into the same narrow space so you're pretty much safe - until your oxygen runs out. If you run this chemical element leaves your body even faster - thank god you can find generators that fill you up quickly.\n\nAs for weapons: the game gives you flashbangs but using them blinds not only the "couple" but also yourself. The effect is a reddish something that can easily make you dizzy. Talk about nausea: since you run out of O2 the sensation of unease and discomfort is just perfect! You also have a torchlight but it runs out of battery very quickly. Quicker than in any other game in video game history. It's a shame as the game is extremely dark.\n\nThere are some other machines that can be interacted with but I forgot what those were and why I should even be bothered by them. In fact, I had a hard time forgetting about the main menu that pretty much gives all the info you need without any options to offer any changes in audio or graphics. I know it's a Unity engine game and prior to launch you have that pop-up for the changes but what purpose does it serve if you can play the game only on "fantastic" quality? So, you only have the "New Game" option with also the controls and in-game tips and instructions but written in an English language that will make all grammar nazis stay true to their beliefs. Oh, and there's no pause - hitting esc brings you back to this screen which has constant, irritating music that you (guess what?) cannot turn down or off.\n\nTerror Lab offers a short-lived gaming experience with cheap jumpscares and the fact that the developer is constantly trying to let you know that your opinion matters and will shape the game makes you pose the question: Why isn't this still in Early Access? GenomGames may be an ambitious indie developer / publisher company but the fact that they  have released 3 games so far in half a year or so (all with pretty much identical quality / approach) does not bode well.\n\nPS: While the great number of positive reviews is not necessarily bad (everybody's entitled to their opinion) what is alarming is that they are too short, far from being factual and there's an odd similarity of their command of English to that of the game's main menu.","May 28","false","0.5"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","14","14","3","0"

From the moment that I began the game, I knew i was going down â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Avenue. Not only does the game not let me turn down the video quality, but it starts in a 2008 style launcher, giving me little to no customization of the game. Upon entering the game itself, the menu at the start had no choice for any options at all, not even audio (which â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ my ears upon launch). Once i finally loaded the game after what seemed like countless screens beforehand, the game actually looked very nice. This however, was just a cover up for a horribly designed piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Taking my first step in the game i knew that the game was going to be dogshit. There was a simulated headbob that was quite unrealistic to real life since i am not a bobblehead. Next, like every other scary game, the lights sudden "go out". This is quite unoriginal and i expected nothing less from a 3 dollar dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The "scary" aspect of the game wasn't even scary at all. I encountered the antagonist twice, and neither times did he scare me but I could have assumed this due to the fact that the main enemy of the game is an unevolved primate. All in all, this is the biggest waste of 3 dollars. I would ahve much rather given the money to a prostitue for a hug. Thanks Bernard Nicolas, for making me realize there is something worse than the holocaust.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crapchinstrap/recommended/448540/","Crapchinstrap","CrapChinStrap","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crapchinstrap/","117 products in account","A nice little jump scare game!\n\nWhen it originally released, it had an unconventional 'on the rails' style of gameplay where you could only move backwards and forwards, whilst trying to fend off a rabid mokey with a flashbang grenade. This was unique and interesting, but also felt very limiting and ultimately the game grew tiresome fairly quick.\n\nThe game creator took all feedback on board, and promptly worked on improving the game. It only took him a few days, and so i decided to come back and try out the newly updated version of the game.\n\nNow it is an atmospheric free roaming survival game, where you have to keep moving in order to not only avoid the rabid monkey, and a zombie-looking doctor, but to refresh the generator and oxygen supply....because if either of them run out, you arent going to survive for long at all.\n\nI can't wait to see what further improvements are made to this game, and will definately be playing again in the future!\n\nYou can check out my Youtube Channel Playthroughs of both the Original and the new versions here:\n\nPlaythrough Ep#1 - *Pre-Update, old on the rails gameplay*:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYdnjDxO0PU\n\nPlaythrough Ep#2 -  *Post-Update, new free roam gameplay*:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExfM33cVGCU\n","April 3","true","0.8"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","5","19","0","0"

This is a game title that the developer listens to everyones opinions and suggestions, you rarely get that in these kind of games and with indie developers just starting out etc.. Most developers will only care about if someone did a negative review then ask a thousand questions knowing its a common issue. This game would probably be good if you had a gun or something. My first impression with zombie games like this is find the gun and shoot them.. LOL nah its not like that at all. as far as trading cards they should be the monkey, the zombie, maybe a room or something. then the wallpaper is the zombie on the one side and monkey on the other.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wademasquerade/recommended/448540/","wademasquerade","wademasquerade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wademasquerade/","85 products in account","I have very mixed feelings on this game, so I guess I will just give a list of pros and cons:\n\nPROS\n- GREAT atmosphere. The "breathing" effect that the lights have truly create a sense of panic and dread. The sound is great, going from total eerie silence to droning, wooshy, "something's wrong" queues.\n- Very scary. Monkeys are terrifying to begin with to me personally, so to have a 6 foot tall one with red eyes jumping out of nowhere is an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-clencher for certain.\n- Visuals (lighting, smoke, etc.) are nice.\n\nCONS\n- Some textures are seriously buggy, and it takes away from the immersion.\n- That Tocatta and Fugue in the main menu totally doesn't fit rest of the game whatsoever, and I'd suggest something a little more subtle.\n- While hand-holding is never good, an objective being made clear would be cool.\n- I experienced a major bug 2 or 3 times where after flashbanging the enemy, my character would be stuck in place, causing me to lose from loss of oxygen. I don't know if there's something I could have done that's not apparent to me, but it seems like something is off there, and it's a total game breaker.\n\nIn short, it's a great idea for a game, and the atmosphere and premise are right. All it needs is a little tweaking here and there and it could be great! Right now, it's a little broken, which is understandable of a brand new release.\n\nHere's my Let's Play! : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99ppATlTNPs","March 18","true","0.3"," 8 of 32 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","8","32","0","0"

My name is Carrillo :) GenomeGames Gave me a key to this game, And I just so happen to have a few things to say about it! Also this is my First Review! Lets get INTO IT!\n\nI've played my fair share of horror games. When it comes to Terror Labs I would say that GenomGames hit home with a lot of the core elements that bring Horror into a game. when it comes to Sound Design/Atmosphere/Map Design etc.\n(PLEASE NOTE: I HAVE NOT PLAYED UPDATED VERSION YET) 3/22/2016\n\nBut If I had any complaints about the game..\n\n-Hard to move hand across Keyboard to "Enter" to activate the computers, switching it to "E" would work better.\n-Timer too long! Add Rounds Maybe? (I calculated that the timer lasts roughly 30mins)\n-Audio is amazing! Cept I wish I could hear the Enemys Footsteps or at least SOMETHING that will help me predict which direction hes coming from.\n-I recommend adding a Respawn feature/timer or somthing becuase in my gameplay The Enemy got frozen in place. (bit of a bug)\n\n\nI think you did a really great job on this, I DID NOT expect it to be THAT SCARY and I mean that. It's Amazing. Even though the mechanics are simple I like that there wasn't many instructions and you didn't hold our hands. You just threw us into the pit with no instructions on how to survive, and that alone set the atmosphere and sense of fear. RECOMMENDED\n\nThank you :)","March 23","true","1.0"," 3 of 21 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","3","21","0","0"

Now, i have seen your reviews and think that you should not complain. If you do not like playing recently released games, what is the point. It is in developmnt sure, but this game has a lot of potential. Dont you think? I'm just an Alpha Tester and before taking the role of an Alpha Tester, i did think about it. This game is potentially satisfying but i have my own feedback for the developer. If you rate thumbs down, what will happen to the game? Be deleted from steam.\n\nI have only played it for 15 minutes and it is very scary. This developer is amazing. Here are some feedback that just needs to be in improved a bit.\n\n[] Music\n[] Esc leads to save menu / exit to menu\n[] Easier to win. Like difficulty levels.\n\nBut if you think about the game in the natural state, it can be improved, just with your support guys!

It would be a very heavy downvote if the controls still worked the way they did. This would still be a downvote however, if the creator didnâ€™t update the game as frequently as he does. The graphic quality of the game is good, but the overall gameplay is lacking. It has a very basic walk back and forth between two points while avoiding an enemy.\n\nHeres before the walking update\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfNKeVpNXec\n\nHere is after the walking update\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lao61aZAk8\n","March 19","true","1.7"," 8 of 33 people (24%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","24","8","33","2","1"

You just play hide and seek with enemies in a dark lab, and besides you have to activate some generators on the map that keeps you alive. Indeed it is a simple game, but the asking price is fair enough I think.\n\nIt's not tagged as Early Access in the store, but it defenetly is still in EA. At least the developer talks a lot to the community and is updating and changing features frequantly.\n\nIt has already changed to a completly different game in this 1 week.\n\nThere are still lots of features that needs to be added, but if the developer keeps up the speed in updating this game, I'm sure it will make a good progress in the upcoming weeks.\n\nLooking forward to the multiplayer mode!\n\n\n\n","March 28","true","1.2"," 4 of 24 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","4","24","0","0"
