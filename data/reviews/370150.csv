I thought initially that 100 levels would be quick to burn through, but as of writing this review I haven't breached 30. You can see from the screenshots and trailers what kind of game this is, so if it looks like your kind of thing, you won't be disappointed.\n\nI will say that it's not terribly relaxing unless you turn SFX down to around 15-20% (from 100%)- but after I did that, no complaints at all, definitely worth the asking price.","May 22, 2015","true","7.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

A nice puzzle game that can be played either as brain workout and try to figure out where pieces go to form the final shape with logic and visualization or played by just moving things around until you get a flash of inspiration and complete the level. I prefer to just move things around but some times it's nice to try and see if you can figure what the shape is with all the pieces scattered around.\n\nI backed this game on kickstarter so I got a couple more hours of play and I'm still not even close to level 100.\n\nDefinetly worth the price if you are into puzzle games. As was said, maybe just lower the volume a bit and it can be pretty relaxing. I wish a negative mod would be added, all that white can be blinding.","May 22, 2015","true","0.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Later, new types are added, like pieces that can be turned and pieces that can change color.\nDefinitely check this one out if you need a new chillout puzzle fix!","November 5, 2015","true","9.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game would make a fortune on android and iphone. A good quality game to add to your library.\n\nGreat game for under a fiver.  The puzzles are challenging and require thought, the music and sound effects are really relaxing and the graphics are bright and vivid, with a colour blind option if needed.  The aim is to rotate, swap and change colours and shapes until you get a series of connecting loops, much harder than it sounds.  I've played it for 3 hours and i am about 30% of the way through the game, so great value for money.

Fun puzzles that can get quite intricate, but not impossible to solve with (some help of) methodical approach.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sekti/recommended/370150/","sekti","sekti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sekti/","131 products in account","I would have hoped for this puzzle game to be a bit more... puzzly. Most puzzle games that I enjoy require some kind of insight to proceed, or at least, are designed such that strategic thinking is superior to trial and error. You apply logic, derive a pattern and act on it.\n\nThis game on the other hand does not reward thinking much. The best strategy seems to be: Find pieces that fit the border (usually this will yield a unique partial solution) and go from there (usually there is a unique way to do so). This took me through the hundred levels in roughly six hours with little cause to reconsider my strategy. It's not super boring (you can listen to music or podcasts in the background) but does not provide an interesting challenge either.\n\nI would have hoped for more clever puzzles. There are topological and graph theoretic insights that levels could be built upon, such as:\n\n• Any cut through the level crosses an even number of lines (of each colour).\n• The curvature of each loop must sum up to a multiple of 360°.\n• If there are crossings between red and blue lines, then this number of crossings must be even.\n• The number of times line segments connect to the left end of a hexagon equals the number of times that a connects to the right (for each colour. the same for the other two directions).\n\nI think it would have been possible to build new mechanics and levels around those mechanics that encourage and reward thinking about these things. Sadly, the existing levels are designed such that considerations of this kind are either useless or more tedious than just applying trial and error.\n\nThere are puzzle games out there that convey interesting logical insights and reward the application of them, making the player feel smart when solving a challenge. This is not one of these games.","May 31, 2015","false","6.1"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"
