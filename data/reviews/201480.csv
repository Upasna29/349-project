Vlambeer is one of my favorite developers, and I do have a small soft spot for serious sam.\nThe problem with Serious Sam: The Random Encounter is it's a bit like Space Jam, it's an idea that sounds really great on paper but doesn't work so well in execution. It's pretty much a heavily scripted pixelated turn based RPG which has one of the oddest turn based/action combat hybrids I've ever seen. You pick a character, pick a weapon or if you want them to use an item, and then point them in a direction to fire said weapon or use said item. Then you get around 5-10 seconds of action while you try to dodge bullets and hit targets with the aim you set.\nThe problem with this is that especially when you gain a third party member, it becomes almost impossible to actually dodge anything or have any real "skill" with dodging or hitting. As hordes get bigger later on, aiming gets less useful too, as hordes will get so big that it pretty much doesn't matter where you aim.\nKeep in mind this is a scripted RPG, so no shops, no "real" overworld and every item or weapon you get is found as part of the rigidly scripted story that's underwritten even for Serious Sam. There are technically "Random encounters" (heh), but with the rewards they dole out it's actually more resource efficient to just skip straight to the next area.\n\nIt's just not worth it. You will probably get about 3-4 stages in like I did and quit when the Texan comes into play because of how impossible it is to keep going.\nBuy it maybe it if goes on sale for like a dollar and you're curious. You won't even get an hour out of this.","May 15, 2015","false","2.3"," 37 of 48 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","37","48","3","0"

You'll have a top down map with enemy encounters and be taken to a RPG style battle system. The map worlds are literally one screen sections, if your party is wiped out three times, you need to restart that one map. It would feel right at home on the original Gameboy or a mobile phone. Random battles can happen when you walk one space on the map, so if that angers you, avoid this game.\n\nThe real game is the combat, each battle pits you and your allies against several if not dozens or hundreds of enemies chasing after you. You select fight, swap weapon or item. Any of your characters can use any weapon. Here's where it gets interesting, the weapons and enemies have uses like in an action game. The revolver will shoot at the closest enemy, the shotgun is a defensive weapon if any enemies or big projectiles get within a proximity of the user, the rocket launcher sends a spread of 3 rockets one per turn, the grenade launcher does big damage.... if you can hit your target in it, since enemies move, they might be gone before the grenade lands, and there's a mini gun where you aim the line and fire until the end of the turn.\n\nEnemies have different properties too. Some will stay far and shoot, others will chase after you and damage you, killing themselves. Enemies are quicker and slower than you, so you can either outrun them or they'll catch you. All of the combat is a really fresh take on RPG turn based combat. Oh and as your turn is happening, you can move your party up and down on the screen to dodge projectiles or stall for time as you wait for the next shotgun blast.\n\nAfter every battle, you get full health. The items mostly consist of armor power ups, health, attack buffs. All of which seem to be needed for bosses at the end of each one screen map.\n\nSo if I enjoy the game how could I give it a negative rating?\n\nThe game is a steep climb in difficulty before you know it. Walls of bullets, things become unavoidable, deaths are inevitable even if party members are revived with full health after a battle. Everything needs to be done in battle and that is the real downfall. You cannot use any items such as armor outside of battle. So if you're facing a wall of bullets against dozens or hundreds of enemies, you'll just get slaughtered again and again. Luck of who you fight plays a big part of your survival. You can grind all you want before a boss battle. The catch is once you've used your 3 lives, you'll need to start that map over again without all of the grinding you just did. Another problem with lack of grinding is that you can't go back to a previous map to grind and no amount of grinding will save you from bullet walls that comes with every enemy encounter past a few maps. Another downfall is there is no native controller or steam support. Not even key binding, but everything else is a much bigger glaring issue.\n\nIn all, its just a fresh take on old school RPGs and I like it, but its as if the developers didn't play the game past a certain point. If you're looking for a very difficult new RPG that is unforgiving and makes grinding meaningless, this is the game for you.","June 8, 2014","false","2.3"," 51 of 73 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","51","73","0","0"

This sounds simple (and looks simple thanks to the 16-bit style graphics), yet somehow the developers of Nuclear Throne still managed to mess everything up.\n\nThe core flaw of the game is that it is nothing but randomness. It is only mildly frustrating that the same level can throw in three encounters or a dozen during the exact same trip. The real pain starts during combat when one realises they have zero influence on the outcome, as the player can issue exactly one command every five seconds (shoot, swap weapon, or use item) but the enemy horde attacks in real time; winning is just a question of luck on enemy composition and movement patterns. Due to this unpredictable and aggravating mechanic, it takes an unjustly amount of patience to even get to the final boss; a patience most players will probably lack.","February 5","false","2.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

After finishing the campaign, the player will be given the opportunity to play in Endless Mode, but without any real goal in mind, this would just be a waste of time.\n\nBecause the game is so short, the developers made sure to make it extra hard just to frustrate the player into believing the game took a really long time to beat. This also has a big impact on it's replay value, because without featuring any kind of achievements or incentives(like extra content), a typical user will not want to have another go at it just for sheer fun.\n\nAlso atypically for any game, Serious Sam: The Random Encounter encourages you to die a few times during a level just to cheat and get a couple more copies of a weapon that can make the rest of the game a lot easier. This is sad and game-braking at the same time, but judging the overall quality of the game, it is something that should have been expected.\n\nOn a side-note, screenshots made in fullscreen mode will look weird. The picture will feature a small screenshot in one of the corners followed by a black background and some traces of any pop-ups that may have appeared on screen during this time.\n\nAlthough I have bought it for about 0.80€ I still believe this game to be a terrible waste of money and I wouldn't recommend buying it. Please, do note that the game has compatibility issues on some systems, so make sure you can play it in case you want to pick it up.","December 3, 2013","false","2.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You then run backwards while shooting at the horde of enemies, and they run forward trying to reach and kill you. This goes on for five seconds before the next turn.\n\nYou'll recruit additional party members and find plenty of weapons to choose from but, contrary to the description, there's no RPG here.

There's just no way to fully describe the variety of reactions that I get when playing this game.  I can describe SOME of it - enjoyment, amusement, mild frustration, more amusement - but more than anything this is something I simply did not expect in a Serious Sam title.\n\nBriefly, the game plays a bit like a classic turn-based RPG, with you selecting actions (primarily attacking) while facing off against enemies.  What makes this a Serious Sam game is that it's initally just Sam against 20+ enemies per encounter, and you're running backwards as they're running towards you.  The format is also a bit different in that you can move Sam around as wave after wave of enemy heads towards you, allowing you to dodge attacks, or try at any rate.  As you progress through the game you gain two other allies who you can control during fights.  This improves your damage output but makes dodging much harder, as all three move as one unit.  In between fights you move around on an overhead view map, encountering enemies randomly as you move; thus, the name.\n\nOf course, what also makes this a proper Serious Sam game is the weapons you are given.  Initially limited to a Revolver and Minigun, you eventually pick up nearly the full compliment of Serious Sam weapons: shotgun, rocket launcher, laser rifle, sniper rifle, grenade launcher, and even the Cannon.  Each has been balanced fairly well for the way the game plays, with differing strengths and weaknesses. Last but not least, the game has no shortage of humor, perfectly on tone for Sam and his usual shenanigans.  Many of the jokes are aimed at the game's new format, with Sam complaining about "puzzles" (read: having to pick up a key) for example.\n\nIn the end, Serious Sam: The Random Encounter is an amusing and enjoyable spinoff of the Serious Sam brand, though admittedly a very short one.  On my first attempt it took me about an hour to get through the entirety of the game to the final boss.  I won't say that's a dealbreaker, especially since the game has a reasonable replay value, but it's worth knowing when you're deciding how much you're willing to pay for a copy.  If you need something to kill an hour or two, you could do far worse.","April 1, 2015","true","1.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

It's one of the Indie line games based on Serious Sam franchise, being made by somebody else aside from Croteam. In this case it was developed by Vlambeer and came out in 2011.\n\nAnd oh boy, is it a mess from technical standpoint. So much bugs.\nWindows 8 users will want to check Steam guides, there is one that has a link to a patch. Otherwise it will start crashing every few minutes.\nMind it, even after patch it still can randomly crash or glitch up. And it will not save your progress, only when you quit to main menu, so I recommend you to do it at the start of every level.\nAnd then there is a bug on final level where if you get game over to final boss at 3-3 world then you will be stuck in infinite loop of game over. And quitting during this loop will not save your progress. So make sure to quit to main menu before the fight.\nAnd then the infinite mode you unlock fails to reset all values properly when started so if you choose to play it right after beating the campaign then it will glitch up after the first battle.\n\nYep, as you see, this game is already quite dangerous to mess around. It's just not serious enough.\n\nAnd if we talk about game then there is a single word that can descripe it: novelty.\nIt really has a nice idea of having shooter combined with jRPG system only to not develop it any deeper or have any good replayability. I mean, it's very short and maps feel somehow too linear and small as well. There isn't much left to be seen after you beat it. And it could be better.\n\nI mean, art is real nice, music is fine, presenation is cheapy and plot is too much of a joke. And gameplay is weird. Most people compare battles to bullethell where it's impossible to avoid everything. To be honest, taking hits is totally okay in jRPG, the point is to survive. There is a reason why you always start with 100% health in each battle no matter how damaged you was in previous battle and it's totally okay as long as at least somebody survives.\n\nAnd yea, each battle goes like this: a horde of enemies spawn in and camera lets you see what this wave looks like. Then every five seconds you set aim, or order to swap weapon, or to use items. And then after giving orders you get to control vertical position of a party, to minimize damage. It's pretty good, you will learn what combination work the best. But near the end of a game it starts to throw battles that might be even impossible. To be honest, the final level is where you pretty much have to use all the items you hoarded up from before, so it's still possible to beat game easily on second walkthrough by knowing this. Still, could be better.\n\nOh, and there is overworld. Which is small and not much. And not much randomization. There is no leveling. Well, you do have a meter that fills up after each battle, but it just gives you random item or weapon. And in later levels the grinding is not worth it. Just do it in early level.\n\nAnd infinite mode that you unlock after beating the game is really cheap. Not worth talking about. Move forward in corridor overworld and get battle.\n\nBut yea, it's just some short game and don't forget how buggy this is! But I still think that it works, as part of Serious Sam Indie series and as a novelty, which still holds up as I didn't get to play any other game like this one. But yes, weak weak weak thumbs up. It's very cool idea, but too buggy and short.","May 11","true","5.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

They succeeded, but the result wouldn't be good enough to support a large campaign, hence the tiny length of the main 'Story' mode here. The minimalist dialogue is both appropriate and funny, and the game itself doesn't try to hold your attention any longer than it ought to.\n\nI love the idea and most of the execution, but I can't say I've had my money's-worth of entertainment from it.","October 31, 2011","false","2.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/201480/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Serious Sam: The Random Encounter is a mash-up of Serious Sam, old-school JRPGs (say, Final Fantasy) and, unexpectedly enough, a bullet-hell shooter. Yes, it is definitely all of those things!\n\nContext\nJust a little bit of history, this was part of a series of promotional Serious Sam games, created by Devolver Digital to promote the (at the time) upcoming Serious Sam 3.\n\nThe other game of the series I've played, was a 2D side-scrolling shooter, where you could mount guns on top of other guns, and had massive mobs of enemies exploding around you. It was a blast!\n\nWith that said, when I saw this available on a sale, I decided to give it a go, as ridiculous as the premise sounds!\n\nIt's a byte-sized game made by Vlambeer, so you know what to expect, knowing them -- sometimes unfair, yet really fun and chaotic arcade gaming!\n\n\nPresentation\nThe visual style in this game immediately shows what the game is. It features the indentifiable Vlambeer style, with the whole SS crew of headless guys with bombs for hands and lava monters! I'm not too familiar with the Serious Sam games (I own them, just haven't gotten around to playing them), so I can't say how faithful it may be.\n\nRegardless, it looks pretty cool. It's a retro looking and sounding game, but not in a lazy way.\n\nYou'll literally fight dozens of enemies at once, in each battle, all with a big flare of explosions and bullet flying around. You may argue that it sometimes obfuscates the screen and isn't very clean -- but honestly, that's not the point. It's supposed to be silly, mindless and over-the-top, and that's exactly what it is! In a good way.\n\nEach area has a very characteristic look, and it's really great to see hordes of enemies on screen getting obliterated.\n\nThe music is a bit strange. I can't tell if it's a different and more retro arrangement of SS's music. Regardless I think it's pretty good! Some of it (especially the drumming) sounds like MIDI, and the rest is simply synth based music. It does fit the theme, though!\nFuturistic levels sound futuristic, egypt level sounds oriental, that sort of stuff. I really enjoyed the music while I played the game!\n\nIn the way of options and interface, it's a bit limited, but it doesn't really matter very much. I beat the game in less than 2 hours, so there weren't any major problems that I've found worth mentioning.\n\nThe writing isn't at all serious, being very self aware and constantly poking fun at both SS and JRPG tropes. It was amusing to me, taking the context of the game into account.\n\n\nGeneral Structure\nIn this game, you have 3 different levels, each with 3 different stages.\n\nIt plays like a JRPG. You have a topdown view and a small map, sometimes with "puzzles" to solve. I say "puzzles" but I don't think they count as that. It's more the concept of puzzle that the game uses to poke fun at. Go to A, press switch, door opens -- with guts and explosion in the middle.\n\nIn these maps, there are, as the name suggests, random encounters!\nYes, about every 2 steps. Literally. Don't worry, the maps aren't all that big. At the end of each battle, your characters gain a bit of armor, if they didn't get hit, so it definitely rewards "decent" play -- skill isn't a big factor in this game, no worries!\n\nYou'll have to balance exploration (very minimal, each stage fits easily in one screen) and just rushing to the end. Why? Because there are chests spread around the stages. These chests contain weapons and items that will certainly prove useful. On the downside, you'll have more encounters, which is more dangerous.\n\n\nAt the end of each level there's a Boss fight, which mainly involves a big horde plus a really big unique monster.\n\nDeath is punished, buy it's not too punishing by any stretch. I find it completely fair! You have 3 lives. If you die in any encounter, you'll go back one step behind that encounter, and lose a life. If you lose all your lives, you simply restart the stage. Since the stages are really short, it's never a problem.\n\nYou start with only one character, but then pick another 2, on later levels.\n\nGeneral Mechanics and Combat System\nOk, this is the interesting part of the game, of course! How exactly do they combine JRPG combat with bullet-hells?\nWell, honestly, not very well, from a design standpoint. It is, however, a fun idea to experiment in a game like this!\n\nBasically, it's a turn-based bullet-hell game. The game stops every 5 seconds. When it stops, you get to choose an action. Use an item? Change weapon? Or maybe you'll simply attack. When you attack or change weapon, you'll chosen which direction you'll want to shoot, and that's about it.\nWhile it's really simply, conceptually, it has many more ideas thrown in, which I'll talk ahead, regarding weapons. (1)\n\nOutside the turn, you basicaly move vertically, trying to shoot your enemies, and dodge bullets (which is worth mentioning by itself (2)). The items aren't very interesting, although they certainly are useful. There are items that heal the party, give them full armor, 4x damage, speed, huge bombs, etc. Nothing very unique, but I'm glad they're there regardless! It adds variety and some degree of tactic to the combat.\n\nI think that's enough to give you a general idea of what the game is. Now, I'd like to discuss some aspects that may make-or-end the deal, for you.\n\n1.Weapons\nFirst off, I'll write about the weapons, since I think it's the coolest aspect of the game. There are several different weapons. And when I say different, I mean different! Not just more powerful, faster, bigger -- they actually feel different, and have mechanics of their own, playing with the turn-based side of the game.\nFor example, there's a Revolver that is a bit weak, but auto-targets close targets, killing them one by one.\nThere's a  Shotgun that shoots only in a certain range that you assign to it when you choose your turn-action -- Trading individual damage for less, spread damage.\nThere's a big Cannon that is piercing and very large shot, basically killing everything in front of it (or the direction you choose) -- however, you always have to wait for a turn for it to recharge! And using items doesn't count.\nThen, there's a Grenade Launcher and damage a radial area of your choosing.\n\nI could go on, but this gets the point across. The weapons are really different from one another, and it adds quite a lot to the combat! It also adds interesting aspects to the weird, unique concept of this game.\n\n2. Dodging enemies and bullets with 3 characters\nI've talked about my favourite aspect; now it's time for by biggest problem!\nThe game is very unbalanced. Period. There was certainly some thought put into it, since the game is beatable for sure, and item placement helps with that. However, this is a very byte-sized game, and such a thing wouldn't work on a bigger game. But I'm digressing.\n\nThe point is, when you're in battle, it's almost impossible to dodge enemies and bullets. Your only defense is actually a brutal offense. If you can kill everything before it gets to you, you're in a good spot! Otherwise, you're screwed.\n\nI mean, there are 3 characters, with a decent space between them. So, if you want to dodge, you'll have to dodge with all three at once. Besides, with the amount of enemies that there are, you'll often be overwhelmed, at one point or another. It happens a lot, but you can be more prepared on your next try.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe game doesn't require a lot of skill, directly because of this. It's a mindless game about slaughtering hordes of enemies at once, with big guns.\nStill, it's chaotic and fun! If you want a short, little, but mechanically ball-sy game, look no further! It's not perfect, but it has its moments!","February 25, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I just can't. It is a hybrid between a shmup and turn based RPG. It's hard to explain. Basically, you select the gun and the range/aim, and then once your characters shoot, you can move them up or down to dodge bullets or shoot certain monsters. AFter 5 seconds, you get another turn, usually setting up the same shots. It was kind of repetitive. The turns aren't step based, they're time based. You shoot for a few seconds and then go to the next turn. The RPG gameplay is like Pokémon, where every step you take, a monster could randomly appear.\n\nI love the artwork, but the gameplay mechanics are just, different. It's not as simple as other Vlambeer games. Try Super Crate Box, that game is the bomb, and it's free. I'd actually pay for it if they decided to charge for it. It has so much more strategy than this.","June 4, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Everytime I try to give this game a chance it just fails horribly.\nWhat seems like nice simple game in the beginning quickly and I mean quickly just becomes frustrating bullsheit. As the game just doesn't seem like it is properly playtested and doesn't give you a reasonable chance to beat the game.\nThe gameplay just doesn't work out that well when the number of enemies just overwhelms your ability to fireback enough. Dodging only literially only works within the first couple of minutes because immediately you get an ally that limits your dodging ability. On that note because of having an ally it limits certain weapon ranges. You can't use items outside of combat. Going back to the overwhelming enemies, using items is sometimes a waste of time as say if you use a revive the one using the revive would probably die afterwards thus making it a waste of time.\n\nBottom line The Random Encounter is a sheit game that looks like a decent game.","January 25","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

To be honest Serious Sam: The Random Encounter is super creative in design. It somehow combined classic bullet hell with turned based RPG. Quite a blast to play for a bit, but its problems become very apparent by the end of your first play through. The definition of bullet hell in this game is a giant wall of bullets with no way to dodge. The gameplay is super repetitive and becomes a chore due to little enemy variety. Their sprites look different but their mechanics are the pretty much the same; they run faster, shoot lasers, or explode in to a bloody mess.

This almost made me decide to change my mind. It's not good. It's almost like someone with no experience with the games other than a trailer decided to write a game to capitalize on the recent resurgence of both Sam and sprite RPGs.\n\nHrm... Almost like that indeed.\n\nIt's a turn based game with an overhead sprite view and a party of 3 guys. The gimmick is apparently that it's only partially turn based in that you have control to move your party to dodge bullets and enemies. Much like the game proper. Problem is. There's no freedom of movement and at least one member of your party will be hit even in the best of circumstances. I saw someone else say that this is a bullet hell with no way to dodge the bullets and that's pretty much spot on.\n\nIt's difficult, but not in the way Serious Sam itself is. The game proper is difficult but fair and there's always a way to win. Here it's basically luck and hoping you only get hit by most bullets rather than all of them. Plus the weapons aren't in any way like you'd think.\n\nFor example, the minigun. In Sam proper do you use it to shoot in a straight line or do you spray back and forth for crowd control? This game seems to think it's the former. The shotgun is probably the most useful hilariously enough because you can use it to shoot down some of the bullets.\n\nNothing else to say really.

The game is 100% trial and error hence the reason it blows. You have zero freedom in how you do battle. It is a neat idea pausing and letting you plan a attack every five seconds but too bad that good idea was wasted on this dog sh-t game. Serious Sam games have a very limited fan base, just enough to register as cult status, enough for them to keep making games, although Serious Sam 3 will probably be the last one. I sure as hell hope anyway. The only one that had any style and was at least somewhat fun was 2. SS1 and 3 are two of the worst games ever made, just boring, bland, lifeless slogfests of boredom. This pile of crap is right up there with them. I have zero interest in playing this garbage past the few levels I played. Maybe in the future they will learn their lesson that people want freedom of choice in games, not to have their gameplay choices handcuffed completely.\n\nUnfun dog crap garbage abandonware 0/10","April 11, 2015","false","1.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The basic premise of the game is cool, but the way that your characters are all stuck a set distance apart (like they're a row of men on a Foosball table) makes dodging incredibly frustrating, as does locking your angle of fire for each five-second turn. Also there's NO CONTROLLER SUPPORT and Windows 8 users say they can't run it. Although you heal between fights, you can't equip armor or change weapons outside of combat, which adds to the game's needless restrictiveness.\n\nIt would be a HUGE improvement if they make a sequel where the characters could move independently and aim freely during the battles.

I know this may seem like a short review, it is. Vlambeer left this game, with so much potenital in the state it's in. The difficulty spike, from what I've seen, is that of some terribly made game which expects the player to be so good after beating the first world, which would make some yell swears at the game. As well as the difficulty spike, at the end of the game, from what I've seen, after the last boss kills you, you're greeted with the normal "Game Over/You have Died" screen, but from that screen, you can't retry the stage, you're stuck in Game Over limbo until you restart the game from a save right before the boss and you can try to hope that you don't mess up and after a while, it will seem more like a nuiscance to even deal with this game anymore.\n\nSo in short, the game is a bit wonky on some computers, and even in game. So please, if you're running Windows Seven, go ahead, but if not, I'd have it in my best opinion that you spend your money on hats or even something else.","July 5, 2014","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Timewise, there’s not much: 2 hours if you’re trying to clown the final boss without using any items - i.e. if you like to die a lot. Yes, three sentences into this review and we’re already at the boss - it’s that short. But there’s a lotta game in those 2 hours, you betcha! This little guy is ripped with gameplay. Consider this: JRPG, shmup, and puzzle all within a glorious 8-bit aesthetic. {The 8-bit/retro motif has come back, and actually been back for so long now that the phrase seems to describe little.} First off, the game is incredibly generous, throwing us into the action with minimal story elements to further bog down an already belief-weary mind.\n\nSo...There’s a lotta game here. And for those of you who find endless joy in point grinding, this is a great deal for $5. SSTRE puts you on a small map with a few items to collect and lot’s of monsters to dispatch. The “random encounters” work more like minesweeper than FF: moving into certain spaces triggers an encounter. Yet unlike minesweeper, the encounters can’t be avoided - oh and there’s no run option either, mmkay? Vambreem rags on Croteam’s horde shooter by having characters automatically run backwards during combat - now come on, that’s hilarious! Hordes of enemies are, during each 5-second turn, getting closer and closer, some faster than others. A 3-option battle menu appears between each 5-second turn. The choices are limited, but as the writer says “vigor is a byproduct of brevity”. Selecting shoot has your “Sam” fire off his equipped weapon; swapping let’s you change weapons but at the cost of 2 seconds of your 5-second turn - 2 seconds you won’t have when you’re about to be obliterated by dozens of headless suicide bombers; using items is actually pretty ♥♥♥♥ing useful in this game, believe it or not: armor and attack buffs, shmuppy full-screen bombs, and instant full-party revives all seem more essential to combat than the dagone weapons!\n\nBeing a short game, weapons are introduced very early. I like that. The variety between the six weapons and their appropriate use pump up the games strategic chops. Earlier I mentioned that the weapons and items were unbalanced and choosing not to rely on the items as much really gives the difficulty a shot in the arm. Behind the weapons and enemies is your basic paper-rock-scissor mechanic. When those suicide bombers come a runnin, get out that minigun and pump em full! Use the grenade launcher on the big boys; and though it’ll cost you a full turn to charge, the cannon is great for taking out hordes of really powerful enemies - just don’t leave anything behind to take you out while recharging the cannon or swapping to a different weapon.\n\nAll in all, the game packs three levels. Not too much by any standard, to be sure, but there is some replay value here. Each of your steps is counted toward your score. So, one could play it all again, going for completion with minimal steps. Also, getting to know the different weapons, how they’re used, and who to use them with adds variety to the battles, ensuring you never have the same one twice.","February 25, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You would not call Tomato soup "Corn soup" even if the soup was red. They called it Serious Sam just because he was starring it, not because it was an actual Serious Sam game. This is too far from the original games, and thus deserves anothe name, such as "Big Guns", or "Just Shoot It". I would recommend it to be out of the Serious Sam bundle, to change the character and monster sprite + the game title and you're good to go. And Seriously (pun intended), this is not that of a bad game in a way.","August 26, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even for this kind of a game\n-You have 3 lives on each map (I don't know if this is a pro or a con, so I will leave it here), and when you spend all of the lives you restart the whole map from the beginning\n\nCONS\n-Community is almost dead\n-Game gets me angry when enemies always spawn when I have spent all of my Special Items\n\nI recommend it.

This is totally something new and different. From First person shooter to turn based topview RPG.   You have to kill enemies durign a random encounter (like a normal rpg game). They show up out of nowhere and you have to kill them in order to continue. (Pop up like Pokémon).  Whenever a battle has started you have to do an action. Every 5 seconds you are able to perform a new move. During the "action" You have to kill enemies and avoid enemy projectiles. Whenever a character dies from your side. You can either revive him or complete the entire wave so he will be revived for free. The enemies are all from the original Serious same series.\nWhenever all of your characters has died during an encounter, then you will lose a life. If game over then you will restart the same level over again.\n\nTurn based combat.\nGraphics is cartoony.\nGraphics is RPGish.\nMusic is weird.\nNot alot of "funny jokes" as we are used to know.\n\nOther things.\nEnemies that are too close, will get instantly killed however you do take some damage in return.\nBulls that are charging towards you can be avoided, Failing to do so will take a huge ammount of damage.\n\nKeep in mind that the original Developers DIDN'T UPLOAD THIS. Its just from some strange random guy.\nGame is somewhat okay. but the fact that he isn't the original developer gave me a big thumbs down.\n\nI Don't think the replayablity is that high.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 6/10","May 12","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
