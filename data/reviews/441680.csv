You can have 5 batteries & 10 matches, but you want to carry 5 tiny wooden plaques, no chance.\n- The puzzles are often frustatingly well-hidden (specifically Devs, the Tribal Masks puzzle, playing on Normal, I basically had to rub up against the masks for the objects to highlight & the Roman Numerals section of The Vault is awful trial & error crap); I'd say 10-15 minutes of game time has been from poor object highlighting.\n- The story doesn't really seem to be apparent, I'll collect notes & Sarah will give me some dialogue; but I can't read the notes, I'm interested in the story; but so far it is very thin.\n\n\nThis is pretty pricey for a horror/puzzle game on Steam, but so far it is worth it.","March 18","true","7.4"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","25","32","0","2"

Later it is becoming more challenging in a positive way; still happy. ;-)\n\nThe in game graphics are very well done and good looking (but poorly optimized; at least you can adjust several graphics settings), overall creepy atmosphere, sounds and some solid jump-scare moments.\nVaried level design with impressive love of detail: mansion, vault, cemetery, asylum, etc.\n\nVery soon it turns out that you have to play hide and seek with some creatures and face deadly challenges, such as traps…\nThe problem: Levels and challenges are getting bigger and there is no save game / check point system in place! The game saves your progress at the beginning of each section/level and if you mess up at the end, you have to do the whole thing again…\n\nLevel of difficulty: hard\nLevel of frustration: high\nMoment of sucsess: awesome\n\nI am an adult, average skilled gamer, so my findings might not apply to you... ;-)\nThe game is great and I still recommend it; even though I might never see the end…","March 21","true","15.7"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","15","20","2","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/441680/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","Obscuritas is a fairly new psychological horror game from the developer VIS Games. No newcomer to the scene, VIS Games have released a slew of PC titles, most of which are simulators or sports based. They've also released some of their titles on the Nintendo DS/Wii/GBA. However, this title is their first venture into horror; with a semi intriguing trailer and promising screenshots, Obscuritas is a game that practically begs to be played.\n\nYou will take on the role of a young woman named Sarah, and early on you learn that your great uncle has passed away. He left you his large mansion, but you must prove your mettle if you want to inherit it. Little did you know that your uncle leaves keys everywhere, has lain many a trap for you, and has so much extra cash on hand that he built his own amusement park just to screw with you. After the opening sequence, there is little in the way of story progression, save for the odd note that you will pick up; they also get less frequent the further you delve into the game. It would be nice if the story was expanded on a bit further, but it's left thinner than rice paper and Obscuritas would do just as well without it.\n\nThere are a total of 29 sequences across three chapters; though really only 28 are playable, as the last one is nothing but an end cutscene followed by credits. Through each level, you will be tasked with completing extremely vague puzzles or finding obscurely placed keys in order to progress to the next sequence. While it would be wrong to classify the game as a key finding simulator, it does need to be said that later on in the title the game focuses less and less on complex puzzles, and does have a hefty chunk of key finding. Though do not let that deter you, as the levels themselves are extremely interesting and range from a funhouse, an underground vault, a massive maze, an asylum, and even an old abandoned house with rooms that constantly change. There are many elements to Obscuritas that will play with your brain, and make you start to question your sanity and reality.\n\nWhile all of these components work well with each other, I would not go as far to say that the title is unique anymore. Quite honestly, it's a conglomeration of The Park, Layers of Fear, and Stairs, all rolled up into one game. Although the horror crowd are definitely not tired of these ode-to-Silent Hills PT love letters, and so Obscuritas is a very welcomed addition into the growing library of psychological horror games that truly mess with your mind. You may now be thinking to yourself, "but Belphegore, all of this sounds really great! Why have you given the game a down vote?", well... there are a couple of different reasons for that.\n\nMy entire experience with Obscuritas was hindered by nearly unplayable levels. Even with low graphic settings in 1080p, in 80% of the sequences I had around 15-30 FPS at all times; some levels even went down to 1 FPS and maxed out around 13. The remaining 20% played perfectly, and were usually the closed-in areas such as the fun house and the vault. Anything outdoors or in a larger indoor area such as the asylum or the mansion were complete write-offs. I am not, by any means, a stickler for high FPS games; if a game is rendering at 30, I'm fine with that. However, Obscuritas would stutter and freeze frame consistently. I definitely did not get any immersion out of the game, and this brings me to the second reason why I'm giving a downvote; I went to the forums to get help from the developer.\n\nWhoever is behind the VISGamesDev Steam account has succeeded in turning me off of purchasing any titles from them in the future. The first thread that I posted in, where someone with a 980 Ti was having the same issue that I was, got closed and the developer said that the game works perfect but the game engine isn't "powerful". They said they included a reflection that is hard to render, in an inferior engine, and apparently you need better than a 980 Ti to do so. Which leaves me begging the question as to why they would include such a "feature" in the first place:\n(   http://imgur.com/gudAmvE   )\n\nAs this isn't the case, I opened another thread to which the developer came in and basically called me a liar in regards to the title running like crap, that they tested this game on multiple systems and there are YouTube Let's Players who can run the game just fine. They act as though their coding is the word of God and could not possibly be wrong. Although the developer wouldn't directly say what game engine they were running, I am assuming this game was created in Unity since there are end credits that allude to it. Which in turn, makes me get why this game runs like absolute trash on my AMD rig (specs in profile) and why it is hit and miss on a lot of systems.\n(   http://imgur.com/HhffXxA   )\n\nSo in the long run, is Obscuritas worth it? It's a 50/50 chance, really, and if you have a hard time running it then you're pretty much SOL with a developer who couldn't care less; at least they're getting excellent Let's Plays, right? If you buy it and it runs fine, it's a really great game with a cop-out ending and menial storyline. The jumpscares are fun, the atmosphere is very thick and immersive, and the puzzles are challenging yet fun. The game lasts roughly 9 hours, which is more than acceptable for the price tag; do note that you may be playing Russian Roulette, however. Spin the chamber and take the chance, or forego supporting a developer that refuses to acknowledge either their coding or their engine needs an overhaul. It's up to you.\n\nRating: 2.0/5.0 - It's not awful, but it's not great.

Much better, if still similar, than the developers last game, Pineview Drive. There are some really great puzzles here, the only real gripe I have is that you must complete the "level" before it saves your progress. I found that it ran better than Pineview, but could still use some more optimization.

It turned out that Obscuritas was made by the same developers of Pineview Drive. Is it better or worse than Pineview Drive? Obscuritas is a lot better. Not a sequel but really good game.\n\nI have always longed to play a game where I take an adventure through an abandoned carnival and amusement park, a haunted mansion, a madhouse, and an abandoned hospital all in one. Obscuritas is that adventure and is a love letter for all people who like abandoned amusement parks, hospitals, haunted mansions, mannequins, dolls and clowns. This game truly delivered the adventure well and I cannot be happier than that.\n\nThe graphics are very simple and gorgeous at the same time that nails the atmosphere well. The atmosphere and graphics reminded me of Pineview Drive obviously, F.E.A.R., Layers of Fear, and STALKER combined in one. It worked so well that it built a lot of suspense and terror that left me feeling scared without relying on cheap ♥♥♥ jumpscares  that a lot of horror "games" use. The scary tension and atmosphere must be inspired by the works of David Lynch and Hitchcock who are very well known for creating horror and mind-bending movies.\n\nThe gameplay is much better than Pineview Drive especially with less keys and more adventuring through different places. You just look around for clues and objects to help you solve puzzles and advance through the places to provide you a part to be in the story. But that method was executed really well for this game.\n\nOne of the better horror games I have played in a long time. A word of tip: do not let that doll mess with you. ;)\n\n8.7 out of 10","March 31","true","24.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

The music is fantastic, the locations are cool and interesting, and there's a bit of Lovecraft mixed into it all. However, there are some issues with this game that make it tedious (tedium =/= difficult). For instance, the save system for this game saves at the start of each chapter, and each chapter is roughly 20 minutes long. That means if you die near the end of a chapter, you have ~20 minutes of replaying what you've already done. This is made worse by the fact that death is instant, and the game is nearly too dark to see traps (If you do play, turn the brightness up to like 80%). In addition, the puzzles scale from great to infuriating. Once again, I'm not talking about difficulty. One of the most difficult puzzles in the game was also one of my favorite. Instead, I'm referring to situations like the very first puzzle in the house, where you're given a clear, concise hint which you follow to the letter, only to realize you didn't "solve" the puzzle because you weren't at the right position.\n\nI really enjoyed the second act, but you really have to be patient if you're going to get through this game. As such, I can't personally recommend it.","March 31","false","9.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"
