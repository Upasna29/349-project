It comes with a Glide wrapper, but DOSBOX needs to have the config files edited to enable it.  Once you do so, you'll be able to get the game in much higher resoutions than were available before by using the 3DFX version.  The ranking system in game is based entirely on how many points you earn in a match, so find a good map that you can get a lot of points on and grind it as much as possible.  You can unlock some cars through play, but when you finish all the maps in the game and 'beat' it you unlock everything, even cars that don't unlock normally.  The levels do not confine you to one track, you can explore to your heart's content - assuming you don't run out of time.  Even the semi-Stand Alone expansion, the Splat Pack, is included.  Just remember, this is an old game with some early design ideas that didn't always work well, but the game IS very fun to play and enjoy!","July 15, 2014","true","30.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rawglor/recommended/282010/","rawglor","яawz™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rawglor/","389 products in account","Ah, Carmageddon, a game where you don't just race other opponents, but also try to destroy them, and run over hundreds of innocent pedestrians in the process. Wicked fun. And you are rewarded for all of this, which makes it even more fun. The game even lets you know how many pedestrians there are on each level, so you can make sure every single one is mangled.\n\nThere are some old games that I think have really good looking graphics, even though they aren't very realistic like modern games. Carmageddon is one of them. There's a grittiness and personallity to the graphics that new games don't have. The lower detail of the graphics also gives the game a little more challenge, as it can be hard to see things coming up at times (at least before you get used to the graphics}.\n\nThe game can be annoying at times though. I found the vehicle handling/controls hard to get used to as first. At least with one car, you can easily get stuck to walls, and have to steer into the wall to get free. That doesn't really stop being annoying. Also if you go too fast up a steep hill, you can end up launching off and flying way too far, and will end up needing to be recovered. These minor things don't detract from the fun though.\n\nThe game has some good music that goes good with the game. There some rock songs and some electronic songs. But if you don't like them or get tired of them, you can always turn on some Metal. Metal goes great with this game.\n\nCarmageddon is a lot of fun. If you like games like Postal or GTA. If you like running over people, wrecking cars, and causing chaos, then you will like this game. If you haven't already played it and don't own it, then you should get it now. Or when it's on sale.\n\n9.5/10","January 16","true","2.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

Armour and Speed upgrades you can put on to your car will help immensely.\nThe other 2 ways are the bog standard checkpoint route and running over every single pedestrian which will take a LOT of time as there are hundreds of them every race and hidden all over the track.\nThere are also plenty of powerups strewn throughout the races both fun and useful such as an electro ray and frozen opponents, or disadvantageous to you such as jelly suspension and turbo cops.\nSpeaking of cops, you will occasionaly encounter them as you first play but towards the end there will be cops around almost every corner and are very hard to destroy making the later courses fairly difficult.\n\nThe graphics are still very playable to this day with nice car and damage modelling, funny pedestrian sprites and a decent variety of track layouts to explore. The audio is equally decent with a kickass soundtrack from Fear Factory and the crashes and clangs of each car not to mention the funny quips from your pratcam driver.\nWith over 30 cars to drive when completed and over 30 tracks to complete there is plenty of value to be had, not to mention the splat pack expansion which adds an additional 20 tracks and cars each.\n\nOverall Carmageddon is a timeless classic that all oldskool pc gamers and racing fans will enjoy,\n","August 15, 2014","true","10.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","3"

This game become an instant cult hit back then when games were going through the hard time of being too violent ect.  It stood out because, yes it was graphic and violent, but also it was a different sort of racing game.  In such you can win a race by doing all the checkpoints in order and doing laps like a regular race, wrecking your opponents cars ( my tactic of choice ) or killing every single pedestrian on the map.\n\nAlong with these unique races come proper zany as hell power ups.  Like my faves Solid Granite Car and Pedestrian Electro-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ray...yes thats a thing...and many more, even combining into some outstanding effects.\n\nThe AI racers also have some good AI as well.  They are set in their ways and go about racing their own way.  Some wanna race, some wanna run over peds and some just wanna turn around and ram you all shapes to Sunday.\n\nYes the game looks dated, so what!?  its a great game to begin with and has a sweet soundtrack, with 3 tracks supplied by Fear Factory from their album Demanufacture.\n\nNice and simple upgrade system, no fussing around or logic needed, just choose either upping your Offense, Armour or Speed.\n\nAll in all I am personally pleased this game has made it to Steam and give a new generation a chance at what was once one of the worlds more controversial games.","October 8, 2014","true","20.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ceekur/recommended/282010/","Ceekur","Ceekur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ceekur/","478 products in account","*Includes Impressions Video*\nWhere to begin with this classic entry of car carnage? It's race how you want at its finest. You can either wreck your opponents or drive over all its spectators (read: everyday bystanders and pedestrians), or merely hit all the checkpoints (still driving way off-track to get there quicker). Hitting opponents and peds award time and credits, the latter used to upgrade your vehicle's armor, engine, and offensive strength. Your race profits determine how many rankings you rise, which unlock new routes and environments to crash through. Once you dip into sub-80s, you unlock additional vehicles through random chance after wrecking certain opponents.\n\nThere are dozens of crazy car designs that all handle differently, included with driver info for the completion of crazy. Your standard Eagle (or Die Anna's Hawk) has very good starting stats and will carry the player through most of the game even so though. Once you beat the game, you may want to drive the inaccessible ones even...\n\nThere is no race happening, no concern about position, no pit-stops, and no rules. For the player, there is no option but first place. You may get bonuses by knocking objects and lampposts into the peds, driving backwards or sliding into them, or sandwiching them on a wall. Power-ups (although temporary) add to this chaos. They can modify your abilities, increase your engine power, respawn all peds, freeze opponents, turbo the opponents, allow you to drive unhindered underwater, increase your damage strength and so on. This game has introduced some of the wackiest additions to races, including but limited to, Pinball Mode, Jelly Suspension, Gravity From Jupiter, and Wall Climber.\n\nThe damage modeling is dynamic and even today we are only just starting to refine how this is done, such as with BeamNG and Next Car Game. Burnout may be considered one of the first, but Carmageddon really is the first to feature real-time 60 fps 3D racing as well as dynamic damage modeling based on how you have collided your car. No two impacts are the same (and your opponents will never be left the same!). Internal damage is incurred through these high-speed impacts and usually matches the severity of the cosmetic damage. Each component is given a damage indicator which moves from Unmarked, Green, and Red/Orange, to flashing Red, finally Black - Damaged wheels are not straight on the axle and bounce your car around, while a broken transmission will constantly stall your car back into the first gear. A damaged steeling column will hinder your turning ability, randomly making it turn the opposite way, with blackened disabling steering altogether.\n\nThe Max Pack includes both the original Carma and its Splat Pack expansion, launching through the DOSBox emulator. You are given the option of launching with original software graphics, or emulating it in 3DFX Glide, which beautifully renders the models and environment on modern graphics cards. Most of the textures handle modern resolutions well, and using Nvidia's Anti-Alias override (on the DOSBOX exe) smoothes out any minor jaggies remaining. It uses the original CD images of the games, then mounts them virtually. This is not a port, but rather a very good package that lets these classics run out of the box.\n\nOnline play appears to be a possibility in this version, with selectable "Launch Carmageddon Multiplayer Host" and "Client" launch options. In practice, it actually does work without any third-party tools, with the host only needing to forward Port 213 in their router. However it has severe desync issues, especially randomly freezing the other car (for one player though) if they separate into another area of the map - which instantly means a desync. This package is provided as-is, so we will have to see if this area is ever improved. It is likely to be a dosbox issue more than Carmageddon itself though.\n\nOn the whole, side, front, half, this game is really recommended. Fans of the game should like what they get; it is as close to the original as can be played on modern systems. It is as fun as you remember it. The damage systems and gameplay style have aged fairly well. The physics are arcadey and floaty (in a good way), as you find yourself flying through the air when you ramp off a sign, then somehow land on your wheels. Despite that, you can still keep your wheels straight without randomly losing traction, even at decent speed. For newcomers, I would say the learning curve is not much (stress-relief ya know) and they will enjoy its charm and freedom even with newer car games now available.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ_G5-En4yw","July 12, 2014","true","9.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The cartoon physics are as spotty as ever, and the rock-stupid A.I.  goes from quaint to frustrating in five minutes flat. As is the sad fate of nearly every early use of 3-D graphics, the game's visuals have aged horribly: The low maximum draw distance is the most harmful to gameplay, but the game's entire appearance is so primitive that it can take a minute before your eyes can even decode the blobby, jagged blur of early polygon magic whizzing by you. All of that said, none of that completely negates that one most important thing: FUN. Nasty, sneering, blood-drenched fun. Making cars go smash, plowing through churchgoers, and, for the more advanced student, crushing and electrocuting two entire football teams, all remain as satisfactory as ever.\nBottom line, it's a bit of cult gaming history, perfect for fans of racing and comedic ultra-violence alike.

It's a racing game at heart, but you can finish the race either by actually racing, killing every one of your opponents, or running over every pedestrian in the track. The latter is the most difficult, as there are typically about 400-500 peds per map.\n\nWhile the game has certainly aged and carries  with it the stigma of its 1990s-era graphics, there is little in the way of alternatives that offer a better experience at this time. Suffice it to say, if this game is up your alley, you can deal with the graphics. And you will, because the game is that worth playing.\n\nDon't go into this expecting a story. Go into it for completion, for upgrading your car and becoming more proficient in killing everything in sight, and you'll love this game beginning to end.","July 14, 2014","true","1.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You get huge, huge amounts of time to actually complete the race, and every car you destroy or every civilian you run down adds a not insignificant amount to it. I wanted it to be more like an actual race, one where you have to quickly explore and find the secrets in order to get enough time to either finish or kill your opponents. Something quicker and snappier. I found out that Hard mode solves all of my complaints - you start out with 30 seconds, which means you need to start driving on the sidewalk immediately to turn wholesome North American guts into fuel for your hell vehicle. It encourages breaking off from the "track" to see the city and find new exciting pedestrians to murder. It is tough as ♥♥♥♥ but it is well worth it to see all the cool hidden areas the developers thoughtfully put in. It's that or wander around the track until you decide that killing every pedestrian is a ♥♥♥♥ing tedious exercise and end up destroying the other combatants. Or finishing the race, because you are 50 years old and you need to get back to filling out your Old People Forms.\n\nAnyway, Carmageddon is one of the greats and despite my moaning about it it's still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun to play after all these years.","January 11, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I used to play the two games back in the 90s on the PC of my cousin and it was a blast. Although it has aged this is still a nice racing game. There are some issues though. The 3dfx graphics, although older, are nice but this version caused sound issues on PC when the sound would just stop. The no-3dfx version feels a tad bit too clunky. The key binding is fixed and even though you can pick from 4 variants it still would have been nice to be able to configure your own setting. Als worth mention is that although Steam gives you options for multiplayer it does not have many players around so it is not worth bothering. Soundtrack and effects are really really great and the racing feel you get is even better (enhanced by the big amount of tracks).

This same game used to run just fine on my my parent's computer 10 years ago but when I try to play it now, it's jittery and the audio is very distorted. I love the game and everything but this needs to be fixed. The only way it'll run smoothly is if I turn off all the textures, which makes it so I can't see anything, which defeats the purpose of playing.","March 31, 2015","true","11.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Just get the mobile version...the only time I'll ever say that ever. This game uses DOSBOX and it looks pixelated and ugly as hell, all while running at 20-40FPS. It's almost unplayable imo.
