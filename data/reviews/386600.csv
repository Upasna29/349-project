Half the time stuff was blowing up and coming towards me, and i had no idea what was going on. You keep on dieing by things that are unclear and are barely visible. I played a very short time, cause i saw no point in playing it anymore. The layout is still very much a mobile port at this stage as well. So right now i would not recommend buying it, frankly not even on a sale. unless they make things more clearer and cleaner on the screen.","July 23, 2015","false","0.2"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","23","36","0","0"

The design of characters and overall map is really good for a pixel game, but the game it self punches you in the stomach of it's hard diffuclty and design.\n\nWhen you die, you start in the beginning and the map stays as you left it. The walls and death people will stay destroyed. Every wall and ground can be destroyed so far. The only thing i don't understand is why a pixel game should have football practice map for a shooter game, in it's tutorial.\n\nThe game was not my cup of tea, and i lost interest really quickly, but the game works fine without problems, which is why i recommend this for people who enjoy pixel games. The game offers alot of different content and gamemodes to play in. - I'm sure that people who enjoy this kind of games will find many hours of fun as the games offers many different modes.\n\nHere is a demo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edLfXN-EQQw&list=PLxDx_O1l8oBtHe9pUJypZY591kZIzg2uc&index=1","August 1, 2015","true","1.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Controls seem a bit "floaty" and no music yet.  Price is reasonable. I still think you should wait to buy.\n\nHere is some no commentary gameplay.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ck0h8buK30","July 24, 2015","true","0.9"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","1"

There is so much more structure and refinement on display that it's like a total conversion and t didn't need that much work to be good. The developer has stuck with it and went above and beyond what I would have expected. Well done.\n\nI won't comment elaborately on the unnecessary aggression shown by the developer regarding my review. I know how hard it is to work hard and release something into the world only to get hit with a negative review.\n****************************\nOld review below\n\nWhy would I say 90% nice things about a game that I do NOT recommend?\n\nTLDR: This game could be a perfect replacement for Expendabros and I mean that in a complimentary manner. It has tons of characters to choose from, although I find the current differences to be less than thrilling, it's a lot for an early access game to have so many choices already. Same thing with the world choices. All of this sounds good still, so why not recommend it?\n\nIt's all content and they have yet to fix basic function. It's really frustrating, which isn't new to EA games, but it's frustrating for an entirely new reason. The menu functions are awful and you have to switch back and forth between keyboard, mouse and gamepad. The physics engine in the game needs a lot of tweaking making basic controls a little wonky. Again, these are things that EVERY developer fixes before exposing the game to the public. There are a few other basic issues like this that make me nervous. With so many of the budget priced developers abandoning their games right after cashing in with a launch I HAVE to tentatively say wait to buy. A competent developer will get this under control in a week or two at most. If I don't ammend this to a positive recommendation by Sept 15, I never will. To be fair to the Dev, I have set a Google calendar reminder to check in on the game and ammend my review. I wish them luck and REALLY hope they pull it off.","August 26, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"
