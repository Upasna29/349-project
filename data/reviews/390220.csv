My recommendation is a cautious one however, random events seem to exsist to squeeze your money from you due to the odds of them going well are extremly low, the music is just a single song on an endless loop and "bad stuff happening" music sting the AI can be absolutly brutal, and all the Co-op is local meaning that you can see what each other is doing instead of having the luxory of hiding your devious actions behind the internet. But over all if you want something cheap and light hearted, you cant go wrong with Toilet Tycoon","September 24, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","9","12","6","0"

I may get another play through but don't really expect 20 hours of play time.  For what it is, I had a good time so I will recommend it.

Of course this does not compare to other games currently available in any way, and will probably seem very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you've got no sort of emotional connection to it, but that does not mean it is a bad game.

I got this game (DRM free) in a Groupees Bundle earlier this year (2015).  It's a turn-based game where you compete against the CPU to try to own and equip the most profitable toilets.\n\nIt has two major problems.  One, your CPU opponent can send the sanitation board after you, and even if you cleaned your toilets 100% in your prior turn, they can cite you for having a terrible mess and divest you of that toilet and all its equipment.  Not fun, and doesn't feel fair.\n\nTwo, the icons to control the various functions of the game are so, so tiny, it's an exercise in tedium just to click the buttons.  And you have to click a lot of buttons to equip a new toilet, so the combination of these two flaws (losing your toilet and all its equipment, and the tedium of equipping a new one) kills this game.  Either alone might be tolerable.  Together they are infuriating, adding insult to injury.\n\nI guess I played about 90 minutes before giving up on it.  It's definitely a turd.\n\nI loaded this up and let it sit (no "sit" or "load" jokes, please) in order to accumulate playtime, just so I could warn you all away from this.  I see that the existing negative reviews aren't particularly informative.  I hope this one is more helpful.\n\nFinally, I just want to say that it is obnoxious for Valve to require playtime (and not just ownership) of a game before reviewing.  It should be obvious by now that many people play games before they get released on Steam, and those people have legitimate opinions, too.  It's also obnoxious that they have yet to fix their review-posting bug whose only workaround is to post a one-word review and then edit it.","September 28, 2015","false","0.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/390220/","trar","Hammurabi of Babylon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/","318 products in account","This game is nihilist art. The Germans, not satisfied with their extensive library of ho-hum simulators and scat porn, have combined the two in a toilet management tycoon game that almost invariably becomes a titanic, never-ending struggle for toilet primacy - albeit solely in an unnamed German city. As people will never stop pooping, so will the Toilet Wars rage for eternity.\n\nI mean, that's probably because the game's already simple mechanics are broken six ways from Sunday, but still.\n\n\nOne thing this game has going for it, apart from the 1997-era graphics, Google Translated text, and general shovelware aesthetic, is the number of victory conditions to choose from. I say this because picking the default condition, to achieve the highest rank of Toilet Tycoon, will most likely end up in defeat or stalemate. (The AI difficulty is hidden in the options menu and defaults to 'normal', for what that's worth.)\n\nIf a stalemate happens, you're in for a long period of spamming chance-based sabotage attacks at the AI's toilets. The hope is that their toilets will become filthy enough for the sanitation inspector to revoke their permit, allowing you to swoop in and buy the toilet stalls. The AI will try do the same to you. The fact that this sabotage consists of hiring goons for several thousand Euros each to smash or puke on the toilets (mainly puke), complete with sound effects, is just icing on the urinal cake.\n\nDespite the oodles of money you and the AI will have from your turbo-charged solid emerald thrones with attached cup holders - that people incidentally don't mind paying for by the way - sabotage attacks and inspector visits can only be carried out once a turn. And since the sabotage always has a chance of failing, and since the inspector's mood fluctuates daily, it could always be for nothing.\n\n\nThe dominant player (did I mention there's only 2 players to a game?) is continually given free toilet items every turn from a bingo, and while it's only really helpful when players are initially building up, good rolls count for more than skill there. Random events can also turn the tide, although in practice the AI always eventually uses them to screw you in a stalemate. Research is also luck-based, which means even more wasted money.\n\nThis game is therefore like World War 1 by way of Dungeons & Dragons, with toilets, where fittingly enough you can only play as Germany. The Great Toilet War module for 5e. And this isn't even mentioning:\n\n* the stupidly opaque and quite possibly broken rating system which the Toilet Tycoon victory condition revolves around,\n* the fact that there's really nothing else to do once players are established other than re-enacting the Great War and questioning why this is even on Steam,\n* the criminally small un-updated 640x480 resolution buttons that make actually administrating your toilets a chore,\n* the fact that there's an entire fourth of the game world with substantially less traffic which means starting there is a death knell,\n* the eternal mystery that is the "Pig of the Round",\n* or the inane looping music that will drive you up the wall.\n\n\nYou'll enjoy seeing your numbers go up, of course, and bad game aficionados will obviously like this one too. But while most of the other victory conditions let the player win, in true nihilist fashion the game won't actually end, and thus the only real victory is pressing Quit.","October 8, 2015","false","3.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","45","5","11","4","8"
