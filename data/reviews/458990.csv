It is a puzzle game with an interesting story and now the controls are fixed it is mostly fun to play and does not cause me any nausea.\n\nHigh points:\nHuge play area, lots of “wow” moments.\nFun puzzles\nGreat humour\nThe light gun is fun to use\nGreat music\n\nThere a a few issues to a aware of:\n1. Movement control was still a bit odd I would it have liked to have moved in the direction I was pointing the controller rather than the direction I was facing. Otherwise you can't run and shoot to the side.\n2. There is no save feature I could find, so you have to play though in one session which can take a couple of hours\n3. Replay is pretty limited as the play is a bit linear\n4. Am I supposed to kill all the poor arachnids? seems a bit cruel:)\n5. A bit too easy for my liking\n6. Music could be a bit load and obscure the dialog\n7. Half the time you are shooting a sphere and getting any fine control can be frustrating.\n","May 9","true","3.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Like dune or something. Game fire explosions are awesome. Graphics are fairly good. But the game has no save feature, nothing realy happens, you walk around for hours and might find a lame !@# puzzle and thats  it. Shooting is just a weird beach ball like fireball sphere. 20 dollars is quite a high step.","May 28","false","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Very restrictive free movements and lacks true room scale.  Defintely meant to be played sitting down because just few minutes of it makes you queasy.","May 2","false","0.1"," 24 of 52 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","24","52","3","4"
