"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RemyLabue/recommended/301200/","RemyLabue","RemyLabue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RemyLabue/","394 products in account","Frederic: Evil Strikes Back is the sequel to one of my favorite rhythm games of all time, Resurrection of Music. If you haven't yet read my review on that game, take a minute to do that now.\n\nRoM was a fantastic game for many reasons, the most important of which is the music. Carefully remixing select compositions from Chopin's work was a stroke of genius, and was the heart and soul of an amazing experience that should not be missed. If you haven't yet played it, you are missing out on something really special. So the sequel should be another masterpiece, right?\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I have to condemn this game for what it is. What made the first game special, the music, is why the sequel falls flat on its face. Take the heart and soul from a work of art, and you're left with an unrecognizable shell, feeding off of the success of its predecessor. That is what has occurred here, and I couldn't be any more disappointed with the results.\n\nWhen I try to imagine what they could do to make a fantastic sequel, I see many possibilities. Something as simple as more of the same, remixing more of Chopin's compositions into more tracks, would have been perfectly acceptable. Teaming up with other well known musicians like Beethoven or Bach and remixing their music would have been great as well. If the premise isn't broken, then you shouldn't try to fix it. Forever Entertainment has already proven that they are more than capable of doing any of those things, so my expectations were high for the next game in this franchise.\n\nUnfortunately, that is not the direction the developers took with this sequel. All of the tracks in this game are completely original, and instead of matching the style of a particular country, they match the style of famous musician. For example, a couple of the characters you come across are parody versions of Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. Not a terrible idea, but the original music fails to be catchy, fun to play, and in some cases, even tolerable to listen to. As I have stated in the past, rhythm games are only as good as the music they include, which makes this game absolutely terrible.\n\nTaking Chopin's work out of the franchise entirely just doesn't make sense to me. Remixing his compositions to fit the style of these particular musicians would have been easy enough, and it would have been interesting to hear Lady Gaga's rendition of Raindrops. Without his music, this game just feels uninspired, and it becomes a chore to even finish it.\n\nTo be fair, the rest of this game hasn't changed a bit. The gameplay is exactly the same, the art style hasn't changed, the story is just as nonsensical, and the voice acting is just as stroke inducing as in Resurrection of Music. There are no surprises here.\n\nIt's a shame that the developers forgot what made the first game so special. Maybe the third game in the franchise will return it to its roots, but I will be researching it first before wasting money on another sequel.","November 18, 2014","false","5.5"," 51 of 61 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","51","61","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/recommended/301200/","kalirion","kalirion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/","2884 products in account","The main reason I'm not recommending this game is that this sequel is so much worse than the first game - Frederic: Resurrection of Music.  The music is worse, the story is worse (overall plot about the same, but not the execution), and worst of all (in my opinion) is that this time around the songs don't match the enemies you duel at all.   One early fight puts you up against a parody of the band KISS, and the song is about as far from Hard Rock or Metal as you can get.\n\nIt's hard to believe that the original team is responsible for this sequel.  The gameplay is about the same, but what's around it is beyond dissappointing.  Go back to Resurrection, no need to bother with Evil Strikes Back.","January 13, 2015","false","3.1"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","32","40","0","0"

While the game may have some charm, it is let down by its execution. Three examples:\n\n- The game is designed for touch controls, not keyboards. That is a limited market, and it is made worse by very poor rebinding options. You can't spread controls adequately across the keyboard because the numberpad and several other keys cannot be bound.\n\n- "Easy" mode does not make the gameplay (which is quite tough at times) any easier at all. It's the same flood of notes at the same speed. The difference is that it simply lets you win pretty much no matter how badly you do. So much for any sense of achievement.\n\n- Worst of all, the autosave system is terribly designed. After winning a battle, you are presented with a screen allowing you to go to the main menu, replay the battle or continue. If you go to the main menu, you'll resume after that battle, right? NO! It takes you back to the START of the battle. Want to save after a battle? Well, you'll have to skip through all the cutscenes and quit at the start of the NEXT battle in order to do so. Utterly bizarre.\n\nAdd in the fact that the game can be completed in under two hours, and it's hard to recommend.","August 7, 2015","false","2.8"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","1"

Can't hit chords with the single mouse input and can't click the flying notes when you are using the keyboard. The game is 100% designed around touch and do not buy this if you aren't going to be playing it on a touch device.\n\nOn top of this, the notes you need to play will randomly be out of sync with the music, so if you play to the music, like you should in rhythm games, you will miss notes.\n\nLastly, the entire interface, notes and keys, are WAY too big for monitors. If they made a proper version of this for the PC, it should be smaller so that you can see everything easier and let you see the upcoming notes sooner.","May 20, 2015","false","0.3"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","18","26","0","0"

I don't understand the mentality of indie developers putting so-called "impossible" achievements or extremely difficult ones especially when their entire games are so easy and bloody casual. It seems that the developers want to ruin some fun for some of their players, or they just didn't put much thought before adding them. Not all games have to be easy and some are extremely hardcore. But again, if you aim to make a casual game, please don't add impossible achievements. This alone pisses me off so I don't recommend this game.\n\n.

The second (Evil Strikes Back) is by far my favorite, although they're both very good, cheesy story line and voice acting considered.  It's just a really charming series, even if both can be completed in a good hour or so of play.  In Evil Strikes Back the original scores have very catchy melodies, so much so that I plan on adding at least a few tracks to my collection.  I highly recommend both Frederic games, they're very well done, very fun, and it's hard to beat free soundtracks as well.","May 25, 2014","true","6.0"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

Whereas the previous installment was equal parts satire of the recording industry and love letter to the late, great Frederic Chopin, this one has more nods to musicians that were deceased far more recently, with amazing tributes to the likes of Falco, Freddie Mercury, and Michael Jackson. You won't hear Chopin's influence here, but you'll still hear some amazing tracks that duplicate the folk and contemporary music of the regions that you visit. It's not only deceased musicians who get their due, either, with characters lampooning the likes of KISS and Lady Gaga.\n\nThe part that was disappointing to me, however, was the story. The first game was quirky and charming, with clever satire mixed with other jokes and jabs at pop culture or random silly bits strewn about. Frederic himself was a somewhat smug, if charming, fish out of water, what you would expect of a composer who had been dead for a century and a half being brought back to life in today's world, trying to adjust to modern musical trends while keeping his own legacy alive and learning the reason for his return.\n\nThis time around, Frederic is almost insufferably full of himself, not to mention extremely modernized. This could have worked if some amount of time had passed, but the story is supposedly set immediately after the ending of the last game. He frequently trades substance for style, which seems to be running theme of this game this time around. It's still entertaining, it's just sad to see the hero, who was so lovable the first time around, turn into something rather obnoxious with little reasoning for it.\n\nSPOILERS:\nAt the beginning of the game, Frederic loses his heart (I assume in a metaphorical sense, considering the imagery), which could explain the way he's behaving, if it weren't for a few things: 1.) he still manages to be kind and charitable when it suits him, 2.) he was acting this way both before and after it was returned and 3.) the first game already dealt with him trying to find his heart, in a more literal fashion (a nod to the controversy surrounding the fact that while Chopin was interrered in Pere Laichez cemetary in Paris, his heart is enshrined in an urn filled with alcohol in Warsaw). Basically, he's already gone around without a heart, and managed to be a good character regardless of it, if an unwitting pawn in a grander scheme.\n\nThat's not to say this game isn't without its  own degree of charm and humor. Most of the references are nods to internet memes this time around, sometimes subtly, sometimes more obviously but to hilarious effect (especially the ending). But as a music game, if you're not in it for the story, then it's still more than solid. The soundtrack is easily equal to, if it doesn't surpass, the first game's, and the gameplay hasn't been radically changed, but mixed up just enough to keep it fresh.\n\nIt's sad that the storytelling isn't as strong as it was the first time around, but like the previous game, the fact that it includes a free copy of its stellar soundtrack makes it worth the price of admission alone. That you get a fun and quirky music game in the deal is all gravy.","June 27, 2014","true","6.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

Now to explain how impossible it is to play this on pc, so I played the last game with my mouse and had a generally good time the story was dumb and the ending fairly awful, but the music was good , this time you cannot play with a mouse no matter how good you are with one. basically from the onset you are beset with a swarm of notes that you will miss most of, and as you go further it obviously gets harder and more likely you will get a lower score. Keyboard is no better you're undoubtedly off tempo with keyboard, like I changed up the keybindings  for keyboard and, even though I followed the tempo i still missed almost every note. So yeah controls are awful seriously just play this with touch input. there is a point where I almost quit because a German dancing robot hit me with a million simultaneous notes at once, like how do you hit all those notes at once? do i just slam my hand all over the keyboard and hope for the best?\nMaybe I should have headbutt my monitor for best results.\n\nTLDR:\n\nAside from some decent music, this game is a definite pass.\n\nPlay the previous title in the series, way more fun and you get to play as a proper respected Chopin, not some swaglord ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who by the end of the game goes super saiyan for some ridiculous reason.\n\nIf you absolutely must get this game wait for a sale, do NOT buy at full price it's not worth it.\n\n2/10","September 22, 2015","false","1.2"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","1"

Maybe i bought this only because i´m a Chopin fan but i realize that Chopin music has almost nothing do to with this game;\n\nAs a musician that did not work well for me and i did not like to use the keyboard for this, so i soon gave up with thinking that´s not a good game to play on PC.\n\nBut maybe it will work well if you get used to play on keyboard, or with a controller, or a guitar pad or even a midi controller, but i´m not sure because bindage is limited and not possible with all keys.\n\nI recommend this game if you really like this genre and are skilled timing button presser, otherwise you can skip it.\n","June 16, 2015","false","3.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

(Spoiler!: look out for the smooth criminal in Hollywood) The artwork seems to have been improved as well in this version, but the same cheesy humor that is prevalent in the first game is still here and has only been enhanced. This whole style of dialogue is reminiscient of monkey island, which if you haven't guessed yet is one of my favorites. Don't buy this game for it's gameplay value unless you really enjoy Rhythm based games such as guitar hero or Dance dance revolution-esque gaming. However if you appreciate both visual and auditory art then i would recommend shelling out a few dollars for this lesser-known masterpiece.","December 11, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you are a classical music fan and was hoping for more Chopin interpretations, you'll be disappointed. Unlike the first "Frederic" that used modern takes on Chopin classics, this version uses close approximations to more modern music. The music is still really good, though. (As a Queen fan, I particularly enjoyed their take on "Radio Ga Ga".)\n\nAnd also like original, I recommend this more for those who have laptops with touchscreens or a Windows Surface. Trying to play this game on a PC keyboard is a source of great frustration for people who play musical keyboards because it's very difficult to get keyboard keys in a position that accurately approximates a musical keyboard. But playing on a touchscreen feels amazingly natural. Even more difficult levels still feel good to play with a touchscreen.\n\nSo, if you have a touchscreen laptop or a Surface, I *highly* recommend this game as  well as its predecessor. If you're on a PC keyboard, remap the keys until they feel just right for you or else you're going to be in for a lot of frustration.","November 10, 2014","true","2.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I recommend getting both in the bundle, don't bother with this game alone considering the similar price. The gameplay is good, with a few new note types in this game. However, the entire style of the game shifted awkwardly. Visually it seems better, but Chopin is less charming and less developed as a character. He's no longer a stranger in a new world, but more of a 80's popstar working to save himself. More of the jokes go from awkwardly hilarious to groaningly memetic. Meanwhile, the voiceovers that could've started their own memes are notably toned down. It's harder to tell that there are only a few voice actors in this version, but it's less charming and natural.\n\nProbably the most important thing is the music. This time it is far-less inspired by Chopin, but the tracks are enjoyable to play. Nothing stuck with me the same way as the first game, but it's still fun. Fans of the story may be underwhelmed, it's not quite a classic. There is fair replayability if you are aiming to improve and complete higher difficulties, but it's easy enough to complete on the lower difficulties in 90 minutes. I can recommend the bundle at full price if you like the idea and plan to beat all the difficulties. If you are just wanting to play once or twice, I'd recommend a 50% off weeklong deal.","September 1, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Nevertheless as a pianist I found this rather enjoyable.\nThe story follows a 'badass' chopin around as he travels round the world defeating various famous figures/musicians on a search for his harp... Yeah.\nThe story and writing is bizarre, it's like so bad it's good, only to be beaten by the voice acting which just adds to the bad-good thing.

Please have that in mind while i describe the game as "way too easy" and such.\n\nFirst off i have to say, that i just skipped through every cutscene in the game. They just feel super cheasy but take a lot of time to sit through. I think the development time spent on them might have better been used for improving the core gameplay.\nSpeaking of which, what does it offer?\n\nWell, sadly not that much. The game gives you 7 keys to work with, 4 in the lower row and 3 in the upper row (as black notes), which is not enough. 4 keys in the lower row mean, that you can´t simulate chords propperly, which i felt was missing from this game. Having 5 keys instead to play chords wouldn´t make a huge difference tho, as there is no second hand to accompany it.\nWith only one hand, the game is just way too easy. It took me 3 levels to get used to the pattern and after that, i felt that there really wasn´t anything to improve on.\nThats even more troubling as the game lacks the courage to put notes onto the playfield. Instead of using fewer notes for the easier difficulties and then gradually increasing the notes in the higher ones, all difficulties have the same set of notes.\nThere were so many times that i felt they could have easily tripled the number of notes to make me keep wanting to play the game and improve, to make meactually feel like really playing the song...\n\nthat said, there are some good notes here. The music is really cool and the overall design feels very smooth. Tho what i took from this game was starting on the lowest difficulty to get used to the gameplay, finding it too easy, going into a higher difficulty and then figure out that i´ve basically seen it all. Now i had fun in this game for a few minutes, so if you´re really bored just go for it, but there are better, free games out there with way more content that i to this day didn´t get tired of.\n\nSo yeah, even tho i liked the game, i can´t recommend it...","March 21","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
