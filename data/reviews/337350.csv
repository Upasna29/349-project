I was a big fan of the freeware version from back in 2007, and this is an improvement in every way. Fast, tough, smooth, challenging, fair. It has everything you want from a masocore game, as well as having an interesting control scheme and a wonderful trashy glitchy aesthetic. To top it off, there's a Steamworks integrated level editor, which I'm sure will be flooded with neat stuff soon enough.

This game (I've only been playing for like 45 minutes but I'm already in love) seems to improve on the original, with a more stable-feeling engine and a more satisfying approach to flying and flapping and sliding through gates.

There aren't any platforms to speak of but I can't think of another way to describe Flywrench.   You're a small white rectangle with the ability to flap yourself to ascend while turning red and tumble and bounce off walls while turning green.  You pass harmlessly through barriers of the color you currently are, whereas you die immediately if you hit a different-color wall or barrier.  The controls are extremely tight and that's good because this game quickly becomes very challenging.  Your (numerous) failures don't annoy however because upon death you respawn immediately and try again.   Also helpful is the fact that new worlds (each one introduces a new mechanic) are unlocked once a set number of stages are completed so if you find a stage particularly difficult, you can skip it and come back later without hampering progression.   It evokes both Super Meat Boy and N+ and comes highly recommended to anyone who likes difficult stage-based platform challenge games.","August 25, 2015","true","1.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It's been a long time coming anyways.\n\nIn a way, Flywrench is similar to precision platformers such as Super Meat Boy (it was even an unlockable character in meatboy). However, in many other ways it is not. For one, the game isn't a platformer, it's hard to even label the game under a specific genre. Flywrench is its own very unique thing, and plays like no other game I've played. The game has a fantastic sense if flow to it making moving through the game a really enjoyable experience. This sense of flow has contributed to me spending 60+ hours doing time trials and speedruns in this game, as moving through the game quickly is one of the most satisfying experiences I have had with a game.\n\nI do personally have a lot of problems with the game though. Firstly, I personally feel that the levels are way to short. This gets fixed later in the game however early levels only take 1-3 seconds to clear which makes clearing them feel really trivial and a bit silly. Some of the levels especially are more about getting the angle or bounce the game wants rather than taking any actual skill from the player. Get past the first half of the game however and it really starts to pick up with the final set of levels being one of my favourite parts of any game. Secondly, the game is very short. Don't let the hours on my account fool you, a first playthrough of the game will only take the player 2-4 hours, depending on their skill level. While there is a lot of extra content with time trials and the level editor, if that sort of thing does not interest you there's very little to keep you playing a long time. I would personally say that with how enjoyable the game is, 4 hours of gameplay is worth full price, but I understand that this differs greatly from person to person.\n\nOverall Flywrench is a fantastic package. Despite it's issues it remains the best experience I have had in 2015 and I will likely continue to play it well into the future. Unique gameplay, interesting level design, and fantastic music and presentation make this game something special. If you interested in these sorts of games, I highly suggest you check this out.","November 25, 2015","true","118.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While the gameplay is simple, requiring only a couple buttons, the game does a great job creating interesting levels. Most of the levels take between five to twenty seconds to complete but you will die a lot as you work out how to avoid all of the obstacles.\n\nGames where you die constantly usually frustrate me but due to the short length of the levels it's not so bad since you lose little progress when you die. Also a majority of the game is moderately difficult. Only the last two or three worlds become really challenging.\n\nIf the idea behind the game doesn't interest you, you probably won't like the game.

It felt a lot like hotline miami, where you just zone out to the AMAZING soundtrack and fly through challenging levels, but the second you die you are immediately back in the action.\n\nUsually in games level design ramps up as you go through, meaning as levels get really hard, you will tend to try at a level for 10 minutes, just to beat it and move on to an even harder level without any sort of break. This game combats that by still leaving in challenging, but not extremely difficult levels in between really hard ones, so you have a minute or two to relax (sort of) and listen to the music.\n\nSpeaking of the music, the soundtrack is really just crazy good. the DnB, and electro in this game is some of the best I have ever heard! I stand by my reference to Hotline Miami, as while it is completely different, it has a very similar vibe.\n\nMy computer accidentically deleted my saves after I was about 3 planets in, then after playing almost to the sun, my computer decided to RESTORE MY OLD SAVE setting me back to the 3rd planet :(, so no I am playing again and I am still loving every second of it! (minus a few levels that were just really tedious).\n\nThe one feature that this game is really lacking is the ability to adjust sound effect volume. I want to be able to turn the music way up, and only be able to barely hear the SFX, but the only option is to turn SFX off completely. The game is still pretty new, so I hope this is added in a patch.\n\nEDIT:\nSo this game is really extremely fun, and has the darksouls quality of making you die a lot, but you always know it's your fault (never the game's), and that you can do better... untill the second to last planet (each planet is a series of 20 or so levels). Once you reach murcury, all the levels put you on some rediculously short timer, and it become less about skill, and more about memorizing the exact pixel perfect sequence of button pushes in order to get through the level.\n\nThese timers take the forms of pinweels that "Push" you through a level, or gates that only stay open X ammount of seconds after you trigger them to open, often closing RIGHT as you are passing through them. The pinweels are especially frustrating because not only do they push you from the back, but if you are going to fast (because, idk, your being chased by a SPINNING WALL OF DEATH) then you will hit the front side of the pinweel and die! This causes a margin of error that is so small it's almost feels impossible, like where the keys on my keyboard/controller physically cannot actuate fast enough to get through the obsticals.\n\nThe game was still REALLY fun up untill Murcury though, so it's still worth a buy","September 13, 2015","true","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Each set of levels (planets) introduces either a new mechanic or twist which changes the flow of levels, making you think of both how to 'solve' the level and then shortly how quickly you can solve it. Flywrench quickly goes from straight-forward to aggressively hard for most planets until the last few planets, where your skills at platforming and patience are truly tested.\n\nTechnically solid with high frame-rate and fine-tuned input control, allowing one to switch between modes almost instantaneously, which for advanced players is key to getting fast times. Also works well with the Steam Controller where using A to jump and RG (Right Grip) to flip green allowed for even faster reaction times when dealing with level obstacles.\n\nOh yeah, the soundtrack is great.

Everything about it feels so good and completely natural. The wrench (let's call it that) has among the most fun physics I've experienced in a game, moving gracefully but with the precision you need.\n\nThe game has a perfectly crafted difficulty curve, introducing you to mechanics and letting you figure out techniques without telling you explicitly, eventually culminating in some pretty hard levels that take a while to get down. We're not talking Super Meat Boy level hard, but I had significantly more fun playing Flywrench and never got frustrated, even when I was bashing my head against a wall.\n\nThe aesthetic of Flywrench is also superb, with a distinctive and appealing art style that still conveys gameplay easily. Even as a colourblind person I could distinguish the yellow walls and green barriers easily. The white and cyan ones were a little trickier but still distinguishable based on context.\n\nFlywrench's soundtrack is phenomenal and is basically just "What does Orbi like? Put that in there" with a compilation of tracks that all work both thematically and to keep you excited. There's an OST available on Google Play. Sadly it's missing the best song, but hopefully Machinedrum will drop it eventually.\n\nEverything about this game speaks to me on a base level in such a way that I just can't help but be enamored.","December 2, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game hits the perfect balance being satisfyingly difficult while not getting too frustrating, it just feels really good to play (I actually wandered away from writting this at least 5 times to play for a bit more).\n\nThe aesthetic of the game is really strong as well, the glitchy visuals are much more appealing than they initally appear and the various unlockable themes are welcome additions (even the one called RETINA_BURN). The music is especially noteworthy, this is probably the best game soundtrack since Hotline Miami, it might even be better.\n\nIf you have any interest in hard games or glitchy visuals and music I would highly recommend picking this up. The soundtrack alone is worth the price of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chipisgreat/recommended/337350/","chipisgreat","ChipIsGreat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chipisgreat/","219 products in account","Flywrench is a brutally difficult game in the vein of Super Meat Boy, VVVVVV and other difficult platformers. The gameplay revolves sround getting your ship to the end of an obstacle course. This involves maneuvering through obstacles and the main gimmick: switching polarity. This allows you to travel trough different types of wall and also changes the properties of your ship, for example: red causes you to drop at a higher rate, green allows bouncing but strips you of control of your ship. The levels are well designed and never feel unfair. The controls are tight and responsive but sometimes feel as if there's a delay (but this is probably my keyboard judging by other reviews). My only complaint thus far is that when travelling upwards, the camera is extremely jerky which can be disorienting (a significant issue in such a precise game). If you enjoy difficult games, this is for you and if you're still on the fence, check out the freeware version.\nFreeware link\nhttp://www.freegamearchive.com/download-games/freeware/arcades/flywrench/17168","January 1","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is one of the best platformer-y things, up there with Super Meat Boy, N, and Super Mario Brothers.\n\nThat said, it is not directly comparable. Rather than standard platforms, it is more manoevering your flywrench ship thing through space, which is set up like levels. The controls are super tight, and if you die, you know it's on you (well, I personally think so, anyway).\n\nThe main thing that makes this game unique is the main mechanic. When no buttons are pressed, you are white. When holding one action button, you turn red, which makes you flap and gives you momentum. Pressing the second action button makes you turn green, and you can bounce of walls. There are barriers that you can pass through, white, red and green, To get through them, you have to be the right colour. But, for example, when you turn red to go through a red barrier, you also flap, so that could mess you up, and so on. There are pink boundaries you can't even bounce off, too. There is more things that come in to change up the gameplay, but I'll let you discover it. My first playthough was about 4-5 hours, but my fastest run was about an hour.\n\nOne last thing is this is a great level editor. It is super easy to use, and I have made a level pack. I usually can't stand level editors (though there probably are other exceptions).\n\nIt is way more straightforward when it is you playing it, but yeah, it is incredible.

It's more forgiving too, with easy mode giving you a "helmet" which lets you touch walls without dying. Soundtrack is definitely much worse and less unique than the original's though. It just feels out of tone with the rest of the game and I swear some planets have repeated tracks. This isn't to say the soundtrack is bad, it just doesn't feel right for this type of game in MY opinion.\n\nTL;DR: A better Flywrench save for the soundtrack.","August 25, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

In addition, fans of Nidhogg's soundtrack will also love this game as it once again features a pounding soundtrack with returning Daedelus as lead music designer, while featuring additional highly influential electronic music artists.\n\nThis game will likely take players 3-4 hours to complete, but the game offers a degree of replayability for those wanting to do time trials, or for those wanting to use the in-game level editor to make their own levels.\n\nI believe the biggest negative for this game is the exponential increase in difficulty towards the latter part of the game.   My biggest critique of the game is, rather truly exploring and using the new obstacles to their fullest in each planet and gradually scaling difficulty, the game holds back until you get to Mercury.  On average, it took me maybe 10-15 mins to completely clear a planet. I would even often clear levels on my first try. However, upon getting to Mercury one level would take me up to 15-20 mins to complete.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Mercury because it really showcases Messhof's creativity, but at the same time why couldn't we have more of these levels?\n\nAnother minor gripe with the game is that difficulty isn't presented through use of in-game mechanics, but rather exploiting the limitations of the keyboard. Levels in Mercury often have you going diagonal, which is inherently more difficult and imprecise than using a controller. I would've like the game to be more challenging through use of spinning and fluttering than trying to awkwardly move sideways. But, as I've said this is only a minor gripe.\n\nOverall I was very satisfied playing the game and I will be returning to it. Time for time trials!","September 5, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyreb7/recommended/337350/","cyreb7","Cyreb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyreb7/","238 products in account","I was drawn to this game for two reasons: first I thoroughly enjoyed Nidhogg (developed by the same people), and second I love execution based gameplay like Dustforce or Trackmania where you replay a level over and over trying to perfect it, but unfortunately Flywrench lands far from the fun experience of hitting the retry button while telling yourself “I won’t mess up this time!”. Instead the “flywrench” you play as is hard to control, the smallest misstep leads to an unrecoverable death, and the levels become ruthlessly unforgivable at the end, but beyond any mechanical  fault, the game simply wasn't fun for me in the same way as Dustforce or Trackmania is.\n\nThe basic goal of the game is to navigate small quick levels by flapping your flywrench to stay aloft while using the joystick to glide from side to side. The levels start off pretty simple but quickly expand with different mechanics, the most prominent being dodging purple barriers while pressing certain buttons to pass through colored barriers. But unfortunately not matter how much I played, I could never control the flywrench to the proficiency needed to precisely navigate stages without touching a barrier or the walls (which starts bouncing you all over the place and is nearly impossible to recover from before you hit something that will kill you), it feels like a precision platformer with terribly unresponsive controls.\n\nWhen I first started playing, I didn’t mind the controls so much because the levels were really short and there wasn't much that could kill you, but about halfway through, the levels started getting longer and the path that you need to navigate smaller, but I still persevered hoping something would click and that I would eventually get better, but any improvement I showed was far outstripped by the ramp in difficulty of the levels until I gave up after completing every level up to 19/21 Mercury. And that was it, I couldn't win those last three levels and couldn't muster any interest to keep trying; I wasn't having any fun, so I quit.\n\nOverall the game has some potential if you are into really hard and unforgiving games, but most of the time when I died, I didn’t feel it was my fault. Instead it felt like it was the the difficult controls and the unforgiving level design that was to blame, this made it frustrating to play. When I did manage to complete a level it felt like it was due to luck more than any skill on my part, sapping any sense of achievement from winning and not providing any incentive to continue on. So unless you really know you are the kind of person who loves throwing themselves at insurmountable challenges, I recommend passing this game bye. There are other games in the Steam, there is bound to be another that will love you back, beacause Flywatch sure won’t.","February 23","false","3.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Like NidHogg, Flywrench is also overpriced, although there is certainly more content and replayabilty. I think this game (which used to be free, with less content) should be priced between 3-5$.\n\nEssentially, you navigate an 'L' shaped character through various obstacles. You have the ability to turn green or red which helps break through like-colored barriers. You will bounce off walls and die hundreds of times. It really reminds me of VVVVVV (I believe they were made in the same time period?). Some people compare it to Super Meat Boy, but I don't really see that. SMB was strictly a platformer - and had better art, storyline, and debatably music (as did VVVVVV).\n\nPros:\n+Interesting novelty of changing colors to break through walls, creating a puzzle-like experience\n+Music is good\n+Fun enough for short spurts\n\nMeh:\n=Storyline (if you can call it that) has potential, but is not really all that engaging\n\nCons:\n-Too expensive - I still feel burned over Nidhogg\n-I mean there are millions of these little quirky games that are generally free, overall there is not enough here to justify that price tag\n\nI'd wait for at least a half-price sale.","August 26, 2015","false","0.9"," 13 of 57 people (23%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","23","13","57","2","3"

It feels a lot like Super Meat Boy, except where SMB gets you mad, this game manages to calm you down, no matter how hard the levels are. Most of the time. Mercury is infuriatingly hard. As in, I got to the fourth level and thought, you can't do this. But the game starts out fine. Then it gets harder.\n\nWell, I never was a writer. Just buy this, on sale if possible, but buy it.
