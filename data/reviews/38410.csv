I'd played Fallout 1, and I'd heard from almost everyone that Fallout 2 was FAR superior. I throroughly enjoyed Fallout 1, but my main problem with it was that the game was timed, and practically forced you to rush through it. Because of this, I felt as though my experience with the game was cut short. The main thing I was looking for when I started playing Fallout 2 was a lengthier game that would allow me to explore and progress at my own pace.\n\nI got more than I could have ever hoped for.\n\nThe game started out slow, much like many other RPGs, and frankly, it was a bit boring for the first few hours. But I knew from my previous experiences that Fallout games only get better as you progress. I made it through the first few areas, and started getting a feel for how things worked, finding plenty of new quests, etc. It was becoming rather enjoyable, then I got the car, which would allow me to carry more things, and explore the wasteland with much more ease. It was very exciting, almost like getting my first car all over again. And at that point I was hooked.\n\nEverything from that point on is a bit of a blur, I remember traveling from city to city, back and forth, looking for every quest I could possibly find. The process of finding better and better gear for my three companions was addicting, the process of ensuring the prosperity of all the settlements was addicting, the atmosphere is addicting, becoming famous for various reasons across the wasteland was addicting, the fact that the game goes into so much detail and lets you influence the way things play out was addicting. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME IS ADDICTING!\n\nI couldn't help it, hours and hours of my life were being sucked away, and there was nothing I could to about it except keep playing. IT WAS AMAZING.\n\nThe final toll was a little over 66 hours for me. And that was all spent on a single playthrough. When I FINALLY beat the game, I felt a feeling of happiness and satisfaction that I haven't felt in YEARS. But most of all, I felt an overwhelming sense of FREEDOM. NO LONGER WAS I SHACKLED BY ITS IMMENSE QUALITY, BY ITS SHEER BEAUTY. I will never play this game for the first time again, that makes me both relieved and depressed. Depressed, because this game is phenomenal, because it is one of the best games I ever played. But relieved, because I will never lose that many hours that quickly ever again.\n\nThis game is a true gem. It is an incredible, immersive experience even by today's standards, and in fact, shïts all over most modern RPGs.\n\nThat's the problem, though, this game is TOO GOOD. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LOSE.\n\n\n\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna start my evil playthough.","February 19, 2015","true","110.3"," 765 of 799 people (96%) found this review helpful 344 people found this review funny","96","765","799","344","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quiverandquake/recommended/38410/","quiverandquake","VirtualTurmoil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quiverandquake/","55 products in account","*I have included some tips at the end to help newcomers to the early Fallouts*\n\nI remember the hundreds of hours I've spent on the console version of Fallout 3 back in 2011. Fast forward to early 2015, I've decided to try out the older Fallouts, starting with Fallout 2. This being my first "true" RPG experience, all of the info and stats, along with the fact that it was a turn based isometric game, made it look intimidating from the surface, but after some researching, the game starts to look less daunting.\n\nJust like the Bethesda Fallouts, the game uses the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system and the familiar stats, along with traits. Fallout 2 really does gives you a lot of options on how you can adjust your character. Naturally, I (stupidly) chose to have a really buff gunman with perception and agility as my dump stats. I went through the Temple of Trials (the tutorial dungeon) and got demolished. My stats made playing through the game a nightmare.\n\nSee, unlike Fallout 3, the stats you choose matter a great deal more. Some of stats in Fallout 2 function the same as Fallout 3 (Strength judges carry weight and ability to use weapons, Intelligence increases skill points, Endurance increases HP and resistance, Agility affects Action Ponts, Luck increases stats slightly and influences random encounters). However, some act differently. Perception affects how acurate you are at longer ranges, every single action requires Action Points meaning that high Agility builds are better for combat, Charisma affects the number of companions you can have, and low Intelligence can effectively deny you from a large amount of quests and activities.\n\nWith this information, I remade my character and went back into the Temple of Trials. It must be said, however, that the Temple is a very poor representation of the game. The game forces you to use melee and barely gives you enough healing items to get past the darn thing if you don't use hit and run tactics with high agility. Fallout 2 gives you no information regarding mechanics, and it's clear that the devs were forced to phone in a tutorial segment (if you can call it that).\n\nFortunately, the game starts to show its magic after you exit the Temple and rejoin the villagers of Arroyo, the home of the decendants of the protagonist of the first Fallout. The village is dying and you are tasked to gind the G.E.C.K, a device that can help bring life back to the village. From there, you find a multitude of interesting characters and locations, such as New Reno and its many gangs, to the Broken Hills with its super mutants. Although there is a small amount of quests compared to the later games, the quality of the dialogue and the world you are thrown into makes it easy to forgive. The game also includes some returning characters from the first Fallout, which give some background to the protagonist and the events of the first game. Unfortunately, the humor of this game is something that may not be appealing to some, however. Fallout 2 does include many pop culture references and fourth wall breaks, which does get tiring admittedly.\n\nCombat in this game is very enjoyable and has a satisfying punch to it, with gory animations accompanying sounds of limbs being blown off. The amount of weapons in this game is fairly reasonable, but this is mainly towards the end where you have gained large amounts of money and can handle the tougher enemies with better loot.\n\nOverall, Fallout 2 is a real classic of a game. It may be hard to adjust as a newcomer, but the game is very much worth it.\n\n*Some tips*\n- You have four types of cursors in the game (switch by using M2), a yellow arrow (click on items to interact, hold M1 to get a list of interactions), a red hexagon (decides where you go), a hand (decides what you pick up in the inventory screen), and a red crosshair (decides what you shoot, only accessable when you are in combat).\n\n- You can break wooden doors by using melee on them or using a grenade.\n\n- To use Skilldex skills, click on the skilldex button, choose the skill and then the item you want to use the skill on.\nExamples: Click on Doctor and yourself to heal. Click on Lockpick and a door to lockpick. Click on Steal and a person to steal.\n\n- Before exiting towns or talking to important characters, save.\n\n- To change the action done to a weapon you are holding, press M2 on the weapon box. For guns, this can change them to Single Fire, Aimed, Burst (If the gun has it), or Reload. The green ticks on the side of the weapon represent the ammo level.\n\n- When bartering, make sure to get change from transactions. For example, if I bought a gun that costs $1000 and gave a gun that costs $950, I need to bring the vendor's money into the transaction area to get money. In this case, I would ask for $50.\n\n- The red button above the inventory button helps switch weapons.\n\n- To enter combat with friendlies (or unaware enemies), click on your weapon. To end combat, press the CMBT on the bottom right. To end your turn, press Turn. (Also on the bottom right).\n\n- Rest by clicking the Pipboy button and clicking on the yellow button on the top of its menu. This can only be done after finishing the Temple of Trials.\n\n-  You can scavenge extra ammo from dead NPCs by using the yellow cursor and choosing the "unload gun" icon (picture of a gun and magazine) from the interation list.","July 20, 2015","true","55.9"," 418 of 428 people (98%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","98","418","428","11","13"

The plot is subtle and a great break from all the melodramatic, save the universe type ♥♥♥♥ most games consist of.\n\nFallout 2, like the first, gives you a large, brutal and unforgiving world to traverse at your own risk, full of genuinely fascinating locations and extremely interesting characters to interact with; from scientists who give mutated scorpions chems to their increase intelligence, talking plants and a highly intelligent and articulate Deathclaw, there are tons of geniusly fantastic, memorable characters to interact with through-out and even though Fallout 2 doesn't always take itself too seriously and is sometimes outright comical the game still portrays a grim, cruel and extremely immersive world like no other.\n\nFallout 2 features some of the finest role playing out there, with tons of meaningful choices and consequences through-out which question your ethics and morality on a far deeper scale than just simply being the good / bad guy. The quests you recieve in Fallout 2 are diverse and often offer multiple ways in which you can complete them, some ways which were not even intended by the developers, there is just so much freedom of choice here that is completely non-existent in 'RPGs' today.\n\nThe character building is brilliant and has a ton of depth, every little stat directly affects how your game plays out, being highly intelligent with the personality of a brick or being a knucklehead with the charisma of a dictator will deeply affect how NPCs interact with you. There are so many choices to make in character building that have huge, meaningful impacts on the world around you that multiple playthroughs are essential to experience what this masterpiece has to offer.\n\nThe visuals at first glance may seem bland and out-dated but the art direction is beyond brilliant and is complimented by believable, excellent world design and an insanely thick atmosphere - this doesn't feel like videogame world nor like it was designed to be one, rather an actual post-apocalyptic place.\n\nThe sound effects are absolutely spot on. The ambient, non-intrusive music through-out is fantastic and adds a lot to the atmosphere and the voiced dialogue is pretty well done.\n\nFallout 2's combat is turn-based and offers a ton of depth, giving you the opportunity to use a tactical approach rather than just mindlessly clicking away like in many of todays so-called RPG's - I do however encounter frustration with not being able to control friendly AI in combat and as a result get shot in the back and watching friendly AI running at an isolated enemy instead of backing up your character who then gets outnumbered and killed is rage-inducing to say the least, these flaws only occur right in the beginning until you get used to pathing and such but rather big flaws non-the-less.\n\nOverall Fallout 2, along with Baldur's Gate, Darklands and Planescape Torment are the pinnacle of RPGs in every regard and will probably remain that way until the end of time judging by how far the genre has declined since. You can't call yourself a fan of RPGs until you have experienced these absolute masterpieces, if you're interested in playing Fallout 1 or 2 for the first time and haven't played anything of the sort before I'd advise a lot of patience in the early stages which by judging from some of the negative reviews is too much to ask for some.\n\nThis is a mandatory experience for anyone who loves videogames, experiences like this simply don't exist anymore.","October 9, 2015","true","85.0"," 141 of 149 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","141","149","7","16"

The story shares some similarity to the first game, as you play a tribal descendant of the Vault Dweller, sent out to find a device that will save your dying village of Arroyo from famine and disease.\n\nThe world, though, feels much larger, showing far more signs of development over the years. Old towns like the LA Boneyard and Junktown have disappeared off the map, replaced with or absorbed into new, more solidly established places like the New California Republic, an evolution of the town of Shady Sands, a San Francisco Chinatown populated by chinese refugees and even New Reno, a city of vice and sin populated by casinos, porn theaters, drug dealers, and gangs of post-nuclear mafiosos all going at each other's throats for control of the city.\n\nMechanically, Fallout 2 tightens up a lot of stuff from the first game. Most immediately noticeable are things like a "Take All" button in container menus, an option to push NPCs out of the way non-violently should they ever block your path, and an overhaul of the companion system, allowing you to get one extra character in your party for every two points of Charisma, with the limit maxing out at five companions for ten Charisma, and the ability to change every companion's strategic options if you don't want them accidentally mowing you down with a Vindicator Minigun.\n\nAlthough Fallout 2 was criticized heavily for it's buggy and rushed state of release, with a large chunk of content never seeing the light of day, it has since received support from modders that fix all of these issues. Most notable are sfall, which makes many engine tweaks and quality of life improvements, and Killapp's Unofficial Patch and Restoration Project, which respectively patch out all the major bugs in the game and fully implement all the cut content seamlessly into the game.\n\nAll this put together, Fallout 2 is a very large, but tight package with solid mechanics and fun writing, injecting even more personality into the wasteland than the first game. It can miss the mark sometimes, but on the whole it feels like the writers had a fun time, and the game itself is well worth playing even today. Whether or not you're a lover of old-school RPGs, Fallout 2 has a lot on offer, and most of it is pretty superb.","January 3, 2015","true","51.7"," 121 of 125 people (97%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","97","121","125","6","0"

Especially competitive MP FPS games like UT, Quake, Counter Strike etc. However every once in a while comes a game that isn't a part of those genres and it's so bloody good that it makes an exception to my preference. This recommendation is for Fallout 1 and 2 which are easily bought in a cheap value pack. Without a doubt they stand as some of the greatest games ever made. Even if they are technologically way behind the times, the concept idea and execution are so well done that this become one of the biggest benchmarks for role playing games in general.\n\nThese games are simple to explain, it's a free roaming massive quest based role playing game. You start the game with entire world open to you, hardly any restrictions and it's up to you to what happens. There are absurd amount of choices in pretty much everything. Make a character that is a gunslinger, sniper, brute using melee weapons, a silver tonged diplomat, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who can only communicate via grunts and hardly understandable shouts,a slaver, evil to the core son of a ♥♥♥♥♥. it's all open to you from start. The character creation portion is extensive, complicated and delightful to how much you can plan out for your game. This is followed numerous ways to solve problems. Almost every problem has multiple solutions, ranging from taking different sides (pleasing or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off factions), violent approach, diplomatic approach you name it. A person won't help you with something you just take your gun and kill them, then face the consequences. Game is really harsh, anything rash and dumb can easily end up with game over.\n\nOne huge praise to the choice presented to the player is the adult theme that isn't dumbed down (unlike the more recent Fallout 3 and NV(though NV to less extent)). You can become a porn star, ♥♥♥♥♥ yourself out for services and persuasion, you can kill children and be labeled as a Childkiller. Everything you do reflects your standing in the world and how NPCs look at you.\n\nAnother big praise is how humor is incorporated into this wacky, grim post apocaliptic world. Expect several monty python references and spoofs.It's seamless and fitting. It's amazing how well such wacky humor incorporated into dark games such as these two.\n\nIf there are downsides it's that vanilla games are rather buggy. I recommend Killap's unoffical patch/restoration project for fallout 2 and the appropriate patches for fallout 1. Check No Mutants Allowed for patches. Get the resolution patch as well. This way you can upscale the resolution to more modern standard.\n\nI could sit here all day and write about the insane amount of cool things to do in this game, but that's better to be experienced in person. Do yourself a favor and if you like RPG games where you are not shoehorned into a path, play these game. They are most certainly some of the best you will ever play.","November 15, 2013","true","91.1"," 145 of 157 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","145","157","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayres662/recommended/38410/","ayres662","Bloody George","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayres662/","350 products in account","Just over a decade ago, life was simpler and more frivolous, so every fictional discovery was fascinating and entertaining. It was in that simple, mid-teenage life, that I dug Fallout 2 out of a fortunate coincidence. A disc copy of the game, in a modest gaming magazine, to whose cover it was poorly attached. It seemed interesting enough, and with little knowledge of cRPGs or English, I went home and gave it a try. Boy, was I enthralled by this game. A game which would, about ten years later, still be the most cherished piece of gaming I have ever experienced.\n\nFallout 2 ventures deep into the dark territories of humour and morbidity. Not many have the grit for its atmosphere, inauspicious and heavy as it is, its dense soundtrack that evinces feelings of gloomy solitude and decadence; exactly the vibe you have got to be in when playing any Fallout title, for that matter. Back when I first tried it, I would engage in conflicts between the curiosity to explore its narrative and the uneasiness caused by that very atmosphere, even after having previously and briefly tried Planescape: Torment - an equally dense game. Fortunately for me, I got past that.\n\nProvided that you can also overcome such uneasiness, you've got an unparallelled RPG challenge ahead of you. Fallout 2, very much like its predecessor, is beautifully written, and cleverly designed in a way that connects your actions to the realities and contextual changes of Northern California as you go. The turn-based combat is typical late-90s cRPG gold. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L role-playing system, a jewel derived from Gurps, offers you that edge of character construction and skill management that makes a bonafide RPG pleasurable. The post-apocalyptic setting and aesthetics, built on the famous premise of the Divergence - the historical fragmentation in which the fictional linearity of the game took a different course from that of our world in the heat of the Cold War, leaving the former with that futuristic-50s style -, renders Fallout's identity unique and typically dark humoured. Its characters are deeply unpredictable and credible, especially the companions, much more mature than those of the previous installment (with all due respect to the likes of Ian and Dogmeat). The game leaves that bitter feeling of longing in the player's mouth should they pass away or have to be left behind for some reason. Each companion adds to the player's enterprise, each has their own story, each has their own passions and motivations. And flaws.\n\nFallout 2 appeals to multiple audiences. Those looking for an RPG; those looking for a post-apocalyptic piece; those looking for a story-driven game; those looking for open-world dynamic narratives; those looking for a demi-horror title; and so forth. While it may not touch some of these categories in depth, it is a game that brings them all to a perfect harmony. Be ready for a challenge, an unforgiving gameplay, but be also ready for enriching rewards that will open your mind to new spheres of role-playing gaming.","July 6, 2014","true","113.0"," 59 of 60 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","59","60","0","0"

World with numerous different characters, situations and occasions. And with constant multiplicity of choices for every your step, of course.\n\nNow, with the High Res mod which Steam finally added into the launcher. Without that mod, you couldn't play this classic on everything upper to WinXP, which was a bummer really. So glad that Steam finally fixed it…\n\nSome of my friends are so purist they think Fallout 2 was a misinterpretation of the first, the-one-and-only, Fallout game. Thanks to Heaven, I'm not one of them. On contrary, I'm enjoying the second game more, for all additional content it have with comparison to the first game. Which was great, but a little straight-forward closer to the end.\n\nIn the Fallout 2 I've spent dozens and hundreds hours of my time, found so many secrets and easter eggs... It is like a town where you were grown. You may be now a big man from big city, but you'll always remember old shortcuts and hiding places where you were at your childhood...\n\nSure it looks dated, and maybe somewhat clunky at first, but, once you get to know that game better, I’m sure, you’ll love it.\n\nMy mark for one of the most tempting games of my teens age? 10/10, of course! Yes, it’s dated, yes, it’s much harder and unforgivable for beginners than new-age RPGs… But it’s lovely thing.

Whereas in Fallout 1,2 and NV the way you handle quests in different areas and your actions in these areas affect the areas future in a deaper manner. for example Fallout 1,2 and new vegas in the end credit scence you hear things like "Your involvment in this town and how you did this mean the town prospered or the town was quickly eradicated" Wheras in fallout 3 this isnt there.\n\nGeneral overview of Fallout 2\n\nFallout 2 is a timeless classic of the Fallout franchise and for those who consider themselves die hard fans of the fallout series you should get this game also if you do get the game also download the resteration patch from the No mutants allowed forum it adds cut content into the game and fixes bugs and generally makes the game better overall\n\nNote: In no way in this review am i hating on Fallout 3 i think Fallout 3 is a brilliant game and i recommend it to anyone but i do not think of it as a Fallout game that stays true to the originals like Fallout New Vegas did\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this review","February 19","true","39.0"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NameNoMatter/recommended/38410/","NameNoMatter","NameNoMatter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NameNoMatter/","109 products in account","Fallout 3 was one of my favorite all-time games. Naturally, I thought at one point, "I've played Fallout 3 and New Vegas, but I've never even heard of Fallout 1 or 2. I wonder what they are like?"\nWell my question has since been answered. And my god, Fallout 2 is one of the greatest games made. As most people do, let's go through pros and cons. I'd also like to say that I haven't played this game in a long time, so I'm going off memory.\n\nPROS:\n~Story elements. You are The Chosen One, or if you are me, Penguin Johnson. You are the descendant of the Vault Dweller, a member of Vault HMHMHM (woops I can't remember) who saved his/her vault from certain doom by dehydration, when he went out into the wastes to get a Water Purification Chip. Your tribe is dying, brahmin and crops are dying as well. And only one thing can save it. I bet you guessed, "Me!" HAH! DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH! No, a G.E.C.K. In fact, if you were the saviour of the tribe, then they would be doomed because of this games...\n\n~Difficulty. Fallout 3, while I died a few times, wasn't that difficult. However, when you ask this game for help, it flips you off, and says how about you deal with that guy with a machine gun yourself? It then proceeds to laugh as the machine gun guy burst fires and kills you instantly with a critical hit that does 78 damage, and you only had 5 health. You WILL see the death screen a lot if you are new to this game, but that's an element that makes it good.\n\n~So much to explore. This game, has you traversing THE ENTIRETY OF THE UNITED STATES! From San Fransisco, to Klamath. What's that? Never heard of Klamath? Where have you been living, anywhere but in Fallout 2?\n\n~So many weapons! You got your pistols, sub machine guns, assault rifles, snipers, shotguns, knives, blunt weapons, fists, fist weapons, light machine guns, miniguns, plasma weapons, laser weapons, and probably even more. And there are a lot of weapons in each of those categories.\n\n~Characters. Characters are so unique. You have the ghoul from... the ghoul place who makes a joke about what assuming does. (It makes an ♥♥♥ out of you and me). Then you got the leader of Vault City, who I shot many times out of pure  annoyance.\n\nNEGATIVES:\n\n-This game, is so broken. I'm not kidding. You know how people say Fallout New Vegas is glitchy? NV is the tip of the iceburg of glitches, and this is the entire thing. Luckily, people have made a total conversion mod which fixes most of the game. It's called Project Purification or something like that. I can't remember.\n\n-SPOILER ALERT! When you get the G.E.C.K. Why? Because SPOILER ALERT AGAIN the Enclave just kills your entire tribe anyway. What was the point? At least I can get revenge on them. Seriously. You have to. It's a main quest to wipe the Enclave out.\n\nSo what do I give this game? 7/10. If you didn't have to download a mod this would have been a 9/10 easily, but unfortunately, that's just such a big problem that I can't. But, get that mod, and you will be embarking on a journey, through war. And as they say, war. War never changes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheELemonator/recommended/38410/","TheELemonator","ELemonator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheELemonator/","184 products in account","Fallout 2 is a game that went under my games to play radar for far too long, mostly because when it came out I wasn't even   in primary school yet. I'm typically not the biggest fan of this kind of post-apocalyptic setting, in fact this is the only one I like. I owe my discovering this masterpiece entirely to the streamlined fallout experience by Bethesda and later Obsidian.\n\nI found the first dungeon to be ruthless my first playthrough, it took me a reload or two before I managed to survive the initial trial and start the main quest. When I emerged into the wasteland of Fallout 2, I was a bit intimidated, every direction on the map had opened up to me. The main quest giver did point me in the direction of a nearby town, but I wanted to see how far south I could go, maybe discover a cool town or two. Nope, I just ended up with plenty of bullets in my corpse.\n\nI decide to not go south when I reload and instead go to the town that the elder directed me to, this is where I lost interest initially. I ended up not in the mood to read any of the dialogs that would've pointed me in the right direction and instead gave up. A few months pass and on a whim I decide to reload my save and see if I can't make any headway in game. After I did a few side quests I really started to enjoy myself, the battle system I found unforgiving started to feel a little rewarding, and I kept going.\n\nI am a little sad however, I'm nearing the final content of the game and I'm trying my darndest to make my remaining hours on my character, the powerfist wielding warrior Gertrude, last as long as possible.\n\nPROS:\n-The game has aged well in my opinion, the graphics may not look as sharp as some people may desire, but the game is  still entirely playable.\n-The combat is very fun after the initial slow burn, I'd say about level 5 is where it took off for me.\n-The characters have been very fun, I can recall most of the characters I've run into in Fallout 2, the same can't be said of Fallout 3 or New Vegas (granted they each had a few good characters).\n-Tons of content, I've spent a good 30-40 hours on my current character and still find new quests.\n\nCONS:\n-The game is from the late 90's and has technical limitations because of this (Combat can be very slow when a large number of characters are engaged in battle)\n-You cannot reload in combat when it is not your turn to move, this doesn't sound too bad but in large battles where you try to keep your companions alive it can be a little bothersome.\n-There is a time limit in game for how long you can play, it's an unfortunate technical issue, however you have about 13 in game years until you are forced to play a new character (my current character is on year 3 near the end of the game)\n\nFinal thoughts on the game:\nThis is honestly the best game I've played in past years, it makes me yearn for games that don't constantly hold my hand. Every mistake I make is punished, every good decision I make is rewarded. The myriad of companions in game really made my experience that much better (barring when Sulik would sit in doorways, blocking my only exit). If I had to give this game a number score it'd probably be an 8 or 9 out of 10. There is no perfect game, and this game certainly has quite  a large number of faults, but this is the most fun I've had with a game since my initial Dark Souls playthrough.","March 18, 2015","true","99.2"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DevConz/recommended/38410/","DevConz","Ice Cold Tabasco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DevConz/","88 products in account","Originally released by in 1998, I never really had the chance to play Fallout 2, mostly due to the fact I was too busy being born. Having got wrapped up into the Fallout 3 hype train, I became rather enthralled in the franchise itself. So, several years later, I picked it up and…\n\n...in an attempt to not color my already vibrant opinion of the nearly twenty year old title to nothing but what can be considered felatio, let me just be a bit hypercritical about the game. The most glaring “problem” is what Fallout: New Vegas suffers from, by basically being the same game twice, effectively Fallout 2.0. While it didn’t work to the determent of the more modern entries, it hurts the overall visual experience with the sprites being rather noticeably polarized. Most are ripped straight from the original, built by pixels and with limited frame to frame animation. Then you have the newer 3D rendered sprites with smoother animation, creating an immersion breaking experience.\n\nThankfully, these sprites don’t really appear in the same cell often, but when they do it is noticeably. Another problem they never fixed was the ♥♥♥♥ING INVENTORY UI! Its clumsy and finicky at best, with the mouse cursor deciding the change sensitivity like a pregnant women. You will work around it eventually, but it just infuriates me how this aspect was never fixed. Its horrid but manages to get the job done.\n\nGetting down on my knees, everything else is, the world, leveling system, character's, weapon variety and quest are, to put it broadly, ♥♥♥♥ING FANTASTIC. While the characters are a tad uninspired and two dimensional, and the story banal, Fallout 2 is possibly one of the best Western RPGs ever made. The leveling system grants satisfaction, managing to maintain this by having “Perks”(effectively permanent stat or combat boosts) that you receive every other level. You can’t help but wanting to progress with the prospect of nearly sawing men in half with not much but as dainty slap.\n\nThe world can be summarized as a sour salted candy advertised as extremely so, its daunting at first and WILL kick you ♥♥♥ once you pop it in you gob, but will eventually become remarkable sweet. Southern California is huge, being exceptionally difficult during the early game but incredibly rewarding later down the line. The only problem I have with the world is the lack of variety, but I feel the questing can make up for this.\n\nI feel developers can live or die by the hand holding die. Choosing to do so makes the game a breeze, and choosing not to has the potential to make progress come to a screeching halt. Fallout 2 gives you just enough information to get on with the question without some patronizing arrow pointing out where to go. And can even have you thinking about solutions for the rare puzzle here and there. Quest are satisfying and varied to an insane degree.\n\nFallout 2 might possibly be one of the few games in which you likely won’t see every weapon or outcome. If you ♥♥♥♥ up, you ♥♥♥♥ed up and there is no turning back, with some things being consequently cut off. Prompting actual thought and replay-ability, I love this idea. The weapons on the other hand, are insanely variant. Its not the fact that a quest outcome closes them off from you, it's the fact there are so ♥♥♥♥ing many that you're unlikely to even find them all. Whether this works for the games prosperity or detriment.\n\nRegardless, with its negatives and positives in check, Fallout 2 is one of the greatest title I have ever played. Even with its missteps, no matter how small, they pale to what the game does right. Of fantastic value, Fallout 2 is a must buy title, no matter its age.\n\nVerdict: 9.5 - Fantastic","October 16, 2014","true","34.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","14","14","3","1"

It is HUMONGOUS fun.","April 19","true","54.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","14","14","4","0"

But soon learned about the first two games and how different they were from Bethesda's Fallout 3. At first, I thought they looked horrible with their dated graphics and gameplay. But after reading hours upon hours of lore and story tidbits on the Fallout Gamepedia, I just knew I had to play them. I was on Xbox 360 at the time so I couldn't play them yet, so I figured I would play New Vegas in the meantime.\n\nAnyways, eventually I got my PC, and one of the first games I got on their was the entire Classic Fallout Collection. I played through 1 first, I loved it. Then, after a long break, I started Fallout 2. I was blown away by it's atmosphere and compelling story. Even though I am not used to turn-based gameplay, I have come to enjoy it because of Fallout and Fallout 2. The game makes you think about your moral desicions and the consequences they bring, something Bethesda games could never really do. For example, if you kill a child bounty hunters will chase you down and everybody will hate you, discouraging you from doing such evil things. I highly recommend this game to any Fallout fan, even the new ones like me. This is definitely my favorite RPG game, and maybe even my favorite game. 10/10","July 14, 2015","true","29.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","12","12","2","1"

I couldn't think of a better game out there. And then Fallout New Vegas came along. And I'll be honest, I was not a fan. Not in the least. First glance was a desolate land that had more punishing combat and a bizarre ammo system. Fast forward a couple months and I decide to give it another go. For some reason this second foray really opened my eyes and I had a blast with the changed up combat that made you think, and the ammo system that gave you more flexability. And once I started playing I discovered something even more miraculous: the writing. Fallout New Vegas had a more believable environment, better characters, better writing. It simply felt more thought out. And looking into its development I discovered that it had some of the creators of the original Fallouts working on it. So I had to give the originals a try.\n\nSo I started with Fallout 1, of course. I bought the pack off of steam and installed it with a gusto. Finally the 5 minute process ended and I delightfully booted up the game, only to have a brilliant rainbow engulf the screen. Great. So I do some quick interneting and download the hi-res pack for Fallout 1 and Killap's Restoration Pack for Fallout 2 in order to plan ahead. Fallout 1 started, and I hit the ground running. My first isometric RPG! Woo-hoo! I immediately fell flat on my face, being killed by rats. I learned my first Fallout lesson: It's okay to run. So after hours of such trial and error I finally completed my game of Fallout 1, and was eager to continue the adventure in Fallout 2.\n\nIf you have made it this far, good lord. On to Fallout 2.\n\nFallout 2, to put it mildly, blew me away. Though the first level was obnoxious as hell. That Temple deserves to burn. Regardless, I pushed forward and entered the world proper. And it was glorious. Everything good from Fallout 1, Fallout 2 has. And then it expands on those. And THEN adds even more. I could do anything here. The world was truely my playground. I could, and did, do anything I wanted. The combat is incredibly punishing, forcing you to make some truely tactical decisions, however it just makes every win that much more satisfying. The dialogue is witty, dark, a tad campy at times, and heartbreaking. The depths of depravity that is portrayed is mindboggling in the modern game sphere. GTA has nothing on this. Additionally I simply love the Enclave. Probably shouldn't, but I do. I really didn't do this game justice at all, did I? When it came down to it I didn't know what to say.\n\nBuy this, install it, download the Restoration Pack, install that, play the game, never stop.","February 18, 2015","true","52.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","11","12","3","1"

This tribe has now fallen on hard times and as the direct descendant of the Vault Dweller you are charged with going out into the world and finding a mythical Vault device known as the G.E.C.K. This device, the elder of your village believe, have the power to turn the part of the wasteland into an utopia and ensure the tribe's future.\n\nYou start off the game with a somewhat lackluster tutorial that introduces you to the basic elements of the game however it is only once you leave this initial area and are ready to depart your childhood village for the first time that the game truly comes into it's own. The massive world map at your feet with no restrictions on where to go and who to see.\n\nThe mechanics are much the same as the original. Isometric turn-based role playing game using the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system for character development. It is however in the open nature of the game that you find it's soul. Made a female character with high charisma? You might be able to charm, or sleep, your way past several encounters. Made a character with incredibly low intelligence? All of the sudden your dialog responses are just various grunts and the people you encounter will treat you as a freak of nature.\n\nEven most of the storyline can be skipped if you know where to go and almost every task you are given in the game can be solved in a myriad of ways, many options not even becoming apparent to you unless you have the needed skills or made some particular choices beforehand.\n\nThe game does have some shortcomings. The 4th wall breaking that was rare in the original are much more commonplace and several characters and areas just feel out of place with the rest of the game.\nNew Reno in particular, a gambling town complete with mafia families fighting for control and a working porn studio takes you completely out of the game and makes for a rather disappointing experience.\n\nFallout 2 has all the qualities that made the original one of the greatest RPG's ever and it improves on many aspects of it with better companion AI and a much larger map. It's faults however do weight heavily and keep it from surpassing it's predecessor. It is still one of the greatest RPG's ever to be made and if you are a fan of open ended RPG games and intelligent story and dialog then it should be a definite purchase.","December 7, 2012","true","409.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","3"

This is the game the cemented the Fallout universe and is considered by many the pinnacle of the series until New Vegas.  This is the game the truly cements the core story of the franchise and takes the seeds planted in FO1 and grows them to fruitiion.  In that process, they helped open up countless routes for storylines for the rest of the series.\n\nSome folks complain that now a game like this feels dated.  I would do my best to compel to you put aside that sort of metric when it comes to assessing the greatness of a game.  With some patience and thought ,which is so often taken out of today popular games, you can grasp hold of what seems at first glance, a copmlicated system for conveying your player character through the in-game universe.\n\nThe routes you take, many encounters, and many other aspects of the game are so open, so huge, that you could play through many times and still find different things. There are so many hidden routes, items, quests, etc and so many ways to play the game it's impossible to describe them all here(smart, tech savvy character or a  brawler or a dimwit?  you can play them all and they all change the game)\n\nThis game is a classic for a reason and is the gold standard by which other similar games should be judged.\n\nBuy it, play it, and understand where one of the greatest game franchises ever got much of it's spark.\n\nDo it now.","October 22, 2015","true","20.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

I was wrong in so many levels.\n\nSTORY\nIt picks up right after Fallout 1 and there are many reference to fallout 1 so I recommend playing the first before heading to the second.Fantastic the plot, should I say is better than the first...well is really hard to say because they're both great! In my opinion I slightly sided with the first game plot because of sentimental value moments but the second just nail right in the park with interesting characters, settings, the jokes oh my god the jokes are better than ever because there are some moments that I smile for those humorous wacky moments. The new enemies are interesting like the enclave (I havn't played fallout 3 before this review) sadly I was a slight dissapointment of not much shown on the brotherhood of steel just only a mention on their OPs and I like them in the first game but I understand they want the most focus on the enclaves.\n\nYour partners have a combat control which is awesome that you can put some orders into your team and they do better in combat but it does not mean their AI is better oh no just slightly, the rest the AI of your team can be walking targets at times. Side missions are better than ever especially the many new added towns they put that you can do a lot in their for many hours. I spend countless of hours just to complete the side-missions which are just awesome to complete because each important side missions adds personality of the towns and it will eventually effect the ending depends of actions you take.\n\nEVERY ACTION COUNTS\nI really starting to love the fallout franchise just because of the towns I visit and the different atmosphere the citizens treated you or to others and it adds different layers of problems and situations that can effect other towns as well if you don't take care of the problem. You can be the savior of many towns saying your name like a hero or you can be a complete bully to everyone and doesn't give a dang about anyone and just want money, booze and sex. Each reputation to each of the town you did effects the endings and there are multiple once and even some funny shock once that you can actual impregnate someone and that child will be "this character." Depends on whom you impregnate though is very limit and I wish they put more on that including when choosing a female. I was playing a female and a slave trader wants me to be in bed if I did and got the ending that I have a child and that child will do this I would laugh but instead I didn't and just pop his head by the end of my barrel.\n\nNow there are some minor annoyance when doing specific actions and that is when following some direction to someone only that you the player playing the game for the first time just follows direction. When doing that task you actually miss one conversation to this specific NPC or doing this specific task and thus either lose that oppurtunity to get it back (unless reset a point of the game) and have to either do it the hard way or just lose an event that you wish to explore. I know the game can be specific on their actions toward some events but man can it backfire sometimes to very important events that you either wish you don't miss or don't want to tackle. Like extra experience or easier access to a certain level with ease.\n\nDiversity and Reality\nI'm really surprise Interplay is really open and creative with this game back in the late 90s! I will say atleast when playing a female there are hinted of homosexuality which you can actually sleep with other females (don't know males but I'm betting yes). The jokes as I mention again is up high because it tackles some interesting topics that back then videogames had to censor it but this one is like an infant state of Southpark, poking fun of many topics in real life we tackle such as; scientology, American politics, race dispute and drug war. I am so happy they made it so professional about their jokes and not over the top in your face though some you might catch up where are they putting but it isn't enough to make it "contriversal" to start yet another arguement. There just many easter eggs, references on different levels of media that I tried google up where are all these little sweet bits come from.\n\nBugs and Improvments\nThere are many improvements within the game but how about the combat and trading system? Well the combat feels the same as before though I still which I get an extra AP two get two shots instead of only one and not have to wait for a perk but other than that they added some new perks along the way. The trading system they finally fix that issue I had with the cap collecting where you have to press one by one, now you have to hold it and it will raise the caps level faster the longer you hold though to be honest is not exactly what I want I still prefer that wishful thinking where you can change the digit of the number of caps to save even more time but eh is atleast a slightly better.\n\nThe bugs I notice they have a bit more than fallout 1 if I'm right? Like some scenarios it won't activated, sometimes my partners even walk through walls or out of the border which I laugh a couple times when Vic just casually walking through an impenetrable base and he walk in the fence and building with no problem. The biggest complaint I should add of the bugs is script errors and even scenes missing! Like don't worry if at some parts you say to yourself "shouldn't it be here or shouldn't the person say something else?" Well that's script error and some scenes missing some bug reasons some developer time constraint and that's kind a sad. Because there are some interesting areas I really want to explore or complete like finding sulik's sister or going in the chinese's sub or even saving the deathclaws from extinction!Thankfully I heard there are some patches that fix some problems and even improve a better experience to the player even more. The only personal issue I will warn you is once again be careful on running this game on win 10 (and Idk win 7) because it does work and I finish the game but in some areas my fps runs slow like walking in mollasses. I don't know if there is a fix on it or not so please be warn not to break your keyboard if it slows down, just make multiple saves, reset on one point and it will go away for now is not a constant nuisance since is only on some section of a town but it gets frustrating later on if it keeps doing that.\n\nIn conclussion I'll give a 9/10 the best sequel of its time and even still to this day, it really does age well to look back and enjoy this masterpiece collection to play again or start a new.","February 6","true","67.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

War never changes.\n\nThe end of the world occurred pretty much as we had predicted. Too many humans, not enough space or resources to go around. The details are trivial and pointless, the reasons, as always, purely human ones.\n\nThe earth was nearly wiped clean of life. A great cleansing, an atomic spark struck by human hands, quickly raged out of control. Spears of nuclear fire rained from the skies. Continents were swallowed in flames and fell beneath the boiling oceans. Humanity was almost extinguished, their spirits becoming part of the background radiation that blanketed the earth.\n\nA quiet darkness fell across the planet, lasting many years. Few survived the devastation. Some had been fortunate enough to reach safety, taking shelter in great underground vaults. When the great darkness passed, these vaults opened, and their inhabitants emerged to begin their lives again.\n\nOne of the northern tribes claims they are descended from one such Vault. They hold that their founder and ancestor, one known as the "Vault Dweller," once saved the world from a great evil. According to their legend, this evil arose in the far south. It corrupted all it touched, twisting men inside, turning them into beasts. Only through the bravery of this Vault Dweller was the evil destroyed. But in so doing, he lost many of his friends and suffered greatly, sacrificing much of himself to save the world.\n\nWhen at last he returned to the home he had fought so hard to protect, he was cast out. Exiled. In confronting that which they feared, he had become something else in their eyes...and no longer their champion.\n\nForsaken by his people, he strode into the wasteland. He traveled far to the north, until he came to the great canyons. There, he founded a small village, Arroyo, where he lived out the rest of his years. And so, for a generation since its founding, Arroyo has lived in peace, its canyons sheltering it from the outside world. It is home. Your home.\n\nBut the scars left by the war have not yet healed.

It was designed by the most talented game studio of all time, Black Isle Studios, with much of the excellence being on showcase in Planescape: Torment which was released the following year.  Largely a different kind of excellence, but both games are so much more original and limitless than anything today.  Everything you do in Fallout 2 leads to some reaction, big or small, but usually somewhat realistic.  When playing the game you have to think twice about what you say and how you act.\n\nKeep talking to someone who doesn't want to be bothered, and there may actually be consequences.  Sneak around in the open and people will question you.  Walk around with a weapon equipped in certain places and you may find yourself being fired upon.  Throw away First Citizen Lynette's trust and say goodbye to Vault City forever.  Become a boxing champion in New Reno and you will be famous and respected in that area, with the townsfolk calling you "Champ" most of the time.  Play as a cold blooded, ruthless killer and you will be feared and certain quests will open up to you while others will become unavailable.  Finish the main quest in a positive way and you will be hailed a hero in most places.  Play as a low intelligence character and watch the whole game transform appropriately (look it up on YouTube if you must).  The list goes on, these are just some examples of the attention to detail in Fallout 2 that no other game exhibits.\n\nFallout 2 is also a very good satire, less serious than its modern counterparts.  If you've only played Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 then you've barely experienced Fallout.  New Vegas is an impressive sequel however, but still more "gamey" and with less role-playing.","April 26","true","30.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Alot of it is really the travelling, as it is further and takes longer to get between the different towns in this one. But you have a CAR! BUT that car has some of the worse bugs in video game history, you can be an unlucky player like I did and lost the car randomly, never to ever see it again. There is no way to track where your car is situated and yea if you lose track of it or if the lost car bug happens to you, that's it no more car for you. You cant get it back nor can you get another one. Also in this game you can play your character even AFTER you finish the game to pick up the quests you missed etc. It is a good game but a very long and buggy game too.

All of them have great atmosphere and mood, but they also have their fair share of stupid mistakes or just plain lack of certain qualities. Fallout 2 eludes most of the failings of its predecessor and its successors and stands strong on its own as well.\n\nIt provides enough variety and character to feel full and alive, while staying true to the mood and maintaining the bar of quality at a reasonable level. Just as importantly, it maintains a very decent level of reactivity and non-linearity, and offers maybe not perfect but seriously flexible mechanics. It also introduces the best plot twist of the whole series. So all in all, I'd call it the purest and the most successful execution of the Fallout concept so far.\n\nEven though I would love it to have more of the desperate and mysterious mood of the very beginning of Fallout 1, the vast pretty enviroments of Fallout 3 and the tasteful characterization of New Vegas.","April 6, 2013","true","30.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I will tell you my experience.\n\nHere you are born in a tribal village in the wasteland of america,  your home where your ancestor known as the vault dweller of V13 was exiled from his overseer due to the fear of spreading diseases and radiation inside the vault towards the pure dwellers, your ancestor did nothing wrong but saved his people from being forced out of the vault into the cruel wasteland due to a dying water supply and being raided by monsterous mutants of the Master's army, he walked north and north to find a tribal village on the wasteland... in present time, you discover your home village is dying.. brahmin are dying, children sick with diseases. everything was starting to fall apart slowly, but you the decendant of the v13 dweller have been chosen by the village's elder to go out the wasteland explored by your ancestor to find the mighty G.E.C.K to fix all this hell happening.. and that is where your journey begins.\n\nNow with some quick tips before you first time play this game:\n\nI reccomend reading this guide to help you get started playing, trust me its worth to read than being torn to shreds by a small Enclave patrol or getting shotgunned in the face when you try to fight with melee in a random encounter. small spoilers because the guide also brings up the details with all the quests available in this game\nhttp://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/The_Nearly_Ultimate_Fallout_2_Guide#Character_design\n\nDon't ragequit over getting wrecked by a bunch of geckos or radscorpians, the more you play the game, the better.\n\n\nOkay so now onto the Gameplay, its very Turnbased but its rewarding seeing the animations of someones torso being blown to bits by shotguns and mini-guns, even melting him like a witch with a plasma gun is entertaining too, of course you can also be blown to bits by anyone. there isn't open world exploration like you get in fallout 3 because outside of towns/other places will bring a large map with a green dot (you) click around and you move around, when you want to travel to another location for the side/main quests  you will often have random encounters such as radscorps, walking into a middle of a firefight between caravans and bandits, there are peaceful encounters like the caravans who will trade with you for caps (aka money) of course the small downside with trading is your karma status effects the caravans, some of them will refuse to trade with you either becuase you are known as a evil fat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ villlain  or a goodie white knight of the wasteland it mainly depends on  locations that you are nearby like the cities, small hint there are easter egg encounters too!\n\nYou can also choose to do what ever you want. Killing before asking/chatting, turning the tables of the side quest (i.e giving the brahmin you were meant to guard to the twins when you trick your dumb tribal friend into running away)\nyou can't slaughter the villagers in your home cus otherwise the game will be over insta.\n\nThere are also Companions that you can take with you on your travels, based on my experience I will give you the details of the companions I had with me.\n\nVic This man may be your second/first companion you can bring along, he's good for ranged weapons, be sure to collect his rifle at his shack in the first town you go to, but he's often slow and bad for melee combat.\n\nLenny A ghoul, he's not great with combat and carrys a knife with him but he is a decent doctor, have him as your field medic and sort. Also he cannot run.\n\nMarcus this guy has a talking head voice acted too, but if you want this big hulk with you, its best you either take his mini-gun away and give him a plasma rifle, or have him as your only companion because he will freaking kill every single thing in his line of fire no matter who's infront when you're in combat, his mini-gun often has a unaccurate shot hitting mutiple targets in a burst of fire which means he can instantly kill you or his fellow companion by accident.\n\nK9 this cyber dog is simliar to the famous dog-meat but he can talk and is cool, you can find him inside a lab at the navvarro Enclave base, its best you get in there with the highwayman car otherwise you will have a pain in the ♥♥♥ experience getting killed by enclave patrols in 1 turn every time.\n\nGoris this DEATHCLAW is quite a badass, except he can only fight with his claws in melee so he can sometimes get in your line of fire including marcus's and his animation with his jedi cloak gets repeative.\n\nThe story also has multiple endings on every town and faction you have met along in your travels, your actions towards them will bring them a future, for example if you slaughter the slavers at the Den and free the slaves, the town will flourish and sort, and if you screw up modac its gonna die because you made a mistake on your decision.\n\nImmersion on this game regardless of the graphics is really great too, you're gonna get tempted to kill somebody because of what-he-said about those poor ghouls or maybe even insulting you. This is not some fallout 3 where enclaves gets killed by revolvers, or deathclaws getting killed in 3 seconds or children being immune to gunshots Oh yeah you can kill kids in this game if you're a heartless monster :3  this is fallout 2 friend.\n\n\n-fun turnbased gameplay\n-immersive storyline\n-able to do what you want that can effect karma or faction/town reputation including the ending of the faction and town.\n\n\n","September 21, 2014","true","51.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I had put 39 hours into this game and then, one day my computer starts running into issues. Long story short I had to completly reset my HDD and reinstall windows. I thought I would still be able to play Fallout 2 as my saves have been uploaded onto the steam cloud. When I reinstalled the game, my saves came along with it, only for every save to give me this error upon attemping to load "The instruction at 004f11db referenced memory from 00000010 The memory could not be read from" I have looked up just about every single discussion about this error and nobody can find a way past it. I have posted about it on reddit, steam discussions and nma-fallout.com.

This is one of my all-time favorite games, and I grew up with it along with the first game. It was part of my childhood and continues to be a part of my life all these years later, and it will always have a place in my heart.  Fallout 2 is excellent and anyone who likes RPGs who aren't afraid to play a game that isn't entirely welcoming should give it a shot; I admit I am somewhat biased because of my nostalgia but that doesn't explain the entirety of why I think this is an excellent game.  There is *much* more to this game than the references, humor and fourth wall breaking; that being said, the humor is a nice touch depending on your tastes.  This game deserves as much attention and recognition as the first in the series and I consider both games to be one in the same and part of the same collective experience.\n\nThis is game is punishing in certain ways, and is not that casual of an experience; and in some ways I would admit that this game isn't the most welcoming, but once you figure things out and start to progress there are numerous different possibilities and choices laid out before you, and you can play any type of character you choose and have any type of temperament you choose in this game world, which is rich and unique.\n\nFallout 1 and 2 haven't aged very well, although personally I can transcend that completely due to my nostalgia and attachment to the series; the game looks better now since we can change the screen resolution, and the game is even better with the Restoration Project mod.\n\nYou are the grandchild of the Vault Dweller from Fallout 1, the game takes place 80 years after the first game, and you are part of a primitive tribe which your ancestor founded.  You must save your tribe by finding the holy GECK.  Along the way in your quest, you can do many interesting things and talk to many interesting characters.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as in Fallout 1, which in my opinion, is a good thing. Fallout 2 is much longer and there is much more to do and see in Fallout 2 than the first (especially with the Restoration Project mod), although the first game is excellent for many of the same reasons this game is excellent.  Most people who enjoyed Fallout 1 (or similar titles) will probably enjoy this immensely also.  I would even recommend this game to people who don't normally play games like it, but are merely very interested in the Fallout lore.\n\nThere is an issue I have with the game but only due to playing it on newer, larger displays and playing it on a higher resolution than the game was initially intended for; certain scenes will look wrong if the resolution is set high.\n\nIn conclusion, this isn't for everyone and not everyone will be able to enjoy it in the same capacity as others might, for whatever reasons, whether it has to do with the age of the game or not.  But this is classic Fallout and deserves as much love as the first in the series.  This game is highly recommended for any fan of oldschool turn-based RPGs, this and its predecessor helped to redefine the genre. This game is old, but it's excellent and one of the best RPGs I've played, and is very well written.\n\nI'd also highly recommend the Restoration Project mod, which includes the Unofficial Patch.  It restores new content into the game that the developers intended to have in the first place but weren't able to, and  you can choose which options you would like to install easily. killap.net","May 20","true","77.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

The story involved you searching for the G.E.C.K. device to save your tribe from disease but of course on your way you come across many obstacles and obstructions as you are looking for the G.E.C.K. 11/10, Must have, Game of the century, Perhaps the game of the universe.","April 27, 2014","true","0.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

What I got out of the game has lasted me a lifetime. From it's familiar locales like New Reno and San Francisco, to it's gritty noir, Fallout 2 has it all.  You could even murder kids and get branded a Childkiller. Not your forte? You can go into the porn industry in New Reno! If you're any sort of fan of post-apocalytic scenarios or films in general, this is an assured staple for your library. Every few years (or new computer, I suppose), I would dig out my old burned copy and reinstall it to give it another playthrough. I happened upon a one-day sale wherein Fallout 1-3, New Vegas, and Tactics were all $2.49 apiece. Naturally, I ♥♥♥♥ with glee and promptly ordered. This game will entrance you, given a few hours of dedication. Just like Fallout 3, Fallout 2 begins with a catchy, old-timey tune; in this case, it's Louis Armstrong's "Kiss To Build A Dream On." Here's hoping this game sticks with you, too.","July 20, 2014","true","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

There is no room for this evil in my world!  I charge right through the front door and skewer the boss twice with my trusty spear of justice...   at which point six heavily armored guards blast my head and arms off with submachine guns, as my 11 year old eyes stare in shock at my blood sputtering corpse on the floor.\n\nI would forever remember this day as when I TRULY understood why guns are better than swords.\n\n\nFallout 1 and 2 are both artifacts from a time when there was no mainstream gaming.

I'm poisoned, bleary eyed and have six hitpoints remaining.\nI just survived the first dungeon with a charismatic character. I killed some Giant Ants.\n\nThis is what Fallout was. A sprawling, tough RPG that actually required some amount of planning toward your character and your decisions. Even to this day the dialogue is great and the story gripping yet allows a sense of freedom. If you want a fighting character you better make a fighting character. When I played Fallout 4 I made an incredibly charismatic, intelligent character with poor stats in fighting. I still managed to kill everything. In Fallout 2 I barely survived the first dungeon, getting mauled by Lesser Scorpions and Giant Ants, all because I wanted my character to be a talker, not a fighter.\nObviously it's aged; three mousepointers need to be alternated between; combat, movement and interaction. There's a panel that brings up skills and not everything is made immediately clear.\nBut if those main 'problems' with the game don't scare you away then this is a great game. It's worth a try, even if just to see how Fallout was and to experience a true gaming classic; one that will remain for countless years as a great game in the history of gaming.\n\njmcone's Personal Rating: Highly Recommended","March 16","true","10.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It was back in 1998 and it was a jolly good time to be a gamer. This game was the perfect example of "not fixing what isn't broken". So, game mechanics were pretty much the same while the game world became much, much larger.\n\nStorywise we control a Vault Dweller once more - in fact, our protagonist is the descendant of the hero of the first game - who's tasked to save his establishment by acquiring the so-called G.E.C.K., a device with such a power that it can restore completely damaged environments to their default state.\n\nNaturally, the "bigger the better" concept was followed by introducing a wider range of weapons and enemies and, of course, new environments. We also have more skills, perks and beside Karma we also have a Reputation. Something that is constantly changing along the way as we make progress by completing subquests. You can be attacked in a new town if you have a bad reputation -  settlements are not independent of one another; if you complete a deed somewhere it may very well be heard of elsewhere.\n\nFinally, recruitable characters seem to be much, much better. We have total control over them by being able to issue orders, help them level up and provide equipment. Just make sure you have the necessary Karma to be able to recruit them - not that you don't have enough to get to know. With all the new stuff introduced Fallout 2 requires much more time to complete - if you're a completionist you can expect to spend 50-60 hours with the sequel. And, of course, like in case of all such RPGs you can start a new game, pick a different level-up method, solve quests in a different way and hire different people to be at your service.\n\nI spent dozens of hours with this game when it came out. I remember being happy of having our own car (called Highwayman) which then could easily disappear (in fact, the game had a related bug which needed to be patched at the time). If you did not pay attention you could lost it forever. It was a shame as it made travelling between towns fast and easy.\n\nFallout 2 is a classic. And it comes patched on Steam which allows us to pick a higher resolution. If you have invested hundreds of hours into Fallout 3 et al you might as well check where it all started back in the '90s.","May 29","true","0.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The stat system offers unparalleled variety. This might be the only RPG, for example, where having a low Intelligence actually changes the way your character talks and how NPCs respond (you haven't truly played until you've tried a character with a level 1 INT and watched him bumble about like a cartoon Neanderthal). Also, the game is huge and, best of all, you can do all the things that RPGs usually shy away from: go on a mass child killing spree, get addicted to speed, become a gay porn star (provided your "endurance" score is high enough, of course), contract venereal diseases, become a pimp or a slave trader. What's not to love? Plus, everything's given a sort of "Gee Whiz!," "Leave it to Beaver" sheen so the contrast between the main character's wide eyed naiveté and the often terrible stuff he's duped into doing (often with the best intentions) is always amusing and can provide a good deal of comedy (depending on how you play).","January 8, 2012","true","64.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This and Fallout 1 are MUST OWNS!\nI recently purchased the 2 in a bundle and I seriously cannot put them down! I've been hooked on them for 2 weeks straight. Now I know if you're like me and not from the era of these types of games you need to be in the mood to play this type of top down, turn based system. But if you look up a quick guide like I did, I was used to the system and was having fun within the first 20 min of Fallout 1. And since FO2 is so similar, you can get straight into it.\n- The story of the games is 10/10, love them.\n- The worlds (especially Fallout 2) are sensational, I spoke to every NPC to soak in as much info as I could\n- The companions are cool but as always in these games, they're in the way a lot and they shoot you a fair bit (Much improved in fallout 2 since you can push them out of the way)\n- And the CHOICES! I now understand why all the other fans were dissapointed in FO3 and 4.. the choices and consequences here are exciting and rewarding.\n- FO2 = Best RPG i've ever played\n\nThere is sooo much more to be said here but I need to get back to slaughtering slavers.

I have mixed feelings on this one.\n\nFallout 2 is more or less the same as Fallout in terms of gameplay, but with improvements, which is certainly a plus. There is one minor gameplay quibble I have, and that's that they slightly nerfed the Turbo Plasma Rifle for no good reason. Why, besides trying to make the Pulse Rifle seem better by comparison? That seems like the completely wrong way to go about it, making and trying to balance new content by changing the old. It was fine! On the subject of equipment changes, they also reduced the weight of the Power Armor by about half with no explanation. I'd accept that if you at least acknowledged it, but now it just seems kind of silly. Just one offhand remark about removing unnecessary systems in there! THAT'S IT!\n\nAnyway, the story issue is a bit more complex. The focus in Fallout 2, I've noticed, is more based on the moment-to-moment or area-to-area experience, rather than Fallout 1's cohesive whole. As a result, the whole thing seems more scattered, muddier, and overall less entertaining and less absorbing, as they'll do anything to make sure that you're never not entertained, while Fallout made sure that there was a single, easy-to-follow narrative, leading to a better and more consistent atmosphere.\n\nOne other really annoying thing: the game takes forever to get going, especially for gun-oriented characters. The Temple of Trials and the majority of Klamath have nothing but scorn for your desire to find a single ranged weapon that doesn't have a 1-bullet clip, and even then you're still on shaky ground until maybe the Den. For a while, I even tried to just play a hand-to-hand character for this game simply because the beginning is so stupidly unhelpful! In contrast, take a look at Fallout 1's beginning. You're kicked out the door. You have a gun, a knife, and ammo to spare (and a definite and straightforward goal). Boom. All playstyles are go. Even with the gameplay sorting itself out, the whole Fallout 2 package doesn't really get engaging until Gecko. After that, though, it really does pick up steam, and by the Enclave you realize that just now you're getting the experience and thrills that Fallout 1 was delivering from square one. (I should probably mention that eventually I was so desperate for some fun way forward that I looked up Per Jorner's excellent guide. That was what truly rekindled my interest, and I urge everyone to check it out. It contains levels of love and research of and for a game that I haven't seen since Everything You Wanted to Know About Headcrabs and More. Check that out too, actually.)\n\nOverall, I like Fallout 1 more. Fallout 2 is huge, much bigger than its predecessor, and has its share of wonderous delights (don't get me wrong on that), but more often than not for me they're hidden behind some sort of obtuse non-engaging..sloppiness? Design oversight? Overreaching? that the first game rarely if ever had. I guess I'd still recommend it -mostly for the story connectivity- but really, Fallout 1 is the better of the two, in my opinion.\n\nTL;DR I like Fallout 1 more, it seems to me that they got sloppy with this one. Too big to ignore, though.\n\nAlso, some of the canonical and best endings are hidden behind lazy bugs? WHAT?\n\nEDIT: Just recently, I've been replaying the Fallout games in preparation for Fallout 2. When it came time for Fallout 2, I used Per Jorner's guide to speedrun through the thing in the course of a night. Playing through the entire thing once was enough for me.","August 4, 2015","true","109.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Whereas Fallout 1 drew me right in from the start, I had to force myself through the first couple hours of Fallout 2, but it was worth it. What you find is a game with everything that Fallout 1 did right, (the atmosphere, the characters, the immersion, the story) and added onto it with a bigger environment, more things to do, more items, and a generally longer and more diverse gaming experience. Highly recommended to anybody who can appreciate an older game.\n\nNOTE: If using windows 7, the colours will most likely look really distorted when you launch the game. This makes the game unplayable, but it can be easily 'fixed' by closing explorer.exe when you run the game.","May 28, 2014","true","69.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

I started with Fallout. It was fun and gave some background information to common themes in the later games. I beat it in under 24 hours, if I hadn't wasted 3 hours remaking characters that could survive it would have been less.\nThen came Fallout 2. With the experience I had gained from Fallout I ran into Fallout 2 expecting a cakewalk. I was wrong. The wasteland had became an even harsher place. It took over 50 hours to beat this game and I loved every moment. Unlike in Fallout where I had ditched Ian late in the game to comtinue on, I found myself reloading ealier saves time after time when Lenny or Cassidy died. I ran all over the wasteland avoiding the Enclave and mutants searching for secret places and proper oppponents. I hope when I start Fallout 3 Soon that I can experience the same level of investment in a game.","January 30, 2014","true","53.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Differing from the third installment (not including Fallout Tactics, Fallout BoS, or any of the other spinoffs that are not considered part of the Fallout lore canon) in the series, the first and second installments were more so based around strategy, smart thinking, constant saves, and knowing when to either fight or run. Compared to the more recent installments, this game, along with the prequel, is somewhat like playing a game of chess. Knowing when to move, when to strike, and when to regret poor decisions. Not a game for those who are not good with tactics. Sadly, it starts somewhat slowly, and once you get really going later on in the game, it get's to the point where not even the more deadly mobs, like Deathclaws or Wamaningos, can not do much harm to you or your party due to how strong someone can become in the game. Let's talk about the story. You, the Player Character, are the son or daughter of the original Vault Dweller, the main protaginist of the first Fallout game. At the start, you go out to find the Garden of Eden Creation Kit, or more simply known as the G.E.C.K, in order to prevent your village of Arroyo from dying of famine and disease. As time goes on, it goes from trying to prevent your crops from dying, to trying to save your village from the Enclave, the remnants of the American Government, who captured your fellow villagers to perform experiments on them, and you're the only one who can do anything about it. Well, you and your party of not-so-merry pals. Ranging from a Artificial Intelligence, to a super mutant, to even a intelligent Deathclaw, you have a wide variety of followers to recruit. Personally, I give this game a 9 / 10, a great strategic game with a decent story and and a lot of replayability, I highly recommend this to anyone who likes the Fallout series, as well as anyone who likes to think strategicly.","June 27, 2014","true","242.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Differing from the third installment (not including Fallout Tactics, Fallout BoS, or any of the other spinoffs that are not considered part of the Fallout lore canon) in the series, the first and second installments were more so based around strategy, smart thinking, constant saves, and knowing when to either fight or run. Compared to the more recent installments, this game, along with the prequel, is somewhat like playing a game of chess. Knowing when to move, when to strike, and when to regret poor decisions. Not a game for those who are not good with tactics. Sadly, it starts somewhat slowly, and once you get really going later on in the game, it get's to the point where not even the more deadly mobs, like Deathclaws or Wamaningos, can not do much harm to you or your party due to how strong someone can become in the game. Let's talk about the story. You, the Player Character, are the son or daughter of the original Vault Dweller, the main protaginist of the first Fallout game. At the start, you go out to find the Garden of Eden Creation Kit, or more simply known as the G.E.C.K, in order to prevent your village of Arroyo from dying of famine and disease. As time goes on, it goes from trying to prevent your crops from dying, to trying to save your village from the Enclave, the remnants of the American Government, who captured your fellow villagers to perform experiments on them, and you're the only one who can do anything about it. Well, you and your party of not-so-merry pals. Ranging from a Artificial Intelligence, to a super mutant, to even a intelligent Deathclaw, you have a wide variety of followers to recruit. Personally, I give this game a 9 / 10, a great strategic game with a decent story and and a lot of replayability, I highly recommend this to anyone who likes the Fallout series, as well as anyone who likes to think strategicly.","June 27, 2014","true","242.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You are sent off into the wastes to help your tribe "Arroyo" and uncover the legacy The Vault Dweller left behind within California/Nevada and introducing a new grand threat who origins are from those whom governed before, the "ENCLAVE". Remnants of the United States.\n\nThe core gameplay mechanics never really changed when transitioning between Fallout 1 and 2 (Isometric turned based combat). The most noticable differences is the amount of new perks, and the way you begin the game. Fallout 2 entices you to create a close-quarters heavy build, over Fallout 1's small guns since you are a tribal. This game also introduces a boatload of new companions (12-13), which smothers Fallout 1's four followers. Fallout 2 has plenty of new quests that all intertwine nicely together, as multiple factions and cities effect one another.\n\nTons of Fallout cameos, pop-culture references, and tons of new content.\n\nSuch a lovely addition to my Fallout experience!\n(Did one playthrough, with around 90% of the sidequests complete.

We're a stubborn race of beings. Like cockroaches. We're everywhere, we just won't go away, and we seem to find a way to procreate everywhere.\n\nOut of every possible way that the human race could near extinction, I think being mostly annihilated by an atomic bomb or so would be the best way to go. Especially if Fallout is something we could go on.\n\n\nIn Fallout 2 specifically, one of the great tactical CRPG classics, an atomic post-apocalyptic wasteland is a pretty fun place. You can pretty much do whatever you want.\n\n\nFallout 2 takes place after the events of Fallout 1, with your character from the first game starting their own village outside the Vault to live out the rest of their days. Your new character is a descendant of them, and has grown up outside the Vault. Their village has had a horrible drought, and it's up to you as The Chosen One to set off and save the world.\n\n\nFallout 2 is near identical to the first game in terms of gameplay, polished and upgraded to make it the definitive classic Fallout experience. If you're looking for the very best in terms of isometric, tactical CRPG action, Fallout 2 is probably your game.\n\n\nThe time limit is gone. You're free to explore Fallout 2's vast, open world to your heart's content. There's all sorts of side-quests, missions, and just random nonsense to get yourself into. You can join the mafia, become a pornstar, or just slaughter every human being you see. It's all free game.\n\n\nTo start, you just need to create your character. There is a selection of pre-made ones, but the real fun of the game is creating your own character to fully immerse yourself in the world of Fallout.\n\n\nFrom there, you just need to play through what could be called a crude tutorial dungeon. After that, the world opens up. Slowly at first, as your stats will not allow much exploration when the wasteland is crawling with giant scorpions and freaks. But with time, you'll be able to do as you please.\n\n\nMechanically, it's better than the original Fallout. It plays better, it controls better, and it has more depth than the original in terms of what the world offers. The gameplay has been balanced to make all character skills viable, which was an issue with the first Fallout game. As a sequel, it definitely has at least improved upon the original.\n\n\nHowever, I personally still prefer the first one. Fallout 2, I felt took a lot of what made Fallout special out of the equation. The time limit, while brutal, was part of giving that sensation of hopelessness and urgency. And having your character born outside of a Vault, it took some of the impact away of having stepped out into the wasteland for the first time.\n\n\nThe story was not as compelling, and it didn't really feel like Fallout at first to me. The early game is particularly slow, and it takes a while to really capture that Fallout vibe.\n\n\nAs an older game, it is still a little bit dated. Especially in the graphics department. But still completely enjoyable as a game. I always did have a thing for older games. I like them a little mature, you know?\n\n\nRegardless, Fallout 2 is still a very special game. There aren't very many other games where you can blow up small children with powerful explosives, become a slaver, or have sex with a mutant. Fallout 2 really is something special, and it's an essential part of any PC game collection. The sheer depth of the game constantly gives off the feeling that there's still more to do and more to see.\n\n\nIn the event of a real nuclear apocalypse, I call dibs on leader of the pornstar mafia. No, I already got dibs, it's official. Too bad. You can be something else.\n\n\nI called it, it's mine.","September 3, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is next to nothing in terms of a tutorial, and it is much different in how it handles quests compared to NV and 3. It does not throw them into your face and say "DO THIS ♥♥♥♥ OR NOT FINISH GAME!" Instead, it leaves you on your own the moment you leave the temple. The character creation is something that we are all familiar with, but matters alot more in this game than it did in fallout, 3, and NV. You have your standard S.P.E.C.I.A.L. selection, and lots of things to specialize in. Unlike in NV and 3, the game doesn't force you to go through primm, and do vault missions. You just get thrown out into the wasteland with one overall quest. It puts one place on your map and it is entirely up to you on whether you go there or not. Also, the wasteland encounters are completely random, and unlike in NV and 3, you cannot take out a group of 5 bandits fresh out of the gate. Also this game is a roleplayer unlike 3 and NV (I havent sunk alot of time into fallout yet, only 3 hours). The choices you make leave a huge lasting impact on the world, you can be a truly evil sonofa♥♥♥♥♥ and kill all the kids in the den, or you can be a nice guy and help torr take care of the "moo-moo's." Hell, you can be a pornstar. This game also has alot of pop culture references. Arnold swollenmember being a pornstar name. It knows when to be serious and when to be funny. It has a rich amount of lore, and you feel like this world is alive. In fallout 3 and new vegas, never once did I feel like the world was living and breathing. Every random encounter felt perfectly timed, and it has put me on the highest of high's and the lowest of lows. This game is one of my top 5 games of all time. I love everything in this game. You can feel your character get stronger. The combat can make your heart pulse rapidly, making you question on whether or not you did the right thing. Every choice you make has a consequence. The game also puts you in positions where there is no right choice. Remember in mass effect when you had to choose who died? this game does that to you quite often and makes you think "did I make the right choice? was this a good thing? should I have saved him/her?" This game is boring at first, for about 3-5 hours, but it only gets better afterwords. I have also not encountered any game breaking bugs yet. One of the only bugs I have had to deal with is when I alt tab out and back in when I am in conversation with someone, the screen blacks out and I have to end conversation to get the screen to display the whole game. It is the only problem I have with this game. This game is addictive, it is a drug. You will get hooked on this like your character after jet. You will not be able to put it down until you have passed out on your keyboard. It will devour your living essence. you will forget about eating and sleeping, you will devote your life to this game. Some of the most fun I have ever had. 10/10 would play again.","July 17, 2015","true","39.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have been a huge fan of the Fallout series since I was a kid and this game delivers almost everything a fallout fan could want but you have to take it for what it is. The game is about 16 years old now so for most of the people that became fans of the series because of Fallout 3 and New Vegas this game is not what you might be expecting. I recommend this game to all of the people that grew up in the 90's and love the rpgs from that time. I do not recommend it for all of the people that are expecting it to be like Fallout 3 or New Vegas or any newer game for that matter. This game is amazing but like I said you have to take it for what it is.","November 19, 2014","true","6.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Very goofy, sometimes.\n-Good variety of weapons\n-Most companions are useful (Vic is the most useful, with is gr8 repair.)\n-Restoration project (Add's SO many bug fixes, cut content, etc into the game the dev's took out, such as the childkiller perk picture was turned back into that fallout guy kicking a pregnant woman in the gut. )\n-Good story\n-Many references to the predecessor, or other games in the series. (It's a personal thing. I like when a game does this.)\n-Some of the puns are actually entertaining to read.\n-SEVERAL hours of gameplay (Even after you finish the game. You can still do many,many things.) I've spent 100+ hours on one character.\n-Good graphics (Although not the most important thing in the game by a longshot, they are still great for 1998.)\n-Mod support\n-Virtually no bugs (I've only seen one through 3 playthroughs)\n-You almost never need to scavange for ammo, unless you are almost completely out. Most vendors in the game sell at least some ammo of some type. (i.e, 10mm ammo)\n-Karma can very much effect your game.\n-Being a childkiller actually has precautions, other than alot of people hating you. Bounty hunters will come after you. What they have depends on your level. They can have leather jackets and 10mm pistols/Hunting Rifles (Level 3-8*) to guys in Enclave power armor with very powerful weapons like miniguns, gauss rifles, etc. (level 15+*) IF you kill them, its very good loot.\nPros/Cons (Problems, but easily fixed.):\n-AP Ammo is useless without the Rest. Project (Rest. Project is very easy to install, just download, choose custom install, and find Yet Another Ammo Mod. Check that, and finish the rest of the things. AP ammo is very useful against decently armored oponents now.)\n-Companions can constantly kill you with machine guns. Stay out of their way. (Amazing example is Marcus with a Bozar or Minigun. Very annoying. Just give him a laser, plasma, etc rifle if you can spare the ammo and gun itself.)\n-Don't make Sulik charge at people. He will just get himself killed, pretty much instantly. Make him stay near you and give him a .223 Pistol (If possible.) It has the same sprite as an SMG, so he can use it. .223 ammo is very common.\n-Untill you get to Klamath, the beginning of the game is somewhat boring.\n-LIke stated before, there are bugs, but most are rare.\nCons:\n- The few bugs there are, some are kinda bad (i.e crashes the game.)\n- Enemy burst fire does a bit too much damage sometimes. (I was wearing Advanced Power Armor Mk2, and a raider burst fired a CAWS, it was a crit, and it did 83 damage. Raider pls, that's bullsheit)\n- Can't loot armor, which makes no sense. (There are mods for this, but most mods can be a pain in the a s s to install correctly.)\n\n*I'm just guessing,\n\nKeep in mind, this is my opinion, no-one else's. Negative commenters get blocked with no reply to their comment. Constructive critisism is welcomed.","July 5, 2015","true","411.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Even to this day the master will freak people the living hell out of them. I even saw a drawing of him and i got spooked. The game isnt that buggy except for the exploitive ones.

It is very old but that does not take away anything from it. The begining of the game is extreamly bad. The first temple will make you want to stop playign but after that its amazing. As you progress in the story you go to different cites with 10 or so different side quests. And they are very interesting. One is about a ghost where you help her find peace. Another is where you go to a bar on one side of town where drinks are twice as much as a bar on the other side of town and you can do a quest where you go snooping around looking for the reason those drinks are so low. In the begining of the game you won't have much and combat can be a little difficult since in fast travel it brings you to a map where you click around in the direction the NPC's told you the next city is which is very unique and interesting. Although sometimes you will run into a group of bandits ir wild animals trying to kill you and since there are edges of the land that you are on you can just run away very easily. Over all this is a great game.","August 23, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've put in hundreds of hours in it playing different ways with different characters before I added it to my steam library (I own the discs for 1 and 2).\nThe game has a good mix of stat/skill building and loot collection. For its time, the cutscenes are pretty good. There's little to be desired in such a classic game.\nThe ability to choose your path in this game is beyond astounding for such an old game. If you remember when Fable came out, people freaked out because you could choose your own path. Fallout has done that stuff way before such games. If you like to be a jerk or a good guy, you can do either to your hearts content.\n\nFallout has some of the most memorable designs and lore of any post-apocalyptic setting I've seen, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good turn-based, isometric RPG romp.\n\nEasily a 10/10 game.

Wait...you're still reading this arent you?\nFallout 2 is by far the strongest title in the Fallout series, and one of the better games of its type from its era of gaming. The story is strong, only rivaled by Fallout 1 within the 5 games that make up the Fallout series. Your village is dying, and you're sent out into the world to find the Holy G.E.C.K. to save your people. A world filled with gangs, slavery, drug use, the Enclave, and talking mechanical dogs modelled off Dr. Who's K9.  The gameplay, while completely different than some may expect after playing FO3 or NV, is a vast improvement upon the system from 1. More weapons, more companions, no timelimit, and improved set pieces, while retaining what made Fallout 1 a good game.\nIf you don't have an issue with the obviously dated graphics, and a gameplay style that, sadly, is long dead this game is for you.","September 23, 2011","true","0.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Wait...you're still reading this arent you?\nFallout 2 is by far the strongest title in the Fallout series, and one of the better games of its type from its era of gaming. The story is strong, only rivaled by Fallout 1 within the 5 games that make up the Fallout series. Your village is dying, and you're sent out into the world to find the Holy G.E.C.K. to save your people. A world filled with gangs, slavery, drug use, the Enclave, and talking mechanical dogs modelled off Dr. Who's K9.  The gameplay, while completely different than some may expect after playing FO3 or NV, is a vast improvement upon the system from 1. More weapons, more companions, no timelimit, and improved set pieces, while retaining what made Fallout 1 a good game.\nIf you don't have an issue with the obviously dated graphics, and a gameplay style that, sadly, is long dead this game is for you.","September 23, 2011","true","0.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fallout 2 doesn't change too much in comparison to its predecessor in terms of the actual gameplay mechanics, but the the improvements and more content, like improved companions and a larger game world, are a welcome that offers plenty of replay value. The charm of Fallout 2 is the change in the nature from the first. The wasteland has progressed greatly in the last 80 years since the events of Fallout, and it offers a much different atmosphere. Trees are starting to grow back again, settlements as large as cities rebuild, governments forming, civilization is getting back on its feet. And with that comes a constant struggle for power across the waste among these different factions. And throughout the game the fate of these factions depend on your actions. The world feels more alive and its a welcome change to see how the universe has progressed since the Vault Dweller walked the wasteland.\n\nAlong side these changes to the atmosphere comes a much different approach to the game. It's seemingly more satirical with many pop culture references and breaking of the fourth wall. It's different from what you'd expect from Fallout but its can be humorous enough to get a chuckle out of it when you get the references.\n\nHowever, there is one major flaw with this game and it's the bugs; and there are a lot. What I would say is the biggest issue with the bugs are with the quest. Many of the quest in the game are heavily bugged, even to the point that it can completely block off an entirely different path to completing a quest which is rather disappointing because you'll have to settle for a lesser outcome rather than the one you desired. It's a real shame too because Black Isle Studios did some outstanding work with quest design, but the experience is held back by the nasty bugs. Despite these issues, I am still able to forgive the game for the rest of the great work put into it.\n\nIn the end, it's the Fallout you've always loved but with the added joy of getting addicted to Jet, becoming a pornstar, or punching children with a mega powerfist because they thought it was a good idea to steal from the Chosen One. And then later you'll be labeled as 'Child Killer'.","August 8, 2014","true","109.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The fact that the game was made in 1998 makes it even more impressive.\n\nFallout 2 centres around the protagonist a.k.a. 'The Chosen One' and is entasked with the duty by the elder of his village to find and retrieve the Garden Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.) which is a device that can create thriving communities out of the post-apocalyptic wasteland.\n\nThe game comprises of exploring and travelling in the open world as well as speech and quests to various characters and NPC. In addition to the role playing elements, a unique turn-based shooter is used during combat. This incredible blend  makes the game so widely stimulating and intense. It is an experience unlike one other. Not to mention the storyline is as engaging as it is compelling.\n\nThe player's actions throughout the game dictate what future story or gameplay opportunities are available.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tidustudor/recommended/38410/","tidustudor","Moriarty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tidustudor/","6 products in account","Fallout 2, like it's predecessor and sequels, stands to date as one of the greatest roleplaying games ever devised. First introduced to the original game in the series as a youth, I quickly became addicted to both the setting and the story being told; I loved the choices you were asked to make, and the customisation options that were available to you; I adored the pre-war 50s feel that inhabited the wasteland, even as you carried plasma rifles and power armour into battle.\n\nIn a word, Fallout 2, like the other games in the series, is sublime. As a fan of roleplaying games in general, I recognise that the post-apocalyptic genre is harder than others to make enticing - and yet Fallout somehow manages to nail it. Gore and mature themes meet head on with quirky humour, memorable locations and characters (Dogmeat and Harold the Ghoul being just two), and an expansive world to explore.\n\nUnlike the first game in the series, Fallout 2 has you taking on the role of a tribal youth who is sent out into the wasteland in order to secure a G.E.C.K. - a Garden of Eden Creation Kit - which will help your primitive people make the land furtile and liveable again. Who your character is - what gender, what they're good at, what their quirks are - is entirely up to you, as are the dialogue and moral decisions you make, and the route you take across the wasteland. With side quests all over the place, you can spend hours after hours trudging through the Fallout world, making your mark as either a sentinel of justice, or a madman with a shotgun. Good or evil, hero or villian - it's entirely up to you.\n\nThe latter games might be controversial to a select few - after all, not everyone liked Bethesda's treatment of a classic game, and it's their perogative to think that way. However, it's almost unanimous fact that Fallout 2, like it's predecessor, stands as one of the greatest RPGs ever made.\n\nBuy this game.","September 23, 2015","true","17.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/38410/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","In some ways, this is a direct improvement over the first. There is more stuff to do, more stuff to unlock, bigger map, etc. The character customization is deeper. That's all fine.\n\nHowever, what I appreciated about the first game were its simple objectives with various free-form solutions. Fallout 2 seems to strip these away in favor of increasingly complex and awkward quests. Often, they will require speaking with specific characters who are almost indistinguishable from other, less important NPCs, and doing so in a specific procedure. The Gecko Power Plant quest is a good example of how this, combined with a lot of tedious running around, results in a tiresome game of "who's who". Of course, the player usually has a choice in these sorts of situations to take a moral shortcut for negative karma, but the rewards for pursuing a "good" outcome pretty much always outweigh the rewards for "bad" behavior. I prefer to finish quests in as complete a fashion as I can, but their weird, constricted structure here bores and angers me.\n\nOther times, logic is sacrificed for the sake of creating gameplay. I understand that Vault 13, literally a hole in the side of a mountain, could be easily ignored, but if this Pipboy is the same one that belonged to the Vault Dweller, wouldn't it make sense for the locations canonically visited in the previous game to be on it already? At least the military base should be on there, if not the vault, but at least it's not hidden to the point of requiring a quest for exploration; Speaking of bases, what about the Sierra Army Depot? It sounds and looks like it would be big enough to be noticed just by going near it, but nope, it only appears when a certain quest is activated. There's also the Enclave power armor that's good at fooling Enclave soldiers in every situation save for the map's random events, but whatever, I'm sure someone with nothing better to do has come up with an explanation for all this. Bottom line is, the first game did not do this sort of thing. It let the player reap the full benefits of accidental discovery.\n\nA large map is good, but the random events happen WAY too often. I breathe less often than I encounter something on the map screen. Almost every time, the enemies appearing in these events are too hard (instant death), too plentiful (slow, agonizing death), or easily outrun (waste of time). Save scumming becomes a necessity for travelling through particularly brutal areas, such as the region around Navarro, where movement needs to be taken an inch at a time, lest I come across a patrol and get a one-way ticket to the game over screen. Get the car, because that ♥♥♥♥ happens a lot less often, although there is still the occasional stop made involuntary for whatever reason.\n\nOverall, the game is representative of living in modern day California; It's buggy (frame drops, some crashing), very disorganized, and constantly frustrating, but it has its moments, and it gets more fun after the first few hours. Bigger? Yes. Better? Maybe. It's still worth playing.","February 16","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The best part is that when the Internet came, I have googled for a playthhrough description and still found a couple of new unknown things to do in this game, that's how thought through it is, that is how much effort have been put in it. It's a masterpeace of gaming. It's a legend! It's Fallout!\n\nEven at the time it was released, the graphics were considered a downside of this game. Half-Life was released about that time with much better 3D graphics.The lack of graphics makes this game trick your brain into turning it's imagination center on or whatever it is called. It's like a book, makes you dream while you are awake, imagine how the caracters and places would look like in real life, placing you directly into the wasteland. That is why Fallout 3 and New Vegas will never be better than this to me, they look not as I have imagined it to be as a kid.\n\nThe music is on point! The sounds, the instruments used add to the atmosphere of the place. The first second you are in New Reno you understand that mobsters and gangsters rule the place. Or Gecko? In Gecko you feel the place is dead even is ghouls are walking and talking and ready to beat your ♥♥♥ after they caught you stealing. Still, the music tells you life abandoned this place long ago. To this day I can tell by heart which melody plays in which place of the map.\n\nDialogues... Just call Enclave from teminal in Gecko and you will understand that dialogues are the heart of this game. The can be very serious and almost existential, they can be simple and super fun. Basically, 50% of the time playing this game you are sitting and reading through millions of lines of dialogue. The other half you are looting, kicking ♥♥♥, levelling up your character, buying and selling stuff, picking locks. But the majority of time you are carefully reading not to miss a clue on a quest or simply cause it is interesting.\n\nCombination of this three things made a perfect game for me. As this review starts, this is the best game ever for me and I do not think this will ever change.\n\nStill playing this from time to time. Damn this game is good.\n\nOn the downside - I feel really old. Ancient. I work with people who are younger than this game, that is how ancient I am.\n\nP.S. I know that nobody will read this review. I pay my respect to this game this way.","March 22","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Tons to do, easy to get lost. One of the major problems with the game is the first 5 levels. You will get mercilessly murdered at even the daintiest of encounters. You will need to do all of the meanial tasks in the first two towns, possibly skipping most of the inital radscorpians. Once past there you will find a delightful jewel though. The combat has been tweaked, you no longer wait for the illogical math models of the first, though this one suffers on occasion from terrible hit percentage calculations. The NPC's are not as deep I felt as the original, but there are so many more to talk to that the trade off was worth it. The intolerance of ghoul and super mutants is emphasized, as well as some of the other less than noble human characteristics. They need to bring the Highwayman back.","February 21","true","82.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This game presents a truly open world with hundreds of choices for any style of character to truly live in. Besides a slow start, increase in comic references, more complex story, and a few bugs here and there; Fallout 2 truly exceeds the accomplishments of its first installment here. Skills are much more useful, weapons and choices are abundant, and companions take on a life of their own here. Although most prefer the 3D titles in the Fallout series, this one truly feels the most imaginative and true to style in the series. If you haven't played it and are inclined to play 2D isometric RPG’s, this one is a real treat.","March 24","true","46.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have huge map to explorer and you can if you want to go straight to the last locations. The game has tons of various cool character you can talk to. And quests you can do. With multiple factions all with they own agendas, and if you don`t like any of them you can either kill them or skip doing those quests all together.  Also every companion can be order to be offensive, use melee weapons or ranged, carry stuff or to wait or move if they stand in you way , witch may happens sometimes. It might no be the best gameplay but it still works just fine. And the game is neither to hard nor to unforgiving.\n\nCharacter development / leveling/skills and quest: How your develop you character is entirely up to you. Do you want to fist you way trough the game you can do that.  Do you wanna be a sniper and let your companions if you want to have companions do the fight for you , you can do just that. Do you want to play the game alone you can do that. For every four level you reach you can choose a skill and some of this skills is pretty good and actually has a meaning. Do you want to be a sweet talker and try to talk your way trough most of the quests you can do that. Compared to the later fallout especially fallout 4 at least in a large extent you have more freedom in how you do your quests and how you accomplish them all with multiple solutions and your choices also has  consequences. All the character you meet have their own personalities and perhaps even problems or a reason they need your help or a reason  why the want to join you and lastly those character especially on the companion side is plentiful and enough of them but not to many and neither to few. All skills have they own usefulness. Almost every character you meet has something to tell about the world. Plus if you really want to you can be a made - man/woman.  And lastly you earn exp by doing quests and killing or even picking up a special items or using seeing special encounters.  So yeah the game is pretty violent. Like shooting the groin of someone or the head of someone.\n\nFactions: A short note on factions. Every factions as previously said have they own agendas. Some are evil som are good some are somewhere in between. Some want to make prostitution and gambling legal. Some want to focus on something else.\n\nSetting: Perhaps most important of all is the setting. The setting is great. It feels very mush like an a post-apocalyptic game. All of the locations feel different in a good way. Different cultures. Different rules in the different places. Every places has it own mini-stories of side quests to tell. And with the wonderful music it could nt be any/much better. And the game has tons of Charm and Humor.\n\nMusic: the soundtrack is very good. And a lot of the tracks if not all you will remember.It really helps you immerse yourself into the setting\n\nBonus: I would put it here. The humor is very good. There is a lot of times you will laugh. Like missing a 95% hit or hitting a target with 20% hit for that matter.  You will laugh by the funny and witty and good written dialogue. A lot of cool Easter eggs that even i understood or laughed and thought was funny, i am not the best at finding Easter eggs, but i could in this game.\nAnd the ending is more then good enough to and so is the voice acting at least for that time. And  despite some few crashes the game is still utterly fantascic. Give it a shot , even if you disliked fallout 3/4. Hugely different.\n\nScore : highly recommended 10/10 if you enjoy turn based rpg set in a wonderful and brilliant rpg setting\nOne of the best pc game i have ever played if not the best . The only one that is close in Planescape, Deus ex and perhaps Max payne 2 and Portal 2.\n\nAnd just if you wonder i would rate new Vegas 9.5\nfallout 3 9/10\nfallout 4 6-7/10\n\nNBI am going to say this is beyond me why this game ha snt gotten enough recognition, well atleast that what it seems like. How a game like this can`t get on top 128 games on gamefaq when games like fallout 3 or say undertale ( as there is many who thought it should nt be there)or any top 50 pc games is beyond me. But i guess everyone has is taste, no bias. and yeah i know in the fallout community this is considered the best fallout game and i have to agree despite putting at least 250 hrs in fallout 3 and 250 hrs in new vegas if not more.

I played this for much longer than Fallout 1 and there is reason for that.  This game has so much more content than the first.  There are many more quests and many more places to explore and visit.  This game is turning into one of my favorites because of everything the game is.  The guns are amazing to and all different.  What took the cake for this game was the dialouge and story.  The story far exeeds the first in depth and feel.  You feel like such a badass after the ending and feel satisfied.  The game is a memorable one for good reason.  What I didn't like about the game is that I wished that the Enclave were a better enemy faction.  I wish there were more to them so I can hate them more.  They did do things that were terrible to me but I didn't feel like they did much.  I guess that is the downside to isometric story driven games.  It is a great game and worth a buy.","December 26, 2014","true","185.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Originally you're sent out from your tribe, founded by the original Vault Dweller from F1, to retrieve a GECK that will help them survive as their village is dying. Needless to say, a lot more than that is going on which you will uncover soon enough.\n\nThe world of Fallout 2 feels similliar to Fallout 1's (from here F1). The very south of F2's map is actually connected to F1's top, making it possible for the player to revisit a few of the old locations, such as Vault 13 and 15, as well as the NCR, which used to be Shady Sands. Other than that's there's a lot of new places to discover, including personal favorite of mine such as New Reno and a locationIreallycan'tnamewithoutspoilingthegame.\n\nAs for the combat and levelling mechanics, these are the same as in F1, meaning you start the game by picking your SPECIAL and tag skills and as you defeat enemies in turn based combat and levelling up, you get to spend more skill points on various skills. The use of AP for moves in combat is a really neat system.\n\nAs for F2 as a sequel, it's pretty great. The mechanics from F1 are re-used but other than that, it's a direct continuation on the lore with new events, a (mostly) new setting, all new story line and great characters.\n\nThe massive downside of Fallout 2, however, is the start. The game starts in an insanely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorial, and the first few hours are annoying as ♥♥♥♥. The SPECIAL you pick at the start wil also really influence the game a *ton*. I, for example, went with 4 strenght, leaving me unable to use 90% of the weapons untill much later on, which was a major ♥♥♥♥ off. Amongst that the enemies suddenly go from easy to kill to pain in the ♥♥♥, and if you're not prepared for that you're having a hard time. A good companion team is basically a must at that point.\n\n\nBefore I wrap this up, I must say Fallout 2 has some absolutely hilarious moments to make up for some of the rage it might cause, such as the Café of Broken Dreams, the Bridge Guardian, conversations with certain NPCs and...SERGEANT DORNAN.\n\n\nOverall, 8.5/10.","September 11, 2013","true","43.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Game is older than many gamers.  Reviewed ad nauseum, I will take this opportunity to impart an anecdote.\n\nI am currently playing thru this game.  I was getting annoyed at the engine.  Even 17 years ago, the hidden behind walls thing was mad annoying.  I have 1 full playthru, and many partials over that time, the last substantial one I stopped at New Reno.  That was 10 years ago.  I was in a town where there is an important NPC (skeeter) in a building that you can't see inside unless you run behind it.  The doors are on the hidden backside.  I knew as I played before, but was a little frustrated.  I was muttering about how Pillars better have screen rotation.  Then I randomly talked to an npc behind this building a bit.  This one was in view.  I asked about the other guy who is hidden a few steps away, and the NPC says "he's standing right there.  Use your eyes."  Those guys at Black Isle knew full well how frustrating not being able to see an npc standing 10 feet away right in front of you due to an immobile painted background, and put those lines in there.  I bet whoever wrote that bit snickered like I did.  I never read those lines before, in probably 100 hours of varied gameplay.  The nuance and subtlety is what is so great about this game.  The way characters are written, the storylines, and unsanitary reality of what harsh life does to mankind.  The good do indeed die young as even the good ones have some bad in this world.","February 25, 2015","true","52.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I have many fond memories of this game, it is one of my all time favorites and even after all these years, after all the hours and hours and hours I have put into the game across several different computers; I can still play it shamelessly for hours and never get bored. Its like a great film that you never tire of. I bought Fallout 2 back in '99, as a teen and could not stop playing it. I ended up becoming so engrossed in the game, that I took to the internet and found myself at the No Mutants Allowed forums where I started a long running RP called Fallout: Systematic Annihilation (My name was TRAG on those boards.) The RP was a little hit on the website, and we had quite a few fans that read it regularly and even joined in the fun. But, I didn't stop there- Chris Avellone started releasing a little document called- The Fallout Bible. I was pulled in yet again. I have read that Bible more than once- I even have a digital copy on my cell phone for my reading pleasure. Yeah, this game started an obsession. Thankfully, it never got bad enough to where restraining orders were necessary (This is a joke of course, but there are those out there that have gone that far).\nSo, you have read how this game has touched my life, and inspired my imagination. Now, you are probably wondering- where is the review!?!\nFallout 2 is an isometric post apocalyptic role playing game with turn-based combat. That being said, this is not just any isometric RPG, this is one of the most well written, deep, open world rpgs ever crafted. Your choices here carry real weight within the world- Want to be a Slaver? A rough, hard living slave catcher/seller. All you have to do is get a tattoo on your forehead that the world can see and you can be one. The only problem is that people really do see it and their reactions to you will reflect that. Needless to say, Slavers aren't exactly welcome in many places in the wasteland. You may wish to rethink that life choice.\nBut, this game is not just about career choice, this is a game with a deep strategic combat system that will challenge even the most hardened RPG gamer. The game does not hold your hand and more than likely you will die a lot. Saving often is the best tool in your arsenal, and you will be relieved when you can reload your game only a few moments before you told that Super Mutant and his pals to shove it up his you know what, and instead he shoved it up yours...Lets move on.\nThis is a CRPG in every sense of the word, so if you get the feel that there is a feeling that you could be playing this on a table with some friends and a cashe of multicolored dice, you probably could. In fact- There is a Pen and Paper version of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system (the rules system the game is powered by.) on the internet and you can find it at No Mutants Allowed (the most well known Fallout fan site, find them here http://www.nma-fallout.com/ .)\nThere is so much that I can say about this game, but I won't, because I believe that you owe it to yourself to see it with your own eyes.\nFallout 2 is considered one of the greatest RPGs of all time for a reason: It lives up to the previous statement. It really is one of the greatest RPGs of all time. The writing is top notch, the sheer amount of choice and freedom. The methodical and satisfying development of your main character from an upstart, inexperienced tribal into a wasteland killing machine who is feared throughout the region, or a hero reveared by the struggling wasteland people. The choice is yours and your actions and decisions will determine the man/woman you become in this harsh and unforgiving post apocalyptic wasteland. You will need all the help you can get, and companions are there to meet and join your quest to restore your village and save its inhabitants from starvation, disease, and destruction.\nThis game is so detailed for its time, that even today I am finding things I have never seen in the game before; and I have been playing it since 1999, a year after it was released! If that doesn't give you an idea of the replayability factor I don't know what will.\nIf you purchase this game, you will come back to it year after year. And if you are a fan of pen and paper RPGS, CRPGS, or old school RPGs, then Fallout 2 is a godsend. Bigger and crazier than its predecessor Fallout (Which itself is an AMAZING game.) Fallout 2 takes you to the future that everyone hopes will never happen and lets you either wallow in it, or conquor it.\nI HIGHLY recommend this game for any RPG fan. It will ensnare you, it will inspire you!!","December 8, 2013","true","16.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Great music, fits the atmosphere perfectly. Decent storyline. The number of possibilities on how you could play through this game is uncountable. You can beat this game in 9 minutes 17 seconds (literally, speedrun is on youtube somewhere) or in average 20 hours without getting bored for 1 second. For me it's possibly the best RPG out there.\n\nNew Fallouts were decent games but sh*t-tier Fallouts. You want to know why is Fallout considered one of the best RPG series ever?

This game is one of the best games I have ever played and it is a game that you can simply play through time and time again not only due to a wide range of choices but a story that you will want to hear again and again, admittedly the controls up until fallout 3 have been a bit primative and lack luster but they work if you're willing to give them a prod and experiment. Fallout 2 is an excellent addition to this series but the game either is for you or is not and with the excessive amount of bugs, primative style of controls and lacking graphics compared to todays top RPG's such as The elder scrolls I would only really reccomend this game is you really enjoyed fallout 3 and New vegas and would like to explore the story of fallout further; if you are one of those people who can't get enough of the fallout series this game is 100% for you, you will not be disappointed because the original games are just as good if not better than the recent ones except more primative.","October 16, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The interface is fixed now, so it’s more in line with modern standards, but the combat is still freaking slow, so if you happen to choose non-combat skillsets, you are screwed. The graphic is improved which is pretty impressive given how little development time Interplay has between Fallout 1 and Fallout 2. As a result, innovation wasn’t present in this game at all. Players from Fallout 1 will notice a crap ton of game-breaking glitches being fixed in Fallout 2, you won’t get boxed in by friendly NPCs anymore because you can just push them away. The world is big(ger), and the plot is interesting as usual. Fair warning though, the game introduction is epically slow.

Well, you'll know once you get to it. Wouldn't want to spoil a nice suprise :)\nLoads of content\n\nCons\nThere's a bit of stuff I consider uneccessary. New Reno as a whole is... Well really designed for fan service. There's a brothel and a porn studio here.\nWhen you have entire PERKS centered around sex, you know something is wrong.\nProgression in the beginning is slow\nGeckos. Screw these things. Especially at the start.\nMissing content that's easily replaced with Fallout 2 Restoration mods.\nGetting a gun that isn't a pea shooter takes FOREVER. Prices are INSANELY high after Fallout 1. I mean, REALLY high. At the start, it cost me my entire supply of money, a gun I previously had (which was an EVEN WORSE pea shooter) and whatever I could scrounge up from the houses near by to get a 10MM pistol. Still a pea shooter, but it dealt more damage.\nRandom encounters are FAR too frequent. It's frustrating when the second you leave the city you're attacked by tweleve dogs, and it takes a few minutes for them to end their turn. And you can't run because they've trapped you.\nRelies too heavily on pop-culture refrences that are now outdated. Funny at the time, but in 2015, some don't make sense or some are just plain stupid.\n\nOn the whole, Fallout 2 is a game everyone who can think should own. This isn't a game for people that played 3 and New Vegas and enjoyed the shooter aspects: This is a bare knuckle, hard core RPG, and you WILL die.

At first I was skeptical because of the age of the game, but honestly that shouldn't be the deterance for this game. It's your top down, somewhat turned based, game but it's more than that. The game unlocks so much creativity to solving things outside of combat! Using your brain has never been more fun! Literally...\n\nPlay this if:\n1. You are a big Fallout fan\n2.

But DON'T buy it from Steam. Get it from gog or somewhere else where you can find a older version.\n\n\nLonger version:\n\nIf you were thinking about buying this game DON'T.\nThis game was great before the update but they ♥♥♥♥ed it up and made the game worse.\n\nHow?\n\nBefore, I had about 30 saves of different characters. Now? Gone. No warning, nothing. All that progress is ♥♥♥♥ed. You can now only have ONE ♥♥♥♥ING TAB to save in which is about 10 slots. They also made the travelling system be slower so you're more likely to run into more deathclaws and die in one hit. Also, of course this breaks any type of mod (the fallout 2 restoration pack which was almost mandatory to play the game properly has now been broken by this update including all of my saves are broken/corrupt).\n\nI have no idea what the person who patched this game recently was thinking.  They've effectively just destroyed older players who got it before the update and made it tougher for newer players who don't know what they're doing.","July 7, 2014","true","49.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is set years after the first where you play as a decendent of the Vault Dweller who has been tasked to go out and find the vault for it may contain a G.E.C.K (Garden of Eden Creation Kit) which could save your people as many are sick and dying as are there Brahman. You start by proving your worth by entering the temple of the vault dweller and retriving the vault 13 suit left by your ancestor before heading out for the elusive Vault 13.\n\nThis game is far better than the previous by doing away with the timer that was in the first one, however the start does involve you running into giant ants and lesser radscorpions in the temple and being armed with only a spear so if you focus on gunpower, there's a good chance you might die or be unable to get through the temple. This game also has the introduction to power gloves if you wish to make a mellee focused character where no previous such weapon exsisted in the first and you were stuck otherwise. There is more adult subject matter as you get to sleep with numerous women (or men depending on sex or your choice) with only a brief description which is somehow more graphic than the Bethesda attempt (dissapointing since the game is a 18, you'd think you'd be treated as a adult) but that's a different discussion for something else.\n\nFor those who have played Fallout 3, this game is where the Enclave first appeared and in this you run into references to the previous game (appearance of Harold, a discovery of a horde of water chips and a Super mutant who is worried about getting a woman pregnant) as well as an evolution in the society where no longer do people collect bottle caps, but crudly made discs called Dollars.  Ghouls and Super Mutants are no longer a big enemy as they have been trying to intergrate with society (except for Vault City which is Xenophobic) and even gain a Super Mutant as a companion as well as many other interesting and even hidden companions.\n\nWell worth if you enjoyed the first game and a lot of fun if you like RPGs in general. You don't need to have played the first one as you can always ask questions about why the world is the way it is and the story has a totally different enemy than the last one. You also have multiple possible endings when you complete the game like the previous one and get to see how Shady Sands has evolved into the infamous NCR.","February 20, 2014","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has everything a gamer could ever dream of including dinosaurs, tanks, zombies, and wizards. The textures are in 1080p and is the most amazing thing i have ever seen and the ominous atmosphere just makes my heart race as i try to find the nearest telephone booth. The amount of effect put into this game by the developer is just truly in need of an applause as they have spent near decades of working the game to the brim with content and the amount of detail into everything in the game is great. The fully animated 3d polygons are a true work of art. The replayability is just unreal as i spent several decades dedication my life into making new characters and roleplaying as one of the many NPC in this game. It also introduces Enviroments that are mindblowing as you wouldnt think they would inploment it in here. I spent most of my time looking inside every cave, forest, town i explored to uncover secrets yet to be told. The mechanics of this FPS rivals those of Call of duty  and needs more recognition. and in conclusion i have no idea what i am talking about.","January 9","true","19.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","1","4","2","0"

Unfortunately, Black Isle Studios didn't have the knack to implement an abundance of voice actors. Truth be told there are only a handful of them in the entire game. Everything else is good old fashion dialogue. Sure, you might here me and other people complain about this. But let's just say, for the shake of this review. I get over the fact the game only has a limited amount of voice actors until Fallout 3. The only major problem I've encountered thus far with Fallout 1 through 2 (including Fallout Tactics) is the despicable combat system. I mean this combat system sucks.. I'm talking atari style combat.. A friendly individual fires first, then a hostile target fires second. It essentially goes back and fourth until one or the other is dead. This is extremely unrealistic, and truthfully. I don't believe there was any excuse for this whatsoever. Take my word for it, I'm a huge fan of the Fallout series; but this is just ridiculous. In closing this message, I want to add the story is of course outstanding. I hope one day they'll consider doing a remastered version of both Fallout 1 and Fallout 2. Preferably with Fallout 4's new creation engine.","May 18","true","0.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","4"

With both games you don't get any hints really where to go, besides what the NPC tells you, so quests would've been hard to solve. With one I just had it windowed and had a walkthrough running in the background. With two, if I were to do that, every battle everytime the game was computing the CPU's turn, my game would freeze and then it'd come back once the turn was over. Sometimes I'd just jump straight to the "you're dead lol" screen. That, and the really obnoxiously OP aliens really didn't make the game enjoyable. I also had to restart 3 times trying to perfect my character before I found out high agility meant more turn points. Without the turn points the game was really hard and unenjoyable. Especially the trial of ♥♥♥♥butt in the beginining. The highway man was really cool, and there were some benefits I enjoyed, but I could not make myself beat the game, and I'm literally in the last mission.

The "S.P.E.C.I.A.L" leveling system is there and will also determine what you can and can't do in game. ( Playing with Intelligence less than 4 you can't even speak properly and NPC's will even ignore you or not give you quests )\nJust like most RPG's of the era the beginning game is a hard survival but as it gets to approx mid-game money becomes so plentiful and your skills advance so quickly that most challenges are cleared easily.\n\nThis game features a car for you to drive around the wasteland quicker than normal and can be upgraded slightly for better fuel consumption, etc. It does, however run on the same ammunition as energy pistols / rifles.  It can also be used as a storage container but beware a bug where too many things are inside it, you'll get locked out of the menu. It also seats all your followers which is a nice added feature. Speaking of followers, they're still the same stupid things that block every-bloody-entranceway when you walk into a room. However they've put a helpful "Shove" Icon in which pushes the follower one hex away, they've also added extra combat controls ( Although default is usually best for pretty much all situations ) that come in Beserker, aggressive, defensive and custom. The ability to choose which armour they wear, although there is no visable change and the ability to get them to use a selection of weapons ( Although they can only use certain weapons, not any weapon as Followers are only "loaded" with certain animations )\n\nHowever I cannot recommend this game solely on the basis that it is so buggy and frustraiting. Walk into the wrong part of town at the wrong time of day and all the guards shoot at you. Enemies ignore you if you wear a certain armour type but if you have a follower in the same armour only 1 type of enemy will shoot you, yet if you walk into a town with your parties weapons drawn everyone will shoot you.\n\nIt's highly inconsistant and irritaiting, saving everytime you do something successfully becomes regular. The game only received one patch in it's life and like many others have said, you have to mod the game for it to become bareable. So likening this over Fallout 4 but then telling people you need mods to enjoy Fallout 1 or 2 is hypocritical.\n\nIt's a shame because I got it as part of the Fallout Anthology and I haven't enjoyed either game and I cannot really see why it has such a cult following. Even other RPG's of the time period this was launched fare better and I think being the one of the only post-apocolyptic and non-fantasy based RPG got it where it is.","November 21, 2015","false","16.5"," 7 of 56 people (13%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","13","7","56","2","5"

I thought it was awsome, and in its time, it was.\n\nHowever, times change.  After playing it a bit, I have found that I do not have patience for old-school game mechanics.\nFor example: You get a quest to Find X.  X can be a person, or an object.  And that is all you get.  Please find X and get something from him.  You would think getting the object from Mr. X would be the problem and perhaps you are right.  However, you must spend HOURS clicking on everyone in town to find Mr. X, IF HE IS EVEN IN THAT SAME town.  If it is an object, lets hope you notice it amonge the muddled brown textures sitting on the ground somewhere.\n\nDo you want to recall what NPC said about something, perhaps there is a hint in something he or she said?  You will not find any such notes in your trusty pip boy.  Perhaps you can find the NPC and talk to them again.  Maybe they will go through thier dialog again, or perhaps they will just ask you if you got the job done yet and you will be SOL.\n\nAnyway, I discovered I do not have the patience for such things anymore.  If you do, then this game is a great classic.  Just be sure you are in the mood to play a very long, old school game or are ok with constantly googling the quest solutions.\n\n","August 12, 2015","false","18.5"," 12 of 74 people (16%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","16","12","74","3","0"

Keep in mind im now 30 and have long expressed interest in RPG games so how did the first two games fall under my nose?\n\nWell rhetorical or not they did, and finally...finally after hours of reading the reviews of how its the best rpg ever and so so so much better than fallout 3 I bought it.\n\nAnd I must say I am quite dissapointed!\n\nThe fighting is just so mundane and repetitive...It took me 3 mins to kill a rat! Miss after miss after miss it was just stupid.\n\nThe inventory....So untidy, just full of everything making me point and click to see even what the hell it is.\nOne of my favorite parts of fallout 3 is organizing all my items and rumaging through every single desk, cabinet and safe. WELL NOT ANYMORE. It is just so tedious making my character check all this stuff, pointing and clicking till my fingers fall out.\n\nKeep in mind im 30 and have been playing games like starcraft, AOE, diablo etc for a long time so I love to click but this is too much for too little reward.\n\nI cant believe id say this about a fallout game but I got maybe fours into it and i think im just finished playing it. It doesnt give me that "addiction" mentality to warrant putting those true kinds of hours into it.\n\nI suppose I would of loved it perhaps if I played it 15 years ago when it came out...wait...thats exactly it! why am i even writing this review...?!\n\nand to be honest I dont even want fallout 4 to come out, its taken so much of my life I love playing it but...at what cost??\n","July 4, 2015","false","0.9"," 5 of 64 people (8%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","8","5","64","2","1"

You spawn near ancient ruins of a tunnel built into a mountain near trees and rocks without anything.\n\nAlso according to other reviews of this garbage "game", this "game" is the censored version... and its also mainly broken.\n\nI once managed to crack the cipher of controls in this "game" and managed to enter the tunnel, there was a giant radscorpion in the way, I click on it, nothing, click again, nothing. In another review of this "game", they said if you crack the cipher called the "controls" and enter a battle, its turn-based...\n\nSO DAMN FUN CLICKING THE ATTACK BUTTON EVERY TIME ITS YOUR TURN TO ATTACK.\n\nBOOM\n\nwait 5 seconds for enemy to attack...\n\nBOOM\n\nwait 5 seconds for enemy to attack...\n\nBOOM\n\nENEMY DOWN.\n\nMeanwhile in Fallout NV,\nyou open your pipboy as soon as soon as a bunch of gecko's attack you, grab your varmint rifle\n\nBOOM BOOM BOOM RELOAD\n\ntheir heads splatter off and more come\n\nBOOM BOOM BOOM RELOAD\n\nnow they are all dead, you can loot stuff from their dead corpses.\n\nWhat would I suggest? Avoid this trash excuse for a "game" and buy NV or Fallout 3 (Fallout 4 is an option too).\n\n"This game is old!" is not a valid excuse for this "games" overall terrible quality, other games released before this trash, function better on my PC (C&C Tiberian Dawn for example, released in 1995, runs better on my PC.) and have more content (C&C Red Alert + its expansions.).\n\nI see people are downvoting my review because they are a fanboy of a poor excuse of a "game", fanboys, why don't you go play Day One: Gary's Incident?

If you're looking for something similar to one of those (like I was), don't buy Fallout 2.\n\nI've tried nurmerous times to like Fallout 2. But each time it just utterly frustrates me.\n\nFallout 1 is a great game because of the dozens of ways you can build a character. In fact, it's not that hard to beat the game as a pacifist, relying on skills and such instead of fighting. It offers a true roleplaying experience and rewards creativity. It lets you roleplay the character that you want.\n\nFallout 2 is the opposite. It is based way too heavily on combat. Even on low difficulties, the fights are really hard. In addition, there are random encounters that happen while fast-traveling, that in addition to be very annoying and repetitive, also contribute to this difficulty problem. You basically get fatally punished for not making a perfect charatcer, and for exploring. The lattter of which defeats the purpose of an open-world game.\n\nPlaying a character that is focused around dealing with problems by using things like stealth, speech, or computers is impossible. Only heavily combat oriented characters can survive. But even if you optimize a character for combat, it's still ridiculously hard. I did exactly that (optimizing for combat) and still got 1-hit-killed by a gecko on easy after barely leaving the starting area, so I'm not exactly sure what kind of build is capable of beating this game.\n\nApparently, you can only play the developer's way rather than playing how you want to play. By not letting you play the ROLE you want, it completely defeats the purpose of ROLE PLAYING. And since it isn't fun and feels more like work, it isn't really a game.\n\nSo in conclusion, Fallout 2 neither role playing, nor is it a game.\n\n","October 2, 2014","false","19.5"," 10 of 87 people (11%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","11","10","87","4","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/razoleg/recommended/38410/","razoleg","Cunning Fox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/razoleg/","664 products in account",""What is the definition of insanity? Doing the exact same thing, whilst expecting different results."\n\nSave/Load fest that is an impossibility without a guide, filled to the brim with below-the-belt humor and obscure, awkward cultural references and puzzling non-sequiturs. Possibly one of the worst games ever made. In 23 years of gaming there are very few games to which I can come back to, after years, and still feel an outrage 15 minutes into the "gameplay".\n\nThis game is just ridiculously bad, it's horrendous. It's a mystery how you could ♥♥♥♥ up something as good as Fallout 1 so badly. A munchkin heaven. Grind to survive - for hours. This is why people play things like WoW - no proper aim in the game, just a mindless levelling and math stats enough to get you through Calculus exam, made up of puree of elements from previous installment, sprewn across the blanket of an aged engine.\n\nNeedless skill increases that you would only need to use once like lockpick to open only one rusty door which does not get damaged explosives or crowbars (or anything else). Or repair at ridiculous level of 50% to repair a generator to progress further in the quest.\n\nThe quests are illogical, game elements are not standardised (one door can be broken with a crowbar, another with a fist, another one is barely held together, but can easily take on a C4 or a plasma shot). You have to find "extravagant solutions" but your freedom is not limited by your own imagination, it's limited by twisted imagination of neckbeard developers.\n\nWeapons and elements that are completely unrelated to Fallout universe are shoved in, like they are shoved in later in NV (the "Service Rifle" and shiny nuAge "9mm" as opposed to proper aged 50's sci-fi weapons of Fal 1 and Fal 3) completely screwing up the whole immersion.\n\n300% for skills, why not 500? ♥♥♥♥ it, why not 1000? And a perk only every 50 levels instead of every 2-3.\n\nHow 'bout missing a 90% chance to hit in a row, thrice or four times while getting always hit by early-game enemies from three screens away? How about random encounters every 5 minutes with packs of wolves and dozens upon dozens of raiders with weapons that crit. hit you every single time?\n\nHow about bugged out everything, from the dialogues with followers where you're unable to trade or to take their equipment to the glitches and crashes. I have nearly completed this pile of dogshit until the game crashed and corrupted THREE of my saves in the Navarro base, I had to go back to my saves more than a decade of levels ago when I was just making it big in the ♥♥♥♥ing New Reno.\n\nNear infinite ammo for enemies, inability to steal it before the fight.\nStupidly overpowered enemy armour, lack of critical hits even for luck 10.\n\nThe game is stupidly, mindbogginly, grindingly difficult for no other reason than "because ♥♥♥♥ you!", it was created simply for those who thought Fallout 1 was not enough, but it was. It was more than enough.\n\nLudicrously nerfed unarmed combat. A punch with spiked knuckles that does 4 damage at over 140% Unarmed? Really? 4 attacks per turn for most enemies in HtH? Late acquisition of Bonus HtH attacks perk? Dogs and Rats that do 8 damage (non-critical!) to an upgraded leather armour? Early raiders that never miss a burst and do over 70 damage per an always critical hit? Dumbass Cassidy that always misses the enemy and hits me? Use Jet once - you're an addict? Knuckles do more damage than a power fist? Come on!\n\nIncredibly narrow focus on select skills, while others are of no use.\n\nYou want to play a character of your own? Tough ♥♥♥♥, pick guns and speech, otherwise you're gonna have a bad time.\n\nWalls of text, boring dialogues that reek of grade 9 English literature homework and bunch of other irrelevant stuff that just breaks the experience. Ghosts, friendly mutants and talking deathclaws... what? The game is either trying to be too serious or too wacky. Racial stereotypes and biased, black and white, presentation of the world. New Reno, for example, is supposed to be the "cool place with no morally polar characters" as it's everything that's "bad" in humanity, filled with vice and rotten people. But it's a sarcasm that misses its mark because it's so "ad absurdum" and gortesque - the actual essence of it is unrealistic and this distances the player from the game. Everything feels like a joke and yet the game is taking itself seriously, like a comedian that's gone too far into the number as the nervous audience chuckle to avoid awkwardness of the moment.\n\nAt level 10 the pack of wolves is still a problem. A bodyguard in a casino get's a face full of Minigun at Big Guns 120+ % to get 12 damage and comes back with 30 damage as you get gunned down by a simple shotgun shot half the way across the room.\n\nAnd to top everything off, constant crashes, corrupt game save files and tons of bugs.\n\nIt feels like a DLC to the great Fallout. Dumbed down and with ridiculous traits like "childkiller" and such.\n\nNo wonder it was more popular than the original, YOBA approved.\n\nWorse than Fallout 1 in all respects except one - inventory management.\n\nI come back to this..."game" every once in a while, mustering all of my will just to push down the stomach convulsions as I try to keep myself from vomiting or just trashing my computer and putting a wooden stake into its remains so that "it would not rise to terrify the living ever again".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovablepwner/recommended/38410/","lovablepwner","LovablePWNER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovablepwner/","361 products in account","I started with Fallout 3. I'm not ashamed or anything this game came out before I even knew how to play video games. I still love Fallout 3 and the world Bethesda crafted for it. I've replayed it so much I know it like the back of my hand. Obviously being that there was a number 3 at the end of the title it got in my head to wonder "What were the past games like? Fallout 3 has introduced me to a fantastic world and I want to see where it started!" Opun looking at screenshots I remember thinking "Wow... these games look old and crappy". However as time went on I actually played Half Life 1 for the first time which really open my naive eyes to the idea that "Hey! Just because it's old looking doesn't mean it sucks!" So I looked the games up again and decided on getting Fallout 2 over 1 as it said there was no time limit to 2.\n\nI can now say that I think Fallout 2 (and 1 respectively) is a far superiour game to Fallout 3. It's amazing how a game where many of the character sprites look the same and the world it self is clearly just 2D with an isometric view could get me so immersed. Being able to place plastic explosive at the foot of a door, set a timer, then run like hell to watch it explode is just one of many things that made me fall in love with this game. While the gore and graphics of Fallout 3 are awesome being in a gunfight with raiders in Fallout 2 is even cooler. I've had a raider aim for my head only to miss and hit the other raider coming up behind me.\n\nFallout 2 is one of the few games that truly made me feel like a Wastleland Vigilante, like Mad Max and Clint Eastwood in one person. I did a mission for a town where I inspected a haunted farm only to find it inhabited by friendly ghouls. When I came back to the town the mayor told me if I didn't find one of their townfolks who had gone missing at the farm they would kill all the ghouls. When I couldn't find him I came back only to find that the mayor had really done it. He really killed all those innocents. So I shot him. I've never been so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at a fictional character in my life but unlike in a book or a movie I actually got to decide his fate and I decided his time was up.\n\nMy hope is that Fallout 4 will look back at some of these games and really try to implement some of the amazing player freedoms that this game allowed. If Fallout 4 ended up being and amazing 3d representation of this game my life would complete.","January 26, 2015","true","39.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You just need to get into it, perhaps get use to the somtimes annoying or cluncky combat and extreme lack of hand holding/any guidance apart from a brief description of what you need to do for a quest, and you will find one of the best games EVER! (Beware though, a lot of reading is required, most characters are not voiced, so people with short attention spams might want to reconsider, however you should still try it, like I did).\n\nSo in breif is this game good; no... It's better than good. Better than great. Better than amazing.

I started playing it way after it was released, so this isn't a nostalgia trip for me or anything, this was from pure interest in the genre and what I've heard about it. I was not disappointed.\n\nThis game is packed with content. There's lots of quests, characters, weapons, locations, and items. There's almost always 2 or 3 ways to resolve a conflict and the straightest path isn't always the best one. Most of your choices do have some sort of consequence. The combat can be pretty challenging, but can also be like super easy if you have the right build, it's not particularly well balanced. The visuals, well, they kind of hit the spot for what the game is portraying. Dark, dull, forboding, if not boring landscapes. I mean, you're in the middle of the desert, it's not that interesting. The humor is pretty cool, and I must have laughed a few times at either something happening or when a character said something funny. The story is pretty interesting overall, having you start as one of the previous PC's (from Fallout) decendants in a tribal community to helping out (or hurting) towns or refugees to disabling (or enabling) nukes.\n\nI think that anyone who can deal with turn-based rpgs should play this. It's pretty awesome. Even if you haven't played turn-based rpgs or maybe have had bad experiences with them, you should like this. But stay away if you can only handle fps style gameplay, this isn't for you.\n\nThe steam version does work with all of the mods out there btw, I've not run into any issues regarding that stuff.\n\n10/10\nWould die in the first battle again.","April 29, 2015","true","68.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've had it (bugs and all) for every computer I've had... It's in my mind, the best Turn-Based RPG ever made.. Everything you do, or don't do, has an impact on the ending... The action is great, the comedy takes from every sci-fi genre you can think of, It's hard, VERY hard if you set it that way... you could end up fighting aliens and deathclaws that destroy you at every turn.. And thats why it's so much dam fun!! it was random..\nI personally was dissapointed with fallout 3 because it felt to me, like a carbon copy of oblivion... They could have done more with fallout 3.. And the other reason why I was dissapointed with fallout 3, because fallout 2 set the bar so high, no third game could compare...\nNormally, I don't write reviews for games.. I just wanted to add my two cents on THIS game though, because it's that good!! with the patches made by fans and the high res patch..

This gotta be the best of them all, of all the Fallout games THIS is the crown jewel.\n\nIt is dark, it is funny and it is a really great RPG with many choices that impacts your character.\n\nThere are 2 versions of the game, one is with children the other is without. The one without is apperently the german and mainly in europa version and the one with is american, This copy on steam have the children in them.\n\nNow to the game it self....\n\nIt is harder than fallout 1 in the start as Stimpacks and medication cost have sky rocketed, it is still however highly important having High Agility, Intelligence and decent perception to become a death dealing sniper with good stealth and a general jack of all trades as the skill points and AP will aid you a lot and the STRENGTH boost of Power armor will give you more than enough carry capacity for the weapon of choice, the arrmor and enough mediciation to rule the world.... unless you get companions to carry stuff for you, yupp you can get companions and they do die easily so best in the start, end game not so much. But then again you can just replace those blasted companions with your nifty car that runs on small energy cells or micro fusion batteries.... meaning your priced energy weapons will suffer a bit unless you can get a steady supply of them by hunting down Enclave goons.\n\nNow..... the story is in a sense just like Fallout 1 with a few changes but in general happen in the same way, go get thing, get back and deal with bigger threat, but the world is bigger, more towns, more quests and more goofy persons to meet.\nIf you just liked Fallout 1 then you are bound to love fallout 2, it is simply done better.","March 7, 2015","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything in here (ants and scorpions) can be kited if you have at least 7 action points.  Punch something (using 3), and move 4 spaces away from it.  It will use all of its action points to close the 4 space gap, and not be able to attack you.  This will save you a lot of trouble.\n\n2)  You can heal yourself using doctor/first aid skills in addition to the powder.  This can only be done successfully three times each though.  (Save your antidotes if poisoned, you'll be able to cure the poison with the use of these skills and/or it will wear off over the course of the time it takes you to attempt to use them)\n\n3)  When you enter the second area, walk slowly forward, one space at a time.  As you notice the raised stone plates, use the traps skill on them.  Even if you skill is low, keep using it.  Eventually, you'll disarm them, for 25 XP each.\n\n4)  You can steal the key from the final guy to avoid fighting him.  You can keep reloading if your steal skill is low.  Alternatively you can talk him out of the fight if you have enough speech skill.\n\n5)  If you level up in the dungeon, don't put points into melee or unarmed. There's a trainer for each in the first village.  If you have less than 55% unarmed skill, you can train to 55%.  There's a guy for melee weapons too, that'll give you +10%.  I'm not sure what the cutoff is.","April 23, 2015","true","117.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you don't make every choice right this game will rip your arm off an beat you with it, you will know this game inside and out, be able to redraw the map like it was tattooed into your brain. This game is hard to say the least, but is also fun.\n\nPros: Don't get me wrong when I say fun, it's kind of like mowing the lawn for the first time, exciting and you can't wait to do more, but constantly worrying that you'll do it wrong and it'll come back to bite you in the future. Story wise, fantastic. Better than all the others and than some. Also lots of crazy easter eggs and references so be prepared.\n\nCons: Sometimes the game just decides to kill itself and have seizures, but it was made in the 1990's so I'll forgive it.\n\nFinal thoughts: If you consider yourself a fan of the Fallout series you have to play this. And you should. But if you're asking yourself "I thought Fallout 3 was the first fallout game" or, "why are you stuck in 3rd person", than you should probably stick to COD.","April 15, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though Fallout 3 and New Vegas are very very good games.. this one still has to be my favorite.. for its time. This game really did good for its time, the random encounters are pretty fun so many unique and interesting things to run into, there is SO much to do. I never get bored of this game, I still play it even now. Plus it brings back so many good memories. I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves RPGs, if you liked Diablo it's a chance you may like this game.. if you liked Final fantasy, there's also a good chance you'll like it. It is a turned based combat system. But it's been developed smart and it's very fun and helpful if you love strategy games. Also if you liked X-Com.. you may fall in love with Fallout 2. It's a lot like X-Com but free roam, you can do whatever you want, so much to explore, the story line was built very well and it's extremely interesting. I hope anyone who grabs this game will enjoy it a lot. Also steam supports this game for different Operating systems. Which is a huge help, also if you like to spice the game up a tad bit.. check out http://www.nma-fallout.com/ to check out some of the cool mods you can add to the game. Enjoy your awesome journey in Fallout 2 and good luck!","June 5, 2015","true","187.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It's a cult classic.\n\nThat said, I'm sure you've heard all the good stuff about it from everyone else. Maybe you remember playing it as a kid (and remember all the good stuff). All that good stuff is true. This game is awesome.\n\nThat said... there are some things that really grate on me...\n\nCombats are painfully, hair-tearingly slow. Sometimes you have to wait minutes for some scorpions to crawl ahead a few hexes each, only to fire at one and find out that you missed. Again some minutes of crawly-crawly. Until they surround you and tear you to pieces within a single round.\n\nYour weapons don't really improve all that much. Later in the game, around San Francisco, even though you can upgrade your arsenal, it feels like a downgrade with the ridiculously overpowered (and numerous) enemies.\n\nMerchants run out of cash, and you run out of storage space. You'll end up lugging around dozens of extremely valuable guns you can't use, and can't barter in for an upgrade, because, say, the gun you'd want to buy costs 10000, each of the old guns cost 1000, but you can't carry 10 of them at the same time.\n\nParty members are bloody idiots. They are a liability 50% of the time. They are very good at two things - getting themselves killed, or killing you and each other. If you give them powerful weapons, they will try to shoot a full cartridge into some enemy right through a party member standing inbetween. If you give them crappy weapons, or tell them to run away, you can't win most of the fights late in the game.\n\nThe NPC control dialog is incredibly hard to navigate.\n\nDid I mention how slow combat is? On a computer maybe a 100 times more powerful than the one this game was written for.\n\nAnyway... of course it's recommended. It's Fallout 2. But it will frustrate you to no end.","June 17, 2015","true","67.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why? ...That's hard to pinpoint. The open world? Only the vaugest hint of linearity? The shenanigans? The trouble-making? The snark. The sardonic, grim humor of a post-apocolyptic world inhabited by humans (tribal and "civilized"), ghouls, mutants, and more.\nIf you wondered about ~any~ of the backstory in F:NV, Fallout 1 and 2 will fill in the gaps. Fallout: New Vegas is the direct sequel to Fallout 2; Fallout 3 is what happens when a company aquires an IP with a rich internal history and says, Eh, let's move everything across the country because who wants to play in -that- world anymore? Me, that's who. This is the 3rd copy I've owned (because I'm terrible at keeping track of install CDs), and now I have it forever (or, at least as long as Steam servers are up).\nWhole-hearted recommendation to any RPG fan, any turn-based combat fan, or ~anyone~ with a dark sense of humor.","April 11, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To say I was hesitant in getting into an older game that is known for being arduously difficult and based on the GURPS RPG system is a gods damned understatement. But when that good ol' Steam Holiday sale rolled by and saw this game for the dirt cheap, I decided "What the ♥♥♥♥" and started my new favorite game.\nFolks without a doubt this is a great game. Its fun, its got great writing, the gameplay mechanics (though challenging at first if unfamiliar) are great, the character system is great...the game is ♥♥♥♥ing great. Obviously, however, it's not perfect. For starters its graphics have aged with the grace of an avacado left under a UV lamp in high humidity for several decades and can prove to be frustrating when you initially start the game and everything looks horribly glitched until you find a fix it. Pacing can be hard to get into if you go from a fast paced pick up and play game, and there is a lot of reading (which isn't a negative but for extensive gaming it can ware your eyes sore).\nWhile it is true that you can basically make a perfect character based on how you want to play the game (ex. a character perfect for the main campaign invest stats in X,X,X an X etc.,) the fun of this game is just seeing what happens when you try and not be conventional. This is where the GURPS mechanic shines and as a result I'm looking into the table top game system  . This game is fun to play around in and while, yes trial and error results in several (and I mean SEVERAL) in game deaths for the uninitiated, it helps you get a strong feel for the world you are playing in.\nAnother minor gripe I have is that there is no tutorial, you are basically dropped into the game and left to figure it out, which for some is great, but it would have been nice to have the option.","January 24, 2014","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fallout: New Vegas is the direct sequel to Fallout 2; Fallout 3 is what happens when a company aquires an IP with a rich internal history and says, Eh, let's move everything across the country because who wants to play in -that- world anymore? Me, that's who. This is the 3rd copy I've owned (because I'm terrible at keeping track of install CDs), and now I have it forever (or, at least as long as Steam servers are up).\nWhole-hearted recommendation to any RPG fan, any turn-based combat fan, or ~anyone~ with a dark sense of humor.","April 11, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything in here (ants and scorpions) can be kited if you have at least 7 action points.  Punch something (using 3), and move 4 spaces away from it.  It will use all of its action points to close the 4 space gap, and not be able to attack you.  This will save you a lot of trouble.\n\n2)  You can heal yourself using doctor/first aid skills in addition to the powder.  This can only be done successfully three times each though.  (Save your antidotes if poisoned, you'll be able to cure the poison with the use of these skills and/or it will wear off over the course of the time it takes you to attempt to use them)\n\n3)  When you enter the second area, walk slowly forward, one space at a time.  As you notice the raised stone plates, use the traps skill on them.  Even if you skill is low, keep using it.  Eventually, you'll disarm them, for 25 XP each.\n\n4)  You can steal the key from the final guy to avoid fighting him.  You can keep reloading if your steal skill is low.  Alternatively you can talk him out of the fight if you have enough speech skill.\n\n5)  If you level up in the dungeon, don't put points into melee or unarmed. There's a trainer for each in the first village.  If you have less than 55% unarmed skill, you can train to 55%.  There's a guy for melee weapons too, that'll give you +10%.  I'm not sure what the cutoff is.","April 23, 2015","true","117.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I started playing it way after it was released, so this isn't a nostalgia trip for me or anything, this was from pure interest in the genre and what I've heard about it. I was not disappointed.\n\nThis game is packed with content. There's lots of quests, characters, weapons, locations, and items. There's almost always 2 or 3 ways to resolve a conflict and the straightest path isn't always the best one. Most of your choices do have some sort of consequence. The combat can be pretty challenging, but can also be like super easy if you have the right build, it's not particularly well balanced. The visuals, well, they kind of hit the spot for what the game is portraying. Dark, dull, forboding, if not boring landscapes. I mean, you're in the middle of the desert, it's not that interesting. The humor is pretty cool, and I must have laughed a few times at either something happening or when a character said something funny. The story is pretty interesting overall, having you start as one of the previous PC's (from Fallout) decendants in a tribal community to helping out (or hurting) towns or refugees to disabling (or enabling) nukes.\n\nI think that anyone who can deal with turn-based rpgs should play this. It's pretty awesome. Even if you haven't played turn-based rpgs or maybe have had bad experiences with them, you should like this.

That is to say, it comes from a time where men were real men, women were real women, and real, fuzzy things from Alpha Centauri were real, fuzzy things from Alpha Centauri.\n\nMy apologies to Douglas Adams.\n\nWhat I mean is that the experience is born of a time when games demanded a lot from players, and pretty much refused to engage in hand-holding. If your character isn't especially scientific, or stealthy, or good at talking, then you'd better be able to independently figure out combat - or you're out of luck. (A well-rounded character may not be your best bet in this game. That was my approach, but I have a sneaky suspicion that the game is much more rewarding for players who choose to specialize.)\n\nThere is one section, very late in the game, which requires you to solve a rather mind-boggling puzzle. If you can't solve it, you can't progress. This isn't like the "Half-Life 2" episodes, where a major design goal was apparently for every player to see the ending. In "Fallout 2," if you can't get through, it's tough cookies.\n\nI cheated. Maybe I'm just a simpleton, but I couldn't get through it without help. I have no idea how anyone figured it out to write the walkthrough, to be frank. (Maybe if I had spend a few hours making detailed notes...maybe.)\n\nLike I said: Games like this are demanding, and do not "suffer fools gladly."\n\nAnd if you want to know how this kind of RPG gaming got to where it is now, you need to play this classic title.","January 8, 2015","true","39.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
