I immensely enjoyed exploring the environment, dicovering the myriad ways I could interact with the world around me. I think I could easily have wasted hours just messing around with all the objects. The game is gorgeous, with excellent graphics and a really interesting art style.

Meaning there are future technologies present but it's a retro future, somewhat reminiscent of the Alien franchise and Space Odyssey.\n\nPros  It has great atmosphere and visuals, I myself played it on a monitor but with a VR headset I believe the experience can be enhanced futher.\n\nThe world is very interactive, I had lots of fun taking polaroids of bees present on the Colony.\n\nThere is a decent amount of content in the game that tells a backstory of what happened on the base and Minefield Games did a great job giving personality to the base occupants.\n\nCons   It's very short, very very short. Not worth the 20 Euro's I paid for it. I'm going to be brutally honest here the price does not reflect the amount of playtime you can experience and is somewhat on the same level as Dear Esther.\n\nThere are many items in the game that you think you can do something with but sadly cant, such as electric welder/solder irons and other assorted tools. Wich is a shame because your character supposedly does have a technical engineering background because the  RAMA corporation assigns you in that field.\n\nFinal verdict  The game is good albeit short however at it's current pricing you wont get lots of bang for your buck, I finished it in around 2 hours. 2 entertaining hours though.","April 20","true","3.6"," 57 of 72 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","57","72","3","0"

Let me just start off by saying that. Howeverl, for 25$ I do not recommend it. For 10$... maybe.\n\nIt's a story-driven exploration game, and although the progression is meant to be by discovering everything for yourself, some things are heavy handed while others are far too vague. Overall not too bad and a decent little mystery in space. The number one thing that bothered me though, was the ending.\n\nYou go through the game  finding out how this "entity" slowly drove the crew mad and killed them. The game ends when you finally confront it. However, the ending is quite literally a fractal sequence. For ten minutes. Followed by a starscape. For another few minutes. Followed by "THE END." It started as a let down that felt out of place and quickly became an annoying fifteen minutes of my life watching a bad fractal music video unfold. Minus serious points for taking what looks like default unity screen effects and just spamming them along with it. The whole thing felt awful at the end of this game, and by the time it was over I didn't even like the game anymore.","April 20","false","2.4"," 81 of 112 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","81","112","2","8"

Slow pace. Zero challenge. Clunky movement. TERRIBLE ending. Not worth $25. Pick it up when it's below $10, and even then, don't expect much.\n\nI spent 20 minutes trying to implement both "solutions" to destroy the entity, provided by clues left behind. I first tried to overload the reactor, which was Pohl's idea, and then tried to use the anti-gravity beam, which was the doctor's idea. It appears that neither solution can actually be implemented. I also tried to send the train carrying the data on its way (finishing what the crew of Station M started), but this isn't meant to be done either, it seems. Maybe you can do these and I just missed it, but I don't think so. I was so frustrated by these dead-ends in the story that I finally just opened the door to the entity and got it over with.\n\nA couple thoughts about the story;\n\nWhat happened to HQ once you arrived at the station? They contact you once after you reestablish communications, and then you never hear from them again. You are still in the main reality/timeline for much of the game, but HQ never says another word. Does the storm knock out comms? If so, they should've said it would happen or demonstrated that it happened.\n\nThere is also no explanation for why Karen was in the entity at the end. Her last message talked about "confronting" the entity. This presumably was recorded YEARS after she disappeared from the station. But in the real timeline/dimension/reality, Karen's clothing is laying on the ground in front of the entity, and there are charred remains like those of the doctor in the lab.  Why does the crew say that Karen "dissapeared" or "jumped over the platform" when they could clearly see her suit on the platform in front of the entity, with the same charred remains of the doctor in the lab? The doctor died the same way, shortly after Karen. Why do they refer to him as dead but Karen as missing?\n\nAnother thing I really don't understand; Ion Lem's helmet, the doctor's leg, the cat's collar - basically every object that takes you to the alternate dimension/timeline/reality, takes you to the place in which Karen was stuck. Although the doctor, Ion, and the male Dr. Pohl all seemed to "die" the same way that Karen died, and they die AFTER Karen, none seem to exist in the same place as her, and picking up their "infected" things don't bring you to where they are. They don't have their own notes or recordings; only Karen does.\n\nSo again, huge unexplained holes in the story. They should've just made Karen "disappear" and make the others die or be killed in other ways, and just use something else to trigger the jump to Karen's area.\n\nLastly, the "ending", where you float through some fractal shape for 10 minutes, is utterly boring and disappointing.\n\n\nI would say "I don't understand this story", but it's more than that. It was boring, there are a ton of loop holes and dead ends, and it's completely unsatisfying when you finish.","April 21","false","2.8"," 56 of 81 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","56","81","2","1"

You learn about the story through various tapes with audio recordings from the characters, as well as other notes and books left around the base. I liked the audio files, and learning about the characters that way, but I found it very strange that for all the object interaction that this game has, I don’t understand why I have to bring the audio tapes to a static location to listen to them on a tape player. I really think I should have just been able to pick up the tape player, and bring it along with me to use, and listen to while I’m still exploring.\n\nAt first I was really excited about being outside on the surface of Titan with the threat of an approaching storm, but I am slightly disappointed that this opening was the only time I got to experience the outside, and everything else takes place inside the base. Don’t get me wrong, the base and everything inside looks wonderful, but I still wanted to be outside more with the storm approaching.\n\nPros:intriguing story, and you will appreciate it more if you take the time to explore as much as you can\nyou can interact with almost every object\naudio voices, music, and other sounds throughout the game are done very well\nimmersive atmosphere, and the environment looks really good both inside and outside of the base\ndepending on how much you want to interact with things, and how much you explore, the completion time of the game can vary\nCons:even though you can interact with so much, most objects serve no purpose\nyou have to find a tape player to listen to the audio tapes and wait around while they finish playing\nsometimes long delay when opening doors I hadn’t used yet, and stuttering when I first went into areas for the first time (after I had been to the area at least once, everything seemed to load normally, and without delay)\nsome very noticeable texture issues - when moving towards and away from them, the textures change (it was really weird, and a bit distracting - I feel like it hurt the immersion a bit)\nvery short game for its cost\nMy biggest complaint about P·O·L·L·E·N is how short of a game it is. It took me less than 3.5 hours and I found almost all the collectibles that were relevant to the story. But still, I feel like the cost of the game is way too much for how short it is. I don’t really feel the need to replay the game, but I might replay it anyway, just to see how it is when it becomes compatible with the HTC Vive. Overall, I still enjoyed the game, but I do regret how much I spent on it.","April 21","true","4.1"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","31","43","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Synchrosis1/recommended/393750/","Synchrosis1","Syn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Synchrosis1/","118 products in account","I will say this now, this game has done something that no game has ever done to me before and I shall explain in great detail for those of you who are curious about my experience.\n\nIt easily ended up generating an atmosphere which genuinely made me afraid of entering rooms. The setting of the game takes place on the largest moon of Saturn, Titan. This is the only moon with a significant atmosphere, hence why in the start of the game you can see bronze windy conditions. The level design for the brief walk you have on titian is very accurate to what Titian MAY look like, so this gives us a good look at how well the level designers of this game can carry their artistic ability into the realm abstract vagary by utilizing scientific evidence and is a HUGE plus in my review.\n\nNow, in terms of game mechanics it felt very smooth on a keyboard and mouse. I had the ability to pick up most objects and interact with them with ease. The subtle detail that the prop design team added into this game made it utterly fascinating to just play around and get lost in exploring what items were. I was actually engrossed in messing about with the environment most of the time. This general curiosity is what fuelled me to inspect every object, and find my way through the puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles of the game were not easy, but they were not hard. They were very balanced and if you have a keen eye and a good attention to detail you will find that this game will be very enjoyable for you. If you are more of a straight to the point, give me the puzzle on the wall type, you may find yourself a little frustrated because the game promotes you to look around and mess about with things.\n\nNow as far as the ending of this game? Utterly surreal and I will not spoil this at all for you but I daresay that It will allow a LOT of room for players to make their own theories which is GREAT for any story loving gamer.\n\nI did feel as if there was a lack of an actual story, most of it was left very vague, I’m not entirely sure what happened at the base or why I was even there but I didn’t find myself having to rely on a solid, linear story to get me through the game. It allowed me to embrace curiosity, rather than just following what a voice actor tells me to do which is something no game has really done to me as strongly as this game.\n\nI will recommend EVERYBODY to play this game, explore, learn, and get curious. You will NOT regret this if you are looking for an eerie atmospheric game to take to you to another world entirely.\n","April 28","true","7.5"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

This sucks you right in. The whole atmosphere is set very well and you really feel being there and finding out what happened and trying to find out more.\nThe slow pace suits very well the story and feeling immersed in the game.\nWithout reading the majority of documents/papers or listening to most tapes it took me about 4 hours to finish. I'm often not bothered much by the stories in games so also here I skipped most text/tapes. Still I liked the game very much. The puzzling and finding out how to get in another room I like a lot.\nI must say that I don't think I would buy or like this game in 2D. It's the VR that makes this work for me.\n\nWhen it was the end I was sad there wasn't more. I look forward to more levels/expansions of this type!\n\nAbout the price, don't forget VR is a whole new way of developing and there for still costs much more than normal game development. Don't compare it with normal games and at this moment the price vs quality is right.\n\nOf course there are things that can and should be improved. For high graphics the game is very demanding so that should be optimized more.

Bear with me for an instant and I promise that this will make sense in the end.\n\nThe atmosphere is amazing. I really dig the retrofuturistic aesthetic of this game's world. The sound design is stellar and excellent graphics really do their job at immersing you into the game. The story and backstory seems to be solid so far and the environments are exceedingly (in a good way) interactive. Almost verything can be moved, nudged or toyed with.\n\nBUT performance-wise the game is a complete mess. I know it is a very demanding game, but I have a pretty decent rig and yet still manage to run this game with major stuttering and unnaturally low FPS. "You should lower your graphics!", you might say. Well, the thing is that even if I put every graphical option at the lowest value possible it still stutters like crazy to the point where it's almost unplayable. I'm someone who rarely complains about performance issues in games and am quite lenient in letting these kind of problems get into the way of my enjoyement, but this is simply absurdl.\n\nUnfortunately due to those aforementioned issues I feel sad to say that I currently DO NOT reccomend this game.

While story driven, the ending and overall story arc seem to end quite lacking of any real resolution. And the optimisation was utter tripe. Im running a GTX 980ti and this game ran like a stuck pig.\n\nOverall the game I would recommend.

The closest comparison that you can make with this game is Gone Home.\n\nSTORYYou play as the sole member of a rescue team who is sent to the moon of Saturn Titan to help the scientists in Station M who have been having some problems. However, when you get there, there is no one to be found. What happened here? Where is everybody? You will (mostly) find an answer to these questions.\nYou will learn the story by examining the environment and by listening to cassette tapes scattered around the station, and while I do like this type of storytelling, the ending almost ruined the entire experience. To avoid spoiling it, let's just say that it's something that only VR users might enjoy.\n\nGRAPHICSMade with the Unity engine, the game looks fan-frickin-tastic! Great textures, plenty of details, good physics and realistic lighting and shadows. Only weird thing was having FPS drops in some relatively small areas. And by drops, I mean going from 50 to 15 in two seconds. Other than that, the performance was top notch.\n\nGAMEPLAYYou will walk, pick up objects, listen to tapes and beat puzzles in order to advance the game. I was fully immersed after ten minutes thanks to how fun everything was, and I almost spent thirty minutes just shooting basketballs, playing darts and listening to rock music. It definitely is the best "walking simulator", coming closer to being an actual fully-fledged video game.\n\nCHALLENGEThe puzzles are mostly easy to beat, and a never found myself stuck not knowing where to go next.\n\nSOUNDThe voice acting is great, and the sound effects are very realistic and professional. I also enjoyed the soundtrack, which reminded me of the one from Ex Machina (great sci-fi movie).\n\nREPLAYABILITYAfter beating the game, you could play it again to pick up some tapes and try to uncover more secrets. But know that the game is very short: it took me only three hours to beat it the first time, and I did try to explore every nook and cranny.\n\nOverall, a fun VR experience with an excellent technical department and cool gameplay moments that is almost entirely ruined by its ending and short lenght. Recommended to VR users and fans of the genre when on sale at around 10$.\n\nStory: 7\nGraphics: 9\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 4\nSound: 9\nReplayability: 7.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 7\nFRUSTRATION: 2\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","April 25","true","9.1"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

I know I'm in the minority here (I think,) but I really enjoyed every bit of it, even the contentious ending.\n\nI should mention before I start that I played the game without a VR headset, and also that while I will try to keep it as spoiler free as possible, to explain why I recommend it will require minor spoilers. You have been warned!\n\nSo Pollen is set in an alternate 1995, where JFK survived his assasination, allied with the USSR, and the resulting collaboration meant a joint Moon landing as huge technological advances. Soon, antigravity drives were developed, and coupled with the rise of megacorporation RAMA Industries, leads to extraterrestrial colonies. You play as an employee of RAMA, sent to their relatively new Research Station M on Titan to replace the previous technician. When you get there, everyone is gone, and through subsequent events, you find yourself shifting between two different realities on Station M, which is key to solving the mystery.\n\nIn terms of world design, Pollen accomplishes this extremely well, better than many games I've played. It really establishes a hyper-immersive alternate universe, and is very similar to old-school sci-fi media such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Alien, or novels by Arthur C Clarke, Frank Herbert, or Isaac Asimov.\n\nAlmost everything in the game can be picked up and examined, and very little of it is superflous. It either accomplished world-building, or it contains plot information. I've seen reviews that say they finished the game in an hour and a half to two hours, and while this is easily possible, you have to be rushing through the game, something which you absolutely cannot afford to do if you want to get the full experience. This is a game that really requires you to take your time, explore, and look at almost everything, and if that doesn't sound appealing to you, look elsewhere, because that's the majority of your gameplay.  Puzzles are extremely easy to solve, more like brainteasers than actual puzzles, but they feel natural for the most part. Other than that, the majority of what you will do is explore and examine items, and my total playtime took about 5 hours.\n\nWith reagrds to the story, since that's what these games live and die on, at surface level it can seem to be rushed and disappointing, which is really what people will feel about this game in general if they don't look deeper or take their time through it. The seemingly simple storyt is actually quite symbolic, deep and complex, when you dig through it and analyze it once you've finished. My only complaint is the ambiguity. Without spoiling toomuch, I wish there had been a bit more of a concrete explanation for the multiple realities. Now, onto the elephant in the room, the ending. I personally enjoyed it, and while it is ambiguous, the ambiguity serves it well. Without delving too deep, let's just say it's very reminiscent of classic sci-fi (I won't name any specific names,) in a good way.\n\nIn terms of the visuals themselves, they are top-notch for a Unity game. They looked far better then I thought they would, but that may have been because the majority of the game is in enclosed spaces. Performance wise, I maintained a steady 60 FPS without any framerate drops on a 980TI. The game seems very well optimized, which is another plus, though I don't know how well it runs on lower end systems. With regards to price, I paid the full 25$ for the game and don't regret it one bit, but for some people 5 hours for 25$ may seem to expensive. It depends on wether you judge value by amount of hours or the quality of those hours. I personally felt I got more of my money's worth out of this than I would have out of a Ubisoft open-world game, but that's extremely subjective.\n\nIn conclusion, if you enjoy walking simulators/ exploration games with complex plots, I would strongly recommend P.O.L.L.E.N, but be aware of what kind of game that you are buying beforehand. It's a short, tight, and masterfully crafted experience, that is extremely slow-burning and rewarding.","May 28","true","5.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Lieder wurde ich vom Gegenteil überzeugt da es mich irgennt wan nur noch Gelanweilt hat.\n\nDiese 20Euro sind es nicht wert.\n\n","April 20","false","2.6"," 20 of 196 people (10%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","10","20","196","18","5"

I would of wanted to know more about the entity at the end and maybe some theories of what happened and why human race exists or something mind ♥♥♥♥ing like that\n\n8/10\npros: real space station feeling\ncons: short game and too long psychedelic demo at the end and lacking more story","May 16","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
