Really, the only notable things about this game is that the protagonists are female scientists. It's nice to see media that supports women in science and technology. That's it, though. The protagonists are shallow, and offer very little personality beyond their chosen field. They look very similar (uniforms don't help), which makes it tough to remember which one is which, and after a while, I no longer cared. Sadly, the player-controlled character is just as interchangeable as the others, with the only difference being that she wears a dumb mask. Couldn't I have at least chosen which of the six to control? Also, most of the science the girls use is either basic high school knowledge or completely fictional, and I think the dialogue is actually a bit disrespectful to the scientific fields represented (though, as a CS graduate, I have spent time in a computer lab playing Nethack before). As for the story, I found it uninteresting and a bit too padded out with all the battling.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it's boring and horribly unbalanced. Your characters' basic attacks are worthless. I found I just kept relying on multi-target skills, with the occasional heal. It's awkward that there's no place that I could find to just recover HP/SP... I kept having to do it in battle by putting one enemy to sleep and defending/healing repeatedly. The battle and level up system are really pretty inelegant. This game would've benefited by keeping things simpler (like the Mario RPGs). Also, I hate it with a passion when skills in RPGs become harder to use as you level up. The saving grace is that all six characters are usable in battle and they all receive XP... at least that's one pitfall avoided.\n\nThe art is not very good. The pixel work is okay. The illustrations do a poor job of making the girls distinct. The alien homeworld looks particularly bad. As for the sound, well, apparently there's supposed to be some sound? There are options for sound, but I didn't hear any. I turned the volume way up and made sure my speakers were working, but no sound or music. The controls try to work for keyboard, mouse, and controller, but the keyboard controls were crap, and for the mouse, the buttons were a bit small and all over the screen, making it tough to use the mouse comfortably. I also found a number of small graphical bugs as I played through... this game really needed a bit more polish.\n\nI was really hoping to like this game, especially from the publisher that brought us Long Live the Queen (which was great) and Magical Diary (which was not very good, but I still enjoyed it), but for me, this game was pretty much a miss on every level. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. If you know a small girl who is aspiring to study a science/technology field, have them play a good game instead. I wouldn't want her to think that science is as boring as this game is.","August 19, 2014","false","17.7"," 153 of 203 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","153","203","7","5"

It also features extensive dialogues that often let you pick protagonist’s response.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/senshado/recommended/269010/","senshado","Homework Chavez - 70% finished","http://steamcommunity.com/id/senshado/","187 products in account","Okay, wow. So a little while ago my profile stated I would review games for people if they asked me, under the condition that the game was in my library. This review is the reason I had that removed.\n\n"Here's Science Girls, have fun reviewing it ♥♥♥♥♥♥" happened and now I'm not that willing to spend so much time on reviews anymore unless something can be bargained.\n\nRegardless, I'm a man of my word and I do have principles so, just this once, here's a dead honest and genuine review of Science Girls.\n\nScience Girls, a visual novel RPG combination by Hanako Games, did a large appeal on my scepticism when I first started it. I couldn't help but notice it was programmed in Python, which explains its filesize and gameplay mechanics. I'm not going to let that be a negative point in my review though, a title deserves an honest review based on the proposed concept and how it's converged to a playable environment. In that regard they have succeeded in what I presume to be an attempt to recreate an atmosphere that belongs in a crossover between a Japanese visual novel and an oldschool RPG from an indie developer. It's not all good though, and I will elaborate this later on.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are solid: it offers free roaming on a 2D map, a turn based battle system, interactive dialogues, save slots and it does this all without bugs as far as I could see. In fact, I don't have anything to complain from a technological point of view. On every screen everything is very responsive and the game can be saved at any moment, which is pretty neat! Parts where you explore maps work as you expect them to, dialogues being printed can be fastforwarded by clicking your mouse, all pretty intuitive. The fighting is not complex but still offers the freedom to use tactics, which is in fact required as you progress through the game and don't want to get slaughtered by aliens that look like plants.\n\nAnd that's where I'll break out the criticism: the premise is really silly though it doesn't seem intended as such. For all intents and purposes and regardless of the engine, this is a game about girls doing science majors in highschool having to fight off an alien invasion. As one of these girls, a masked psychology student, you first gather other girls in the school while fighting aliens. This setting is empowered by the dialogues that sometimes feel forced so much that the game gets an educative feel, and by this I of course refer to the girls explaining you how rockets work, why plants can't 'move and attack people', or that a ceiling fan does not provide enough mechanical modules to build a mecha. Of course, having a mecha around to fight the aliens would make the game much easier (in this setting, before any MuvLuv fans send me death threats), but mentioning these things feels out of place and pointless.\n\nThe artwork expresses the game's indie origin, being reminiscent of a release from college game design club. I'm not arguing that this is a bad thing however, in my opinion it actually gives life to the Japanese indie atmosphere (Oreimo S1, anyone?). The same can be said about the music and sounds. While it might not be your preference (and it certainly wasn't mine), this is exactly what the game is meant to be like. Dialogue screens present you hand drawn characters, the battles are done in 2,5D perspective, and though I must admit that the free roaming map feels a little cheap, it gets the job done.\n\nWith that I can summarize my review, Science Girls met my expectations as far as the atmosphere was concerned. I could appreciate the authentic Japanese indie feel and the fact the engine was as solid as it gets, what I wasn't so fond of was the educative dialogues that seemed forced and out of place as well as the premise altogether. If Hanako Games has more games based on this engine, though with a less silly and more genuine setting, I am pretty sure they have one or more gems with their name on it. While it might not suit your tastes, it will definitely hook those that look for a Japanese indie visual novel RPG without translation hassle. Hell, when you look at the website of Hanako Games you will see that they actually sell these games on CD's at anime conventions, it doesn't get more authentic than that.","March 22, 2014","true","1.9"," 146 of 205 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","146","205","5","21"

The characters are fun but the further you go the more leveling your characters seems to punish you by greatly increasing point requirements for performing actions while doing nothing to accelerate recovery of said points or providing much in the way of recovery items. The gameplay responsiveness is unreasonably crunchy, and shortly into the game battles just become increasingly numbing repeats of your team against armies of self-replicating enemies that just take too long to clear only to get into another same-same-same fight only moments later, taking even longer as it becomes more costly for your characters to perform their actions. If the repetition doesn't sound like a big deal to you, you may well enjoy it.\n\nMaybe we'll get to see these fun characters in a different game at some point.\n\nShort version: Good characters, but slow and repetitive gameplay that gets slower and more repetitive.","April 7, 2015","false","8.9"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

It's their because they wanted to do an RPG/VN. It serves no purpose.\nThe RPG protion of the game is sloppy. You have no way to gain consumables outside of combat. You have no place or way to rest/heal. The combat is slow, tedious and poorly designed. The basic attacks are worthless, so you end up in a ring of defending and healing just trying to get your party ready for the next fight. The character sprites could have used some variation other than hair.\nEven on the hardest mode, their is no challenge. It just requires you to spend more time in the defend/heal/use special loop.\nMoving the character on the map works best with mouse. Using the kyeboard is clunky.\nGoing through combat is best with the keyboard as using the mouse get tiresome quickly and you can accidently misclick quite easily.\nController support might as well be yanked. Moving is sluggish, accessing menu's is unintuitive, and using special attacks sometime breaks it so that you can't do anything until you use the mouse/keyboard.\nAnd finally the biggest question for a game: was it fun? The anser is no. It was slow, had no real story to speak of, troped characters and tedious combat that monopolizes the majority of the game.\nI loved other games by the publisher, specifically LLTQ. So this game came as quite a let down.\n","October 6, 2015","false","1.4"," 36 of 56 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","36","56","2","0"

The battles threaten to become a grind before you're quite able to unlock something else or run into anything new. A fair amount of the game's length is fake - walking around running into repetitive mob packs. There's also a bit of a balance issue in that there's no renewable source for items so you fashion your party in such a way as to have enough sustain to farm battles for SP. Not surprising then, that of the people who played the game long enough to get back the box of doughnuts (~25%), only slightly more than a quarter (~6.4%) bothered to finish the game.\n\nThere isn't all that much of a story either - just a few lines of comedy and simple decision points stuck along a linear narrative. The alien overworld art is conspicuously ugly. The recorded character sounds are actively offensive even if you watch anime. Fortunately, there's an option to turn off the yell-on-attack sounds, but you'll steal hear them screech every time you get hit.\n\nAt $5, borderline purchase.

In Science Girls you play as the president of the Science Club at a private, all girls school, and the school is being attack by aliens that look like plants but are not plants. Not soon after you make this discovery you go out and find the 5 other members of the club, each of them specialized in a specific field of Science/Technology, and all their special moves are based on their field. There is Jennifer whose field is Biology, Nicole whose field is Physics, Heather whose field is Engineering, Missy whose field is Computer Science, Andrea whose field is Chemistry and your character's field is Psychology.\n\nOn a gameplay level, Science Girls is a JRPG with the typical turn based fighting system. Arthur C. Clarke once said that "Magic's just science that we don't understand yet", and that is reflected here as the spells and Mana that you would find in a more classical JRPG have been replaced by Specials and SP (Science Points!).\n\nOne good thing that Science Girls does is that the story is surprisingly compelling, and it makes you want to keep playing and see where it goes. Another thing Science Girls does well is that the fighting system is actually pretty fun for a turn-based fighting system. All the girls in your party get XP every battle no matter if they were fighting at all, unless they pass out, and there was enough variety in the girls' special moves to prevent the game from getting too repetitive.\n\nHowever, Science Girls does have it flaws. While I find the story to be compelling, the girls themselves are not. I had to look up their names when writing this review because the characters themselves have no real personalities of their own to speak of, which makes remembering their names to be difficult. The only really personality quirks that we do get is that a) they are girls and b) they are interested in Science (which is pretty obvious in a game called Science Girls). You get some likes and dislikes in the character profiles in the menu, but they are not really all that reinforced in the game itself. Another problem is that the while the fighting system was pretty good, the overworld looked like something someone put together in half an hour using Gamemaker.\n\nScience Girls is not a bad game, and while it may not be the best game I've played this week, I feel that it is worth a playthrough.","June 10, 2014","true","5.8"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

It plays like your typical turn based RPG so pick your attacks and level them wisely. Speaking of leveling, it has a really cool system in that it allows you to pick any aspect you want to upgrade.

It's not going to replace any of your other PC or console RPGs, but it doesn't claim to, and it doesn't ask much of your wallet either. The game reminds me a bit of old (S)VGA DOS anime RPGs back in the late 90s.\n\nThe first half of the game plays like a light RPG+visual novel. During this period you meet your team members, get to know them a bit, and discover the situation you're all in. Combat is fairly light, being limited to one random encounter per room or screen you enter. I think this part of the game is balanced well, with frequent "story" segments regularly breaking up the short strings of battles and exploration.\n\nThe second half of the game adopts a more JRPG style with an overhead world map and visible wandering enemies. However, dodging enemies is limited since they seem to constantly spawn and swarm you, and most of your time is spent navigating labyrinth-like narrow passages with an annoying number of branching dead ends. Decades of JRPG grinding has worn me thin, so this was more annoying than fun, but I'm sure many people won't mind. Depending on your preference, you should adjust the game difficulty at the beginning accordingly.\n\nBosses are a slightly more interesting affair compared to regular battles, but they are still fairly easy. The last battle, however, was a surprising spike in difficulty. It was probably the first time I really had to make full tactical use of all six girls. I still beat it though, and I even had 1-2 skill points on each girl that I hadn't used yet.\n\nYou have six party members, three of which can act in each round. They can be swapped out with no penalty at any time, leading to surprising flexibility in combat options, which is probably most necessary in the harder difficulties. You can choose to equally balance all girls and swap them regularly to moderate SP use, or you can specialize the girls in certain roles, like having three for front-line fighting, and swapping the others in as needed to unload their souped-up skills.\n\nThe girls themselves are nice enough in personality, although I wish there was a bit more talk and story bits with them. The actual science in the game is pretty light too, and nothing you wouldn't have learned in high school. I wonder if a younger child would like this game? Humor is pretty mild, but it's charming enough, and it mostly comes from the girls' personalities.\n\nCharacter art is decent, but the girls look way too similar (palette/paperdoll swaps?). Audio is nothing to write home about. Sound effects and voices are tolerable (excepting Nicole's voice when she gets hit in combat), even if the way they talk in Japanese is puzzling. Some of the music tracks are tolerable, but I imagine most people will mute it after an hour or two.","April 23, 2014","true","6.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Really the game is so so, I just didn't find it do intresting and kinda got bored after awhile. It is not a hard game either.

Toying with volume etc hasn't resolved the sound issue.  My Microsoft PC gamepad wasn't set up by default, and the game crashes when I start assigning buttons.  The game also crashes during gameplay.  I can't seem to get much further than past the first battle.  The game appears to be a python port or something, based on the error dumps I get after every crash.\n\nI cannot recommend this game at this time.

I enjoyed the corky storyline and goofy characters in this game, however I found the battling system to be very frustrating at times. Often I ended up hitting the wrong button because of how close together the list of options was and I don't think there was a way to change the option you picked...or at least I couldn't find it. I also feel like the enemy to player damaged/defense ratio to be unfair. The characters did not really do a whole lot of damage despite me putting skill points into almost everything and the characters didn't dodge quite as much as the enemies did which made me rage quit a few times and it also drew the battles out too long. However I did still enjoy this game over all even though I found it frustrating. I wouldn't recommend this for everyone, but for those who are looking for a short rpg and for those who are willing to work around some wonkyness you should try it out just don't expect something amazing because this game is very far from amazing.","October 31, 2015","true","12.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I would've been very interested if a sequel was made, but the devs went on to make Long Live the Queen.... oh well.\n\n\nIt was okay for 3 quid.","March 26, 2014","true","40.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The characters are actually believeable to people who have worked/lived closely with people of other scientific professions and I have actually had many of these conversations myself. The combat system does become a bit more difficult later on based on the recovery rate of sp being identical regardless of level but with skills requiring more as they level up but this puts more importance on planning whether the extra damage/effect is worth the sp cost, although it doesn't become too much of an issue if you plan ahead, it is a cute game and I enjoy it so I definitely recommend it and I personally would love to see a sequel or more games from this creator.","January 25","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
