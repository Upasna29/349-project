After that it just gets kindof boring and repetitive.  It's no Nuclear Throne I'll say that much.","December 23, 2015","false","2.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Very polished with original gameplay with pretty fun graphics. It's fun and addictive.\n\nI simply can't recommend this enough!\n\nYou can tell that this game was crafted with passion. I hope we see more from this developer! Bravo!","January 4","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The controls feel a bit stiff. For the price, its not horrible.\n\nNeeds music! if this gets a decent sound track I would have recomended it.\n\nHere is some gameplay for those interested.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rqtlU5EuFLk\n\n","December 29, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If these are the holy trinity of a good game, then by George, I think we have a winner with UnSummoning. Although short, at this pricetag we get a lot of game for our four bucks.","April 16","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall I'd say this is a C- and with so many games to play it wasn't worth my time.  The controls could use some work and the concept gets boring after an hour or so.","May 23","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Considering how vital it is to do precise moves, the feeling and responsiveness of the controls should be perfect. Using a keyboard did not help.\n\nI came back and tried again a few weeks later but it was no better and I gave up even sooner.\n\nI have a high end PC and there is no reason why this game should feel laggy and I chalk it up to poor design.","May 27","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
