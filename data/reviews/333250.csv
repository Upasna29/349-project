"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sousekei/recommended/333250/","Sousekei","NO FEAR.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sousekei/","75 products in account","Forward the the Sky is a very simple game. The controls are easy to understand. Left and Right mouse buttons to attack, keyboard for movement (You can use a controller as well).\n\nCombat: Combat in this game has no depth. All you are going to be doing is spam clicking left or right mouse (doesn't really matter which) until the enemies are defeated. There is also no blocking function. The only "defense" you get is a back flip which you will never use.\n\nPuzzles: All of the puzzles in the game are very simple, with exception to level 4's main puzzle. It took me a minute or so to finally realize how to complete it, which is a good thing. The rest of the puzzles focus on switches and platforming that anyone can complete with ease.\n\nMusic: The soundtrack in this game is nice to listen to, and fits the Fighting/Platforming/Puzzle gameplay the game has to offer (with exception to the final battle).\n\nVoice acting: Not best, but it's ok. (The main character sounds cute, so that's something).\n\nOverall, the game is something you would beat in one sitting, it consists of 6 levels, all which take around 20 minutes to complete MAX. I do recommend this game, and it would be a good game for casual players and some hardcore gamers. If I had to rate the game, I would give it a solid 7/10. The game is surely there, just not put to it's full potential.","January 29, 2015","true","1.5"," 131 of 146 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","131","146","3","8"

It kept me engaged as there is not much filler, or flutter, but it felt as though I was playing through a story, and my actions were of the princess. I genuinely wanted to complete the level to find out the next part of the story. As with anything, there is room to improve.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 7/10\nYou play a princess in a 3rd person action platformer. The controls on the keyboard are tight, and tapping keys allow for finite jumping and a great experience. I personally had issues using the gamepad from the start, so I have no opinion if it works properly or not. The goal is to complete the level, and optionally collect all of the crystals.\n\nDIFFICULTY: 7/10\nIf you plan on being an achievement completionist, you should expect this game to last you 2-3 hours for the genuine most. For me, the puzzles were not too difficult, or too easy, and I found myself having to go back and forth in some areas a few times to completely understand some of them. When you complete the puzzle, you will feel positive for completing it and continuing on. The combat of the game is lacking; you will face a handful of different skeletons with varying abilities, all will prepare you for the final boss; but the combat is weak and leaves a lot more to desire.\n\nTECHNICAL: 8/10\nWhen first launching the game, the menus confused me, clicking each one of them takes you to a different part of configuration or tutorial, and eventually will start the game. I would have personally liked if the menus were a bit more intuitive. Performance was fine with a full 60fps and no dips in graphics. Some of the sounds, like a whistle for the balloon when you die can get annoying; I would prefer something a bit more lax.\n\nCONCLUSION\nRecommended gameplay for a simple platformer, with cute graphics and an engaging story. Nothing to write home about, but something you will remember playing. 7/10","April 5, 2015","true","2.1"," 52 of 63 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","52","63","4","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/333250/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Summary:Forward to the Sky is an action adventure where you take role of the loli princess who decides to venture to the sky tower to kill the evil crystal witch. But... something happened there and things may not be as people say.\n\nThis game is a great relaxing platformer, as it is pretty easy overall and anytime you fall down the tower that you're climbing, you'll get back up immediately. I loved that every level, a new gameplay mechanic is brought into the game, so each level has different gameplay. The bad thing is that there are only 5 levels and a bossfight, which you'll beat in about 2 hours, getting 100% achievements meanwhile.\n\nI think the developers could actually squish more out of the game, at least every gameplay mechanic (gravity changes, wind rings, elevators) could get more levels that would just grow in difficulty by the progress. Anyway, the game, even when is short, is entertaining and worth buying - though it's up to you to decide if you'll pay the full price or wait for (another) sale.\n\nPros:- Relaxing and entertaining. Your brain (or fingers) won't melt there, don't prepare to die. You'll just be jumping and slashing with your sword.\n- Cute protagonist. You'll be happy if you are into cute loli princesses.\n- Delightful environment of the sky tower. Also, things around you are destructible! (I might've spent about tenth of my playtime just destroying walls and columns.)\n- Voice acting. Though it's not something coming with extra quality, it was still a nice surprise to hear conversations of princess and witch.\n- Controller support.\n- Steam achievements.\n\nCons:- Short length. Considering the soundtrack, visuals and the amount of gameplay mechanics, I'd still consider that the price of the game is reasonable.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 8","true","5.7"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","42","49","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/curly_nuts/recommended/333250/","curly_nuts","curly_nuts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/curly_nuts/","1432 products in account","I would recommend this game for the following reasons:\n\n1. The graphics are pretty nice. The game hovers around 60 FPS at 1080p. It is vibrant and colorful. The main characters looks great and animates well. Enemy animation, however, isn't as smooth as I would like. I liked the grand scale of some of the levels which are floating in the sky and have you traversing higher up as you progress. You can see parts of the tower floating in the background. They are detailed enough that it creates a cool 3D effect. It's cool to start at the bottom and work your way up only to look all the way down and say, "hey, I was just there." Unfortunately, much of the first levels look similar. I haven't seen the later levels yet, though.\n\n2. The gameplay is fun and pretty unique for PC. It is an adventure game where you play as a princess trying to discover the mysteries of a massive tower. There are six levels and the increase in complexity and scale as you progress. There doesn't seem to be any power-ups or collectables other than crystals that you are required to find in each level. Crystals are gotten from beating enemies and breaking statues. They can be cleverly hidden so finding all the crystals is a challenge. Enemies don't vary much and they're pretty easy to dispatch. The real star of the show is the level layout, puzzles and traps that you must get through. The puzzles are what you'd expect from this type of game (move boxes to jump higher, throw switches to move platforms) but they fit well with the whole massive tower-floating-in-the-sky theme. The traps can pose a bigger challenge and I was supprised to find that I just barely made it out of the first level alive because of all the traps.\n\n3. The price is right. This isn't a big game, but it's a nice diversion and it's something different than what we are used to on PC.\n\n4. Trying to 100% each level is a fun achievement. I don't know if it will make a difference in the game or ending, but finding all the crystals is a nice challenge.\n\nSome other things: this game works with a controller (although I noticed the controls were a little spotty and unresponsive a few times). There's not much music variety in this game and sometimes sound effects are missing, but there is voice acting. The voice acting is what you'd expect from the genre (cute little girl voices).\n\nI would recommend this game, especially if you are a fan of the genre (Japanese style adventure/action games). It is a budget title but it is very playable and enjoyable at a reasonable price.","January 29, 2015","true","1.8"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","44","54","3","0"

On your first playthrough you may find your self enjoying the game somewhat but if you were to step back for a second to take a more objective look at the game you would see that it's rather bad.\n\nThe combat in Forward to the Sky could be completly thrown away and nothing would be lost expect for a couple of sales because they wouldn't be able to feature it in promotional images and videos. It's awful, pointless and adds nothing to the experience other then frustration at how little range and "AOE" you have in your attacks.\n\nThe platforming is trash and only has one mechanic to it... the jump key and movement keys... you get no double jump, sprinting varying height nothing. You can jump and move that's it for a platformer these mechanics are far too simplistic.\n\nThe puzzles are ok however with that said this isn't a puzzle game it's a 3D collectathon puzzle platformer with combat elements. The collectathon part of this game is pointless and is only there to make sure that you kill all enemies and solve the "optional" puzzles. Honestly though if you skipped the collectathon part of this game you could probably beat this in under 30 minutes.\n\nIn conclusion\nForward to the Sky feels like a foundation for a better game as it has ok ideas it's just that they're executed poorly. If the developers were to take these mechanics and improve on them in a new game I wouldn't complain even if it was of the same length because that's the thing I prefer quality to length but with Forward to the Sky you don't get quality or length.\n\nSo do I recommend Forward to the Sky?... No, it's not bad but it's not good even if it were free I wouldn't recommend it as the mechanics aren't good but I've said that several times.\n\nI also did a video review if you want to watch that but I doubt you would want to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tG_W3szkDc\n\nA message to the DevsYou're game isn't awful but you need to expand upon and improve the mechanics you have because when your being out matched by old PS2 games your not in a good position.","March 7","false","3.6"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","34","39","3","5"

With the price, I expected a bit more than what I got (luckily, I got it at a cheaper price). In terms of characterization and story, simple and "cute". Overall, not all that outstanding. I expected the puzzles to be a bit more challenging, but they were simplistic at best. The only times I got stuck were when I got lost due to my sense of direction.\n\nThe writing was "cute" but the voice acting didn't match well with it and seemed rather force. When zooming through the map, there were points where the sound would get cut off which was very distracting. There is no option to turn off the voices nor an option to skip the cut scene with the air balloon when you fall off. There were also points where I ended up jumping onto places where I shouldn't have landed (like standing in midair), getting pushed back and forth between spikes, somehow getting trapped between walls. In short, the game is still buggy.\n\nI do appreciate the hard work put into it and would give it a neutral review if there was one but with the price at 7.99USD and gameplay of 1~2hrs, I can't recommend it.","May 7, 2015","false","2.2"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","43","56","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentcaay/recommended/333250/","silentcaay","SilentCaay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentcaay/","247 products in account","I'd probably give this a neutral if I could. Leaning toward "Yes" because it is a pretty charming and enjoyable experience.\n\nThe two main flaws are the length and simplicity. I 100% completed this in just under 2 hours and I goofed off a bit at some parts. The game is also very simplistic. The combat is basic 3D swordplay like something out of Ocarina of Time but without any of Link's gadgets. There aren't many enemies, though, so the lack of complex combat isn't a huge deal, IMO. The levels are like 20% fighting and 80% puzzling/platforming.\n\nThe story and voice acting are pretty amateurish but at the same time they're kind of charming so, again, not a huge deal for me but my finding them charming is subjective so I wouldn't fault anyone for hating on them.\n\nThe mechanics are pretty basic but not braindead. In a few of the latter levels I found myself having to go back and forth to find things I missed or to figure out a puzzle. Each level adds like 1 new enemy type and 1 or 2 new puzzle/platform mechanics so it does stay fresh as you progress. There are some interesting mechanics you don't see very much in puzzle/platformers.\n\nOverall, I had an enjoyable 2 hours but for $8 some might have a problem with the length, the simplicity or both. In that case it might be worth it when it goes on deep discount during a sale.","February 1, 2015","true","1.9"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","27","30","0","0"

It's on the store page; no review (not even my stellar, first-rate, excellent, incomparably fantastic review) can match what you'll get from the demo, so if you're on the fence go download it and try it out.\n\nMy opinion is that this is a very charming, simple game. I enjoyed the game thoroughly (with a few slight misgivings), and I hope to see more from the developer.\n\nI'll cut right to the chase and tell you that this game is EXTREMELY short. My gameplay stats list it at an hour, but I did play the first few levels without running Steam so it's actually about twice that at 2 hours (I did go back and replay the first 3 levels in Steam to get the achievements, but at that point I remembered the layout and basically just speedran them). There are 6 levels (5 levels, really; the 6th is just a boss fight), so that puts it at right about 20 minutes per level on average. I bought it on sale so I wasn't put off by the lack of playtime, but it is something you should consider.\n\nThis game is mostly platforming, with two or three combat setpieces per level between platforming sections. I have absolutely no problem with the platforming beyond the fact that every level introduces a new gimmick, and none of these gimmicks are ever repeated, meaning that the skills you get in one stage never carry on to the next. As an example, the third level introduces wind gust tunnels that you have to navigate to get to different sections of the level, but no other stage has these tunnels. Every stage is mechanically completely different from the next. However, that's really just kind of a nitpick. If the game ever gets a sequel, I'd love to see stages that incorporate the gimmicks from previous stages. Level design does incorporate the gimmicks well, though, and overall each level is pretty fun. Thankfully, the camera is completely controllable and the princess controls great, so there's really no major gripes from me about this portion of the game.\n\nCombat, though, is a little boring and really just amounts to a button masher. You have left-click attacks and right-click attacks, but the difference is minute enough that you can go in swinging either way and it doesn't have an impact on combat. There is also a backflip button, which acts as a dodge, and that's fairly useful late in the game against the mage enemies, but they only appear in the last two platforming stages. Earlier stages can be beaten by literally just tanking every hit and whaling away on the mouse. However, the stages are mostly focused on platforming and like I said there are at max about 3 major "battles" per level, so it's not unbearable.\n\nDuring each stage you have to pick up the various crystals you find. Small enemies drop one when defeated, big enemies drop three, and statues you break apart are each worth 25 crystals for a total of 100 in each stage. Typically, the split is 25 crystals from enemies and 3 statues. For every 33 crystals you pick up, you unlock one section of that stage's story; if you only collect 33 crystals, for instance, you'll only get 1/3 of that stage's exposition. Honestly, it's kind of a non-issue. If you have absolutely ANY sense of exploration you'll easily find all of the statues (some later stages have statues hidden behind puzzles, but all of them are rather simple, and the statues have a very noticeable glow that is visible even through solid objects) and enemies are NEVER off of the beaten path so it's very rare you'll ever finish a stage without getting all 100 crystals. I don't know what happens if you don't get all crystals from each stage; there might be two different endings depending on whether you get all of them or not, but like I said, it's simple enough to get all of them.\n\nI did have a slight problem with the voice acting. None of it is awful, but none of it is good, either. I would describe it as "endearingly mediocre." The princess and the witch, the two main voices you'll be hearing throughout the game, are both fine, but I really didn't like the third voice actress.\n\nThe story is just a setpiece, really. It's there to justify the fact that you're a cute girl jumping around in a tower in the sky. There's nothing wrong with that; the story fills its purpose, and even though it's about the simplest and most cliched story you can think of, it's amusing enough that it doesn't get on your nerves. Though I enjoyed the game and wish it had been longer, I think that if I had had to listen to either the voice acting or the story for much longer it might have started to drag the experience down. As it stands, though, the game is short enough that neither are too grating.\n\nThe characters are rendered in a cel-shaded chibi style, which fits the tone and is pretty cute. The early levels are rather plain and bland, but later on there are glowing crystals and colored fogs and other visuals to help keep things interesting. The music is enjoyable and, again, mostly fits the tone of the game.\n\nOne thing I WOULD like to complain about is the presentation of the menus. There's no text; everything is done via pictures. This isn't a terrible thing, but I did twice accidentally end the game because I couldn't tell which button was supposed to take me back into the game. I will chalk that up 90% to personal idiocy (just hit the Esc/start button again to get out of the menu, idiot), but even just a single word "Resume" or "Close" would have been helpful. The buttons for camera inversion are also a little awkward. However, this is another tiny nitpick and the game itself is not in any way negatively impacted by this.\n\nOverall, I think this is a thoroughly enjoyable game. Bear in mind the cost when deciding if you want to buy it now or wait for a sale, and above all, since the developer was nice enough to include a demo, play that to see if you want the full product. My guess is that you'll enjoy it.","June 22, 2015","true","2.8"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","4"

When I started the game up I got what I expected for the price: Simple combat, nice and sometimes challenging puzzling and some platforming elements. The controls are tight but sometimes frustrating when jumping. Combat consists of slamming the left or right mouse button to swing your sword, you cannot block, you can only "dodge". It's very minimal.\n\nThe game contains 6 levels/chapters, in each of which a new, unique mechanic is introduced, which I like.  The dialogue is sometimes funny but overall very naively written, what makes it obvious that the game was targeted at children.

The game will take you on a 1-2 hours journey as you slash your way through enemies while traversing through light platforming segments and puzzles. Though combat can get repetitive this is mitagated by the introduction of new elements throughout the levels such as wind tunnels, gravity, and more.\n\nThe game uses a chibi/cute anime style which may be off putting to some. While the music isn't very memorable it does it's job and suits the atmoesphere of the game. The voice acting on the other hand will be hit or miss for some. As while it is by no means awful it's certaintly nothing to write home about.

Beautiful graphics and detail. 9/10 would buy again.\n\nI first purchased the game because the cuteness got me. I was not disappointed. It was quite adorable with a sweet storyline that you uncover as you go. While it is a bit short, it isn't half bad compared to other indie games out there. Especially since it is (i think) the company's first game. But, lets get to the niddy-griddy.\n\nPros:\nIt was fairly easy to dive into, you don't have to deal with a tutorial. The graphics are quite beautiful and interesting. The story was good, if not a bit obvious to me. However, it is the characters that make the story, not the story itself. Voice acting was pretty good as well.\n\nNeutral Statements:\nThe main menu was a bit odd, since it didn't say what each thing was and was only an Icon. But that isn't anything major. (The menu itself was good looking too) There wasn't much combat, and most of it was easy once you got the controls down. The puzzles are relatively easy if you think about them for a few minutes, but as a game that can easily be rated E, thats to be expected.\n\nCons:\nIt was short. Took me roughly 1.5 hours to complete. (But, for $8, i feel i got my moneys worth) There is a lack of replayability, as once you complete it nothing really changes from each playthrough, unless you miss crystals going through the levels. (but then again, almost every game has almost 0% replayability for me anyway, lol) The "flying" stuff is kind of wonky. It can be hard to use if you aren't prepared.\n\nHonestly, i'm excited to see where they go from here and look forward to the company's future games. I can easily give it a 9/10.","February 2, 2015","true","1.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

The visuals are a muddy mix and match. I can appreciate the protagonist having flat textures that go well with the anime style, but the same effort should have gone in to the rest of the game. Everything else is bland, muddy and really low-res. Keep your distance from walls and objects, they're absolutely hideous up close.\n\nThe controls are responsive (excellent controller support) and you're given a reasonable moveset, but that doesn't matter when the levels are filled with bugs and holes, automated objects that don't work as intended, annoying invisible walls where they shouldn't be and a lack of walls where they should.\n\nI don't see myself recommending this game to anyone unless the developers double up the time and effort they've put in to this.

The character models are well done. The actual maps are somewhat simple but that adds to the charm.\n\nMusic: I'm not sure how many tracks the game had, but what was there was peaceful and didn't take away from the aesthetic.\n\nGameplay: Puzzles: The puzzles were not very challenging but were fun and invoked a little thought non-the-less.\n\nVoice Acting: The game for the most part is completely voiced. It's nice to see in a game this small.\n\nNeutral:\nGameplay:  Combat: While combat is smooth and well done it wasn't used much or very exciting. That's fine the game was more about the puzzles anyway. Only thing that felt sort of wrong was no inclusion of being able to attack while in the air.\n\nCons:\nStory: The story wasn't so bad when seen from the character's perspective, but the the story told from the narration was semi weak. It's alright, but don't expect too much of a grand tale.\n\nVoice Acting: While it's nice to see voice acting... I'm trying to say this without offense to the VA(s); I believe they had the talent to make the character's enjoyable. I'm not fond of the way the characters speak(accent given to them). It was actually sort of painful for me, and definately hurt my experience with the game. If you play the game you'll understand what I mean.\n\nTL;DR:\nIt's a short, fun, cheery little platformer with peaceful music, decent combat system, and voice overs that would have been the icing on the cake if only they had chosen a better accent for the characters.","January 30, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Struggling to prove herself, she takes off to the fabled Skytower to defeat the evil Witch. Travel through the Skytower, full of beautiful scenery and mysteries to be unraveled if you are willing to search.\nWith the rise of indie games in the last few years, platformers have made a comeback as a popular choice for Indie Devs. A mixture of nostalgia, ease of coding, and a lot of different things to do with it make it a genre that fits right in that niche. The nostalgia isn’t restricted to game devs either with some of the games like Shovel Knight becoming big hits with retro graphics and high difficulty.\n\nForward to the Sky, while an action platformer, is not left with retro style graphics or a high barrier of difficulty. While many Platformers have been using old style graphics, Forward to the Sky uses an anime inspired art style and some very talented artists to create some excellent looking areas.

Crystals are obtained from enemies or smashing statues. Enemies range from melee, range, and magic and come in different levels themselves: minion, veteran, boss (not official names). With the simple combat it means for some groups you'll have to employ strategy to defeat a group at times as you cannot replenish lost life in a level and later groups can mob you to death if you just rush in blindly.\n\nIt's a quirky fun game but once you full clear the six levels there isn't much reason to go back to it, still I had a lot of fun with the game and can recommend it.","February 10, 2015","true","1.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The entire game takes place on "The Tower." The Tower is a collection of blocks hovering in the air, if you fall you die.  Don't worry too much about falling though cause you will be respawned and flown back in to someplace nearish to where you fell.\nI honestly think that this game would have been more fun if it was a little more old school and sent you back to the start when you fall off the world. That said...\nMost of the puzzles are pretty striaght forward to solve. The more annoying ones are the timed jump "puzzles" but they are easily overcome since the game restarts you near to where you failed, or has a route you can take to retry it again and again till you get it right.\n\nSummary:\nTagging this game as an RPG is WAY off imo. For starters, there is no character development or anything of that nature.  It's a pure 3D platformer in an anime style.  It is easy to play through the game in about 2 hours if you are not looking to collect all the crystals. This is where the game makes up for its short play through time somewhat, but for 8USD its not overpriced.","February 8, 2015","true","2.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Graphically the game is sound, and the music does a good job of propelling the atmosphere and the momentum through the story. The game is based around climbing a tower, and there are only six levels to the tower, making the total game time between 1 1/2 and 3 hours. As you ascend the tower, you collect crystals on each level that drop from killing monsters or solving a puzzle.\n\nThe gameplay is simplistic, and what combat there is, is not the selling\npoint of this game.  You are given the option to kill all the enemies, or bypass them, if that is not your thing.  You can make your own path if you wish\nto.  I feel that the story was overdone, and a lot of it is unnecessary filler.\nWhen the dialogue happens, the text takes up a large portion of the screen and limits your view.  That coupled with  all the extra story got to be annoying.\n\nWhat makes this story interesting is the level design.  Each level offers\nnew, interesting mechanics, making each level unique and keeping the player\ninvolved.  It keeps the gameplay fresh.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vsonic128/recommended/333250/","vsonic128","vsonic128","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vsonic128/","53 products in account","TL;DR? Forward to the Sky is a charming, but short, puzzle action-adventure that's definitely worth the small price tag, especially if you have fond memories of older-school Playstation and Dreamcast action-adventure titles (^-^)\n--\nI've just pulled myself away from playing this after having played a bit of the 5th Chapter of the game. 5 of 6, so that's a little bit of a bummer. But it's a bummer simply because the game is fun, well-made and good-looking, and I totally would love to play more of it. On the flipside, this is one title that definitely won't be cloggin up your Steam backlog; this is a title that you will actually finish :)\n\nSo it's short; that's not necessarily a bad thing. What matters is if it's good, and Forward to the Sky certainly is. As a rookie effort from a small studio, this is a very well made game. They do a lot with a little, and despite only having 6 chapters, every chapter introduces new mechanics that mix up the style of gameplay. One brings in elevators and fan-platforms (jump on the blades), another will bring wind that pushes you around and "air gates" for you to ride in, the next will bring in crystal prisms that shoot lasers around to activate hidden platforms and stairs, etc. These things do a great job of changing the platforming gameplay & puzzles from Chapter-to-Chapter.\n\nThey also do a good job with the limited art assets, changing the time of day/skybox/lighting to make the Tower levels look... well as different as you can, even though the assets are pretty much identical throughout. It's just amazing what a change of lighting can do. It's not as varied as a bigger production, but for what it is, it's very smart and well-done.\n\nThe combat is the most simple part of the game. It's not bad; it's almost like a 3D Secret of Mana or classic Zelda title. You have a simple combo, and then a charge attack (which you can also combo). The depth comes from handling the different types of enemies, which they do manage to mix up as you proceed to the game. So there's enough enemy variety here to make the encounters feel fresh Chapter-to-Chapter. They have guys that fire arrows, shielded foes that use charge attacks, sorcerers that can freeze you in ice if you get too close with a wave of their wand, etc. They introduce a new unit every Chapter, and fighting different combinations of them is engaging. There's definitely a little bit of strategy here; trying to pull some guys away so you can take them out before projectile-users start firing on you from across the map, or rushing in and trying to kill the archers before they become a nuisance... and how best to take on a bigger enemy one-on-one; can you get a combo in before they wreck you, or should you try to get their rhythm down, and doing hit-and-run tactics instead? That sort of things. It's old-school, and it does it's job. It's engaging enough without getting monotonous. Besides, combat is there but it's not really the focus; it takes a back seat to the puzzle-platforming.\n\nThe worst part of the game (which isn't that bad overall) does affect the platforming though, which is a tad floaty. The physics though, they're not that much of a problem - a floaty jump is fun and forgiving in most cases, and that rings true here. What's awkward is that jumping will KEEP YOU jumping in that direction until you change direction in mid-air. So for a game with some precision jumps (especially in the Second Chapter with the fan-platforms), you end up doing this silly move where, to land your jump accurately, you pass over your platform and then start quickly moving in a tiny circle in mid-air so as not to overshoot as you wait a beat for your fall to actually drop you on your destination. It's never really putting you in serious risk (if you DO fall from the Tower, the Princess will summon her Hot Air Balloon to catch her and plop her close by to where you fell), it's just a little less polished than you'd hope for.\n\nPlus, oddly enough, while the lighting is good overall, there is no shadow underneath the character. The oldest-school trick in the 3D gaming book to help with this sort of thing. Weird.\n\nBeyond that though, I honestly have no issues with the game. I mean, it's fun. It looks good. It sounds good. It's got a simple, cute story (with simple, cute voice acting). And it's a really well designed, very small production that successfully hearkens back to the age of really charming Japanese action games. It's like someone took the design principles for titles like Threads of Fate, Tenerezza, Gurumin, Dual Hearts, Dawn of Mana, Brave Fencer Musashi, even Dark Cloud and decided to make a new game like that with modern tech. Which is awesome! It's just short and doesn't feel quite as good as you'd like it to.\n\nBut make no mistake about it, I'm definitely recommending it! Plus, $7 is not that much for a fun experience and to support a promising developer, especially if you have anything in your Steam Wallet to knock that down even further. It could be $6, $5 or even lower for you. So don't let the length dissuade you if you enjoy titles like those I just listed. This game will definitely entertain you and charm your socks off, just like games used to do (^-^)\n\nHighly recommended. Very fun. AnimuGames is a small developer to watch in the future, for sure!","January 30, 2015","true","2.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

On her way, she has to fight her way past  enemies and solve puzzles in order to unlock the passage to the next floor of the tower as well as the "full story", with more lines getting added the more crystals you collect in every stage.\n\nThe game is quite charming both in terms of visuals and sound; both add quite a lot to the feeling of being high up an uncountable amount of feets up in the air. However, this doesn´t mean that it´s impressive from a technical point-of-view: It looks very low-res and without much detail, and the only thing that stands out a bit (outside of its style) is the destructibility of the terrain: Most pillars, bricks, stone piles and even some walls can be destroyed with your sword, even possibly hurting you in the process if you aren´t careful. Soundwise, it needs to be said that the voice acting, while not exactly terrible, feels very amateurish as well: While I personally had no problem with it, this may be a downer for others. Controls for the most part are fine, though a bit too floaty and not always as precise as they should be. Combat controls are very simplistic, with two kinds of attack and a parry move; the latter one being kind of useless though (you´re better of just jumping out of the way).\n\nGameplay-wise, each stage consists of platforming, hitting switches, finding specific statues and defeating enemies, neither of which is particularly difficult even if you aren´t used to platformers in general. Each stage also has one or two unique gimmicks (like boulders that you need to roll on, or lasers that you need to dodge with the right timing) that aren´t reused in other stages, as well as one or two new enemy types. You can´t fall to your death (your trusty hot air balloon will always catch you), but you can die in battle or by getting hit from obstacles; if that happens, you have to restart the stage from scratch, so keep that in mind. Even then though, you will rarely get stuck, and no stage should take you longer than 15 to 20 minutes to complete.\n\nConcerning the length: It´s a very short game and should not take more than two hours to complete. The only kind of collectible are crystals that you need to collect in order to unlock new story passages, and they can only be found by killing enemies and destroying hidden statues. Some of those statues are fairly well hidden, but nothing you can´t find on your first try. Otherwise, there is no replay value, no hidden bonus stuff or unlockables. Having said that, I found those two hours to be quite enjoyable and entertaining. Still, its price point (8 $) may be a bit steep for it´s overall content.\n\nOverall, I would I recommend the game. If you feel that its price is too steep, wait until a sale occurs: At a lower price, I wholeheartily recomment it.\n","June 13, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Kinda like those wordless instructions that come with all sorts of things these days so they don't have to bother to translate it into a hundred different languages.\n\nBut that's just the menus, surely the gameplay is ok, right? No, not really. Moving and attacking are mutually exclusive, you can't interrupt your attacks to dodge and you can't attack while in the air, which makes combat frustrating. It isn't very clear what counts as an enemy attack either. There's also no sense of "flow" between one bit of the level and the next - there's a bunch of typical platformer segments in there, moving spike puzzles, moving platforms, lever puzzles, box-pushing puzzles oh and bits of combat - but it's like they were put in willy-nilly rather than creating any sense of progression or building on earlier elements.\n\nOh, and when you run out of HP? There's no game over animation or anything to tell you you died, you just go to one of those wordless menus that looks more like a pause screen than a game over screen.\n\nAll in all the whole game feels like a 3D version of what a bored 14 year old might make in Game Maker.

If you can look past the simplistic combat and visuals, you can enjoy a fine, although short, puzzle platformer with a child's tale that will put a smile on your face if you have a heart.\nThe puzzles are fine (especially level 4, it was beautiful), but you can figure them out quickly. Combat feels like it's "just there" and I wouldn't mind if the game had more/harder puzzles in its place, although it would contradict the story about a princess who went to defeat the witch.\n\nJust one major complaint: it's hard to control the character in a straight line with an analog pad, because movement is not analog (you either move or don't, there's no slow and fast movement) and the deadzone is like 0%. So unless you press forward exactly straight, the character will move diagonally, making platforming more difficult than it should be. In the end I opted for mouse and keyboard and it was very good.","January 27","true","2.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It follows the story of a Princess who explores the Sky Tower to learn what happened to it and reclaim the crystals. It's a nice, relaxing game with good music and pleasant, vibrant visuals. The game is 6 levels long, and will keep you occupied for about two and a half hours. The combat is very basic with a strong attack, light attack and a dodge, but that's really everything you need. The jumping is good overall but changing direction in mid-air moves Princess a bit further than you'd like to, making precision jumping difficult at times. But the game is forgiving enough that it never really becomes an issue.\n\nThe meat of the game is in the puzzle platforming, and it's pretty good at that. Every level introduces new mechanics and presents you with interesting puzzles. None of them are especially taxing though, so don't expect taking hours on finding the solution to a puzzle. The only disappointment was that the game never really put all the different mechanics together to make a truly diabolical puzzle, preferably for the final level.\n\nOverall though, I really enjoyed this game. It's a good, relaxing game with a cute story and mechanics that don't overstay their welcome. People looking for a long or difficult game might want to look elsewhere, but those who want a fun disctraction for a few hours should definitely take a look at this game.","August 1, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a game for you. The art style is beautiful, the levels are fluid, and it can serve as a nice little distraction from a rough day.\n\nJust be warned that it is short, very short, 83 minutes for me from start to finish with a minute or two trying to find the quit button (a little lost amongst all the beautiful visuals, but I'm not complaining).  It was an enjoyable experience, but it really leaves you right after you start getting comfortable. Besides the length, the story is really simplistic and predictable, and the final boss can hit you like a brick considering the combat mostly takes a back seat throughout the other levels.\n\nAll in all, very polished and might be worth picking up on a sale, but because of the incredibly short length of the game and lack of replayability it is hard to say it is worth full price.

If you are looking to explore fully 1 thing that got me is it doesn't explain that you get hints of statue locations due to the light blue glow they give off. This glow can be seen through objects. I could've not been paying attention during the begining. Controls were pretty well done tho it took a short while to get use to the animations. With no lock on feture when fighting combat gets a little weird but the evade button seems to fix this if you line up incorrectly.

The soundtrack fits the game very well but the songs will get old if you get stuck or your trying to figure out how to get all the crystals.\n\nThe artwork and animation is just ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. It looks so cute and smooth.\n\nThere are some moments that will make you go "Wtf, what do I do" but you won't be stuck like that for long because the enviroments are very straight-forward and tightly packed.\n\nIt's a very solid 8/10 for me.\n\nWhat I'd suggest to improve it:\n\nThere were a lot of glitches, but none of them were gamebreaking. A couple of them you also have to actively look for in order to see. One in particular is if you come at a box on it's corners it gets pushed in both directions making it spazz out and go a lot more forward a lot faster then normal.\n\nSome of the enemies were extremely annoying and kind of OP. Particularly the guys that make the crystal barrier.It's not hard to get down what you have to do against them, you have to totally focus on them before any one else. Otherwise you'll waste a lot of time or actually end up dieing, which almost nothing else in the game will kill you except them.\n\nThe mechanics weren't quite that smooth. The boulder rolling and the low-gravity sequences were very hard to control at times. (Though thankfully it wasn't so god-aweful that it caused me to die.)\n\nI was expecting another level to put everything I learned through the rest of the game to the test. Instead, I got level 5 that introduced some new things then straight to the ending boss battle that used nothing from the rest of the game.\n\nFinally, I'd love to see combinations between the LMB and RMB attacks and the combat to be more interesting. Most of the enemy AI was extremely simplistic and the combat was only button-mashing. You didn't even need the second attack function unless you were getting a bit impatient. You also did not need the Backwards dash.","January 31, 2015","true","2.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

It's extremely simple and a bit short (got all secrets and achievements on the first try), but lots of fun, definately worth it. It has some well-thought puzzles and a good challenging final boss at the end. The main character is super cute, and the little skeleton monsters are quite charming also. 9/10 Totally recommend.\n\nIt is quite atypical for an RPG in that there is no way to restore your health unless you start your current level over. What you start with is all you get for the whole level. But, the controls can be learned quickly enough that you probably won't fall victim to each enemy type's attack more than once. I wish it had better audio quality on the voices, and unlockables like perhaps a bonus level, alternate outfits, higher difficulties, etc. but for that price, I'd say you're getting more than you're paying for.\n\nBesides, everyone, deep down, somewhere in their heart, is a little princess with a big sword searching for crystals through an ancient ruin floating in the sky.

It's a short (~1.5 hours) light-hearted puzzle platformer game.\n\nEvery level has its own theme and implements specific gameplay mechanic, which keeps the game fresh until the end. The story is presented both in-game through conversation as you progress through the levels  (they do not interrupt the gameplay) and through short picture/text presentation at the end of each levels.\n\nYou can complete each level simply by reaching the balloon at the end but you really should try to get the 100 crystals hidden in every level (25 from monsters, 75 from 3 statues). You're rewarded with additional story bits when you do so.\n\nAt first It seemed like this game was too simple and kind of lackluster but as I cleared each level, my opinion changed completely. I just kept going forward compelled to hear more audio interactions between the princess and the witch and to discover and toy with the new mechanics of each level.

Not worth picking up for any of those categories alone, but hey the anime aesthetic is here if that's what you're into. (You can even look at her panties, if you're into that kind of thing)\n\nSome of the later puzzles are actually quite clever (meaning, they take a bit of thinking but aren't frustratingly difficult), and the puzzle mechanics are kinda fun, like rolling around on top of giant boulders. However, the game is designed poorly to the point that performing the right solution to puzzles can feel like you're playing the game wrong. It feels like it shouldn't work and you've found a way to cheat the game.\n\nControls are annoying to use, especially in battle, and the script and voice acting is downright hilarious.\n\nOn the plus side, the devs are very responsive and will try to help with any issues you are having (my camera kept spinning wildly and they gave me advice on fixing it, in the steam forums).\n\nI'm going to click recommend because I enjoyed it, but  only pick this up (on sale) if you really like platforming games (like me) and/ or anime, and want to scratch that  itch.

That's pretty much what you'll be thinking when Level 1 loads up. Nice air balloon floating through the sky, some dainty ancient stones floating around the place, you being a chibi knight with a huge ♥♥♥ sword (Riven's daughter?). Almost worth the price just for those sort-of-nostalgic graphics, reminiscent of Shadow of the Colossus in its scale.\n\nThen you get to the first mobs, and you start fighting. This is where the game falls off. Your attacks are pre-determined, sequential swipes, and with every mouse click, there's another swipe in another direction that follows a certain pattern depending on how many swipes in a row you've done.\n\nProblem is, the first three swipes go in one direction, then the fourth swipe becomes an inexplicable backwards swipe that leaves you open for an attack from a mob in front of you. Same thing happens again and again. You end up fighting in a manner which is not exactly tailored for directional combat, and you have to turn your mouse awkwardly to try and catch everything.\n\nPuzzles are not hard to figure out, though the lack of heals might lend a little trepidation to any new players of the game. The traps, around which most of the puzzles revolve, are often clustered together, and one mistake has the potential to cost you around 200 life (1/5th of your starting 1000 life). As the mobs get harder, and the mechanics stay the same, it simply becomes a difficult game to navigate.\n\nGiving it a 5.5/10 for the graphics. Voice acting sounded overly-dramatized, though at least the actress tried to sound cute. Without the graphics… this game could use some polishing.

One. It will bore its way into the farthest reaches of your mind, preying on your every happy memory until you are nothing but a shell of the person you were before.

There's no such thing as repetition and lazy level design here.\n\nThe combat isn't the biggest part, yet it's done pretty well too. You have two attack types with advanced combo moves, there are walls and pillars that you can use for cover or you can smash them apart and hit enemies on the other side with falling chunks of rock.\n\nMain downside is the length of the game, especially since it makes you want to play some more. Other problems are rather typical for smaller games - like sometimes a bit unpredictable collision detection, few unimportant graphical glitches and rather oversensitive controls for my taste, especially mid-air.\n\nTl;dr: You will probably finish this game in a single run, but it will be a very enjoyable one if you like the genre.","April 27","true","3.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

At one point there is this random purple ♥♥♥♥ that knocks you off the platform and the only way to bypass it is to just walk against it and pray. Most of the time, you are left just repeating the same action, as there is literally no other way, until magically the game decides that it will let you get to the next platform.\n\nNot only that, but the combat is absolute trash. When you have to fight something, it feels like they tried to "spice it up" a bit and just add a lil skeleton dude that you hit once and it dies.\n\nOh, and did I mention there is no saving mechanic? On top of having little to no controls or options, the game decides when your checkpoints are. Again, I have no problem with this as most platformers have their own checkpoint system, but this one is unforgiving. I could go so far and even have to sit through an entire dialouge section, and then fall off the cliff and respawn 3 years earlier.\nI had such high hopes for this game, but was throughly let down.\n\nAnd before anyone says "it's only $8 don't be so harsh", I know and have played plenty of other low-budget indie games, but not putting in at least SOME effort to make it good is unacceptable.","December 21, 2015","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

See the score I gave it here: http://gamewalkers.com/games/forward-to-the-sky/review/\n\nWords:\n\nIt’s easy to get the details wrong. If I told you that this game only lasted an hour and a half, you would probably immediately think that I was saying it wasn’t worth the $7.99 price tag. That’s not necessarily true. I do think you should be hesitant but I will get to that.\n\nForward to the Sky is about a princess who’s eager to prove herself. Everyone thinks that she can’t handle herself and so, to do this, she has set off on an adventure to defeat the evil witch that has taken control of the Sky Tower with nothing but her sword, her wits, and, of course, her hot air balloon. It’s a charming story about getting the details wrong, details you uncover by collecting crystals that hold memories of the place they reside in. It’s a largely predictable story but a charming one, nonetheless.\n\nThis story is brought to life by a great 3D anime style and some rather good voice acting done by one or two people. Don’t worry, the voice acting is all in English. And yes, it is good. I was actually pretty shocked by the overall production values. The game is clearly an indie effort, as the gameplay is simple, and it consists of only six levels, but the author(s) made a clear effort to make it look and sound the best they could within the confines of their budget.\n\nThe gameplay wasn’t lucky enough to get such polish. For starters, the combat is incredibly simplistic. With an awkward dodge and no way to block, the only way to really go about things is to brute force it by taking out any long-ranged opponents, or mages, in later levels, and then taking out any melee opponents by simply beating them up and dodging back whenever they go to attack. This may not be ideal, depending on how many melee opponents are attacking at once, however, and it can eventually turn into a mess of jumping around, trying to take out whoever you can whenever you can. With only two combos that vary solely based on how many times you hit their respective button, it gets old fast. I was extremely grateful that enemies seemed to be limited to 25 crystals-worth per level, with larger enemies giving you three. Considering the limited amount of attacks and the fact that most players who even sort of figure it out will have more health than they need, meaning they will almost never be at risk of dying, it easily starts to feel a bit like a chore. You don’t ever feel like you’re in danger and the larger enemies can take a long time to take down.\n\nThe gameplay isn’t the most polished, either. The AI are extremely dumb, mostly just chasing after and attacking you in a very slow fashion. Archers are dimwitted and shoot at a location you haven’t been at for about five seconds. If they can’t reach you by pathfinding across a flat surface, melee enemies will kind of dance back and forth in place until they can. If you jump onto certain platforms that act as elevators, rather than just walking onto them, you will fall through them. There are some layering issues on one level where platforms have to be activated by hitting crystals with projectiles. There are a lot of clipping issues in terms of platforms that aren’t in one place permanently There are way too many places you can get to unintentionally by falling off of a level. There are some audio issues when a sound is played repeatedly. In short, there are a lot of little issues that add up to a less polished feel.\n\nFortunately, the puzzles and platforming make up for that. Every single level is themed around a different set of objects and mechanisms that are used to both reach statues that give you crystals when destroyed and get to your hot air balloon to end the level. There are 100 crystals in total on each level and each statue gives you 25. There end up being three statues per level and, while not mindbending, the puzzles do take some thought. Most are relatively isolated, though, and only give you as much as you need to solve the puzzle, rather than putting you into situations where you can mess up by altering something further back than the puzzle you’re on. In fact, the game really doesn’t allow you to mess up at all, as it has a generous checkpointing system for when you fall off the level, the hot air balloon somehow catching you and dropping you off at a nearby platform. I don’t know what happens when you die but I assume you just restart that level.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are rather varied in nature. One second you’re flipping switches to align things correctly or to set up elevators in the right places and the next you’re walking on a boulder, trying to avoid lasers. Once you’ve left a level, you have left behind that kind of puzzle and an entirely new kind is headed your way. The amount of variety is extremely welcome due to the fact that it is a short game. It would have made a lot less lasting of an impression on me if I were solving the same kind of puzzle repeatedly for an hour and a half, especially when you consider that only five of the six levels are puzzle levels. The last one is a boss.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, it is really hard to recommend Forward to the Sky. It is a charming game with an entertaining, if predictable, story, and it has quite a lot of puzzle variety but it just isn’t substantial enough. It’s a mere six levels, set in scenery that feels the same from level to level, that might take you two and a half hours if it takes you a while to figure the puzzles out. It would be much easier to recommend if it were twice that. Unfortunately, it is not.\n","January 30, 2015","false","1.4"," 32 of 70 people (46%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","46","32","70","6","0"

I played it for about an hour before I had to go somewhere, so this is what I felt in that hour. I first saw it on Steam and thought it was super kawaii so I bought it. No argument there, its pretty kawaii. 10/10. I usually know what to expect from anime games on Steam so I didnt have too high expectations for the gameplay. The gameplay was shockingly good for what I was expecting. The puzzles were interesting, and you get to smack these skeleton things with your sword so its a puzzle platformer with a twist kind of. 8/10. Now, Im not sure if this game was made by some company that actually makes games, or if it was made by a group of game developers, but the voice acting was really bad. She kind of just says the same stuff over and over again then the witch girl does the same stuff over and over again. I almost wanted to just turn off the sounds. 5/10 Im going with 5/10  and not 2/10 because Im giving them the benefit of the doubt becuase Im pretty sure it wasnt by any big company. So overall, I guess it is a well-spent 7 bucks, the game is cute and the gameplay is interesting. Voice acting aside, I will put this game at 7/10.

I'm glad that every time you fall your balloon will bring you right back without losing life.So there's that and  the other things mentioned above that I like about this game.The things that I don't like are as follows. Now I am using a controller which is the way for me in about every game I play. I don't know if it's different on the keyboard and mouse but it seems to take forever to turn you're character around. There is the option to press a button to have her look in the direction she is facing so at least there's that. I hate that there's no checkpoint or at least any healing items in the levels. I get that that's part of the challenge but it would be nice to get a freebie here and there.\n\nOverall it's a decent game. If you can get it for a discount then that's the way to go. It's just how it makes me feel.","April 3, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Needs a bit of polish, but if you like light-hearted games, hack n’ slash games, puzzle games, and/or platformers this game is definitely worth the money.)\n\nPRO:\n- Lots of gameplay elements; puzzle, hack n’ slash, and platforming.\n- All gameplay elements are very well done.\n- Fun, cute little story.\n- Good visual style.\n- Good music.\n- Adorable dialog/voice acting (it’s not good, but it’s charming in how silly and earnest it is).\n- No recycling; every level introduces new challenges and enemy types.\n- Interesting mechanic of having to gather items on each stage to reveal more of the story.\n- Full voice acting in-game.\n\nCON:\n- The combat could be deeper.\n- The lack of a lock-on or ability to adjust mid-strike makes the directed attack all but useless; the game is essentially just one-button combat with the wide area attack.\n- The dodge sends you flipping backwards relative to where your character is facing, not the direction you push the left analog stick/what movement key you hit.  This makes the dodge useless as you can’t see where you are dodging and often go flipping off of a ledge.  My advice is to just jump out of the way instead.\n- It’s a bit hard to explain, but your character is sort of “floaty.”  It’s almost like she is TOO responsive; trying to land on some of the smaller platforms will often result in her running off them as you try to just adjust yourself slightly.  Maybe this had something to do with me using a controller instead of the keyboard. Regardless, my advice is to stop touching the stick/keys the moment you are about to land.\n- VERY short: I was able to 100% complete it in less than two hours and in just one run.\n\nOverall it’s a fun little game with lots of features and a sweet story.  My only complaints are that the combat is rather shallow and it is way too short.  It should be noted that there are many bad games out there that are “anime-like.”  For those games it’s clear the developers made them that way simply because they knew people would gobble them up.  That is not the case with this game; when you play it you really get the sense that Animu Game cared about their project.  Honestly, I recommend buying this game at full price like I did.  Hopefully with more money their next game can be a bit deeper and much longer.","March 14, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It serves as a simple framework for the gameplay.\n\nThe world itself is also quite simple, somewhat repetative, and it's easy to spot several places that need more work to make the gameplay more understandable and intuitive, specially with some of the puzzles. The fighting mechanics are crude yet they do their job. The game easily makes you feel there is a lack of something but if you focus on having fun it is very enjoyable. Let's just say it's easy to point out places worth improving upon. Yet this doesn't disgourage me, it makes me think of how fun it could really be with some more work.\n\nThere are a lot of interesting features and elements to this game that make it fun to play through, it packs a nice 2-3 hours of easy fun with varied tasks that offer their own unique challenges. Nothing too complex but not too simple either.\n\n\nAll in all I would recommend this game if you are looking for something to play around with without taking it too seriously. It gives the impression of being a basic app-game for a tablet type platform, yet left unpolished and slightly lacking. Treat it as such and you'll have fun.\n\nIs it worth the price? No. You get a game that feels unfinished and rough with several lacking elements.\n\nShould you still buy it despite of this?

The camera is INCREDIBLY twitchy if using a mouse. If you play this you are going to want a controller or you're going to have to slow mouse movement to a literal crawl manually.\n\nI understand this is more a puzzle game than a fighting game but the combat system is horrible. You can't swap between light (swing) and strong (thrust) attacks mid combo. You're locked into the animation until it finishes... which is not an issue for the basic trash mobs but very bad for the "boss" mobs. The puzzles are simplistic, you're not going to get stuck on any of them. The timing of the traps are odd, and while they should not kill you they are going to hit you a lot.\n\nThe voice acting is cringe worthy. The characters sound like little kids playing pretend. The main character is assumably at least a teenager, and the witch should be an adult but they sound, and act, much younger than they should be. You can tell the story is supposed to sound semi-serious but the writing itself sounds juvenile to the point of it could be badly written fanfiction... or again, little kids playing pretend.\n\nThe game IS pretty, very pretty.

At first I thought the game had potential, but when I actualy started playing the game I found out that it was riddled with bugs. For the combat system, the hit boxes are messed up, which makes it difficult to execute combat as visually it may look like you hit an enemy when you actually didn't. Enemies have mediocre attack animations that deal damage long before the animation even seems like it begins. The "puzzles" in this game are blatantly obvious, not adding any real difficulty. Overall, this game is definetely not worth $8 (maybe for one dollar or two) and you are better off spending it on another game that isn't a giant bug.\n\nPS: If you want to hit an enemy and deal damage, you basically have to hit them with the middle of the sword as the tip is completely useless.

The remainder of the crystals on each level are gotten by fighting crystal skeletons, and the mechanics for that are honestly pretty terrible. Thankfully, the game never requires you to get all that good at it, because there's a limited and rather low amount of enemies on each level.\n\nUltimately, it's also rather short - six levels, each of which can be completed rather quickly if you're just trying to finish them, and it only took me two hours to find all of the statues hidden in the first five. As such, the price (currently $8) feels a little high, and it ends up not really having much of a "draw" since there are plenty of other 3D platformers and cute anime-styled games out there, with this one not really boasting any unique features.","September 11, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat feels awfull. You can't stop an attack, it's really hard to change the direction of the attack, so you get easily attacked from the side.\n2. The guards do damage no matter what you do, if not attacked exactly from behind.\n3. The plattforming feels odd. It's all or nothing while movin midair.\n4. You can't run. I combined dash and jump, but when you press the rightkey twice you aren't moving further.\n5. The story is sort of ok-ish. not ok, that EVERYTHING of the story you collected while be read to you in the and again and I couldn't quit it. (Bug or is it a special key beside "Enter/Escape/Space/Strg/Shift/.....tried some more")\n\nSome pros:\n1. The artstyle is nice, just like the soundtrack.\n2. Some of the puzzles are quite nice to solve. Except the last angel on lvl 5 at which the stoneballs always glitched inside of each other and the lasergrid which I wouldn't get throw cause I was thrown back no matter how carefull I tried to go through. (I watched a yt vid and made the same as the person there and glitched through)\n3. It's fairly short. Pro because I wouldn't have been motivated to play it for more than the 100 Minutes (including all achievements, chatting a bit and starting this review).\n\nAll in al:\n\nNot worth the 7.99 it costs usually.

Sure not all games are perfect, all have its flaws.\nFirst of all, the pros, the game has an entretaning story and levels are all made differently and change in every way, quality and graphics of the games are good, and no bugs or glitches were found. Characters of the story had good voice recording and were cute, from all the levels i didn't have any trouble completing all of then, maybe it was too easy.\nThe bad thing is the lack of levels, i felt like i wasted to much money on the low time of fun it gave me, it took me 10 hours to get everything in the game, from level competion to archivements. The replay value is poor since once you complete a level its no good playing it again.\nBut overall, pick this up on a sale if you are way too bored of whats in your games library.","May 5","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles aren't too complex, but I did have to think about a couple of them.\n\nCombat is okay for the most part. It's mainly just the sword/shield guys that are hard to dodge. It does take a little getting used to. Controls could be a little better.\n\nI 100%'d it in under 2 hours, so it might be best to grab it during a sale.\n\nSeriously though, it's adorable. ;w;","May 2","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The camera is static and painful to use, combat use only two buttons corresponding to two sequences of attacks (one of which is almost completely useless) and she also feels very stiff when she's fighting. Once you've finished the 5 levels + final boss fight all there's left to do is to find the missing crystals to unlock the whole ridiculous story.\nOn the plus side, getting 100% achievements on this one is pretty easy and will take you a few hours hours only.\n\nI really don't get how this game has so many positive reviews. Did they get it for free or is the demand for pre-teen princesses slashing gem-ridden skeletons with giant swords really that high?

There are 6 levels and each of them brings new puzzles and gameplay mechanics so you don't get bored.\n\nGame is quite easy, took me an hour and a half to finish it completely (So short that I only had 2 out of 3 cards for the game. That's a bit of a shame because i won't really feel the nedd to play it again only to get the last card).\nNo sadistic achievement, and you can get everything in one playthrough.\n\nStory is very soppy though, texts are not incredible (Never heard the world "Witch" that many times :D) and voices are meh.\n\nSo this is a nice, relaxing little game and I sincerely hope that Animu will be able to make another one that will be even better.\nBut considering the time it took to finish and the rather common story, i'd say it's a bit overpriced and is worth 5-6€.","May 21","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
