No, don't think that the game isn't nice. The game is really awesome. There's an excellent storyline, funny dialogues (and monologues), difficult riddles, original characters, and awesome cutscenes. So, you're starting thinking why I said that it was hard for me to put a positive review? Because of the countless crashes! The game crashed so many times, that I seriously thought of unistalling it. The constant crashes were making it unplayable. Anyway, I managed to finish the game and if it wasn't for the crashes, I would give a 10/10. But now, I can hardly give a 6/10. Please, understand that, even though I love this game, all these crashes made me really frustrated.","February 28, 2015","true","6.7"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","9"

There are three playable characters: Ceville (the sniveling deposed ruler), Ambrosious the (hilariously) pompous knight, and Lilly (a cute little girl who has great banter with Ceville).  Sometimes you play multiple characters simultaneously, and there are points where you have to do one thing as one character, switch to another, and complete a task.\n\nNote that there are a few clearly-identifiable timed elements (a clock will tick) where you have to do something within, say, 10 seconds.  There are no failures that require a re-load, and you can save any time.  You can double-click to skip run animations, and you can hold the spacebar to reveal hidden objects.\n\nMost of the puzzles are quite fair and reasonable-- there were a few I had to get help with...which IMO is a good thing.  Many of the puzzles are combining inventory items in a (usually) intuitive way...and using dialog trees to open up new paths.\n\nAnyway, give it a try next time it's on sale!","April 11, 2014","true","16.9"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","26","32","0","0"

Characters are all stylized like caricatures, making them interesting and unique. Story is done largely from the eyes of the bad guy, a role that is interesting to watch be explored. Interface is familiar and easy to pick up quickly.\n\nCONS: Majorly-glitchy and has a tendency to crash. the 3D graphics don't look very good. Puzzles are far too easy. Dialogue is one-note and can be pointless often. Cringe-factor is present with some of the jokes.\n\nOVERALL: Ceville is unspectacular for a point n' click adventure, and not very well made as a game, but it's entertaining enough for a few hours of your time.\n\nSCORE: 6/10","March 9, 2015","true","4.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

For the most part I found it enjoyable. A lot of the humour was pretty cheesy, but they're well done and there's bound to be a few in there to make you laugh. To progress in the game, you have to play a few nasty pranks of some of the other characters which is always amusing. I was able to figure out most of the game myself, but thankfully there was a few good walkthroughs online for when I got really stuck. I guess my mind wasn't twisted enough to solve all the puzzles =P\n\nI recomend that you save fairly often though. The game was a bit buggy and it froze a few times.","September 13, 2015","true","9.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Starit/recommended/23460/","Starit","Starit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Starit/","780 products in account",""Ceville" is a classic Point & Click adventure, a comedy that follows the adventures of Ceville, former tyrant of a fantasy kingdom, now dethroned and searching for revenge, and a way to recover his throne. The main appeal of the story is the main character: this time, you control the villain, and it's a blast: Ceville is a really fun character, in his comical way. Forget about complex antagonists, with vague moral compasses and troubled backgrounds, because Ceville is just the epitome of the classic "Bad Guy". He twirls his mustache, hates good actions, is always rubbing his hands together and machinations perfidious plans, and he's deeply amused by other people's misfortune.\n\nIf you're used to the good ol' adventure games, you'll feel right at home in this game. Lots of witty lines of dialog, funny characters and tons of puzzles, around a game that doesn't feel too long or too short. The game isn't very hard, most of the puzzles can be solved through logic, and you can press "SPACE" to see every interactive element in the screen, so "pixel hunting" isn't even a factor.\n\nNow, for the cons, the biggest one: Game crashes a lot. At least, it did for me. During the second Act, when you get access to the Map, every time I pulled it out, there was a chance the game would crash to desktop, or just freeze, which made that part very annoying. There's no way to fix or avoid it, so if you're unlucky, all you can do is to be patient and load the game again every time it happens. It's quite telling that in a game where you can't die, the game auto-saves every 5 minutes, rotating through 10 different files.\n\nOther than that, while the writing is good, sometimes the humor relies on references too much. And the ending is really abrupt.\n\nBut other than that, I recommend it to any fans of the adventure genre, just be warned about the technical issues.","March 13, 2015","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is funny, traditional, and quite challenging in some parts.\n\nYou play mainly as a deposed king trying to regain his throne and his little assistant Lilly. The two travel through a very typical fantasy world and solve puzzles to advance the story. It's all quite charming.\n\nSome of the puzzles are very obtuse and while many of the solutions are satisfying, some left me saying, "Oh...that was....the solution?"\n\nThis game froze up constantly on Windows 7. It usually freezes up when traveling between map locations during the lengthy second chapter. Fortunately, the game autosaves every five minutes and F5 quicksaves. I got used to saving before traveling.\n\nIf you like typical adventure games, this one is a good one and should be played by anyone.

Ive seen people somteimes give bad reviews to games because they don’t like the genre. i dont particularly enjoy point and clicks and this game didnt exactly change my point of view, but i think it does an adequate job at what it is attempting","June 22, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Alas, it's the other way around. I was drawn in by its humor, but after completion, I was greatly turned off. The controls and navigation are a pain. I feel a lot of my time was wasted. The ending wasn't very good either. Why did I finish this? I didn't want to waste money as well and of course, that's just how I roll.","October 23, 2011","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The humour, the colours, the characters, the puzzles, the voice overs and everything suited me just fine, I found it funny and enjoyable. I enjoyed Ceville's character :D I guess it might not be the longest or the most difficult adventure game, but I personally kinda like it like that. Felt a bit like The Book of Unwritten Takes, though that game is a bit higher quality in basically every respect.\n\nA big con for Ceville is that it crashes a lot, as many have pointed out. Save often! I was about to give up at one point where the game kept on continuingly crashing over and over, but I found that if I muted all sound in the game settings I could play past the crash-point and unmute afterwards and continue just fine.","January 1","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They're very generic. Feels great playing as the bad guy and the innocent girl. The story is pretty predictable but I love the addition of fairy tales.","November 8, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nemeskericsaba/recommended/23460/","nemeskericsaba","Samick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nemeskericsaba/","57 products in account","Ceville is a funny, classic point&click game with medium difficulty. The graphics is fine, the dialogs are really funny.\n\nUnfortunatelly I experienced some technical issues. The game craches often, fortunatelly it has an automatic save system, it saves in every five minutes, so you dont have to play from the beginning, if you forgot to save. And I don't no why but I did not see some cutscenes. I heard the voices but the screen was black. I searched on the internet and it is a common issue, but did not find solution.\n\nI still recommend this game because if you did like classic Lucasarts adventures like DOTT, Monkey Islands, Sam and Max, you will like this one too.","March 14","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Take up the role of Ceville, a horrid little troll of a king, cast out from the throne on a bizarre and hilarious quest to regain power from the idiots who dared defy him. If Shreck amused you (And I mean back before it fell into the sequel pit), you'll love this game; it's a great sendup of fairytales, legends and beloved stories, with enough pop culture refrences thrown in to make me a very happy geek.","December 29, 2011","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Whenever I was stuck, I would wonder if something was bugged, or if I was just being stupid. Always turned out I was just being stupid. T.T If you're willing to overlook the bugs though, the protagonist's charm easily turns this game into a precious little gem.","May 8","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
