It has its quirks (no control in combat), but the replay is huge.  All the classes actually do play differently! The "Voice of El" collects relics from settlements and uses them to increase his holy bonus and gain (random) units from El in his settlements.  The more "seals" broken (7 in total for the world), the closer the world gets to El and the more powerful units you get for free.  You can also spend money to convert settlements to your faith.  Even if an enemy recaptures it, it'll still pay you money every year (in a lump sum)!\n\nThen there are the dwarves.  They lack any "standard" recruitment, but gain a free dwarf every turn birthed from your Dvala (whcih can't leave its mountain home).  You then spend iron to upgrade your workers.  You gain less gold from settlements, but more iron from mines.  Mines also yield gems to power rituals or further upgrae your troops.  The mountain-mines also count as citadels (recruitment centers) that you can install more Dvala's into (for more free troops).\n\nThe point is that the El faction will fight tooth and nail for large settlements to fuel their relic addiction, and while they need mines for higher-tier troops, its not critical for them.  Dwarves on the other hand, can't even collect relics.  They also get barely any gold from settlements but can't get enough iron/gems for upgrades.  Thus, its fairly typical for a dwarf  to ignore settlements and only take them away from other players.  Even if they capture a city, they can't recruit units out of it for defense (other than sporadic, expensive, mercenary options).  Nor can they upgrade their base workers in one.  So two factions that can' be bothered with the others' resource, and have their own mechanics for progress and expansion.  These are just two of the ~20 factions found in the game, too!\n\nAbout the combat though... while there is no real control, units still move about the grid and have varying ranges on their attacks.  They also try to fit in various ranks (front/middle/rear).  So you can have a cluster of rear-castesr that would otherwisse be secure behind two ranks of infantry.  However, if you think a few powerful frontliners are all you need, superior enemies can flank around them and gank your casters- this is particularly true for swarms of fast wolves.  Also, you can have infrantry ranks so thick that your archers can't fire over them, or casters that kill your own units with your spells! For the latter you have to turn those off, or only use resistant troops in the front ranks.  However, light frost damage ove the battlefield can be worth it if your enemy has tons of 3-4 hp fodder (goblins)... Your troops survive, they get decimated.  On the world map, they can have different move speeds and movement types.  So like in Age of Wonders, you can put together an amphibous army to attack from the coast-line, or a mountain-moving army able to quickly hit/run through a mountain range.  Also, some units are slow and others are fast.  So you can keep a quick mounted unit to scout/snatch locations from an enemy while your slow army makes the most efficient beeline to whatever the scouts found.  There is actually quite a bit of strategy involved in combat planning still... I really can't recommend this game enough to TBS fans!","November 18, 2015","true","148.0"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","33","35","0","0"

You claim different locations on the map and recruit or summon your armies to battle the neutrals or a player. The game is focused on combat which is really great because that gives more time to explore the huge database of creatures rather then spending time building cities up.\n\nThe map is played out tactically and when you go into combat it’s automatically played out which is good because big battles with scores of units would take forever if it were turn based combat.\n\nI am very happy with COE4 and I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of fantasy strategy games, this is a gem! 10/10!","November 16, 2015","true","9.6"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","31","38","0","0"

People who played CoE 3 and Dom 4 and those who havent.\n\nPeople who have:\n- All units and leaders have descriptions like Domions! This made me so happy. I love the lore in this game so this makes me much more engaged. Even better it is written from a Ethnocentric human empire wizard view. Calling Dwarves ants or mushrooms is hilarious.\n- The battle mechanics are greatly improved and closer to Dominions. Especially the fact that units can only hit units they are next too, so big units get ganged up on less.\n- Castle defense actually has walls, so you can hold land much easier than before. It also adds a seige dynamic that makes sense.\n- There are multiple demensions! 7 total demensions and they can invade the normal one, and you can invade them back. And then get lost in the void, go insane, and fight horrors until you die.\n\nFor those who havent:\n\n- The game is well drawn but not graphically advanced. It never bothered me. Think of it like an eletronic boardgame.\n- It is an adventure of a hero and his army. And everyone in the army can pick up the advanced weapon and be a hero. If that sounds cool to you this may be your game.\n- It is turn based so just be ready for it.\n- IF you like world mythology and factions based on that, this game may be cool for you too.","April 30","true","32.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","1"

The essential gameplay is very similar (identical) but the new battle system is a fantastic addtion. There's other new things, but there very specific...they all make the game a little nicer to play. If you like Illwinter's stuff you probably have already bought it. If your not familar, and like fantasy strategy games, I whole heartedly reccomend starting with Conquest of Elysium 4.\n\nOne of the things that Conquest of Elysium 3 did so well was making each faction feel unique to play. Conquest of Elysium 4 nails this too. A good way to illustrate this is to explain the different resources that factions need to collect and spend. All factions need gold and iron, collected from farms, towns and mines. Different factions require different components to cast their faction specific spells and special abilities. The demonologist, for example, needs blood from blood sacrifices (obtained from the unlucky town inhabitants), whereas the necromancer needs Hands of Glory (which are the pickled left hands of those hanged until death – collected from gallows and cemeteries), druids need herbs and troll shamans need fungi (both of which can be found in forests and jungles). Each faction needs towns and mines, but different factions will hunt out different sites of interest for their components. Druids will patrol up and down forests (being invisible to other factions while in them), controlling as much of the foliage as they can. Trolls don’t need the foliage of trees to get their mushrooms, so they can set the druids’ much-needed forests on fire. Demonologists will ignore the forests on the hunt for more towns while Necromancers will search out grisly gallows and cemeteries. The druids will flit through the trees, conducting their animal summoning rituals in secrecy while the other factions march around the forests in search of different goals. That is unless they don’t decide to set the forests on fire to clear the druids out.\n\nThe special abilities and spells of the factions also help to create the sense of uniqueness. The Druid will command a massive horde of summoned animals bolstered by bare-chested warriors and slingers – all with the ability to be invisible when surrounded by trees. The Troll King has the ability to not only regenerate, but to single-handedly pulverize small armies, his recruitable goblins die extremely easily though. The Troll King is also always joined by a Troll Mum, a troll shaman unhappy with her son’s ability at waging war. The Necromancer can summon large numbers of the undead for almost free, the only cost being to his sanity. Necromancers are able to cheaply amass a huge number of troops but will often refuse to move for a turn due to bouts of insanity. Conquest of Elysium 4 does an amazing job of translating the lore and personality of a faction into unique ways of playing the game.\n\nThe new battle system illustrates the clashes between these factions much better than the previous edition of the game. Rather than a black void, units now fight on a terrain appropriate square graphed map. Grass, rocks, snow, caves, and walled fortifications are represented. Units themselves are viewed from the top down and will move with respect to the other units and terrain conditions around them. Like the previous edition, the player has no direct control over their units. When a fight starts, the units are on autopilot, moving and fighting their way across the battle field. The only control the player has as a general is to decide which units are given to what movable commander. The system is elegant and refreshingly straightforward once you get used to it.\n\n(Parts of this Steam Review are taken from my review here: http://www.hbhud.com/2015/11/17/review-of-conquest-of-elysium-4/ )","November 17, 2015","true","29.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","3"

Formula is simple: player must gather army, gain control on resource spots and destroy all other factions. There is very simple economy, no construction, no even a sign of diplomacy and research. But there are many factions, units and spells, clashed in endless uncompromising battle.\n\nVariety of factions is the best part of Conquest of Elysium. Game has twenty factions, each of them has its own unique style and gameplay, they even require different resources. Just a pair of examples: while trolls roam the forest in search of fungi, humans are trying to burn the groves, for their armies forest is nothing more than an obstacle in path. Demonologists gather sacrifice, hoping to call powerful allies from Inferno. Priests of El convert settlements in right faith, while their leader seeks to bring the Apocalypse. Each faction plays differently and it is really good.\n\nMaps are randomly generated, considering a variety of factions and units it ensures that each new game will be different from previous. Game offers a large number of combinations, so it will not be boring.\n\nAI is decent. It is obvious that on higher difficulty levels AI receives bonuses, so he can collect very powerful forces. For me it was not easy to play with AI even on medium difficulty, game is challenging enough.\n\nUnfortunately, from my point of view, Conquest of Elysium is far from perfect. First of all, i do not have enough control of units. I can not design formation for my troops. In combat, units just rush forward and beat each other; in same time, valuable warriors such as mounted commanders or heroes are often in first lines, so they die in vain.\n\nWizards cast spells at random and it is impossible to predict what spell your magician will cast next turn. Will it be powerful attack, able to destroy half of the enemy squad, or it will be something completely useless? Random knows! I really want to see a system that allows to customize the formation and tactics of units. Such system is implemented in other game created by Illwinter - Dominions, and i hope to see something like that.\n\nBalance is not perfect too. A lot depends on the generation of map. If settlements are rare then human Baron or priests or El will be very weak, because they can not realize their full potential. If there is no forests, then trolls will not have enough resources to their powerful spells. Map generator can place a powerful monster right next to your capital and you can not do anything about it. And so on.\n\nAs for monsters. Neutral creatures, roaming around, can sometimes attack your settlements. This is not surprising, but i do not understand how lone deer can capture fortress. Even if there is no soldiers, but deers can not climb the walls, and why they need to attack fortress anyway? I may give advice to beginners: do not leave your capital unprotected, unless you want it to be captured by moose or snake or a band of hamsters from nearby meadow.\n\nA lot depends on luck. Your best wizard can be smashed by stone from a catapult during the minor siege of small fortress; your brave commander, leader of elite infantry squad, can decide that it is good idea to attack pack of wolves without waiting for footmen; puny serpent can poison your favorite dragon or giant... a lot of things can go wrong. Well, from my perspective, it adds some spice to the game.\n\nGraphics looks dated. In fact, i am calm about graphics, but... just imagine how great Conquest of Elysium would look with modern engine... well, this is just dreams.\n\nAnyway. Despite all flaws, Conquest of Elysium brought me a lot of pleasure, i want to play this game again and again. If you enjoy turn-based strategic games in fantasy style, i can safely recommend this game to you. Perhaps, Conquest of Elysium is not perfect; maybe it could be better; but it is very, very good.","November 29, 2015","true","32.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

I can't say any of the two classes really play the same, at all really, which is a plus since there's currently 20 classes.\n\nEarly game is a bit hard for certain classes, but if you can get through it, those factions usually become much much stronger later on than the ones that have an easier time early game, so risk vs reward... all it takes is one lucky hit for a troll king to be slaughtered in one blow, (open ended dice means that if you roll a 1d5 for damage, and roll a 5{maximum} a 5 will be added, you roll again, each consecutive 5 after this adds 4 {5-1} damage, which can stack infinitively, causing a possibility for a single levie/random miltia to slaughter a troll king/dragon in one blow...) which brings another point, this game is very heavily RNG based, don't expect to win every game even if you have a near flawless strategy and are in an overwhelming lead, something can happen that can turn the entire game around in an instant... Remember, it's a game, so play to have fun, even if a meteor strikes on your biggest army in the middle of nowhere, or a gate to inferno opens and your army is slaughtered by demons.\n\nI'd consider this game a turn-based warcraft if you will, much better mechanics involved here (if a descriptor says it does something, it does it... be sure to read certain descriptions, like for ghouls; if a ghoul feeds on another person, that person will also turn into a ghoul if they die, this isn't shown as an ability, but it's clearly depicted in the description.), all in all one of the best, definitely top 2 strategy games I've played, the other also being an illwinter game (Dominions 4), so if you love strategy and want a quick skirmish (though, games still do take the better part of an hour or three if playing on medium with 3 players;) then this is the game. Dominions 4 is better for longer games and has more management aspects overall, but I'd almost argue that the combat, though unable to be as finely tuned (with scripting spells and army order) is better here, since you can clearly see all units depicted on each of their own tiles, the visual noise isn't too crazy, you can see each and every target getting hit, and the combat log is full of information for each battle.\n\nhrm, getting a bit off track, not the best at writing reviews but yeah, definitely recommend this one,\n\np.s. the soundtrack is AMAZING, wish it came in mp3 or something so we could listen to it any time.","December 3, 2015","true","46.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

It works and is practically the same game minus the Illusionist class and the rituals that each caster gets in this game.\n\nGame Breaking Cons - Your main commander will run ahead of ranged units protecting him( even though he is a back rank unit that is supposed to keep his distance), just so he can melee units with his fists or staff. For those that don't know..if your commander is killed, you cannot move your army across the map anymore.\n- The new shiny battlemap screws up the AI to where if the map is filled with your large army, they wont move until enemies are within so many squares...making summoning mages/units very useless. If there is no space for them to exist in, they get spawned on the opposite side of the map...where they usually are killed..or may get lucky and kill the casters of the enemy due to this bug. On top of this, your army will eventually just stop and pile up at the front gate, barely maneuvering through the opening.\n- Siege weapons don't work if you have a big army that pushes them more than 20 squares back.\n- The AI on the strategic map will generally mill around and will not attack your main outpost, giving you nearly unlimited time to build up, you just need to avoid them long enough to eventually overpower them.\n- Your very precious faction command units will be offered for recruitment very rarely, even with magic libraries or increased chances of recruitment. This makes building a decent army hard...and very punishing if you lose them in the beginning.\n\nThe game looks much better (compared to CoE3) and could be really fun.

Some troops have better synergy than others. con - lack of control, pro - no micromanagement. Which matters more to you is pretty subjective depending on what you're looking to get out of the game.\n\nIt's random and you can get terrible starting positions or great ones. You'll get key troop offers when you need them or maybe not. If that happened in a 40 hour Civ game, it'd be annoying. In a few hour Civ-lite, it just means some runs are more challenging than others.\n\nIt's not really a rogue-like, but it has that feel to it.

I enjoyed CoE3 a lot and the sheer amount of new features in CoE4 is astounding.\n\nNew map gen system looks great. New combat system has made fighting more interesting since terrain/forts makes a difference. Getting stuck at the walls of a fort while archers (and that one pesky wizard you didn't notice) throw everything they got at you from on top of the walls can really put a damper on your plans.\n\nRandom starting rituals will help keep it interesting when you roll the same class again. And there's two new classes! Haven't tested them out yet since for the games that I've played so far I've used random classes.\n\nI really like the graphics. The font seems much clearer and easier to read than in CoE3. And the spell effects look great.\n\nI can't wait to play some more this coming weekend!

CoE has much less micro than dominions and plays a lot faster, but it isn't an easier game. It is true that CoE 4 is going through a lot of growing pains right now, but it is quite humbling how efficient Johan is at fixing things. I've reported a good handful of bugs and have seen most of them fixed. And at the same time, I can confirm that CoE 4 is a straight improvement over CoE 3 in most respects. It's more than worth every penny and I can highly recommend it. If you do decide to give it a shot, be mindful that it is made and maintained by pretty much two people. Attention to detail is kind of Illwinter's thing, and there happen to be a loooooot of details in this game, so missing a few of them is only natural. Most of the bugs or oversights aren't game breaking by any means and the game is a blast, even where it needs improving on.","December 8, 2015","true","25.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Think of yourself as the quartermaster/recruiter/eventorganizer\n\nYou don't fight, you don't lead, you just tell people where to go and give them troops and they do the rest!\n\nSo what is Coe4 exactly?\n\nIts a turn based strategy game where various players are competing to be crowned big boss\nThe gameplay itsself is quite simple, pick a class (these guys are each unique, some more so than others) You gather gold/iron/ and depending upon your class one of the following: Gems, Herbs, Mushrooms, Sacrifices, The severed hands of criminals as well as weed.\n\nThat's right weed, those cheeky hoburglar hopped up on some green stuff, no wonder their fat.\n\n\nIf you've sticked around for this long heres real talk.\n\nThis game fufiles a niche that is lacking in strategy games. While you can play it seriously you can also play it with a more laid back attitude, while their is some strategy and though required, for the most part the game is not balanced, their is a lot of variety and things you can do.\n\nThe gameplay itsself is quite simple to learn but complicated to master. While on the surface each class seems to be similar to several other in one way or another, their not.\n\nEach class plays drastically difference from each other has advatanges and disadvantages, as well as various unique abilitites beyond similarites, for example: The Senator, based off of Roman esque legionaries can declare himself the Emperor which gives him a few boons, no one else can do this, unless of course you encounter someone or a bot playing as the Senator and then proceed to take control of him :p\n\n---Now for my personal opinion\nTheir is a lot to be desired but I love this game for what it is: A laid back be a warlord stomp some face with your armies get conquered by deer because you forgot to leave a troop behind, reroll as a caster get mauled by a manticore on turn one, reroll again as a druid, off to a great start, what's this no special location to be able realize your full potential?\n\nThis game won't hold your hand, it is also not forgiving, but this game teaches you to learn from mistakes, to look to the future but also remember the present and most importantly scouts are not a luxury they are a necessity.\n\nSo yes I recomend it, but I also recomend if a friend has it, to play theirs, or to watch some videos on YouTube before buying simply because this game is not for everyone.","March 17","true","152.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Some points are just subjective but will do for most of the players which are fine with an OK grafic but good engine and alot content. Do not understand me wrong ... it's all about winning the current map. In any case the next game start with a new char from scratch.\n\n\n\nDE Review Version\nDas ist dann wohl mein erstes Review ...\n\nNachdem das Spiel in Steam aufgetaucht war und mein Interesse regte war ich mir nicht sicher warum hier ~20 Euronen aufgerufen werden. Also den Kauf abgebrochen nur um ihn 5 Minuten später doch zu tätigen. Natürlich war ich skeptisch was sich nun offenbaren würde:\n\n-keine spezielle Reihenfolge-\n\nPlus:\n+ Musik (die man den ganzen Tag durch hören kann *subjektiv*)\n+ Rollenspiel-Inhalte\nDetailreichtum der Beschreibungen\nPure Anzahl unterschiedlicher Einheiten (mit modernerer Grafik unmöglich)\nanlegbare Gegenstände (nur finden)+ Unterschiedliches Gameplay für jede Klasse\nVerschiedene Strategiemöglichkeiten um zu gewinnen für die meisten Klassen *subjektiv*\nKonter-Klassen verfügbar+ Komplexität der Spiel Mechanik\nviele Eigenschaften\ngroße Armeen möglich\nBeschwörung im Kampf\nVor-/In-/Nach-Kampf Berechnungen\nJahreszeiten / Klimabedingungen+ Karte\nprozedural generierte Karte\nMehrere Layer (6?) mit weiteren dedizierten AI-Spielern+ Spiel-Server Option (nicht getestet)\n\n\nNeutral:\no AI auf 'Jester' level (+/-0% Bonus) ist OK, andere Schwierigkeitsgrade habe ich bislang nicht\ngestestet *subjektiv*\no Schnellste Kampfgeschwindigkeitfastest könnte schneller sein (epische Kämpfe) *subjektiv*\no Grafik besser als erwartet *subjektiv*\nAngriffsanimationen der Einheit im Kampf\nZauberspruch Animationeno Steuerung nicht selbsterklärend aber eingängig und schnell erlernt\n\n\nMinus:\nkein Inventar-System (neu gefundene Gegenstände können verschwinden so keine Slots\nbereitstehen -> Verbesserung)\nkein Intro\n\nNicht Bewertet:\nunbekannte Skalierung der AI (nicht getestet))\n\nVerbesserungsvorschläge:\nSchaffen eines Inventar-Systems um Gegenstände aufbewaren zu können die nicht angelegt\nwerden konnten (Plätze in Armee voll, Plätze in Armee nicht verfügbar -> Gegenstand wird nicht\nauf dem Boden platziert)\nBeschleunigung der schnellsten Kampfgeschwindigkeit\nWenige Einheiten haben keine Beschreibungstexte und einige teilen sich dieselbe Beschreibung.\nNeue Option: bewege Einheit vollständig aber zeichne den Weg ein den sie genommen hat und\nermögliche eine Konfigurations der Wartezeit bis die nächste Eiheit zieht (die gesammte\nBewegung ist zu langsam beim Rundenwechsel *subjektiv*)\nKeine Kampagne (mir nicht so wichtig *subjektiv*)\nGegenstandsverkauf an bestimmten Orten der Karte (mglw. eingeschränkt auf die Klasse\nund/oder random)\nNeue Option bei F10: Zurück zum MainScreen\nMir hat es also bislang viel Spaß bereitet und rein von zeitlichen Aspekt war es den Preis schon wert. Manche hier aufgeführten Punke sind einfach subjektiv, dennoch denke ich die meisten Spieler die nicht nur auf die Grafik schauen aber Inhalte schätzen werden das Kleinod erkennen. Und bitte nicht falsch verstehen ... das Spiel dreht sich ausschließlich um das Gewinnen der aktuellen Karte. Eine Charakterentwicklung über eine Karte hinaus ist nicht möglich. Gegenstände werden ebenso nicht in das nächste Spiel übernommen.

While this might seem like a mistake at first, it actually kept me alive, as the demonic forces were too busy ravaging Elysium to bother with the minor foothold I kept in hell.  Eventually, after my tellurian citadels were overthrown by rampaging demon lords, I decided to bring my demonic army back to Elysium and shut the gateway to hell.  I succeeded in doing this, but hell's legions were persistent, and kept reopening the gates.

I was a little put off because he was supposed to be the toughest to start off with, but he got basically bloodstained by a ghostly apparition.\n\nI thought it was a fluke. (Probably not- I'm new to the game and probably did something wrong.)\n\nSo I tried again, and the randomizer gave me the Demonologist. And here is where I started to see the game begin to shine. I slowly but steadily started to built an army of demons- starting off with different flavors of imp, then cautiously working my way up to hell-hounds, devils, and vast clouds of demonic locusts. I would take over magtic sites and began to clothe myself with items that would do things like summon lesser imps at the beginning of battle. With glee I would summon demon knights and watch as army after army began to fall before the hordes of wrath I had summoned. Great swaths of flame scoured huge holes in enemy lines and they rapidly crumbled. Ruling the world with my demonic army became a goal that I could not put down. The barbarians were the first to fall. Soon, my army would destroy the Burgmeister and his beer-swilling ants of ... men.  Even watching the sprites wage war on each other, I could imagine the Inferno slowly starting to take over this world. Even after I destroyed my enemies- I felt an insatiable desire to start up another Demonologist to go forth and sacrifice untold thousands to explore anything else this class had to offer.\n\nJust a few more thoughts:\n-the above was based on all enemies being on default difficulty.\n-I took over the world with a Demonologist that wasn't even maxed on ability. (What could I do with a maxed out character? I don't know, but intend to find out!)\n-I had the option to go to another plane, but because I wanted to win the battle on my plane, I chose not to explore to see what was there, but completely had the option to do so.\n-The independent mobs can be a little annoying. I found it best to create a few small mini-armies to go around and destory them.\n-there's a LOT left to learn. I had an incredibly satisfying game.\n-read the manual. It's not too long, and I didn't feel too lost after getting my momentum. At a minimum you'll be able to get started with whatever class you want and dominate Elysium.","November 22, 2015","true","68.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's as close as you're going to get, and that is very high praise.\n\nUpdate 27 Feb 2016 (thumbed down):\n\nHaving sunk a bunch more time into this (offline mode, I probably have fifty hours offline), I'm ready to thumb it down. It's tedious. MoM was never tedious to me. There is a non-stop barrage of deer, snakes, wild life, and wandering nobodies that continually take your farms, forests, and anything else you could have possibly laid claim to. For no good reason. Two wandering deer do not chase people from their farm.\n\nIt's a non-stop game of recapture. You leave three guys to defend the farm? Four bears show up and kill them. If that's not bad enough, there are actual random factions and events that pop up for the sole purpose of spitting random extra monsters across your lands.\n\nIf you start a game with five AI, three of them will be killed by neutral "armies" (deer) in the first dozen turns or so. As far as I can tell, the only difference you get for ramping the AI difficulty up is that they start with bigger armies (and probably get cheaty amounts of resources per turn).\n\nI assume I'm just bad at the game still, but there's no excuse for the amount of rubbish that exists just to force you to keep recapturing the same thing over and over.","January 2","false","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Half of that was on the first day.\n\nAnyway, COE4 is amazing. You have this real sense of being a ♥♥♥♥♥ty wizard with this tiny defense/attack force until like 5 years into the game where your resources build up enough to both improve your wizard/Voice/ruler levels and do some World Changing Shi.t.\n\nSo I will give an example from the Voice of El playthrough I did. I started (after about 4 fail starts where I lost my starting army to fire ants or a disease demon cohort) in a desert and grabbed a few little farms and converted them. I then waited ending the turn for about 2 years (and the ai does things super fast so ending turn takes at most 5 seconds till next one) until I could Break the First Seal.\n\nSPOILERS (but they shouldn't really matter because you need to know what your actions can do to calculate them for if you want to actually win instead of fail hard).\n\nSome zealots and saints start spawning and I then turtled till got Favour from El and then more of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ chaff popped up over time.\n\nEventually, there were bands of Celestial Lion creatures, Arch Angels, Harbingers and other such things that you get for breaking open the first 6 seals. These celestial creatures are on your team but not controlled by you, so you often see a saint with 15 flagellants trying to attack a demon citadel that popped up in Elysium.\n\n\nI broke the SEVENTH seal! and instantaneously the Apocalypse happened. Yes. Apparently when you release El totally, he unleashes the Abys instead of sending hundreds of angels in armies to cleanse the world of evil. You unleash a tonne of evil.\n\n\n\nAnd then this complexity is for every single other hero you can pick. Everyone has some way of ♥♥♥♥king up the world in some way, whether unleashing barbarian hordes, opening a portal to Hell, using earth worms to dig tunnels in the world to release demons, summoning Void creatures....\nBecoming God Emperor....\nYou get the picture.","November 22, 2015","true","35.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The other day i seen this was out and most reviews said it was a much improved version so i decided to skip part 3 and buy this. Since i never played part 3 to justify buying this i decided that i had to play this one first day of purchase rather than leaving it in back catalogue to be forgotten.\n\nAll i can say is this i recently bought black ops 3 and star wars and tomb raider and i have to force myself to play them as they can get boring fast yet this game i put on yesterday and i played it for close to 10 hours on my first day. I couldnt turn it off pretty much its so addictive. The only thing that made me turn it off was i realised it was after midnight and i had to be up at 6am the next morning.\n\nI have already put this game in my favourites the game is great. Yesterday morning i didnt know how to even move the guy so i watched a review for 30 mins on youtube and it gave me a basic idea. I thought i would hate the graphics but they grew on me almost instantly.\n\nI cant go into much detial on how the game works as im only a beginner at it but everyone on reviews says there is huge variation and depth and it does seem this way though im not at the level to really comment at it.\n\nYou basically do skirmish mode on whatever different sized random maps you choose with up to around 8 players im not sure exactly. I played about 10 games yesterday on large and small maps some lasted only minutes and others hours.\n\nI made a small map game just because i thougth it would be over quickly but it lasted hours and i was totally engrossed and had to save it and turn it off due to it being late at night.\n\nToday i was playing rise of the tomb raider because i want to finish it so i can trade it back so i didnt play this game today but i much more wanted to play this also i bought star wars battlefront today and was same thing i would rather have been playing this.\n\nThe main reason i prefer this game and why i recommend it compared to those others is that during this i was completely engrossed not noticing time pass where in those other triple A games they were ok but kind boring and not engrossing.\n\nI highly recommend this i love this game its a brilliant turn based strategy game and it might prompt me to finally play dominion 4 which has been sitting in my library never played also :)\n\nEdit - You can actually play 16 player skirmish which is unreal (I previously wrongly said it was 8)\n\nAlso there are there are 10 different levels of AI and the lowest difficulty AI level is called ♥♥♥♥ boy and second lowest is called jestor lol its hard not to love this game","November 19, 2015","true","12.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

My main point will no doubt make people mark this as not helpful since its minor in the grand scheme of the game.\n\nBefore anything else, there are plenty of pros compared to CoE3:\nWay better music\nVastly improved UI\nPlanes add an interesting element\nNew everything: spells, monsters, etc\n\nNow onto the main con. If you're wanting to play this game with friends, then you have to use hamachi like services (I've tried countless p2p programs and they all suck, and even then, no one likes using hamachi) that allow peer 2 peer without port forwarding. Or, if able you have to port forward. This is my primary, huge con. The developers simply won't budge on using steam's api to allow p2p connecting and that is just a huge drawback to me. I was hoping it would of been an improvement and a step up from CoE4 but atlast, CoE4 just doesn't have it. Is this probably unfair to the whole game? Perhaps. But multiplayer is what makes this game fun and until its easily accessible without jumping through needless hoops, my review will hold a negative till then.\n\nCons\nTCP/IP Connection only support (No peer 2 peer)\nNo modding support\nSome UI is still clunky (Exit ingame quits entirely? Uhhh okay then..)\nSome races just arn't balanced and rely on extreme RNG.\nNo manual control in battle\nThere should be an after battle stats report along with viewing what happened.\n\nIf you plan on playing just single player, go for it, no reason not to get this if you've liked CoE3. However, seeing how this is an entirely different version from CoE3, and warrants a price tag. I expect majors in not only the gameplay (Which, they've successfull) but in the overall game/engine itself. There are simply not enough improvents to warrant an entirely different version instead they could of added it as dlc (While everyone would prefer free, its understandable for dlc) for the previous version.","November 21, 2015","false","20.7"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","10","27","0","8"

Worth the price for an upgrade?  Well, if you played the crap out of the last one, you'll probably play the crap out of this one too.  The additions and upgrades are, in my opinion, definitely worth it, although I wish the game could have been a little cheaper.  Same great classes as last game, and even a couple new ones, which are interesting, but not really insanely awesome either.  First differences you'll notice are the changes to the battle system.  It's much more fluid and interesting to watch.  Also, you now have a little bit more control over your characters' development throughout the game.  Libraries (as far as I can tell)  can be used forever, so as long as you have the gold, you can just keep learning new spells. They can also be used to upgrade those cool mercenary wizard characters that are recruitable from time to time.\nThere are also different worlds you can visit, like hades, inferno, some elemental planes, and probably more that I haven't cared to remember, each with their own landscapes and towns and citadels to recruit from.  Overall a very fun time.  I was addicted to 3, and now I'm addicted to 4, and they added and changed most of the things that I was hoping they'd change in 3.\n\nMultiplayer works, but it's another game that seems to make it a pain in the ♥♥♥ to set up. It's basically a direct connect type of game, and if you don't like dealing with port forwarding,  you're going to have to use something like hamachi. Hosting requires you to start another instance of the game, which can be tricky in steam, but doable if you just run the .exe from the game folders.  I  haven't played too much multi yet, but the only downside I've encountered are the continuous restarts from you or your friend dying early.\n\n\nIf you haven't played CoE3 or really any of Illwinter's games, I can only really describe it as a game where you spend the majority of your time finding ways to put cool new monsters or soldiers in your army, and then send them into what are basically live action autocalc battles.  Might sound lame if you are into games where you play a more active role, like the total war franchise, but the fact that you have no control over it once the battle begins adds to the roguelike quality of the game.  Your favorite character will often die and leave their apprentice.  Sometimes your giant army killing troll king will be cursed within the first few rounds of play, and have that curse for the rest of the game.  Even though the game offers less freedom of choice in battles, it still has so much variety that you won't even care.\n\nIf you want a game that will run on pretty much anything and be capable of stealing hours and hours of your life from you, then I highly recommend this.","December 3, 2015","true","183.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Greatly improves on COE3, but is an evolution not a remake.  There's nothing else like it out there.  I highly recommend for fans of turn based strategy.\n\nPros:\n-Many unique classes to play that greatly alter your play style\n-Doesn't hold your hand.  Survival is a struggle and victory is an accomplishment.\n-UI is much improved from COE3.\n-Maps are much more coherent than COE3 - geography is more clustered into regions than in COE3 (where terrain seemed totally random).\n-Awesome variety of interesting units\n-Nice music, it's not ugly (just not pretty)\n-Combat is better in general, particularly sieges\n\nSome annoyances remain:\n-Your towns still get conquered by 2 damn wandering snakes or a deer.  I really wish they would come with a small militia to defend against such annoyances\n-Still no building of structures.\n-I would really like to be able to build roads so I could more quickly retake my town that was conquered by the 2 snakes\n-This is mroe a refinement from COE 3, and not a huge departure.\n-Only adds a few more classes than COE 3 had.\n-More ritual spells would be nice.","November 18, 2015","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Conquest of Elysium 3 was good in itself, I played a lot with it and enjoyed it. That said, I don't play thousands of hours with a single game, I'm more diversed in the way of gaming I have. But this game is absolutely worth it! Illwinter Game Design made it. They are responsible for the Dominions series as well. That is more complex. This game is simpler, but that does not mean that it is simple! In fact it is not simple at all! You have either tons of units to recruit or tons of units to achieve with your special resources through Rituals of Masteries. It is more straightforward than Dominions. but it's depth is even deeper than many of the turn-based strategies today. There are zounds of units either under your control, or seeing the game as a whole. You have a choice from the beginning. What you want to do defines the gameplay for the 20 classes not mentioned before. These 20 classes range from Necromancers to Barbarians, through Senators and Demonologists, to name a few. I said before recruitment. You either have a lot to recruit from (but usually only one per turn can be recruited, with a few exceptions) or you have not many, but you can collect resources and expand your abilities named Rituals. Mostly, there are three levels of rituals. You can repeat a Ritual of Mastery many times, but the result will always be random, granting it infinite replayability! But it's the usual explore, exploit, expand, exterminate formula many times did before. I recommend it highly to anyone, who didn't try it before and is good at English. You should definitely give this game a try and let you get charmed by the atmosphere and music it has.

In fact most of your thinking is risk management rather than tactical management. Instead of picking a civilization like in most 4X games, you actually pick a character. The characters all have different ways of interacting with the world and they recruit armies to carry out their way of defeating their foes.\n\nUpsides\nSimple to play but MAN is there a lot of little things that can change things! You don't nessecarily USE it all depending on your character.\n\nExample: You may be a Witch who has to run around, capturing forests so you have more fungi to collect to cast your spells, however unlike say, a Baron, you don't really have the income to raise a huge standing army, but you can cast powerful spells unlike the Baron!\n\nSuprisingly solid RNG Based Automated battles. Yes you read that right as an upside. It is true, once the fighting starts, you have no control, but the strategy is about risk management before the fight ("Can I really take on these 12 dwarves with my Calvary Army?") and then the game automates a battle in a kind of "Auto 2D total war like" scenario, which is really neat! Plus the game competently puts your soldiers in formation (Tanky heavy-hitters in the middle, skirmishers in the flanks, archers and spellcasters in the rear) and they act as you would expect the unit would in a fight!\n\nThe soundtrack!\nYour mileage may vary\nYes it looks like it Came from the 90's, I'm ok with this personally, but again YMMV.\nMain Downsides\nIt doesn't explain the basics at all. There is no tutorial and help only appears after your first year, and it's always about random factoids rather than how to play. The best way to learn how to play is to watch someone else play it on youtube. That said it is actually simple enough to actually play despite the depth this game has.\n\nUI is sometimes a awkward to use.
