Cube Destroyer gives you an epic nostalgic feeling which causes you to play for hours in a row.\nThe objective is simple, pass the level by destroying the villain blocks and spawners. But watch out; some of the blocks can shoot back!\nCube Destroyer could be considered a better game then Asteroids since it has way better graphics, no bugs and cool music!\n\nPros: Any non-acient PC can handle the game. If you want to check if you can handle the game, go to "canyourunit.com".[www.systemrequirementslab.com]\nNostalgic feeling which entertains you for hours.\nEasy, basic controls very easy to learn.\nPersonally I love the music, it suits the game really really well!\nCube Destroyer is very well balanced, the levels are not impossible to beat but it is very hard to beat a level in only one try.\nWhen you die it is not a disaster, you immediately restart the same level.\nVery pretty backgrounds, great for the eye.\nPlaying this game will improve your reaction time slowly but steady.Cons: 75 levels, all very nice but also very similar. The levels get harder and get different enemies but I feel like this game is too similar to Asteroids as in gameplay.\nThere are no power-ups which could possibly make Cube Destroyer even better!\nThe concept of the game is not unique, there are a lot of games with the same concept, nevertheless is this game still really good!\nNo sense of progression except for the fact that you move to the next (possibly harder) level.\nOverall experience:\n\nCube Destroyer is an awesome game, I can guarantee you will have loads of fun playing this game! For just 3€ I would recommend this game to anyone who likes having fun!\nIf game will be too hard - you can use mouse scroll wheel to zoom out the camera. Good game!\n\n\nRating:\n\nI would rate the game "Cube Destroyer" a 8/10!\n\n\nWant more recommendations? Come see our reviews on our favorite upcoming games!

It may have been a waste of .74 cents.\n\nI have 13 minutes of play time. I played 8 minutes yesterday, and then got bored. Today I played 5 minutes, and then got bored.\n\nThere is a totally free game on miniclip.com called Super Awesome Tanks 2 that is a better version of this game.\n\nSuper Awesome Tanks 2: Upgraded abilites, Like 8 different weapons, upgradable weapons, FREE\n\nCube Destroyer: No upgradable abilities, same single shot weapon the entire game, not upgradeable, costs money.\n\nI kind of feel like a fool for bashing on a .74 cent game but hey, you probably shouldn't waste your time/money. Go buy a candy bar or something.\n\nRIP to the people who bought this game at full price.","April 22","false","0.2"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","10","22","2","0"
