The colors in the backgrounds and scenery can range from absolutely breath-taking, to horrifically morbid (in a good way). The character and level design is also very unique and while somewhat cartoonish, this only helps serve the purpose of resulting in a very creative and imaginative piece of art.\n\nNow, despite it's beauty, the game is also filled to the brim with what we all want: violence! It pretty much is a "hack-n-slash," type game, however there are also plenty of power-ups and abilities that can be used to "spice things up" a bit.\n\nPlatforming feels solid. Double jumping not only looks beautiful with a cool graphical flourish but the "float" ability that allows you to glide and string multiple double jumps together is useful and cool to look at. The fighting is also done really well. I like dedicated melee and ranged buttons that allow the combat to flow seamlessly instead of constantly switching weapons back & forth as the situation and enemies demand a major improvement over the first. Theres also a dodge/dash ability that's both very useful and is awesome to look at. Locking on to enemies to and being able to change to another target during battle is very useful.\n\nThe environments were stunning, from a beautiful forest, to menacing castle, and even the streets of London! Most games stick to one theme, such as being dark and scary to the end, or bright and happy, etc. Alice: MR had instances of gorgeous and serene, contrasting to the dark and ominous. They were the things of a beautiful, daydreaming nightmare!\n\nIf your idea of a good game is one that involves stultifying realism, empty action, and hollywood cliches then odds are that you will not like this game. If your tastes go beyond that to the appreciation of literature, art, and above all imagination then this game should prove to be quite satisfactory.","December 19, 2013","true","14.8"," 496 of 554 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","496","554","0","22"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goodguynickpt/recommended/19680/","goodguynickpt","Good Guy Nick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goodguynickpt/","418 products in account","Short Version:\n\nPros:\n+ Beautiful art design\n+ Interesting story\n+Controlling Alice feels great\n+Combat stays fresh for most of the game\n+ Enemies' design is amazing\n+ Voice acting is mostly good throughout the game\n+ Tons of collectibles\n+ Cool weapons\n+ Great soundtrack\n+ Weapon upgrades\n\nCons:\n- Repetitive puzzles\n- Stale platforming\n- Annoying camera\n- Level design is as linear as linear gets\n- Tons of invisible walls\n- Some game breaking bugs - Getting stuck, getting knocked down and never getting up again (which means you will not die and have to restart)\n- Impressively boring if played for more than 20/30 minutes (longer periods of play)\n- The absence of the original's weapons still haunts me (Deck of Cards, Jacks, Demon Dice, etc.)\n\n"Long" Version:\n\nWhen you start playing "Alice Madness Returns", it is quite evident that its art design is unique and downright beautiful. Personally, I think this game is already worth checking out at least once just for its art direction. It starts out with beautiful, calm and bright landscapes - which are really colorful and highly detailed; once ♥♥♥♥ starts hitting the fan, that beautiful Wonderland turns into something ghastly, corrupted and quite disturbing - the catch is, it's equally appealing. As stated, eye-candy is abundant from start to finish and you will have many opportunities to catch your breath and take some beautiful screenshots.\n\nPlatforming is a big part of "Alice Madness Returns" and it seems it gets worse as the game goes on. The problem is that one can only pull so many levers before getting bored. The level design plays a vital role here; it is extremely linear and you are pretty much getting from point A to point B with little to no side objectives - collectibles alleviate this by making you go off your main path; unfortunately, by the end of the game, you will most likely find yourself ignoring some (if not most) of them, since they required YET another lever and a couple more jumps and floats.\n\nStory-wise, this game shines. The story is nothing to write home about but it does a decent enough job of making you wanting to keep playing - I guess it ends quite abruptly but still, it's good in my opinion. It manages to keep you invested in Alice's "quest" and the use of "Alice in Wonderland"'s characters was refreshing (even though the first game did it better).\n\nVoice acting is, as said, really good. You meet your fair share of looney characters with high pitched voices and your dark enemies have intimidating voices and sound effects. The soundtrack is great. I think it is the kind of soundtrack I would buy if it was available. Weapon sounds also feels great as you cut enemies in halt and fill their ♥♥♥♥'s with (peppered) lead.\n\nCombat stays fresh for most of the game. Enemies require different strategies to be defeated and later on there are multiple types of enemies at the same time which requires you to adapt accordingly to the enemies weaknesses.\nYou have 4 weapons (or 5 if you count the umbrella) at your disposal and, even though I wanted more weapons, including some from the original game, they are enough to keep the combat engaging. Being able to upgrade them with Teeth (in-game currency) is also a bonus since you can turn your fluffy looking Hobby Horse into a full-fledged fire breathing stallion of punishment and death or your traditional Pepper Grinder into a.... full-fledged fire breathing... cooking..... tool.... ..... of punishment and death.\nHowever, the camera tends to flip out during combat and changing targets is a shore, usually costing you a chunk of your health.\n\nInvisible walls are everywhere, some small holes and gaps where Alice could easily fit in are regarded as impossible to cross and, considering the game is "quite" recent, it is something I found both annoying and disappointing. They are everywhere.\n\nI made a mistake while playing this game. I thought "I am going to play this for 2 or 3 hours" and let me tell you that it is something I sincerely do not recommend you to do.\nMost levels go like this: Jump, jump, jump and float; pull a lever/switch; more platforms show up; you can jump some more just to pull yet another lever; once you reach a bigger platform, you will have a battle; once you finish off all the enemies, more platforms show up. You then put a Bomb on a pressure pad so the platforms don't disappear and make your way to the other side well before the bomb detonates; then you will jump some more and pull some more levers... Sounds repetitive? That's because it is! I believe, after the first 2 hours or, let's say, 2/3 levels, this game gets on your nerves fairly quickly. I recommend it in short bursts.\n\nBut still, this may sound bad and all but Alice moves so effortlessly that the platforming sections feel graceful. It feels great even though it eventually gets boring.\n\nSome other bugs break the experience a little bit. One example is when you jump on a mushroom (it acts like a trampoline), you can only move again once Alice reaches the top of her ascension and starts falling down again; if you were pressing forward when you were going up, you will need to press it again after Alice starts descending so she moves forward - have fun dying because of it, since you will find yourself wasting extra jumps in the air while standing still.\n\nFor me, "Alice Madness Returns" is a big disappointment, yet, I can't bring myself to hate it.\n\nHere's the thing: I wanted to like this game. Unfortunately, I found myself getting frustrated and bored for a big chunk of its 14 or so hours of story.\n\nIs it worth buying? Not for 10 €. I would suggest 75% off, considering the game's age. But still, if you like engaging stories and value art design in video games, 5 € should be ok as well. It is a game everyone should experience at least once!\n\nAs far as replay value goes... I think you will only be playing this once.\n\nThis game had so much potential. It could have been something as epic as "Batman: Arkham City". That's what makes me sad.\n\nScore: 6.5 out of 10.","October 25, 2014","true","18.1"," 277 of 295 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","277","295","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericjdouglas/recommended/19680/","ericjdouglas","koala fish mutant bird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericjdouglas/","561 products in account","When American McGee's Alice[en.wikipedia.org] came out in 2000, it was one of many shots in the arm that gaming received back then (the original Half-Life and Deus Ex to name a couple), showcasing the idea that videogames could aim for higher and higher levels of creativity and ambition. The mythology of Alice, Lewis Carroll's inquisitive young heroine thrust into a psychedelic kaleidoscope of strange yet unsettlingly familiar characters, has changed hands and changed costumes many, many times since Carroll penned Alice's Adventures In Wonderland[en.wikipedia.org] and Through The Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There[en.wikipedia.org] at the end of the 19th century. I personally love the original story and that's pretty much where my head first goes when Alice is mentioned. I don't think the gentle whimsy of Carroll's writing can ever be matched when it comes to the denizens and riddles of Wonderland. But even the malevolent nonsense of the poem "Jabberwocky"[www.jabberwocky.com], for example, never saw anything like American McGee's vision of Wonderland. The original game took many of the story's elements and twisted them up in fantastically demented ways and delivered the New and Improved Alice to us with flashy, blistering combat and a dark tone that was most certainly a product and an extension of the 1990s with their Hot Topic meets The Crow meets The Matrix mélange of gothy, trendy edginess. I'm not knocking that (okay, I am a little) because God knows I was cheerfully invested in it myself back then, but it is what it is. So, with that out of the way, enter Alice: Madness Returns.\n\nI can't really talk about the story too much without spoiling anything, but this isn't really a spoiler if you happened to notice the actual title of the game, so let's just say our gal Alice is, in fact, nuts. Insane in the membrane. Mad, you could say. And as she winds her way alternately through a dirty, dark London skid-row and a troubled, hurriedly collapsing Wonderland on a quest to solve a mystery and save her sanity, it becomes obvious, like in the first game, that as bonkers as she is, there are crazier -- and scarier -- things about, oh yes. Which is of course the main draw of a game like this. How bizarre can we get? Well, let's see. There's steampunk taxidermy gone horribly wrong, various ill-thought ways to use baby dollheads, an impressively grotesque and bloody take on The Walrus and The Carpenter, an entire level that feels like the drug-addled fever dream of M.C. Escher and Wes Craven locked in some padded cell together, and I think you even walk through a giant mouth at one point. And not in a Disneyland kind of way. Concerning the neverending search for weird ♥♥♥♥, Alice delivers whole-heartedly. (Imagine me saying that while holding a pink, veiny, pulsing heart while twitching and grinning insanely.)\n\nAs spectacle, it satisfies. I loved the originality of the levels and the many, many weirdnesses it serves up. I won't say anything about the story because, no real way around it, it does take a second place to the gameworld, the atmosphere, and the characters, but it doesn't help that it's really not all that great to begin with. It doesn't do anything necessarily wrong, and the voice acting is pretty good (especially Alice's), but it doesn't really do anything amazingly right, either. It's pretty much what you'd expect if you've played the previous installment. Disappointing, a bit, but whatever. Again, the story can be excused for taking a backseat to the visuals just because of the game that it is.\n\nCombat and gameplay... oh boy. Good points: melee feels GREAT. I want a Vorpal Blade in real life. I never got tired of dancing and blitzing that blade through the air. It's great fun. Other weapons are good too, in varying degrees, but sending Alice dodging through enemy attacks to be able to slash viciously back at them and then dodging away, in a beautifully animated burst of indigo butterflies, never ever gets old. Ranged combat? Not... so... great. Irritating controls requiring quick-switching targeting modes that also partially disable your camera make for some very frustrating battles, especially ones involving tons of airborne and ground enemies at once. No, sir, I do not like it.\n\nBut then again, the Vorpal Blade is really, really sweet. So it's a mixed bag. And that honestly sums up my overall feelings on the game because while, like I already said, the levels are visually fantastic and new, the levels are also INCREDIBLY long and drawn-out. I mean, I like getting a lot of game for my money, but there's a point where you can almost hear the devs running out of ideas for a certain level or world and sad to say the game just sails right past that point into exasperated tedium. But that's me. Your mileage may vary, and very possibly will.\n\nIn the end, this has everything you'd expect from a concerted effort to take your childhood and turn it inside-out and sideways and then tell you to kill it and smash it and blow it to shreds. As Alice herself might say, "Curiouser and curiouser! And completely covered in blood."","April 26, 2015","true","89.9"," 167 of 177 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","167","177","12","11"

The game is also plagued with random minigame segments. Thanks to EA pushing the studio for early release.\n\nStill, the game is amazing, the story is one of the most ballsy a game could have.

Racked with guilt that is slowly driving her towards the brink of insanity she once again descends into the imaginative world of Wonderland looking for some comfort with old friends but with her mind fast unraveling the Wonderland of her childhood has now fully transformed itself into a dark cellar of a world filled with the grotesque and unimaginable.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=149704525\nAlice: Madness Returns is a mixture of platforming, puzzle-solving, adventuring with more than a touch of horror. The games earlier scenes are visually stunning as we move from a grey 1800's London to the lush beauty of the Vale. The differences in color palette used is so striking that for a minute you will almost believe that this safe haven for Alice's shattered mind is the rightful place to recuperate. It doesn't take long, however, before Wonderland starts to distort and disfigure itself.\n\nIt's a pity that those striking sequences aren't matched by what follows as Alice visits three area's in succession that diminish the power of the opening stages - The Mad Hatter's Domain, the Deluded Depths and the Oriental Grove (with the Grove looking particularly under developed and rushed with terrible textures everywhere - in fact it looks like an entire different team developed this section as it doesn't match the quality of the other areas). It was at this point that I was getting weary and a bit tired of Alice's shenanigans and her search to find out the truth about what actually happened to her parents that she initiates once in Wonderland by cleverly having to collect memories of her childhood that slowly piece together the events that led to her family's death.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=148814210\nI am glad I stayed along for the ride because Alice really shows off its strength in the last two areas of the game - Queensland and the Doll House. These two areas are such a horrifying joy to explore (and I mean horrifying with the Queen of Hearts castle literally blood-soaked or being attacked by dolls with missing eyes and limbs during the Doll house sequence). It's during these stages that Alice really hits its creative stride soaring past the earlier levels in design and creativity. If I have one gripe during these magnificent levels, its seems as if the game itself has gotten much, much easier posing very little in the way of a challenge.\n\nTowards the end of the game things take a decidedly darker turn with quite the disturbing twist in the tale. I won't spoil it for the gamer out there who still wants to get the full experience but suffice to say that by the time the Doll's House rolls around the imagery should already start preparing you for where the story is actually headed. Buckle up - because we are headed straight into the heart of darkness.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=226092373\nThe game is also a very long one - it took me 18hrs to complete and that time does not include searching for all the collectibles on each level. The game's soundtrack is also truly immersive managing to hit all the right notes to keep you audibly invested in the adventure even though Alice: Madness Returns is a game of two halves - one utterly brilliant and so imaginative that I could lose myself to a larger gaming world just comprised of those areas and the other feeling completely soulless and devoid of any charm. But it’s still worth the experience just for the last two acts alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","February 1, 2014","true","18.8"," 163 of 205 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","163","205","2","7"

I didn't kill my family. I am fine. I'm not mad, I'm innocent - I mean, not guilty!" - Alice\n\nWhat a little gem this is. In Alice: Madness Returns you control Alice Liddell, a girl who suffers from an emotional trauma caused by the death of her parents. To get rid of the trauma and learn the truth of her past, she once falls again into Wonderland, where a new evil force has corrupted it.\n\nThe strongest attribute of this game is Wonderland itself. This creepy and dark vision of Wonderland is beautifully recreated in this game. The art design in it is top notch, and graphical wise it does it job well, even though there are some places here and there with some ugly textures. As you progress the game you will get to new areas of Wonderland, each one of it with its art style, which makes it feel less repetitive. Menus are also slick, easy to navigate, a negative being that in video menu you have almost no options of configuring the game graphically, you have to do your tweaks through the config file unfortunately.\n\nSound is also pretty good, nothing mind blowing, but it does its job well enough. The voice acting its great as the soundtrack, but the second one can get repetitive very often.\n\nGameplay wise, which its the most important factor in a game to me, is where this game falls a little flat. Controls are great, smooth and easy to use (I used a ps3 controller[/b]). Length is also a strong point in this game. Its not huge, but it is almost the perfect length to keep you interested during the game, with tons of collectibles to catch and areas to find. I spent about 12 hours to complete it and did not get all the collectibles, only about an half of them. You also have a neat diversity of weapons which make the combat more fun.\n\nNow to the negative things in the gameplay. The worse part its that the game gets very repetitive because it does not evolve much from the start. At some point, you will get to do the same tasks all over again till the end which makes the game a bit boring sometimes. Also the puzzles and other tasks to change the pace of the game are not very fun. Even less fun when they also start to get repetitive.\n\nThe combat is very fluid and responsive, fast paced as well with a good variety of horrendous enemies to confront, but once you master it it becomes very easy.\nAcrobatics are also well done, which makes the navigation in Wonderland very smooth though jumps (even double-jumps and triple-jumps), floating and shrinking.\n\nThe story is also one of the strongest attributes of the game, being amazing. Its full of interesting characters, riddles and surprising reveals.\n\nGame performance is pretty good, I played it on a laptop and only had 4 or 5 fps drops through the game. Its locked at 30 fps, but you can easily change that in the config files.\n\nSummary:\nPros:\n- Beautiful dark version of Wonderland\n- Top notch art style\n- Smooth and easy to use controls\n- Great length\n- Amazing story\n\nCons:\n- Tedious gameplay and puzzles\n- Steam version does not come bundled with the original game "America McGee's Alice"\n\nMy personal score:  8.0\n\nIf you love action/adventure and platform games play this gem, there arent many platform games on steam, so if you are into that genre this is a good bet. The awesome story and setting of this game will make you forget about the boring gameplay, and you will have an amazing experience for a game that gets very cheap in steam sales (I got it for 2.50 euro if I am not mistaken).","May 29, 2015","true","13.0"," 78 of 90 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","78","90","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adam1224/recommended/19680/","adam1224","adam1224","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adam1224/","1546 products in account","TLDR: Game is beautiful, story is intresting and atmospheric, but gameplay streches too long and some parts will be boring and monotone - game is often on sale, a -75% usual one is GREAT to pick the game up. Don't bother with full price, I don't think it's worth it.\nAccording to Steam I've played this for the whopping amount of 36.9 hours - ingame timer says 16 hours, 91% completion.\nAbout this game: picked up a copy for a friend to return a friendly gesture and at the same time I bought it for myself, because I was really intrested in it (Alice + implementation of madness? Yes please, I'm in!)\nThe game starts out wonderful. You'll keep making screenshots - the game world is really nicely designed and well-executed, some landscapes are jaw-dropping both in terms of quality and creativity.\nPlatforming works great, there are no issues with controls - but after a time it can be boring, because most chapters (5 looong chapters, all in 1-2 different settings than the others) use quite the same mechanics/ideas as precious ones, only re-skinned.\nCombat is both lacking and feels rewarding. Why?  Personally I really miss combos and airbone attacks. Maybe I'm too new for the third-person platformers, but I think while combat plays a really central part in the gameplay, it could have been much better.  And why is it still great? You have 4 weapons - basically a light and heavy variant of melee and ranged. As most things, the weapons look astonishingly good, with real nice sound - and visual effects. But the biggest and best thing of combat system is the really different enemies. They all work in their own way - one is easy to take on with the pepper-grinder (machine gun), the other one's weakness is the heavy Hobby Horse's armor-breaking hits. Each enemy, and especially their mixed groups require different tactics to defeat them.  It's a little shame that by the time you finish a chapter, most likely you'll be bored of the enemies - the first Samurai Wasp is challenging, the third is an intresting enemy, but you'll stomp on the 8th one. Not to mention the 20th one.\nLevel design: Gorgeous. In chapter 2? you'll go into a snowy landscape, to end up in a ship-in-a-bottle, only to get it sunk then continue your journey underwater. Another chapter is all about Japan and the East - koi pond, china-landscape, traditional fans.  Chapter 4 and 5 are just incredible and maybe the best ones from the game, both in terms of gameplay and design. If only chapter 2 and 3 would be similarly good.\nThough there is one thing that can put a dent on the experience: invisible walls everywhere. You can't touch most of the walls because you'll stop running ~ 30 cm before them, you can't jump on most things because pleasantly placed invisible ~2-3 metre tall "boxes" are placed on them because you only can jump on something you're *supposed* to jump on. It's a shame in a game from 2011.\nMinigames! There are various minigames/ tasks in the game you need to complete to continue: chess puzzle, sliding blocks puzzle, shoot 'em up game, sidescrolling platformer, guitar-hero like small puzzles.. I haven't expected this much variation, it's a really strong positive of the game.\nCollectibles: Collecting memories gives you a small quote (1-2 sentence) from a specific character of the story that deepens the main story. Even though they are quite conveniently placed and easy to find/get most of them, this makes collecting them really rewarding.  Game lacks backtracing at several points of the game, making impossible to get the stuff at the other side of the crossroads if you took the correct one  - without chapter selection. What a pity.\nAfterall, all I can do is to recommend this game. It has several really strong aspects, while the weakest points aren't worse than "average".   Previously I thought it's a silly suggestion, but *Good Guy Nick* is right - playing the game for more than an hour can induce a strong feeling if monotonicity. I feel like most chapters should be 10-20% shorter, because while there are enough action, jumping and fighting to fill the gametime, there is not that much "soul" in the game to keep the gamer playing for longer periods.  At the end, it was a nice - after how bad is EA's reputation in recent times, it was refreshing and pleasantly surprising to see a really creative and daring game under their name.","February 5, 2015","true","36.9"," 53 of 59 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","53","59","2","0"

As well as the art you've got a bunch of collectibles to find, like bottles, memories and flying pig snouts. (Literally).

You took me to place that I've never seen before and yet were hauntingly familiar. Introduced me to friends that I could have sworn I had met, and yet were different and twisted. Ours could have been a love affair for the ages.\n\nNow, four years after we should have met, I've followed you down the dark and twisting road of your past. I fell in love with you at first sight. You told me the horrific story of your past and for a time I sat raptured. I have so many good things to say about you. You're smart and graceful. Your movement is like a gazelle. You showed me places M.C. Escher would be proud to call his own. And yet, and yet.\n\nThe truth is Alice, you don't know when to leave. I wanted to hear your story. I wanted to visit all the dark places that you promised me that we would go. I have to admit that you delivered on your promises. Each place we went was more interesting, darker, and haunting then the last. You just wouldn't leave. Every intersting thing you showed me you had to show me three or four times.\n\nAs intelligent as I find you to be, your repitition was heartbreaking. The amazing thing is that your repitition was per location, not overall. As much as I wanted every time we met to be a joy, I found myself starting to resent you. I started to wish we could just finish this part and move on to the next visage that awaited. I knew that if I stuck it out, the next local, the next piece of the puzzle of your mind that you opened up to me would be amazing. It was just such a long time between one revelation and when you would open up to me again that I started to wonder if it was worth the time I was spending getting to know you.\n\nYou had so many interesting insights, so many variations on how you viewed the world I wish that I could look past your refusal to grind through each and every insight multiple times. I wish, I wish, I wish.\n\nDear, Dear Alice. You have so much to offer. Maybe it's not you, maybe its me. If another chap came up and asked me about you I would tell him how lovely you are. I would tell him how smart and charming you can be. I fear that after a few pints I would probably tell him that I just had a hard time with how long you would drag through any given situation. That the revelations were inticing, but the fluff between revelations didn't make me anticpate the revleations more, just make me resent the fluff.\n\nLove,\n\nKuasimoddo\n\nP.S. I am tentatively telling my friends you are a cool chick with the caveat that you waaaaay overstay your welcome.","December 29, 2014","true","19.2"," 60 of 70 people (86%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","86","60","70","28","0"

And every creature lends themselves to change your state of mind...\nI finished this game about a week ago and for an old game it's pretty damn good tbh. Alice's past is pretty harsh and she dwells on it all the time thus her wonderland is falling apart.. again. And she must go into the depths of her mind to find the problem that's scratching at her sanity and execute it.\nI absolutely loved the scenery and artwork of this game the most. The levels were not too long but not too short either. And each chapter has so many secret rooms and hidden items. The storyline could have been a bit more compelling but it was still pretty good imo. It does have some decent plot twists.\nThe game definitely has a pretty creepy feel to it and the enemies seem like something out of a horror movie as well. Some enemies can be very frustrating at first but once you get a good system on how to kill them then it's not so bad. The puzzles in the game were definitely a wide variety of fun, like how they should be in most games. They weren't too easy and they weren't so hard and/or confusing that it would just ♥♥♥♥ you off.\nOne of my favorite aspects of the game were the weapons. Which you can also upgrade the weapons over time by collecting teeth.\nThe characters in the game were just awesome. Ofc you have the ones you know like Mad Hatter, The Queen, Chester Cat, etc. The voice acting was spot on to the character's personalities as well and very good facial expressions.\nAnother thing I thought was a really nice touch, was Alice's outfits. Each chapter she would change into a different dress and they would match the scenery of the current level.\n\nAlso. I would eat Alice's green eyes. Even though I have green eyes myself, but... I just like her eyeballs. ಠ_ಠ\n\nThe only complaint I really have about the game is that it can be a bit buggy. Sometimes when you kill an enemy it might move about like it's still kickin, but the game is just being derpy and the enemy will just disappear eventually. The only bug I had a real issue with (and others had issues on it too) was on one level, Chester Cat is suppose to appear and say something but he didn't. But it was an easy fix of just restarting the chapter again and it wasn't too far into the chapter either. But keep in mind that the game is just old.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. I just didn't want to stop playing it honestly. And sometimes I find myself going back to the game and playing through a level or so. Still haven't found all the secrets and missing items though.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing artwork and decent graphics for how old the game is.\n-The characters aren't dull\n-Not too easy and not too hard either. Everything in this game is pretty much a good balance\n-There is a lot more to do in this game than just hacking and slashing, defeating bosses/waves of enemies, and cut scenes.\n\nCons:\n-Can be a little buggy at times\n-The story could have been a *little* more compelling","February 22, 2014","true","35.6"," 51 of 62 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","51","62","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/recommended/19680/","tmcookiez","<™[-=> Cookiez <=-]™>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/","177 products in account","Fantastic game. I truly recommend it. Reminiscent of early games such as Psychonauts. Mini games resemble Little Big Planet. Dollhouse level reminds me of Saw and the Jigsaw doll.\n\nThe game starts to becomes a little buggy at the Oriental stage E.g. Alice's hands no longer grasps the chain when she pulls on them.\n\nYou begin to see repeats and less unique creatures. E.g. Ink Wasps are Bolterflys, Wasp Samurais move like Madcaps, Baby Doll dies to plain shooting.\n\nPROS\n1. Great visuals\nThe concept behind Wonderland is truly amazing. Looking at the floating Hatter Industries, the Insidious Ruins, the crying statue, hidden pathways that can only be seen with tiny vision and the vaiety of monsters to fight against each with their own method of killing.\n\n2. Creativity\nAs above.\n\n3. Combat system\nAmazing. Each monster is killed in a different manner giving you the feeling of a unique creature. Unlike normal hack and slash games, you have to remember each monster's pattern of attack, else you won't be able to kill them. E.g. Insidious Ruin has to be blocked when he throws a fireball or knives, dodged when he charges and attacked from range. Eyepot has to be hit with a range attack first, followed by a melee slash. Repeat twice.\n\nI was surprised to see that this game had such an amazing combat system. I was expecting a puzzle solving game instead. The dodge and block modes with the umbrella were fantastic.\n\nThe Hysteria mode will give the hack and slash fans the frenetic joy they relish if they prefer not to remember patterns of attack.\n\n4. Storyline\nLove the story. I'm at the beginning but I can't wait to find out more.  The story gets darker as it progresses, child sexual abuse, paedophilia, child molesters masquerading as doctors, p rostituted children hypnotised to forget and used to satisfy the perversions of wealthy London clients.\n\nSteam censors the word P-R-O-S-T-I-T-U-T-E for some funny reason. Considering the type of content that they provide. It is most strange.\n\n5. Movement\nLove the double jump and the quick walking speed.\n\nCONS\n1. Movement\nJumping in the air is still a bit clunky especially using the air vents. Jumping in the middle of an air boost creates some problems for long distance jumping.\n\n2. Character models\nOther than Alice, most of the beginning character models (children in the hospital) are quite boring. You can see that they are repeated multiple times.\n\n3. EA Account\nI do not want to create another account just to play a game. It's irritating.\n\nSuggestions\nI would love to see the combat system put into an MMORPG. Hope EA and Spicy Horse Games can continue to work together on creating quality games like Alice.","October 31, 2014","true","15.0"," 44 of 52 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","44","52","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/19680/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","At it's heart, Alice: Madness Returns is a 3D platformer, with occasional action sequences that oscillate between (light) third-person shooter and brawler. Madness Returns is a diamond in the rough. It would have been so wonderful with more polish and time to add new original features here and there!\n\nI do not like brawlers nor third-person shooters, and yet I was able to enjoy the fights from Madness Returns. The first reason is that I gave a lot of thought to my key bindings so it feels as natural as possible despite the clunky design (it really requires too many inputs). The second reason is that the action is very tactical (at least in the higher difficulties, which I recommend) and has a great flow when the player masters the tools and weapons at use. For instance: Hit an enemy with the teapot canon to make it fall backwards and reveal its weak spot. Go in for a few slashes with the knife. Dash away to avoid another enemy trying to attack. Use the now reloaded teapot canon on that second enemy. Dash in to avoid the attack of the first enemy and quickly slash the downed second enemy. And so on. A ballet of butterflies and blades. New enemies here and there require different approaches, however the number of different enemy types is insufficient. Also, not enough true boss fights.\n\nWhere the game really shines is in the environments. Chinese ceramics, doll houses, flesh castles, mushroom forests, steampunk factories: grandiose, beautiful, oozing with character and magnificence. The dark undertones of some locations is really fascinating, and builds a heavy atmosphere despite the childhood themes. Platforming and exploring in such locations is a treat for the eyes. Alice can go as far as to quadruple-jump and slow down her fall, and the levels accommodate in consequence with aerial elegance. The gameplay of these sections feels good, and is rather permissive (even dying by falling to oblivion is of little to no consequence thanks to an instant respawn onto a nearby platform), so progress flows well and the game feels like an adventure and not an hindrance. Exploration is well done, and some little traps and puzzles can add some spice to the platforming. Problem is, the levels are really big and long, and some sections can overstay their welcome. Well just one in particular in my opinion, the ice world. I would have rather preferred that they make the levels shorter and instead include some cool new ideas that got scrapped during development, but ok, this is just me yearning for more. The reality of game development is not as pretty as this game. Still, there are some sections here and there that are completely different than the main game and add variety, like a shoot-them-up or a 2D platformer, but they feel very floaty.\n\nStory-telling is not great, it feels quite disjointed. However the story itself is quite interesting, with lots of subtleties and darker themes. The person voicing Alice does a stellar job. Even though many people like them, I dislike the cutscenes that look like animated cardboard and would have preferred to see them done with the game engine.\n\nThere are different costumes for Alice, some were part of a pre-order DLC or something. Thankfully they can be unlocked, but it is by editing the Windows Registry. Seriously, how annoying! And also if I remember correctly it is required to create/have an EA account of some sort to launch the game for the first time, thankfully not Origin or anything to install. But seriously, how annoying again...\n\nAs a conclusion, Alice: Madness Returns is a game full of charm and character with grandiose levels to explore and a morbid undertone that builds a heavy atmosphere. Platforming and fighting is like a ballet once mastered, even if both will not please everyone: it can be argued that the platforming is too light and the fighting is clunky, and that both are repetitive. Alice is awesome, very elegant and pretty in all her dresses and movements, and she benefits from great voice acting.\nOverall Madness Returns lacks some polish and could have been better, but still very memorable and enjoyable as is.\nI liked this game so much that I finished it several times despite it being quite lengthy. I would only recommend it to people that are strongly attracted to its visuals and are not looking for state of the art game mechanics.","July 20, 2015","true","18.8"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","31","35","3","0"

I have no idea where to start to be honest.\n\nLet’s say I was blown away; not only by the amazing level design, but the strong moral behind the game reaches far down in the back of your mind.\nThis game brings the true dark-side of the story of Wonderland up. Wonderland truly lives up to their motto: “We’re all mad.”\n\nAmazing graphics, stunning level design. They weren’t lazy at ALL. Every corner, every new step reveals something new to witness. Whether it’s a teapot with eyes staring from afar or a doll hanging upside down from the ceiling and black liquid substance dripping from the orifices…\nThe drawings on the wall, dolls, skeletons and the overall lugubrious perspective of the game.\nThe artstyle is truly amazing.\n\nGameplay:\nNot your usual buttonsmash, but a hack and slash nonetheless. But you have a heavy attack, shield, range which you can upgrade over time by collecting Teeth…pretty much anything you need. There’s a lock-on system which is pretty nifty. The jumping can be a little tricky, but overall you’ll get used to it.\n\nWhomever thought this felt very repetitive: I disagree. There are a few places in the game where you’d do the same thing, the same kind of puzzle, but they are all within a good “stop” in between.\nI mean to say there’s a lot of platforming in between the puzzles, a lot of other things to do before doing something you’ve done before. I think it was alright, they balanced it out pretty well.\n\nStory:\nI love the story, and the level designs…all the drawings, props, traps, enemies, you really feel that these are all interpretations of Alice’s feelings; something that used to make you smile is now corrupted and is  turned against you.\n\nThis little review of thought MIGHT contain slight spoilers:\nOverall, the story, it being quite the deep moral. A girl having herself blamed for something she did not do, the grudge being pushed down her throat and the endless pain and depression ever soaring through her mind. She tries to justify herself, she isn’t sick; she’s in pain. But nobody who really reaches out for her, giving her what she really needs. All but her Wonderland friends…\nAlthough they may appear threatening, or they may appear as they want to harm Alice, they’re all merely afraid of HER.\n\nShe is destroying her own beautiful mind: Wonderland. They are the creatures who roam over wonderland, and she’s her own murderer - the Infernal Train is her own invention.\nAnd if it wasn’t enough, the doctor is ever more pushing it down her mind and blaming her.\nIf one only knew the darker intentions the doctor had in mind by letting these children forget their past…\nThey are nothing but mere numbers. They are but the mortal bodies that walk on the earth, all forgetting their “unproductive” memories.\nShe’s not just being tortured by herself, but others around her, who suffer the same pain, have a huge influence on her as well.\n\n10/10 from me. It’s a damn masterpiece.\n","January 27, 2015","true","27.8"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","27","29","2","0"

Probably with the best aspects of this game.\n\nThe thing (that I believe) that stands out the most is the design. The game itself is like a work of art - it's a visual treat along with the interesting soundtrack and atmosphere. All the level designs are unique and they change often, keeping the player immersed and curious about the environment they are in. Sure, there are some disturbing or incredibly creepy stuff lurking around all the time, but I think that is what seals the deal. Just. Wow. I've never taken more screenshots in my life.\n\nNext would be the story. Now, I guess we don't really associate platformers with intriguing stories, but that's what makes AMR such a cohesive and linear game. As the player progresses through the story, he/she will realize why the levels are designed the way they are, why certain characters say certain things, etc. It'll all come together towards the end. Some people may think the story's a bit dramatic or just downright disturbing, but the purpose of the game is to uncover our protagonist's insanity and madness. It's GOING to be a bit provoking, at least.  But as for me, that's all the more reason to play this game.\n\nFinally the gameplay is quite smooth. Platformers need smooth controls, and I've played the first parts of this game using my keyboard, but then switched to controller (when I twiddled around with the menu and figured out it's compatible with one - just personal preference). For both methods, I think it runs fairly smooth. I've encountered a couple of problems with some levels where I had to calm down and then retry getting accross somewhere, but that just might be my technical ability to cope with the difficulties of some platformers. The only issue I really have is that camera control is relatively important in fights, but focus mode totally disregards that.\n\nThe puzzles are also pretty fun, and there are different minigames scattered here and there.

The controls (using k/b and mouse) work well and are very responsive. Story is top notch IMO. Love the whole take on Alice and the interaction with the wonderland residents.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bluewolfca/recommended/19680/","bluewolfca","BluewolfCA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bluewolfca/","231 products in account","I feel obligated to write a review after taking 18h 47m (according to the game itself) to complete the playthrough. (The 26 hours recorded by Steam of course includes time when the game was paused or sitting on the main menu while I had to be away from the computer.)\n\n+ PROS\n\nGreat artistic style: The game is over-the-top beautiful. Even with the game's age you'd be hard put to find many others that hit the level of pure artistry in imagining the twisted vision of Wonderland.\n\nAmazing level design: Each of the five story chapters (the sixth is only the final boss-fight and cut scenes) has a very different look and feel and are peppered with mini-games that break up the platformer main play with other kinds of puzzles.\n\nGreat voice acting: The actors were simply excellent even when the material was on the thin side.\n\n+ MIDDLE GROUND\n\nFlat story; As much as I was impressed with the voice talent and how well crafted the words were, the narrative itself was a bit ho-hum. And you get a lot of it by finding items that trigger memories (voice-overs). It's the same as finding audio-logs in BioShock but not as well executed because a lot of memories add only weak context to the story. It almost makes finding them not worth the time in some cases, but finding them is really part of the fun. Consider that BioShock Infinite takes just as long to complete on average as this game, but the Alice storyline has nowhere near the depth or detail.\n\nCombat: It's OK. You get five weapons and all have important uses. In general combat helps break up the platformer experience of finding your way through Wonderland. But there's nothing terribly bad nor satisfying about it.\n\n+ CONS\n\nToo long: As beautiful as it all is, the chapters are about 25% longer than they really need to be. This made the fifth and final story chapter drag because I simply wanted the game to be over by that point. This wouldn't have been an issue if there was more to the story driving the game play.\n\nBugs: Clipping issues (getting stuck on a seemingly smooth path). Game locking up under heavy button-mashing requiring a reboot. Also the beginning of chapter three has horrible button lag that made it a chore to get through.\n\nClunky mechanics: The auto-target system locks the camera on the current target making you circle around it when moving Alice. This makes it impossible to rotate the cam to see what's coming up behind you in some cases. It also was a bit wonky changing targets. You can't play the game without auto-target though because the game often forces perspective shifts that make it impossible to aim like a traditional 3rd person shooter. You just deal with it as best you can.\n\nNo Steam achievements: Lots of unlockables are tracked in-game, however no one but you will ever know how many you got.\n\nRating: 6.5/10\nWorth playing, just be prepared for a long haul if you intend to complete it. Replay value is very low.","January 30","true","26.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","2"

Some of the art design employed by the game is simply the creepiest I have ever seen! But all this in the good sense as this is a damn fine game with jaw-dropping visuals and music that gives you the goosebumps.\n\nThis is a journey through vivid and dangerous dreams - Alice's Wonderland but as opposed to the cartoon this is now a horrified, alternative version of the same where the only way to survive is for Alice to be equipped with a bloody knife and a teapot that works like a grenade launcher.\n\nI like how idyllic it all begins only to gradually get more and more corrupt and in the process Alice faces more and more dangerous creatures of the Ruin - this powerful force that tries to stop Alice. You fight throughout the game and you will do that a lot - but you will also solve puzzles and jump and also shrink so that hidden paths can be revealed for you to make progress.\n\nYou will jump a lot and many will result in your falling to certain death. But once you have put enough trial-and-error the game will be grateful as it shows you the progress Alice makes - a desperate progress to find out what caused the fire that killed his family at their home.\n\nThe game is pretty long and is full of hundreds of collectibles. I finished it in roughly 15 hours and got only 90% of the stuff scattered throughout Wonderland. There is a special menu called Troubled Visions in the main menu that is only unlocked if you collect every single bottle during each chapter. Pretty neat, huh? Plus, you can always try the New Game+ mode if you think "Normal" does not offer a real challenge for you.\n\nBuy this game and immerse yourself in this unique, nightmarish world of Wonderland!","December 3, 2014","true","14.1"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowfox444/recommended/19680/","snowfox444","Snowfox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowfox444/","463 products in account","IntroductionI bought this game on sale for $5 and it sat in my library for a couple weeks. After starting to play it, however, it quickly found a spot on my favorite games list. Even though some parts were tedious, the story kept me engaged untill the very end.\nPrepare yourselves for an exceedingly long wall of text (go to the TL:DR if you wish to skip).\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=638015953\nOverviewAlice: Madness Returns is a psychological horror game developed by Spicy Horse and published by Electronic Arts in 2011 for Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. It is the sequel to America Mcghee’s Alice, made in 2000.\n\nBefore I ramble on about everything that I enjoyed about this game, I would like to point out a few flaws with this version on steam.\nFirst: the umbrella to block projectiles might not work (it didn’t for me) and if so, you will have to change some files to get it to work right.\n\nNext: the combat focus mechanic is far from perfect and has many flaws. It feels awkward to use at first and could use some polishing. Love it or hate it, this mechanic is essential for fighting certain monsters. I got used to it eventually, but it was hard starting out (because you have to hold down the CAPSLOCK key to stay focused).\n\nYou will also need an EA account for a brief activation (as far as I can remember) but then you don’t need it for the rest of the game.\n\nNow on to things I enjoy about Alice: Madness returns:\nVaried environments: from dark castles, underwater cities, Victorian London, an asylum, and even a train. All of these settings make for an interesting experience as you travel throughout Alice’s now twisted version of wonderland.\n\nPlatforming: Satisfying and well designed (albeit repetitive) embodied by unique jumping mechanics (I will explain later). Something that would make the platforming better would be to include the edge grabbing mechanic originally shown in America Mcghee’s Alice.\n\nStory: I won’t spoil it for you but here is a brief summary: Alice tries to piece together memories of the night that her family died in a fire and ultimately finds out who is truly behind her madness… The story is presented in an interesting way, mostly told by cut scenes, brief dialogue and memory shards that are hidden throughout the levels. The story is very thought-provoking and I recommend that you go into the game as blind as possible because of how captivating the story is, especially towards the very end.\n\nChallenge rooms, puzzles, and game modes: There are several puzzles in environment, needing to be solved to more on (they can also be skipped). They vary from playing musical notes, finding blocks that need to be arranged to form a picture, and chess. I enjoyed most of them, but the finding the blocks for a picture is repeated around 6 times, which got repetitive. There are also multiple challenge rooms where the goal is to survive waves of enemies or complete a certain objective. When a challenge is completed, you are rewarded with some red paint. Each time you collect this paint, a part of a rose is filled in. Once you fill in a rose 4 times, you gain an extra rose container (like a heart). Lastly, there are a few game modes, each unique to its environment. An underwater side scrolling shooter, 2D platformer, and baby head rolling course (which is by far the most bizarre of them all).\n\nWeapons: There are 4 of them, not including the clock work bomb which you will collect as you progress through the story. In order of appearance they are: Vorpal Blade, Pepper Grinder, Hobby Horse, and Teapot Cannon. (there is also an additional variant for each of these included in the unlockable DLC). The Vorpal blade is your first weapon and used for fast melee slashing. Next, The Pepper Grinder is used rapid, medium to long range assault (and for triggering switches). The Hobby Horse is a slow but powerful short range weapon that is effective against groups of enemies (and is my favorite). The last weapon you get is the Teapot Cannon, is long ranged weapon of high damage and large radius (can be used to break some walls).\n\nCharacter customization: There are several outfits for Alice, her original outfit that changes depending on which environment you are in, a few others, and the DLC outfits. The DLC outfits and weapons each have buffs (or debuffs) that can fit your playstyle. Also, the Teeth you collect can be used to upgrade your base weapons, changing their look and empowering them.\n\nMechanics: many of them stood out to me, aside from the combat focus.\nShrinking: used to get through small keyholes and reveal hidden paths. Activated by holding down left control.\nHealth system represented by roses. You can regenerate health by picking up roses that enemies drop or finding a purple flower (if you shrink on top of a purple flower, it will regenerate your health). You can increase your health capacity by completing challenge rooms.\nHysteria (my favorite) where Alice taps into her insanity for several seconds to become invincible and gain increased damage. This can only be activated at extremely low health by pressing enter.\nJumping: you can jump 3(?) times in midair, losing height with each consecutive jump. If you jump and hold down space in midair, you will slowly float. Also, while we are talking about movement, you can dodge by pressing left shift.\n\nEnemies: Small leech-like slimes to massively destructive blobs with baby faces and flamethrowers. Nuff said. Each monster has their own attack pattern and vulnerabilities, which you will need to recognize in order to be victorious. The enemies vary from environment to environment.\n\nLevel design: predominantly linear with multitudes of secret memories, bottles, and challenge rooms to be found. A few puzzles (mentioned above) are included, but the vast majority of each level relies on platforming. This may get repetitive, but this is up to personal opinion. Although there are no steam achievements (wish there were), you progress is recorded and you can see how many secrets you have found (no one but you can see).\n\nGraphics/art style: Surprisingly stunning, detailed environments. One of the selling points for me. I was constantly taking screenshots and have 350 of them (200 uploaded). Half the time playing I was looking for the perfect place to take a screenshot (I got some pretty good ones).\n\nPerformance: Mouse sensitivity takes getting used to, controls are clunky at first, but after playing for an hour or so, you’ll get used to it. The FPS and a few other things can be changed by editing some game files. You can find guides on how to do this if you look on the Community Hub.\n\nFree DLC: Although it is not enabled by default, you can enable the DLC (that includes outfits and weapons) for free by changing the value of GIsSpecialPCEdition from FALSE to TRUE. Due to how much I liked this game, I decided to check out the earlier game, America Mcghee’s Alice. For a game made in 2000, it really impressed me. If you want to play Alice: Madness returns or have enjoyed playing it I strongly recommend you get a copy of America Mcghee’s Alice. It even has slightly better controls (sensitivity wise).\n\nTL:DRTo summarize: Alice: Madness Returns features a unique atmosphere, impressive soundtrack (which I forgot to mention), surreal story, decent platforming, weapon appearance customization, interesting mechanics, linear level designs, vibrant and dark art style, and average performance.\n\nOn sale this is a must buy and at $20 I would still recommend it (if you understand some of the flaws).\nFor personal enjoyment I’m giving it a 9/10 and for review purposes, I give it a 8.5/10 because of its flaws. Just be prepared to troubleshoot any potential problems that could arise.","March 5","true","63.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","3"

While held at Rutledge Asylum for treatment, Alice was able to conquer her doubts, and eventually was released from the ward. Alice, now 19 years old, resides at an orphanage in Victorian London, under the care of Doctor Angus Bumby, a psychiatrist who uses hypnotism to help his child patients forget their memories. Though she believes herself cured of her madness, Alice still suffers from hallucinations of Wonderland.."\n\nThe Gameplay\nAlice: Madness Returns is an action platformer that presents itself with a creepy, dark and creative atmosphere. Wonderland is inhabited by squirming leaches, firebreathing dolls and evil looking teacups, creating a twisted and surreal vibe. As you float and jump through an eerie dollhouse, you can drop bombs, shrink down to a miniscule size or dodge ceiling spikes ready to slam down on you. Unfortunately, the gameplay doesn’t evolve much from the start. This causes the game to become quite repetitive, especially when often, your task is to go and fetch something for another character. If it were not for the distinct and peculiar backgrounds, you might be tricked into thinking you’ve been playing the same level since the start. However, throughout the game there are plenty of hidden secrets motivating the player to fully explore every grotesque nook and cranny. There are enough hidden secrets to make it worth inspecting Madness Returns' grotesque nooks.\n\nAlice:Madness Returns does try to change the gameplay up. There are ramps to slide on, an underwater combat scene, puzzles to solve, and a giant dolls head to control. Unfortunately, oftentimes the camera gets in the way of doing these things. There are awkward transitions going in and out of third person, and side views are generally useless. Instead of a heart-pounding flee from a giant executioner, it feels like Alice is just jogging towards the camera. You’ll certainly be glad of the change of tempo, but it leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nMelee is the best part of the combat system in Alice:Madness Returns. It feels light, fast, and incredibly deadly. My favourite melee weapon would have to be the Vorpal Blade. Alice will flutter in and around her enemies, slashing them to bits and leaving a trail of butterflies behind. Unfortunately, ranged combat isn’t as fun. The controls for ranged combat lock your camera in place and the targeting system is a little frustrating to use. Unfortunately, this makes many of the battles you will face in this game almost impossible, especially when you are facing multiple enemies.\n\nThe Soundtrack\nThe soundtrack in Alice: Madness Returns is spot on in setting the mood. The voice acting is good. Nothing spectacular, nothing terrible, as it can get a little repetitive, especially during the longer levels.\n\nThe Experience\nIf you buy the DLC, there are some stunning dresses you can wear throughout the game. The Fleshmaiden is a direct example of this. While wearing this, Alice’s pupils are white, her legs are bloodstained and the actual dress itself is a mesh of bloody flesh and tendons.\n\nThe story of this game will be left in your mind for weeks after you’ve played it. It is engaging and a dark twist on your childhood memory of Alice in Wonderland, and you’ll probably never be able to read it the same way again.\n\nOverall Verdict\nWhile the gameplay can be a little repetitive, I honestly think this game is worth it for the dark, realistic take on a fairytale.\n\nIf you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!","August 6, 2015","true","10.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197974763255/recommended/19680/","76561197974763255","Kill Switch","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197974763255/","212 products in account","I would consider Alice: Madness Returns to be primarily a platforming game with some fighting; including some arcade and puzzle elements to a lesser extent.\n\nThe environments look pretty good and give the impression of a dream world, but the path Alice takes is extremely linear.  There is no real exploration in this game and there are no large open areas; in fact, there are hidden walls which prevent you from even walking behind some objects.  The main path will occasionally branch off to a deadend that leads to collectible items.  The deadend paths must always be followed first because events are frequently triggered that will prevent you from backtracking.\n\nAside from the teeth you collect--used to upgrade weapons--there are "memories" that will provide you with a short audio clip and there are also bottles.  I had to google the bottles because they don't seem to do anything when collected.  According to the wikia, if all the bottles of a chapter are collected then it unlocks a piece of concept art to view.\n\nThe weapons are an interesting take on conventional weapons (i.e., a pepper grinder chaingun), but there are only 5 to choose from: a knife, chaingun, two-hand club, canon, and timed bombs which may also be manually detonated.  After 13 hours I have yet to unlock the canon.  There's also an umbrella that, while not a weapon itself, can deflect bombs back to the enemies that threw them.  I end up using the knife, the weapon you start with, the most.  It has a really satisfying sound and animation that I never seem to grow tired of.  Upgrading the weapons change their appearance and makes them do more damage, but doesn't given them any new abilities.  Ammo is unlimited, but the chaingun will overheat if you hold down the trigger for more than a few seconds.\n\nThere is no manual save option, but the game does a good job with autosaving right before some difficult platforming.  If you fall to your death while platforming, you typically won't have to worry about redoing much of that again.  However, if you die during a boss fight, you will have to redo some platforming to get back to the boss area.  This has got to be one of the more frustrating aspects of the game.  You could die on the platforming section literally 2 seconds away from the boss and only have to redo that 2 seconds of platforming again.  If you die figting a boss, you won't get placed at that save point 2 seconds away.  Instead, you might have to endure 2 minutes of platforming along with cutscenes that you can, fortunately, skip.  It makes no logical sense.\n\nA mechanic I thought was kind of cool is the "drink me" shrinking effect which can be used at any time simply by pressing a button.  This not only shrinks Alice, but reveals invisible platforms and tips scrawled on the walls and floors that are EVERYWHERE.  I emphasize "everywhere" because the developers somehow thought it would be good to hold your hand and tell you where every secret path can be found, what collectibles are down that path, what enemies to find around every corner, and what weapon to use on them.  Everywhere.  These tips can't be disabled.\n\nThe most annoying aspect of this game is the constant camera hijacking.  The game will frequently pan the camera to some triggered event and then return it to a predetermined angle leaving you disoriented.  Infrequently it will fix itself at a particular angle and distance for platforming and also in confined areas.\n\nThe mouse control was unplayable for me when I purchased this game over a year ago.  I decided not to play it at that time because of that.  You should consider yourself forewarned if you use a mouse because you may not be able to tolerate it.  I picked the game back up recently and I've been using a 360 controller which works fine--aside from having to manually edit an .ini file because the main menu does not include the option to disable force feedback.\n\nI find the platforming and boss fights to be enjoyable and challenging and not at all frustrating; instead, the frustrating parts are bad developer decisions that could have been avoided.  While the graphics and animations are beautifully done and the story is somewhat compelling, it doesn't seem like enough incentive to continue playing.  I feel like I'm playing just to get to the destination instead of playing it to enjoy the journey.\n\nI suggest only picking up this title during a Steam sale so you don't feel too cheated when you decide to not finish it.","December 20, 2013","false","13.2"," 90 of 161 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","90","161","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/recommended/19680/","Nawrusi","Nawrusi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/","789 products in account","So after comepleting this game, I found out it`s a sequel to another Alice game. Wow I think I missed out on something here.\n\nPresentation:\nRight of the bat, we see that the game is split into to "stages". stage one is the real world, where Alice is lossing her memories, and tryes to find out how her familie got killed. The secound stage is wonderland, where Alice turns into a badass and kills the bad creatures of wonderland.\n\nThe story is based around the Alice in wonderland universe, but the universe here is far more disturbing, and shows a more grim side of wonderland. I think I would get more of the tone if I had played the first game, but as long as you know  Alice in wonderland. It dose not fell like you are missing out on anything.\n\nGameplay/Controles:\nIn terms of gameplay, this game is acually very fun. It can get repetetive now and again but the balance between combat  puzzels and platforming makes the game seem more or less fresh all the time. In terms of main gameplay, there is your 3D platforming and your combat.\n\nIn terms of platforming, the game can from time to time fell a bit slipery, but after you get use to it, you fly around, and do great. The platforming is also mixed with puzzeling, where you have to activate a switch, and afterwards run back through some tricky jumps. This can be frusterating at times, but when you succed you fell good.\n\nThe combat is simple, you aim with the mouse and leed Alice towards an enemy. You will get other weapons than your standard knife, like a heavy weapon, and a light and heavy gun. This makes it up to you, to find out how you want to take care of your enemies all the time, and it`s a great way to make palyers chose what they want too. One thing though which I`ll also mention in visuels. I had problems with the game, and it started to prefomre purely when to many enemies where on the screen, this runied the gamepley a bit for me, but it is a matter to be overlooked, if you have a strong PC.\n\nThe enemies are all themed from the stage you are on. This is teapot fighters from Mad Hatter stage and card soldiers from the queen of hearts stage. You need to find all the enemies weakneses in order to win, and some of them, needs a bit more of stragetie to defeat.\n\nThere are also fun ministages, such as a sidescrole shooter, a maze game, and much more. There is also a lot of collectebels to find in this game. Which only helps you explore the beutifull world even more.\n\nCharecters:\nIf you know your Alice in wonderland, you`ll know most of the charecters. All of them have been givin a more sinister look, which you also can see on there stages. You`ll meet many great charecters such as the Mad Hatter,  the Carpenter and the Queen of hearts. All the charecters are well voiceacted, and have there own persenalitty, and it is a joyride all the way through.\n\nVisuels:\nAs said sometimes the game slowed down for me, but it dose not change the great looks of this game. Every single stage is beutifull in it`s own way, and everything is so well done, that I think the visuels where some of the most importent things of this game.\n\nEvey stage has it`s own charm and it`s own looks, we have a steampunk stage based on the Mad Hatters tea factory, we have a Water level that looks beutifull, we have a japanese inspired level, a cardhouse in the sky  and much more, everything looks so beutifull and nice, that you want to explore everything, and see even the smaller details in this game.\n\nMusic:\nthe music is very well made, and fits in with all the stages. Not much to be said here, other than I want the soundtrack so I can play it for a D&D night.\n\nStory:\nThe story is accually not that complecated , Alice needs to find her memories in wonderland, and also find the out how her famelie died in the real world. The game switches from wonderland to real world, and you find out new things all the time. Alice needs to face many of her old friends in wonderland, and the progress you make all the time, makes the games story flow by pretty smothly. I am not going to spoil anything, but let me tell you, the end boss is a blast to fight.\n\nConclution:\nThis game is really good, with great charecters, fantastic visuels, and nice music, but tihs is maybe also the minor complain I have. The gameplay could at times be a bit better, and the art direction seems to have taken over with this game. This is not a bad thing, but if you are a gamer, that don`t care about visuels, this game can seem a bit flat at times.","July 20, 2015","true","15.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vegosiux/recommended/19680/","Vegosiux","Radene","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vegosiux/","260 products in account","Bought this game then proceeded to spend three quarters of my waking hours over the next few days spelunking through the depths of Alice's insanity, the girl's got issues, to say the least. And after that dose of crazy, I've been having funky dreams, too. Been a while since a game drew me in this much. Consider this TL;DR.\n\nNow onwards, to the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\nTHE GOOD:\nThe aesthetics. The scenery is really satisfying and pretty, even when obviously bad things are happening. It changes slowly, sometimes subtly, but you can't help but notice how broken Alice's mind is once you scratch the surface. And the journey is going to be long, indeed. Things will get worse before they get better. Also Alice's dresses, they're lovely and fit the theme of whichever part of her mind she's currently in. Complete mood whiplash when you swap into the monochrome-with-red Hysteria mode that's one of the best visual depictions of psychotic episodes I've ever seen.\n\nThe combat. It flows nicely, and all enemies have their weak and strong spots. A few occasions will pit you against a formidable challenge, and split-second decisions will need to be made to survive. The weapons are imaginative and you can switch between them seamlessly, and Alice isn't shy about using them. The variety of enemies is decent, and all of them represent some mental problem Alice is dealing with. You also get a last stand mechanic, once you're down to your last rose, you can enter Hysteria mode (or "Psycho Mode" as I like to call it) which renders you invincible and increases damage for a short while (while looking awesomely morbid and badass), and if you gather more health while under effect, you can chan it if you drop to a single rose again. Don't get too reliant on it, though, later on many enemies can do enough damage to not even let you have the chance to use it.\n\nThe sounds. From Alice's voice acting that does wonders for relaying her personality and Cheshire Cat cryptic snarking, to the ambient sounds and the soundtrack itself, you won't even notice most of it because it flows so seamlessly into the setting and just becomes part of the whole experience.\n\nThe subtle puns. "Train of thought", "Jumping off the slippery slope" and "Shattered mind" are quire real in the Wonderland, to say the least.\n\nThe ending. It leaves things open to interpretations, of which I have at least three competing ones at the moment, ranging from mildly optimistic to downright depressing, and none of them is more likely than any other. It's that kind of game.\n\n\nTHE BAD:\nThe lack of bosses, especially since it's obvious they were planned, but only one made it to release. Why did that happen? Well, likely budget or deadline problems, and considering who published the game, that doesn't surprise me. There are some tough, mini-boss like enemies, but they can't both present challenges at significant points of the game, AND not get a little repetitive as the time goes by.\n\nThe game feels shorter than it could have been. There's more to explore, Alice's mental issues run deep indeed, and at times I felt as if things were unraveling too fast, some characters aren't explored as deeply as they could have been. With the cast, content and concept, this game could have been made considerably longer, however...\n\nThe platforming sections sometimes feel too long, and start screaming "filler" at you. Especially in the first and fifth chapter, there were extended times when I felt I wasn't actually doing anything, nor getting any closer to the underlying mental taint while I spent long periods of time getting from point A to point B. The platforming puzzles themselves are okay, but sometimes too concentrated.\n\nThe focus mode. While combat is good, this is one aspect that simply doesn't work. The focus mode only really works one-on-one since it forces you into wonky camera angles, so aside from the scene not looking as gracefully badass as it couls, the beasties trying to eat your brain from directions other than twelve o' clock are going to become a real problem. This mode is reduced to something you use to deal with the strong enemies once you've dispatched the trash mooks through normal (and impressive-looking!) combat. A shame, really, because it has much potential for blocking and ranged combat.\n\nThe occasional glitches. The only one I really ran into occasionally was invisible ankle-high-walls in the middle of nowhere that I got stuck on and had to jump over which cost me just enough time to have to restart the jumping puzzle, but people also report crashing and the like.\n\nTHE UGLY:\nThe truth. Not going to spoil, but bloody hell, the truth is ugly.\n\nSeveral enemy types. If you think being insane could be kind of cool, remember that you really don't want these abominations traipsing through your skull. Sanity is not overrated.\n\nEveryone except Alice. Honestly, pretty much everyone except the protagonist looks like they just crawled out of the gutter. Whether it's just her perception of everyone is up to interpretation. I'd say that it likely is, especially considering who the only other relatively normal-looking character is.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:\nIf you like platformers, atmospheric horror, and disturbing, morbid content, this is a game for you if you're willing to forgive its flaws and the fact that it requires EA authentication (but not an Origin account, oddly enough). Oh, and this game definitely isn't something you want to let your kids play in the evening.","June 18, 2015","true","31.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

Being rather fond of surrealistic elements and other-wordliness, this game struck me from way across the field as both visually-aesthetically beautiful and packed with an overall feel and mood that makes playing it like being in a dream.  Really.\n\nI love it, I love the game mechanics, the design, and for what it matters there's also a storyline, but I scarcely care about it because whoever drove the main gist of this game is someone so well in touch with their own nocturnal affairs that simply walking through the maps is an oddly, bizarrely enjoyable experience.\n\nThe only downside is the sluggish response and non-optimized engine.  Ever had that hard-to-nail feeling that "there's something wrong here.. like I'm walking in shoes with sticky soles, or trying to drive a car with a slightly loose steering wheel and laggy servo mechanism" ?  That's the feel I get in Skyrim too, the feeling of something made for a console (and in my world, game consoles are an entertaining, but utterly inferior species) ported to PC without optimizing.  'cause feck the PC gamers, right? They'll just buy new hardware, right?\n\nIt's from 2011, this is 2015 and I think a dual core 2.8Ghz with a Radeon 290X ought to be enough to run these graphics smoothly, with no input lag.  Alas, not the case.\n\nDon't let the above deter you, I'm fairly confident these are somewhat card/driver-specific, and it's not actually a problem unless I max the physics (which I don't really notice anyway).  Just take heed if you're someone who's bothered by these things.\n\n\nImagination, visuals, gameplay, cool mechanics and a unique atmosphere, it's a fantastic game, totally recommended.\n\nBeautiful.","September 5, 2015","true","61.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Alice, now older, returns to a corrupted wonderland to do battle with events from her childhood and her own insanity.\n\nEA initially market this game as a psychological horror game. While it certainly is creepy and dark at times I would never call it scary. This game has more in common with games like Spiro and Banjo Kazooie than it does with your stereotypical psychological horror title.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun, both combat and platforming are incredibly satisfying (Having the ability to triple jump and glide from the beginning and LEARNING to master these abilities as opposed to unlocking them). Each area of the game grants access to new weapons, allows you to collect teeth (currency) to upgrade your weapons and gives Alice a new outfit whcih is a reflection of the level (a nice little touch). The game also contains 'memories' and other such collectables which allow you to unlock bonus content (concept art for example) which will appease the OCD side of the avid completionist.\n\nThe game does suffer from some optimisation issues (It's a console port) and certainly does control better with a gamepad.

It is hard to describe such an hybrid of a game; If there is one game that doesn't quite fall victim of genres, this would be a great example.\n\nIt is loosely based on Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland", but with a much darker setting. The thematic present in the story is somber and sometimes psychologically disturbing. This is definitely an M rated game, due to a very mature story (younger players may have an hard time understanding it due to it's complexity) and the gore level involved, but even on this aspect this game is unique, the violence isn't gratuitous and it always serves the purpose of the story and the setting involved.\n\nMadness Returns is a mix of a third person adventure with a great combat system implemented for the action sequences. It has exploration as well, with plenty of collectables to find, but at it's core it's an action adventure game, but it's unlike anything else out there. This game is a work of heart and art. The enemies, settings, artwork in the game world are all unique. And unique is the best word to describe this gem. There is also variety in the game, some sections are played in 2 dimensions in a cell shaded style, and many more surprises that are better left unspoken.\n\nDesigned and produced by American McGee, an experienced game designer that has worked at ID Software, on Doom and Quake, and also the designer of the first Alice game, Madness Returns is quite an accomplishment.\nThe visuals are simply amazing, breathtaking and draw you in. You have never seen so much use of colour on the Unreal engine before, and the quality of the textures really manage to impress. Graphically it is one of the best looking games to ever grace your PC, even today 2 years after it's release. The real winner though, is the art and design of the levels themselves. You have to see it and experience it to believe it. The music is quite good, Chris Vrenna (Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson) is the man responsible for the soundtrack, and it matches the visuals in perfection. This is one of the few examples where the audio is just as important as the visuals and the story. They all are and feel like a perfect match to each other, and not so many games can claim the same.\n\nThere are some flaws though. The camera is a bit shaky at times, and it does get in the way on occasion. The mouse control is very sensitive and it will need adjustment. Some people may find some exploration parts boring, but it was not the case with me. If you decide to purchase this gem of a game, do so knowing it will take you quite a bit of time to finish.

It's darkly gorgeous and creative with brilliant level design and simplified combat driven by a dark, psychological story. That said, the boss fights were underwhelming to me, especially the final one (Just start the game on Hard or Nightmare), but all my complaints are minor. In contrast with the first game, there are few memorable music pieces, as there's much more focus on background ambience, though the addition of heart-pumping fight music is nice. Still a bit disappointing considering it's Chris Vrenna. Anyway, there are plenty of moments where I got stuck not knowing where to go - another leftover from the original, but this sequel really succeeds where it counts.\n\nThere's simply much more plot going on here, more characters and a mystery to unfold - all fueled by solid voice acting. There are some loose ends still untied once it's all over and I did feel some of the symbolism - especially with the end villain - was forced, but considering the dark creativity at display with the monsters and levels, I can easily forgive that. Seriously, the amount of detail put into places you won't even necessarily visit is amazing. Anyway, if you enjoyed the original game, absolutely play this - and vice versa. I didn't even like Madness Returns at first, but it won me over for all the above reasons.","June 17, 2015","true","39.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

If you are a fan of Wonderland, then you will love the creepy, strange beauty of this game. Each chapter is rich with artistic detail that looks as if it has been pulled straight out of a Tim Burton movie. Every chapter has a unique look that will make you well acquainted with your screenshot key.\n\nWhile the art style is clever and interesting, the level lengths are quite long and can be a little tedious after a while. Don’t go into this game expecting a fast play through, especially if you plan on collecting everything.\n\nThe boss fights, are thankfully, unique to this game. They are challenging and had me at times wondering if I was actually playing a mini Dark Souls game instead. The clumsy controls make for an aggravating experience when facing enemies in flight, and don’t even get me started on that umbrella.\n\nBesides the games shortcomings, including a few bugs and glitches here and there, the game really does make you feel as if you were traversing through a strange, yet wonderful Wonderland. There are several challenging puzzle games spread out through the chapters that I felt were a nice break from the constant platform jumping, and the characters you meet along the way are interesting and unique.\n\nMy overall score for the game: 7/10. I would recommend this game for those who like challenging puzzles or those who just want to experience a darker version of Alice in Wonderland.\n","May 11","true","35.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

You'll like this game.  You are born into the world with not only the ability to double jump, but you can quad-jump, and you can glide after each jump!  Platformers dream come true.\n\nThe imagery in the game is beautiful and twisted.  Some scenes are wonderfully gorgeous, while other scenes are ruthlessly violent.  I'm not really a screenshots kinda person, but I did end up taking a lot of screenshots of this game.  And the hair physics...you wouldn't think something so small as which way Alice's hair blows in the wind would be such a big deal but it is surprisingly pleasant to watch during those moments when I stop to smell the roses.\n\nThe platforming complexity is decent.  Hardcore types might be turned off because the path forward is relatively linear and the puzzles themselves are relatively straightforward, but it's still a satisfying experience.  Especially because this game has not frustrated me even once, which is surprisingly difficult for games in this genre.\n\nThe fighting isn't incredibly complex and the moveset is fairly limited, but it does give you four different weapons, fast melee, strong melee, fast ranged, strong ranged.  Some attacks work better than others against some enemies.  The fighting adds a nice break between platforming segments; I don't grumble when a fight starts, but I don't get all excited either.\n\nFor the completionist, there are lots of little things to look for that are hidden away.  I'm usually pretty thorough at searching for things and I've managed to miss two or three things in each level (out of about 30-40).  Fortunately, the game allows you to replay previous chapters you've beaten, so you can get a perfect score.","June 14, 2015","true","28.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/19680/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","Alice Madness Returns is a great, well put together, 3rd person action game. First of all, you can clearly see from screenshots and videos that this game is a great looking one, sometimes even breathtaking. The game is divided into 6 chapters and each chapter has its own unique look and they all look great and I think the developers did a really good job in creating a Wonderland that is shaped out by Alice herself. Along with the corrupted Alice mind and the corrupted Wonderland the creatures that once lived there also became corrupted and even though I found the enemies to be really well designed at first, they quickly get repeated over and over throughout the entirety of the game but they still provide solid and enjoyable combat scenarios.\n\nAlice Madness Returns tells you the story of how Alice thinks she's responsible for the fire that burned down her house and also killed her parents and sister. She gets the help of a doctor from an asylum which tries to make her forget about what happened and that it wasn't her fault. By thinking that she was responsible for the death of her family, her mind becomes corrupted, and so the Wonderland, and this is where the game takes place. Throughout the game you'll visit various regions of the Wonderland which have become corrupted and each one them has been designed in a very unique way.\n\nAlice Madness Returns is pretty much a straight up linear third person action game with alot of platforming segments, puzzles, minigames and alikes. The game rewards exploration by giving you extra health and teeth, which you can use to upgrade your weapons (knife, hammer, pepper gun and tea cannon), not only you get small benefits by exploring but you'll also be able to collect "memories". Memories are audio logs that when picked up they will trigger a memory of someone you know on the real world, this, in my opinion, makes the storyline progression not that linear in the way that if you don't explore and don't collect all the memories you probably won't get certain parts and you won't understand the game that well.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple, you walk/run, you can jump, glide while in the air and jump multiple times while in the air, this is the key, along with great timing, to solve alot of "jumping puzzles" that are scattered throughout the entire game. I mentioned above that there are also some kind of puzzles and mini games, the two examples I can think of right now is some kind of minigame which plays pretty much like Super Monkey Ball and another one is chess, except that in this chess you have a maximum number of moves that you need to use in order to move two pieces of the chessboard to a certain location by moving them at the same time (pressing right will make one piece go to your right and the other piece move to your left, inverted chess if you can call it that way).\n\nBesides what I already mentioned I think nothing else needs to be told about this great video game. Absolutely gorgeous environments and music, well designed and breathtaking scenarios, surprisingly good and interesting storyline and characters along with the solid and satisfying hack and slash combat are reason more than enough for me to recommend this game and for you to pick it up.\n\nIf you're looking for good reviews, consider joining Good Games Giveaways & Reviews group.

The story has a TON of twists and plot holes, though i wont spoil it, if you have any triggers about ♥♥♥♥, insanity, denial, murder and so on; do NOT buy this game.\n\nBest storyline i've seen in a LONG time 9.5/10\n\n(Is the gameplay good?)\n\nIn MY opinion, no, i do not like the platforming, and the combat is very flawed. The level design sometimes suprises me, but it's often just generic platforming with very little inspiration. I can tell that this game took inspiration from psychonauts and the previous alice game, however. it fails miserabely to emulate the charm and wit of those games. As quoting the children in the orphanage "Mad as a hatter, without the charm" I will not lie, the game has allot of suprises when it comes to gameplay, and dependant on what kind of gamer you are, these changes can make or break you. I did however feel a huge rush of adrenaline when in hysteria mode.\n\nDecent-ish combat, but sub-par level design. 6.4\n(I do not mean the graphics and visual stlye.)\n\n(How does the game look?)\n\nPut Psychonauts in a blender, add some denial and a few doll heads, and some rabbit blood to boot. There's your game. In all seriousness though, the game looks amazing. The visual styles often remind you of how you're inside alice's broken mind. Graphical quality could be better, the post-processing is ugly, and the game doesnt run as well as it should.\n\nAmazing visual styles, but i bet this game would run on the original xbox. 8.8\n\n(So is this game right for me?)\n\nIf you're like me, you like a deep and dark storyline over amazing gameplay. The gameplay in this is not to my tastes, but the story is just perfect. I recommend playing the previous Alice, however, first. As I like a deep/dark story line WITH amazing gameplay, I'd play Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix over this any day, but this is so much darker.\n\nIf you liked the walking dead and psychonauts, yes, this game is right for you.\n\n(Replay value?)\n\nNothing for me, i doubt i'll go anywhere near the game now that i've completed it.\n\nNo score for this yet.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY:\n\n8.5\nThe game is great, though very flawed, the story makes up for the lack of innovative level design, and  shabby combat. If you're just in it for the combat, don't get it. If you want a story that will be in your mind forever, It's well worth whatever you pay.\n\n\nSmall update: Haven't played for about a year now, and I have no desire to.","September 26, 2014","true","28.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","3"

I have to say i was very skeptical about getting this game, seeing that im not as big on Alice in wonderland than a lot of mainstream society. I jumped into it and found it to be a very smooth game with devilish humor and dark suggestive intents. This game fits me perfectly as for my studies in college and career wise. It plays on psychological themes in Alice's mind. Her memories, and within those memories a very dark and gritty atmosphere.\n\nI have only just started this game and i feel i definitely got my money's worth and i plan on continuing this game. The graphics in this game.. although they're not amazing, they're clear, dark themed and her hair... my god, every strand of hair she has moves with her. They did quite amazing on the physics. This game not only captures a dark mind of a schizophrenic Alice, but involves a dark world with kind of a scary, horrific tendency to keep you compelled to keep playing.\n\nThe combat is actually fun, i actually really enjoyed it and it's difference on crouching and dodging. It involves her teleporting into butterflies and shifting around the enemies. The combat so far uses a knife that can upgrade. it's actually quite fitting for the type of game it is.\n\nSo i leave you with this, i recommend this game through and through and i'm not even done the story yet. When i do finish the story i will probably update this review even more but i just feel with this game it's too good to pass up. I just wish i had played the first one so i could understand everything. Enjoy this game.","November 20, 2014","true","1.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","3"

My initial reaction was that it handles horribly, but once you actually get past the real world and into Wonderland the game really opens up and allows for excellent platforming and combat. The pinned down and awkwardly restricted feel of being in the real world serves to highlight how liberating going to Wonderland is for Alice, even if it has been overrun by horrible monsters. The story is dark and quite cleverly written, which really helps to drive the whole game along and keep you wanting to find out more (as if exploring the scenery and cutting up creepy slime-oozing dolls wasn't enough to keep you moving through Wonderland). Collecting memories as you explore your damaged mind helps to slowly reveal the entirety of the story in all its ugliness.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ausmerica/recommended/19680/","Ausmerica","Ausmerica","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ausmerica/","444 products in account","Charming, twisted and beautiful; a 3D platformer set in a darkened, nightmare dreamscape of the Wonderland mythos. Aside from the theme, what sets Alice: Madness Returns apart from other 3D platformers? The answer here would be, without a doubt, the environments. The platforming itself isn't taxing, it's simply the mode through which we traverse the obscenely pretty level design; whether it be the Victorian, smokey and claustrophobic city; the pristine fantasy of Wonderland, contrasted very quickly with a horror-packed perverted version of; a dirty, mechanical Hatter's domain; or an underwater grotto. What of the gameplay? The platforming is fun, and whilst not difficult, it's not dull either, and is often spiced up with some combat - which, with a controller, feels fairly robust, isn't overwhelming and offers a satisfying break from platforming. The story, in collusion with the environments, delves into the sick mind of our mad Alice, spiralling downwards with a half-memory of burning her home, and in the process, killing her family. As is often hinted at, Alice is duelling with real-life turmoil manifesting itself through her fallen-from-grace Wonderland, and therein lies the key element of the game, the pivotal relationship between her unreconciled conscious and unconscious.\nAll in all, Alice: Madness Returns feels cohesive and well put together. The gameplay is solid, but the real reason to play is the journey you'll take.","February 24, 2014","true","24.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This game is about Alice Liddell, and the corrupted Wonderland, through the story you will find facts to remember what happened to exactly her family 10 years ago, why her house burned, if it was just an accidental issue or it was done purposely, Alice will remember more and more things thought the game about her past. Also art style of this game and story are creepy.

It's a beautiful game, with cleaver puzzles, lock-based hack'n'slash combat.\nThe audio is very well done, with excellent ambient music and scores. You play as Alice Liddle, exploring the memories of your past to find who set her house on fire, killing the entire family.\n\nYou can shrink to fit in tight spots, and see things that you normally wouldn't see.\nTriple jump, with a very nice floury effect, floating to those; hard-to-reach areas.\nDashing out of the way is nicely done, turn into a flutter of butterflies then reappear out of harms way.\n\nThe environments were stunning, gorgeous and serene, contrasting to the dark and ominous.\nCut-scenes are fantastic, very well animated. (Love the art style)\nIt's a memorable experience; a game you'll never forget.\nThe minigames are enjoyable and well designed.\nHad puzzles that once completed I thought "damn, that was pretty cool." so I loaded an earlier checkpoint to replay the puzzle.\nMakes me sad that the first game (American Mcgee's Alice) isn't on sale anywhere. Not even on origin.\nControls take some time yo get used to. (if playing keyboard) but it's still playable.\nCollecting teeth will let you upgrade your weapons to make more powerful versions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/recommended/19680/","RJtheShadow","il Duderoni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/","537 products in account","Alice: The Madness returns is a game where the enjoyment of the gameplay and narrative may stand apart from eachother.\nLet's start with the part that  ends up failing: Its platforming.\n\nThere is a distinction to be made between not challenging and boring or tedious. In this game's case, it is the latter when speaking of it's platforming element, the practise of jumping across platforms to reach your destination.\n\nWhile the difficulty of the jumping puzzles does raise slightly, it rarely introduces new elements or methods of thinking that help you pass future puzzles. The gimmick remains simple. Jump platforms until you can no more, shrink yourself to see secret platforms or keyholes, and flick switches and shoot targets to progress further. The implementation of the latter two eventually ends up to be slightly confusing in the last chapter, but not excessively so.\n\nThis simply is a case of a gaming element that is it's weakest part, while being omnipresent. If the platforming wasn´t basically the only method of transportation throughout the game, it could´ve been forgiveable. But right now it becomes a question of whether the game can be redeemed by it's strengths.\n\nOne thing that surely is not one of it's strengths is the combat. A lot of interest from this games comes from people having played the original American McGee's Alice. There, the platforming was somewhat reduced and combat took a much higher priority.\n\nIn Alice: Madness Returns, combat takes a little bit of a backseat. The grand array of weaponry has been replaced with your faithful old knife, a pepper grinder for a quick firing ranged weapon, a Hobby Horse as your heavy attack and a Teapot as a heavy bombardment firearm. Each of these are unlocked throughout the game, and do tend to play a part in progressing the platforming. But not in a Metroidvania style, of course. There's no level backtracking, which is good because that only helps one of the games strengths stand out: The design.\n\nIf there is one thing that the game developers did spot on, it was level design. In many levels, you feel like things have been hand placed. Every area feels unique, and are beautiful in their own respect. Seldom have I felt as enticed to just stop and look at the areas that I pass, as I have with this game. While I will not say that there have been some less interesting corridors, they are far and few between. All in all, the world does not just imply madness, it genuinely invites the player to believe that they are in a world of fantasy, where they can safely forget the rules of reality. And a play on reality this game really is, at least when going by it's story...\n\nThe story of Alice: Madness Returns is not the best I've ever experienced. In the end, it did not make me think deeply or differently about the things that I already knew in life. But it follows three storylines and beautifully merges them together at the right time. These storylines are mainly Alice in reality, dealing with events around her as she tries to manage menial tasks ; her investigation of why her 'Wonderland' is slowly falling to ruin ; and her placing pieces together of her past, the burning of her home and family that left her in this state to begin with. These three branches meet in the end and reveal the final plot, which wasn't very surprising, but very well orchestrated nonetheless.\n\nAlice: Madness Returns is not very good as a game. But as a narrative story that allows some interaction, mainly serving progress, it can manage to suck you in and make you want to finish it. Which is the way that everyone should experience this game:\nPlay it once, enjoy and experience the story to it's fullest and end, and keep that experience with you. But probably not play it again.\n\n\nPriced 10 at time of writing, a 50% off should certainly justify the purchase of this title.\n\nGet this game if you are interested in a good story and are curious about American McGee's version of the Alice universe. Put the game on easy (there are no achievements to speak of) and try to muscle through the platforming, and you'll be rewarded with a worthy storyline, well narrated and voiced appropriately.","September 27, 2014","true","26.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

It's certainly a weird one, so it earns both sides of the argument.\n\nBut here's whats up and why you should pick it up:\n\nThe combat is like the R rated version of Wind Waker and is oh so fun when it shines. I recommend playing on a harder dificulty to increase the visceral satisfaction. Switching between weapons is fluid and natural (Hobby Horse/Vorpal Blade combos are SO satisfying).\n\nThe atmoshpere is astonishing and unsettling in equal measure. The environments are gorgeous but there's always a sense that something isn't quite right, a sense magnified by the very sparse background music and ambient noise.\n\nThe weapon upgrade system is satisfying and gives a purpose to the collect-a-thon style gameplay.\n\nAnd here's some nagging issues:\n\nIt's overstays it's welcome. Seriously, levels stretch on and on and there aren't enough world-specific mechanics to sustain interest. There are multiple times when one can't help but think "alright, I get it. Can we move on now?". Spicy Horse could learn a thing or two from Nintendo's book on how to constantly surprise the player.\n\nThere are some shockingly bad textures in this game, which is so strange coming from a game with an otherwise very strong visual aesthetic. I understand it's an indie title, but more than a handful of other titles have proved that simply being an indie isn't an excuse.\n\nOverall it's an easy recommendation simply because there's not a lot else like it and if the darker aesthetic is something that appeals to you then you're in for a treat.

The graphics aren't necessarily bad though - just not the best. However, the art style is phenomenal. I mean I absolutely fell in love with the creepy environments and character designs. I even bought the art book for this game and have spent many hours going over the Timburton-esque style drawings. - 9/10\n\nAudio:\nDefinitely the stongest aspect of the game for me. If you haven't listed to the soundtrack all the way, YOU NEED TO! Seriously, it's on Spotify, I listen to it al the time. It is unbelievably atmospheric, even just the title screen music is indescribably perfect for the tone of the game. - 10/10\n\nGameplay:\nOkay, so this is where I stop praising the game. It's a bit of a button masher and one of those hack and slash types where the enemies NEVER stop coming even though you got bored of killing them like 5 hours ago. There are several different types of enemies (not too many or too few) that all have to be killed in specific ways. This would be fine if there were more varieties of weapons and/or upgrades for the weapons you already have. You basically end up using the same strategies throughout the entire game to defeat the same types of enemies and bosses are no exception. As for the platforming and puzzles; they're a'ight. - 6/10\n\nStory:\nI'm feeling pretty conflicted about the story because I liked certain aspects (like how dark and creepy both Alice's real life and Wonderland were) and I've always been a fan of the Alice in Wonderland story anyway. However, I was extremely confused about who the real villain was and what my ultimate purpose was throughout the entire game. Though you do find out who the real enemy was all along, I never felt like I fully understood the story even after I finished the game. However, I did enjoy the parts of the story that I understood. - 6/10\n\nReplayability:\nUnfortunately, I would have to say that Alice: Madness Returns has very little replayablility due to it's repetetive gameplay. Though the art style and soundtrack are nothing short of perfection, they can both be appreciated outside of the actual game. Combine the lackluster gameplay with the confusing story and I'm afraid there's not much incentive for a second playthough. Unless, of course, you enjoyed the combat mechanics. 4/10\n\nOverall:\nThough obviously not perfect, I do not regret my playthough of Alice: Madness Returns and would recommend it to any fan of the original game, American Mcgee's Alice. If you can get it on sale, it's a steal. - 7/10.","July 12, 2015","true","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The game is excessively linear and can feel a bit repetitive after the first chapters. There's a lot of platforming sections, and I really think you should use a controller to be more precise with your movements. Also unlocking the 30 fps cap helps a lot because it will obviously make the game feel a lot more responsive. You are also sometimes presented with puzzles and mini-games, but these tend to be very basic and fail to result interesting... some of the mini-games simply outstay their welcome. The combat is fast and feels good, thanks to interesting weapons and some creative enemies. Yet the camera does sometimes go nuts when you lock on targets, it gets stuck in the most unconvenient of angles.\n\nAside from solving puzzles, fighting stuff and jumping from platform to platform, the game doesn't really offer much more in terms of gameplay. It took me 12 hours to finish it on hard difficulty and I have to say I don't really feel like going for a second playthrough. I guess I could raise the difficulty to nightmare, find all the collectibles (they add details to the main story) and maybe change the voice acting to my native language but... 12 more hours are going to feel like a lot of time now that I know how the story unfolds.\n\nThe narrative and writing in this game is what really got me, I think it's pretty good. Many things are left unclear because Alice is costantly in a state of deep mental confusion, so that you are left with interpreting a lot of stuff on your own. Including the meaning of the ending sequence. The developers have revealed what you may call the canonical meaning for the ending of the game, but it doesn't really feel much of a payoff to me, so I am willing to simply reject it in favour of my own interpretation.\n\nAnother strong aspect in the game is the overall graphical design. Every chapter takes place in completely different landscapes, and all of them feel very inspired and sick. The screenshots in the store page don't really show you that much, but this is a game where Alice's mind is on the verge of complete and utter madness, so don't expect Wonderland to look all cute and safe. Even the real world sections are great and succeed in depicting industrial London as a grim, dirty and vicious place. The beginning of chapter 2 is the only part of the game which I didn't like from a graphical standpoint, but that section lasts merely half an hour.\n\nKeep in mind that you will need to activate the game via an EA account before you can play it, and that buying it from Steam will NOT give you access to the DLC and to the original game American McGee's Alice... though it is possible to unlock the DLC by changing a single parameter in the same .ini file that you need to tweak in order to get rid of the fps cap.\n\nTo summarize, avoid the game if you don't like platforming. Do not expect any replay value unless you like hunting for collectibles. Use a controller, enjoy the writing and aesthetics and don't miss the train!","February 14","true","15.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ehlii/recommended/19680/","ehlii","Ehlii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ehlii/","112 products in account","Alice: Madness Returns, the sequel to American McGee's Alice, is an incredibly pretty game.\n\nThat's not the only similarity it has to its predecessor - on many levels it feels like a game lifted straight out of 2000. It belongs to the long abandoned genre of 'action adventure', a careful mix of platforming and combat sections on linear levels with just a faint hint of collect-a-thon. From the very beginning, it's worth adjusting your expectations to this.\n\nIndividually, the gameplay elements are.. well, solid. The platforming is accurate (a triple jump from the very start!), the combat is varied and allows for both melee 'bash them in the face' or ranged 'blow them up from afar' playstyles, and the minigames that show up are amusing interludes. The level design, as mentioned, is linear but once again solid with a hint system built into the very mechanics of the game for when you get lost.\n\nA number of concessions are made to modern game design, for the better, and Spicy Horse should be commended for this. The minigames can be skipped if you don't like them, the difficulty can be adjusted on the fly, and picking up collectables is not needed to progress. Most importantly for me, when the you enter a section of a level the camera pans to where the exit/destination is - and then pans back showing you the route you need to take. This one change alone eliminates a lot of the frustrations I've had with other similar games. A good job was also done in making gameplay mechanics serve a function both in platforming and combat (for example bombs could be dropped in combat for damage/distraction, but also on pressure plates for platforming puzzles).\n\nThe game truly breaks its shackles of mediocrity and blandness in the art design and direction. The levels and areas are simply stunning, many set pieces are breathtaking, and it's clear that a lot of love and effort was put into this. Even when the level design doesn't hold up or gets repetitive, the look and feel of the levels continues to shift and hold your attention, not to mention the things added to 'hidden' areas that the average player might not even find. Moreover, enemy types are made unique to the areas (even if they have the same or similar attack patterns/moves). There truly is an atmosphere to the chapters, and indeed as you progress through the game it becomes ever more unnerving and unsettling. A lot of the atmosphere could be credited to the music as well. Whilst the original game had a much more 'active' soundtrack, this is more ambient and stays in the background, and it fits. As a spoiler, there is a level where you're slowly descending into the heart of a castle (literally) and the background track has the thump of a beating heart worked in, making the experience creeepier.\n\nOn top of all this, there is a plot that is beyond the average. Heavily foreshadowed and sometimes heavyhanded, it still left me feeling uncomfortable and disconcerted. In the interest of avoiding spoilers I won't give details, but suffice it to say that it won't leave you wondering if the game had a writer at all (as some games do).\n\nFor me, this game was right up my alley. My main complaint? The game, much like this review, overstays its welcome, and could have done with being cut down by even a few hours.","June 14, 2015","true","17.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you do too, there might be some frustrating moments when it seems like an adversary wont die. No worries.

It has great controls, great sound, awesome crazy graphics, interesting crazy enemies, awesome weapons, awesome combat, and gorgeous graphics. It is weird and ♥♥♥♥ed up akin to the likes of a Nine Inch Nails video because lord knows Trent Reznor is a ♥♥♥♥ing weirdo. It has great sound: on my 5.1 surround sound speakers it sounds great: the sledgehammer horse pounding into the ground makes my floor vibrate and the peppergrinder machinegun blasting shots off sounds like booming thunder. One of the coolest things about it are the weapons and how they act and look when you upgrade. You get a butcher knife, a hobby horse (like a sledgehammer), a pepper grinder (machinegun), and a boiling tea kettle (like a grenade launcher). Their graphic effects and attacks change as you level them up, becoming more and more cool looking. It is also pretty long, around 15-20 hours or so, which is a nice change because most dumbass SP games are barely over 8 hours anymore. The art design is amazing. It really is a great looking game. It's definitely worth its $20 price tag, and a must buy if you can catch it on sale. Also make sure you google how to easily remove the 30fps cap for a far more enjoyable smooth 60fps experience.","May 4, 2015","true","19.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Controls Feel Great on PC with Key board and mouse, though i believe it is possible to hook up your Xbox Controller. The only problem i have found is that the camera tends to Swing left and right very dramatically while exploring in areas where the developers wanted a sudden change in camera angle (though not game breaking). Jumping from platform to platform and other various puzzles feels great.\n\nArt Style and Presentation is off the chart, this game had some talented designers since every chapter is a diffrent theme, impressive and not even campy. From Bizzare land scapes to under water Habitats, very gruesome killings, body parts, decapitations, hangings, etc  it is all well done, the game puts you into a very immersive ride through alice's Story. Character designs are great, even a Enemy or two actually gave me chills while fighting them, especially in the kids land...*shivers*\n\nTHough the game differs from the 1st alice, it plays really well along with some old returning characters more as Interactable characters and plot devices. With a slew of Toys such as the Memorable Vorpal Blade, The Hobby horse that breaks most if not all gaurds, A shield that knocks enemy attacks back and some long range fire power, there is a multitude of ways to beat your enemies but employing and quickly switching too and fro through all your weapons is a must skill to have if you wish to live long enough on higher difficulties.\nLocking on to enemies is a great way to Focus fire and dispatch weaker ones, i found it more usefull to actually not lock on for bigger fights and use a combo of Hobby horse/Pepper grinder/Rabbit bomb ;D manual fight! dont be a scrub ;D\n\nNow those are some Good points, now lets talk about some downers.\n1. EA registration is involved i believe (i downloaded this game a long time ago but just got around to it, might have changed)\n\n2. 30 FPS, this is the Unreal engine on a PC, why in all that is Sane is it 30FPS? you can unlock it in your Alice Engine file to make it go 60 FPS (you should) then the game will feel like you are in a movie, its incredible. here is a guide http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=235427066\n\n3. Limited Graphical option for being a Unreal Engine game, only AA, Gama, Bloom, and Physix. woop de doo...\n\n4. You ned to unlock the DLC, guide here--->http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=121133044\n\n5. The game tends to Crash/stop and go, this could be with current Nvidia drivers, i have had this GTX660 when i downloaded Alice and played long ago and ran like Butter, but now its having some weird crashes, so im gonna guess its Current patches that botched it all up, not to much of a problem but really sucks to restart. (in short Performance may vary)\n\n6. Akward camera angles when exploring at times when developers change the camera angle on you.\n\n*This game is for everyone who likes fast action Platformers, a moderatly Good Combat System thats not to in depth but enough to have fun, and a Driving Story that actually makes you hunt down for the extra Items for more back ground story to connect and make sense of! Did i mention the Story is full of twist and turns? gruesome scenes? Funny commentary, disturbing spikes of Slaughter, demented children, Tim burton-esk Themes, Prostitution, Acts of violence upon kids?! yes and more! then this is for you!!\n\n\nAlice Madness returns 8/10    * a under dog Game with a Hype Story and game play!\n\nand once the Madness is over...well who is to say...that it is truley is over?   =3","April 25, 2014","true","28.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Nothing really special.\n\nThe major complaints are that it does drag on a bit (the levels could be, say, 25% shorter) and that the auto-targeting issues tend to be an annoyance after a while.\n\nIt's definitely a very unique game I'd recommend playing.","September 1, 2015","true","12.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaobasa/recommended/19680/","Kaobasa","Kao the Space Cow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaobasa/","306 products in account","Madness Returns is an acceptable sequel to the fantastic Alice which was released so many years ago.\n\nThe dialogue in the game is as nonsensical as you'd expect it to be considering the source material and then putting this psychological twist to it where Wonderland is some how Alice's way of dealing with her problems.    It's a tad unfortunate that the game doesn't explore this more beyond just some short cut scenes and the even shorter collect-able "memories" that you can retrieve.  Levels are usually too long and a bit boring also so if you miss one of these collect-ables it's not exactly enticing to go back and get them.\n\nSpeaking of the levels, at face value they seem pretty interesting.  The very beginning of the game has you start out in a lush green forest area with fungi and all sorts of vegetation.   This doesn't last long however as the game quickly gives you the impression that they got lazy.  This is because the level design is quite heavily invested in the platforming.  You'll come upon one area after another that's wide open and is littered with several tiny platforms that you must jump through.  None of it is very challenging and it just feels like it soaks up time.  There's not much to look at beyond the platforms either.  The sky boxes look nice, but that's almost all you'll be seeing for each area.  Unfortunately this is the bulk of the game and it doesn't take long for it to become dull as it feels like a chore.  Another thing that can make these areas last longer than they should is that there are often secret invisible platforms that often lead to the collect-ables.  These are found by pressing the LB button and making Alice shrink in size.  So frequently as you hop through areas you'll have to stop, shrink and visually scan your surroundings to make sure there's nothing you missed.  As stated before these collect-ables give you teeny tiny hints to the story.  So tiny in fact that most of them only last about 3-5 seconds.  It's not very rewarding and there's at least a hundred of them.\n\nI should also mention that there are small mini-game type sections within stages as well.  These are also quite boring and some of them seem slapped together at the last moment.  For example in one section the game changes up into a shoot 'em up style game where you control an under water ship shooting at skeleton fish.  It's not challenging, it's slow, there's no boss, and no power ups.  You just tap the fire button and wait till it's over.  Other mini-games include slide puzzles.  None of these mini-games add anything to the experience.  They just slow down the game.\n\nThe combat in the game is very Zelda-like, as in you target an enemy, wait for an opening and attack and some enemies have a weakness to a certain weapon.  It's alright for what it is.  However many times when there are several enemies to fight picking the one you want can be a hassle and sometimes the camera doesn't give you the best angle.  The weapons are cool though and very fitting for the theme of the game.  Alice has the Vorpal Blade, which looks mostly like a giant kitchen knife, a Pepper Grinder which operates like a machine gun, a Hobby Horse that acts like a giant sledge hammer and a Tea Pot that lobs drops of tea like grenades.\n\nAll in all this is an okay game, but the level design is absolutely atrocious.  At $20 it's a little pricey, I'd pick it up for around $10.\n\n6.5/10","May 27, 2015","true","21.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Alice: Madness Returns takes this definition and constructs around it an artful story of a young woman fighting to reconnect with “what’s in her head.”\nFrom the moment the game starts, I was met with intricate character design and thoughtful scenery; the entire game oozes with wonderfully dark depictions of Lewis Carroll’s beloved incarnation of the imagination. A true treat for fans of the macabre and an artful abomination for others!\nBut enough with this, let’s get to the game itself.\nAlice: Madness Returns is a platformer indeed; puzzles and side-scrolling games are scattered throughout. All are quite nicely done. However, for many of these puzzles ad side-scrolling sections, the controls are not explained and camera angles are off. Consequently, players will be unable to see looming dangers and drops hidden off-screen. A frustrating prospect indeed. Still, not enough to deter players but certainly enough to become quite the annoyance.\nEnemies can vary from easy to challenging. While there is only one true boss-fight in the game, the introduction of many new enemies can certainly seem to be a boss-fight. Players will be forced to learn how to take down new foes. I found the scarcity of true boss-fights to be enjoyable. In my opinion, it was certainly part of the storytelling. Still, I can imagine some gamers may be disappointed by this.\nIn any case, Alice: Madness Returns is certainly one of my new favorite games; taking platforming and storytelling to some interesting places indeed! And, as I’ve said, certainly adding an insightful look on mental illness.\n","May 9","true","104.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The camera angles can be a problem at times. Has loads to do like finding memory’s and bottles as well as pepper pig snouts.\n\nAchievements:- N/A\n\nGraphics:- Graphics are alright could have been better as they do a kind of pop in style of loading. Its dark and strange.\n\nGame Play:- A platform game with a lot of jumping and some action, there’s riddles to solve, puzzles to do, things to find and collect.\n\nStory:- Alice the lone survivor of the liddle house fire, driven mad by the memory your wonderland is in chaos but is that all there is to it?\n\nReplayability:- 6 chapters as well as a new game+ could finish the game 100% in 2 play throughs or just for the story of alice.\n\nWhat Could Be Added:- Would be nice to see some achivments added to this game, give some drive to find everything and complete it on the hardest difficulty.\n\nRating:- 8/10\n","December 2, 2013","true","33.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

I do have a thing for Lewis Carrol's creation and by extension, American McGee's creations in Alice and Madness Returns.  The original Alice was okay, but Madness Returns simply takes off as far as sound design, graphic detail/design, and control.\n\nIt plays almost like a God of War game in terms of combat.  You have light, heavy, and ranged attacks.  The combat is fun and can be challenging.  It is a beautifully grotesque world created in the mind of a mad girl (alice) and the "real" world is something straight out of Sweeney Todd.  There are light puzzling elements and a wonderful twisted wonderland to explore.\n\nMy only regret is that I didn't buy this game sooner.","December 28, 2013","true","18.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Yes! 8/10\n\nAlice: Madness Returns somehow manages to have colorful lands that are still dark, grey and a bit disturbing. The gameplay is a bit hack-and-slash, some shooter, and platforming. The voice acting is great; I love Alice's voice and the Queen of Heart's as well, and I love the Cheshire Cat's the most...so dark and yet a bit soothing.\n\nAlice has a tendancy to be a bit snarky and doesn't respond so dramatically as many female game characters out there, which can be a good and a bad thing at times, but overall she is a well made character who comes across as rather lethal. Depending on te stage of the game her outfit will change which is a nice touch, and her animations are great; attacks fall one after the other without any clipping and move beautifully, dodging is quick and comes with a cool butterfly effect, and jumping and floating seems a bit elegant.\n\nCutscenes are interesting because they are done in a pen-and-ink 2d style that gives the game a book-like feel as it tells you a story about her insanity. They often give insite to her mental state and her past.\n\nMost gameplay takes place in wonderland, but starts off in reality. The scenary changes with each location (and as mentioned before, so does her atire). In reality, the scenery is dark, dank and dreary, and the people of the towns don't exactly qualify for any beauty pagents. Despite their uglieness, their appearance adds to the atmosphere. When you first get to Wonderland though everything becomes colorful and vibrant...then slowly changes to dark, then darker, then even darker yet. Water turns to blood, vibrant green grass turns dead and ugly. Even in areas like the frozen landscapes has its own disturbing atmosphere with frozen animals that have exposed inards. Pleasant, right?\n\nEach area of the game acts a platforming area where you have to run and jump from place to place, pull levers and turning things on and off. As you move around the game you are attacked by monsters and things, and these opponents can get monotonous as you are often attacked by the same things over and over at points. The enemies do differ frm level to level but there comes a point where you'd rather kill something else.\n\nThis game is well done, fun and disturbing. Some of the dialog is a little hard to follow, but its clever and dark and often strange, but remember she is insane and this is Alice in Wonderland (and we're not talking Disney). And as I've said, the voice acting is great so dialogs are enjoyable.\n\nAlice: Madness Returns is well worht the money.","January 22, 2014","true","8.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InnerConflict/recommended/19680/","InnerConflict","InnerConflict","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InnerConflict/","291 products in account","Ladies and gentlemen,\n\nwelcome to Ms. Liddell´s magic land, Wonderland, where not all seems like it once were. A mysterious train shackels Wonderland and Alice tries to fínd out what´s behind it. Alice Madness Returns is a mystical, atmopsheric 3D- sometimes 2D Plattformer with casual tactic combat and puzzles. Levels filled with collectibles and levels designed so lovefully you wish they wouldn´t have been so repetitive in reaching your goal just for the sake of the game becoming a masterpiece\n\nLet me tell you the dangers and the wonders of wonderland:\n\nBefore entering the rabbithole make sure to read these:\n- 30 FPS Lock which you can easily break legally. [.ini Tweak]\n- NASTY EA Online activation DRM!\n- Long stretched levels due to repetitive patterns in objectives, puzzles and combat.\n- Gameplay might not be hard enough for experienced players.\n- Mediocre to annoying combat lock, camera during firefights and 2D sidescrolling plattforming.\n- Only users of nvidia cards with good physx performance will experience the great physx effects in combat and levels as it MASSIVELY drains performance on anything else. Can be turned off in the graphics options.\n\nOptions: Controls with mouse and keyboard are clunky, use definitely a controller! Audio, control schemes, key bindings, are all the normal standard with average options to configure. Graphics are less so but due to the game being a console port it´s obvious.\n\n\nWonders:\n\nAs Alice´s story begins with a doctors appointement in which you soon realize our dear girl has fallen mentally ill, escaping to wonderland, her internal magic place which some of us would indentify with the subconscious or in general our mind, you find yourself wondering about what´s going to happen. That train I mentioned earlier, plays part of this story´s main reason of sickness, as well as all the other figures you will meet are involved in your madness. Hatter, Caterpillar, Crazy Alice, Peaceful Alice, the Queen, and many more. From here I just wanna stay at that and tell you that this game´s story is mainly spicked with highly creative and traditional english vocabulary, animated paper art cutscenes, many wonderfully designed crazy characters and a badass heroine searching for her own salvation. Wonderful and beautiful story with interesting characters! Less story than gameplay though.\n\nWhile the story is great, the level art and chapters which are in total five plus prologue and epilogue, are even better! The soundtrack fits the levels and mood perfectly and often even dominates the games atmopshere. Breathtakingly beautiful landscapes and also deep dark and obscure bloody dungeons, cathedrals, castles, bridgeworlds, iceworlds with a mix of lovecraftian charme, and so on, overflow your screen. It´s literally a masterpiece at that! The levels though follow the same pattern all the time. It gets really repetitive mid through the game. The combat keeps entertaining as new enemy types appear throughout each new chapter. Dodging might be too powerful but at least the gameplay during combat is better than most crap out there and doesn´t rely on stuns and locks all the time. But you also don´t need to parry or counter as well, simplifying combat a lot. Plattforming as in jumping on trampoline shrooms or valves blowing out steamstreams shooting you upwards your next plattform. It´s all very fluid and smooth, yet also too easy 3D Plattforming. Puzzles usually are easy too and offer no real challenge. The level design tries to keep you entertained with the enemies and combat, new plattforming challenges and events, but it can´t hold it all together. You meet characters who you need to rescue or help in order to proceed, but with average 15 hrs playtime and 20 doing the collectibles I found myself swearing, "WHEN DA♥♥♥♥ DOES IT END?!". The last bits being more challenging and entertaining, change into the same repetitive pattern too eventually, making your once anticipated trip end into an still amusing when also tiring task to complete. There is not much interaction in the real life parts of alice ensuring you know immediately to just run and progress.\n\nThe game has weapons such as the peppergrinder which acts as a gun, the good old teacannon, your trusted blade and a hobby horse which acts as a hammer, equipped with also a explosive rabbit device you fight and travel through the chapters. Some enemies need to have their defenses taken down while evading others, shooting down ♥♥♥♥♥ babies and flying dollface blobs. Creatitivity conquers even the most simple designed combat. If you want to complete this game make sure to ignore the useless collectibles and just aim for either the useful ones such as teeth with which you can upgrade your weaponry or the memories which give more insight into alice´s life as she tries to recollect her memory. There is not much more to the game than that, satisfying combat, repetitive 3D plattforming, maddening 2D plattforming and genius level art.\n\nI´d recommend the game to everyone who wants to have a once in a lifetime experience in video game history. A very mediocre designed, yet geniusly crafted one. If you want to play this game be sure if you are going to buy it for more than 10 bucks, as it probably is a game tiring to finish, but at least it was worth the trip. Weed is recommended at all times, LSD and shrooms too.\n\nThis game really plays inbetween being too long and repetitive and being still entertaining and beautiful enough to keep one either entertained or bored. Make sure you watch an Let´s play before playing and decide afterwards. There´s also a much creepier and more challenging predecessor of this game just called: Alice. It´s one of AmericanMcGee´s (Quake, ex id Software employee and famous game designer) previous works. Both these games are pearls between pigs.\n\nOST playlist:\nhttps://youtu.be/Atht5YI5ZhM","January 7","true","15.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The environments are truly stunning, lending real depth to the tortured imaginings of a fragmented Wonderland. The story line is dark, engaging and entirely adult despite the youthful protagonist and fantastical thematics. It's twisted and downright brutal in places, and I particularly enjoyed the gothic stylings of the game.\n\nHowever, having just completed this game, I'm actually quite disappointed, and it's hard to explain why. I should have really enjoyed this game as it's something that's normally right up my alley - beautiful graphics, interesting story, developed characters and relatively easy-to-learn gameplay that's just the right mix of gaming, cut scenes, puzzles and combat.\n\nThe major problem for me is that Alice: Madness Returns is actually much more fun to look at than it is to play. I could spend hours looking at the pretty graphics and backdrops but actually negotiating the levels got downright repetitive - if you like jumping from platform to platform then this is the game for you, because that's about 90% of the gameplay. It's fun at first with the triple-jump and float functions, rendered as they are with butterflies and graceful effects, but after a while you do get bored of doing the same thing over and over for five long chapters where the only thing that really changes is the scenery, and Alice's dress.\n\nThe combat style is pretty simple to learn but can be difficult to master - the odd target lock function leads to weird camera angles and can frustrate you when there are mutliple targets. Most battles end up being fairly frantic but the game does force you to think tactically when facing multiple foes, as you will need to employ different weapons to defeat certain enemies. To its credit, it's not the straightforward hack n' slash that I'd first anticipated. The enemies have a good range of abilities and tactics to counter, though it would be nice if there was a bit more variety in appearance - okay, doll's heads are creepy, but after a while you do become immune to the terror-inducing effects of black goo with an empty-eyed doll's head for a face. Adding more doll's heads does not make it creepier. Just harder to kill...\n\nThe game does suffer from a number of well-documented bugs, just check out the community hub, which solved 99% of the problems for me. These did not make the game unplayable but did detract a lot from the enjoyment and flow of the gameplay, particularly an inability to access one of the weapons for nearly all of the first chapter in my case without having to exit the game and/or reload from my last save point.\n\nAnother thing that I found incredibly irritating was the minigames - for some of them the switches in artwork/style/gameplay seemed a refreshing change at first, but then you realise it's just more jumping from platform to platform, just in a two-dimensional or other such different setting. On some of them the camera angles are so odd you end up having to work towards the camera with no clue as to where you're going or what you're supposed to be doing. "Maybe that's the challenge!" you may cry - true enough, but it's pretty annoying when you can't see where you're going and you end up dying a dozen times before you work out where the next platform is in relation to where you are. Some of the smaller puzzles, which involve chess pieces, or playing a tune, can be skipped entirely without affecting the game play, so there seems little point in them at all.\n\nHidden objects are strewn throughout the game, but there's no real impetus to find them all unless you happen to be really into your extra features/concept art/character profiles. Perhaps if the game supported Steam Achievements or some other such reward it might have been worth spending more time searching out these items, but after a while you will probably decide it's all more effort than it's worth - after all, it's not like you're short of platforms to be jumping to and from in the main storyline.\n\nI do recommend this game, though, simply for being a visual spectacle and an interesting, dark, really screwed up story line. Definitely one to purchase during a sale at a heavily discounted price, as I did - I think I'd be much more disappointed if I'd paid full price, especially given the minor bugs, the repetitive gameplay and the many small irritants that made this game a lot less enjoyable than I'd expected it to be.\n\nOh, and at the risk of a spoiler, don't expect any "big boss fights" until the only one that comes at the very end of the game. It teases you by making you think there will be some, but each chapter usually just ends with a cut scene that doesn't explain anything and tells you to go talk to someone else instead. Now go jump across some platforms to get there...","August 1, 2014","true","25.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Been excited to play this game for some time now.\n\nImpressions: When you are dealing with a place called Wonderland you really need to give people a sense of wonder. A:TMR does some really interesting stuff with Lewis Carroll's base material and adds it's own twists that compliments the imagery established in the first game. In short it's dark, twisted and does everything right that Tim Burton's film got wrong.\n\nThe Good:\n* The grim 'reality' of Victorian England is grotesquely exaggerated.\n* Glorious and twisted Wonderland is the perfect counterpoint.\n* Some absolutely gorgeous visuals, outfits and backdrops.\n* Thoughtful plot with cues and callbacks if you pay attention.\n* Honours the design, voices and locations of the original.\n* Weapons have impact and look great.\n* Voice acting is decent throughout, huge improvement over original.\n* 24 hours plus game play.\n* Shrink/Hint mechanic is fun and helpful.\n* Very linear but lots of content keeps you wanting to progress.\n\nThe Bad:\n* Lots of jumping puzzles, but few are particularly hard.\n* Enemy lock-on makes encounters feel samey.\n* Killing enemies is repetitive, use the same tactics over and over.\n* Limited range of weapons and upgrades could have been more visual.\n* Dark themes, visuals and language are not for everyone.\n* Shrink mechanic could have been more diversely used.\n* Hint mechanic can be too helpful.\n* Hidden items rarely challenging to obtain.\n* Retry system sometimes takes you back further than at other times.\n* Side scrolling sections are unchallenging.\n* Feels slightly 'console port' like but not overly so, plays well with keyboard\n\nRecommended for: Fans of the first game. Those who like twisted and dark fairy-tales. The 15 age rating seems about right.\n\nConclusion.\n8/10. Great fun to play and explore with some interesting encounters for those that like their fairytales with a hint of gothic about them.","July 6, 2014","true","20.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Because for many of us, our most recent memory of the character Alice is bleached Disney.  For me, there was a G rated nostalgia barrier I needed to break through to fully immerse myself in the experience.  Embracing the dark connotations that Alice: Madness Returns has to offer was effectively my rabbit hole.\n\nThe environments and overall feel for the gameplay pay a solid tribute to that N64 era of three dimensional platformers.  From hidden collectables to Alice’s environmentally adaptive dresses, the developer’s attention to detail is apparent throughout. Further supplemented with artistic story-book-style cutscenes and well executed phasing to/from Alice’s mundane real world existence.  I found myself stopping to paint the rosses and taking an excess of screenshots.\n\nI highly recommend this title to all platformer loving gamers.  9/10.","August 25, 2014","true","20.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

However, keep in mind that it has no achievements, which (in my opinion) takes away the sense of self-improvement for completionists. So you found all the memories/bottles, upgraded all the weapons and finished the game in nightmare difficulty? That's cute and all but it won't be engraved in your profile. Ever.\n\nLooking for a challenge? Think twice, because Alice: Madness Returns might not be for you. Why? Because Nightmare difficulty is a disappointment (and boy am I gonna get thumbed down for saying this). It won't spawn more enemies, it won't give them more HP, puzzles won't be harder... and it won't take away the constant hand-holding factor in the game (clues everywhere and the Cheshire cat appearing out of nowhere, telling you exactly what to do).\nOriginally posted by you:		Well, what the hell does Nightmare difficulty change then?	The damage you take from enemies.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThat's all it does.\n\nAnd given that there are no achievements, you're better off enjoying yourself, playing in whichever difficulty suits you best and finishing the game in a 100% solitary experience. However, if you can see past these major flaws, the game is quite an enjoyable experience that I'd recommend to anyone.\n\n\nNoteworthy	In order to get rid of the peasantry in this game, go to "Documents\My Games\Alice Madness Returns\AliceGame\Config", open AliceEngine.ini, find "MaxSmoothedFrameRate=31" and change the 31 to your monitor's refresh rate (60, 120, 144, etc.)\nBest played with a controller","March 31, 2015","true","27.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dististik/recommended/19680/","dististik","Mahou☆Shoujo!!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dististik/","29 products in account","This game is awful. Let me start off by saying that I wanted to like it. I had wanted it for years and when I finally got it for a gift I was estatic because I've been wanting to play it for so long. The concept is beautiful, the horror atmosphere with the unique weapons and gothic take on Wonderland appealed to me more than anything. But then I played it on Nightmare mode.\n\nI assumed through my vast experience in playing insanely difficult games that I could handle Nightmare mode (and 13 hours in I'm still convinced that anything lower would have been too easy) right off the bat. In playing Nightmare mode, as unforgivable as I expected it to be, I slowly grew to despise this game and can safely say that I will never purchase or play another Spicy Horse game after this.\n\nWhy is the game awful? Well, here's why:\n1) Clipping - Clipping is usually something that's never an issue in video games. Usually the developer understands that it's better to underclip and make a few objects that a part of the terrain mere textures so that the area is easier to move through for the player and removes the problem of the terrain being an issue during combat, puzzles, anything at all really. In Alice: Madness Returns the clipping seems uber random and is the one of the most annoying things about the game. Every single texture is a part of a clipped object. Literally all of them. I'm sure there may be a few of textures that aren't clipped, but from what I've seen, every single thing is clipped. So what? Well, now, in the middle of fights you'll get randomly stuck on gravestones or in the middle of a shinking puzzle you'll get caught on the edge of an invisable platform and oops, because of that error you're either dead or at the beginning of the puzzle again.\n2) Hitboxes and Colision - The hitboxes in this game are gigantic and the way hitboxes colide is infuriating. The hitbox for every attack is 100% garunteed to be larger than the animation for the attack, the hitbox of Alice is bigger than she is so the already large hitbox of the attack easily hits you unless you've made an awkwardly large amount of space between you and your oponent. The hitboxes of the enemies? Also overly sized. This means that while you're already getting caught on every single surface, you're also getting caught on every single stationary enemy. Lovely.\n3) Checkpoints - I want to punch whoever decided where to place the checkpoints in this game in the face. Let's look at an example: In Chapter 3 once you get into Wonderland, you're faced with a large enemy as a part of learning how to use a new weapon you just obtained. The enemy is uber strong and on Nightmare mode can kill you in a single hit (though Nightmare mode is the hardest difficulty, so I expected that to happen; I am in no way complaining about the damage the enemies deal). Once you beat that enemy? Checkpoint. Great! I won't have to redo that terrifying fight. Then I do a few parts of a jump puzzle, fight a pseudo-boss, do more jumping puzzles and - oops - ten minutes past that initial checkpoint I died. Ah, that's alright, there's no way I didn't run into another checkpoint, right? Right...? Wrong! Back to the beginning of the chapter you go! I shouldn't have to explain why that's annoying.\n4) Jumping Physics - I still don't even understand them. Ever since the first jumping puzzle I haven't been able to understand them. The "Float" mechanic that you're allowed to use after a jump that replaces an extra jump (you can jump three times mid air, which I found to be way more useful) is useless, Jumping mid-air does nothing after your first mid-air jump while the rest just... I don't even know, prolong the inevitable fall? On top of that, every time you land you slip all over the surface you just landed on which makes the jumping puzzles insanely annoying.\n5) Forced Fights - Forced fights in a game aren't bad. They make the player have to face the strong enemies and learn how to conquer them, and I like that. But when 99% of the combat in your game is forced, you're doing it wrong. When some of your fights are clones of previous fights in the game and they're still forced, you're doing it wrong. When your fights require memorisation in order to clear on the hardest difficuty, you are doing it wrong. Essentially the forced fights in every chapter work out like this: First, introducing a new enemy that's kinda difficult that you have to learn your way around. Not really that hard, usually beatable in the first try. Not a problem. Second, locking you in a room with that new enemy and a pseudo-boss. Kinda annoying, but the hierarchy of threat is pretty clear in this game, so not impossible. Towards the end of the chapter, locking you in a room with at least two pseudo-bosses and a rapid income of high strength grunts. This is annoying - no - infuriating, and in some cases impossible unless the perfect series of events occur.\n\nThis game is not worth $20. This game is annoying, infuriating, and I would be upset had I spent real money on it.","November 24, 2015","false","15.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"

As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research. It is a shame I have to put up these notes telling people what they should already know on to do their own, but due to inflammatory commentry, I do.\n\n\nOkay, so I wound up playing this game for 5 hours straight and absolutely love it. From the beginning, this game is artsy, gothic, surreal, creative, inventive, and a bit disturbing. The beloved fantasy realm Alice used as her escape from reality-from life-is thrown into chaos, mirroring the once innocent girl's now tomented mind. Through stunning and disturbing imagery we can see what Wonderland once was, what it has become, and what it is turning into. The camera and movement controls are just as perfect as directional buttons and a joystick, so those used to PS3 like myself had no problems adjusting. Gameplay is fluid, colors are vibrant to dull, sharp to blended, and the attention to detail is perfect. There is nothing boring or dull about this game as it really takes hold or your senses of sight and sound, keeping your brain stimulated and your reflexes ready.\nMy only complait about this game is that there is no camera sensitivity controls and during in-game play it's kind of fast, out of gameplay it's slow. Other than that this game is worth the money for more than just the gameplay, but the experience as well.","July 14, 2013","true","37.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game runs on UE3 and that's both a good thing and a bad thing. The good thing is the visuals are great. The bad thing is it's buggy and still to this day I hate the engine's habit of not pre-loading the textures. For a split second, Alice looks like a lip-less pile of flesh on the main menu. Game runs at 31 FPS by default and you must tweak the ini files to get 60+ FPS and unlock on disc DLC. Clear signs of this being a direct console port with no love for the PC crowd. Game is very buggy and the devs never bothered patching the game. How about you patch your existing game before going to kickstarter for that third Alice game, eh, American?\n\nStory is interesting but the acting is spotty. Not sure the awkward voices were intentional. Art is very impressive with some gothic feel. However there are some areas that look bland. Gameplay is okay but some areas are too repetitive with lengthy platforming sections that basically lets you do the same thing like jumping on mushrooms, entering keyholes and switch levers.","April 24, 2013","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DudeDesigns/recommended/19680/","DudeDesigns","DudeDesigns","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DudeDesigns/","254 products in account","The sequel to 2000's American McGee's Alice.\n\nMadness Returns brings the thirdperson-platformer to hack'n'slash territory, with fluid like combat, and easy to learn controls.\n\nThe games graphics are far more styilized compared to the first game. Sure this one is a decade ahead in terms of graphic capibility, but the overall style and tone is much more cartoonish, which I actually think aids the games narritive. The original was dark and depressing because that game was just that. A dark and depressing variation on the novel.\n\nHere, the world of Wonderland is drastically more colorful. The combat is rather basic, but it's simple enough to not get in the way. This isn't a game that really needs combos. There are a few, and they do do more damage, but that's about it.\n\nOne of the negative aspects I feel of the game is that you only have 5 weapons. You have the Vorpal Blade, the classic Knife Alice used in the first game, the Hobbyborse, which acts as your strong attack that can break defenses, a timed Rabbit bomb which can press down weighted switches and deal explosive damage, a Pepper grinder that can be used as a longranged attack, a Tea-Pot cannon, which is a strong explosive ranged attack, and the last one is the Umbrella. The umbrella doesn't really count as a weapon, you just use it to deflect projectiles back at certian enemies.\n\nSince the game has a hack'n'slash perspective, the limited arsenal is understandable, but can get a tad bland late in the game. The game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing long. If it's your first time, you may spend well over 24+ hours on it depending on what difficulty you play on. And that's all just in one sit down, nevermind the amount of time you may put off on it. Part of this problem is that the chapters are so excessivley long. Chapter 1 took me around 3 1/2 hours the first time I played the game, simply because I wanted to explore everywhere.\n\n\nThe enviroments are absolutely breathtaking. The game runs on Unreal3, but they really took advantage of it. The Vale of Tears, The Hatter's Domain, Queensland, and Cardbridge are all stunning to look at. It's an absolutely gorgeous game and one that demands to be played at max settings.\n\n\n\nAmerican McGee is an amazingly creative individual, and shows that he can once again bring the magic back to Wonderland for a second romp. It's drasticly different combat mechanics may put off fans of the original, but as a sequel, it's absolutely fantastic, and I could recommend this to anyone. Even if you haven't played the first game.\n","March 6, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're constantly given snippets of back-story via various collectibles so there's a big sense of immersion.\n\nThe downsides are that this game is riddled with bugs. I didn't suffer the umbrella issues that many report but the game crashed to dektop at least once per playthrough. As with many EA games on Steam there are no achievements or trading cards. Controller support is passable but not all on-screen prompts have been updated (which is odd considering there's an Xbox 360 version) which often leaves you struggling to locate the buttons for new abilities/weapons.\n\nOverall it's an enjoyable romp through the scenery but with 70% of terrain being moving platforms of one sort or another it cann leave you feeling like you're in one big jump puzzle. I enjoyed a single playthrough but there wasn't anything that made me want to go back start a New Game +.\n\nI'd recommend getting this in a sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/recommended/19680/","albertrayon","albertrayon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/","1581 products in account","Alice: Madness Returns is an action platformer inspired by Alice in Wonderland. This is a follow up to American McGee's Alice, and shares the same style. That style is what this game has in spades. It stars the Alice in Wonderland characters, but in a very grimdark/steampunk universe. If that is your cup of tea, then this game is definitely for you. If not, then take a closer look at the gameplay to see if you would like this.\n\nThis game is a very linear action platformer. You will be ushered along from point A to B in mostly constrictive environments. Along the way, you will battle baddies with you selection of weapons (blade, hammer, pepper gun, umbrella) and look for collectibles. Collectible teeth can be saved to upgrade your weapons. The other collectibles have no noticeable effect apart from filling in some backstory. Combat can be quite exhilirating at times, since the enemies are varied and are thrown at you in different combinations. You will definitely have to use dodging, blocking and switching weapons to succeed. I mostly stuck with the Vorpal blade since it seemed to be the quickest, although some enemies require the Pepper gun to create openings. Learning enemy patterns is also very necessary to survive. The combat can also be very difficult at times, which would not normally be an issue, but if you die due to enemy attack you could be set back several minutes in progress. Checkpoints save automatically, but on more than one occasion I found that after dying I had to complete several sections of platforming just to get back to the battle. This can be quite annoying, especially since if you happen to fall during platforming you are usually just sent back to the platform you fell from. I do not know why they are different checkpoints for each, and I would much prefer just starting again from the beginning of the battle. The platforming controls are tight and fun, with double jumps and floating at your disposal. You know you made a mistake when you fall, and that is all you can ask for.\n\nThe graphics are definitely a selling point, especially if you are a fan of steampunk. Everything is heavily stylized, with only Alice having a hint of being realistic. There was some noticeable slowdown in certain areas, especially during battles. Framerate came to a stutter a few times, which is odd considering I can run most newer games from 2014 in medium-high settings and this game came out in 2011. The music and voice acting are all very well done. Once again, if you like Alice in Wonderland or steampunk you will probably really enjoy the dialogue, but if not, well it can be quite silly at times.\n\nI would recommend Alice: Madness Returns to all those that are huge fans of action platforming, or like the idea of a steampunk Alice in Wonderland. While it is not the best of its genre, it is worthy of a try if you really like those types of games. I found myself not terribly interested in the story, but I am just not a fan of that style and i won't hold it against this game. People that are only mildly interested in platforming might want to look elsewhere first.\n\nGrade: B-","June 29, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Wonderland, this game takes you on a adventure into depths of Alice's mind, which in it's current state, is a pretty devasted place. A:MR is a typical platforming slasher, similar to Devil May Cry but a little less complicated - combos are limited, there's not much special attacks etc. Fighting mechanism, though limited, is based on finding enemies' weaknesses and using them, which on higher difficulty levels (I played on Nightmare) can be a bit tricky to pull off. Throughout the game, you're able to use 5 types of weapons (with a very interesting design), given to you on various stages of gameplay.\n\nFights are extremely satisfying, challenging and well-balanced. The only aspect of fighting which I didn't like was targetting (by default set to Caps Lock), as it sometimes messes with the camera.\n\nPlatforming aspect of the game lacks a little comparing to similar games. There are a lot of invisible walls, meshes and textures which block your path (best example being straight floor with a little crack in it which you have to jump over) or places where you'd think you can jump to, but you can't. Also, Alice's ability to dodge mid-air, which makes your jump longer, sometimes doesn't work properly, making you dodge into the abyss rather than forward.\n\nAll of those though, become forgivable, when you take a look at scenery and level design. I've never seen world more beautiful and grotesque in a video game. There's always a challenge of some sort in your path, which makes the game enjoyable throughout the ~17 hours gameplay (on Nightmare difficulty). Every chapter is different, introducing new lands in Wonderland and what comes with it - new enemies.\n\nThe most important thing is the plot. Grotesque, fascinating and magical at the same time. I can only say that you must save Wonderland, to save yourself, and vice-versa.\n\nPros: gameplay, plot, atmosphere, fights, visuals, Alice and Wonderland\n\nCons: invisible walls (!), targeting during fights, places which you might find reachable in fact are not, a little bit of general "bugginess"\n\nAll in all: 8/10","July 2, 2014","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're constantly given snippets of back-story via various collectibles so there's a big sense of immersion.\n\nThe downsides are that this game is riddled with bugs. I didn't suffer the umbrella issues that many report but the game crashed to dektop at least once per playthrough. As with many EA games on Steam there are no achievements or trading cards. Controller support is passable but not all on-screen prompts have been updated (which is odd considering there's an Xbox 360 version) which often leaves you struggling to locate the buttons for new abilities/weapons.\n\nOverall it's an enjoyable romp through the scenery but with 70% of terrain being moving platforms of one sort or another it cann leave you feeling like you're in one big jump puzzle. I enjoyed a single playthrough but there wasn't anything that made me want to go back start a New Game +.\n\nI'd recommend getting this in a sale. It was certainly worth the £2.50 I paid for it but not a great deal more.","November 25, 2013","true","19.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It feels very powerful to be swinging around a giant unicorn mace.\n\nThe gameplay is where this game falls short. The entire game is mainly (I'm not joking) jumping puzzles. While there are story bits here and there, the game is full of annoying, repetitive jumping puzzles. Other puzzles include moving tiles to match an image, and these are often ♥♥♥♥-easy.\n\nGraphics are pretty good too (Unreal Engine), and offer the perfect balance between beauty and horror.\n\n7/10, would buy on sale.","June 26, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This takes you through American McGee's grim take on Alice's story.  This is actually a sequel to a previous game, but I played through and enjoyed without knowing that.  The artwork and dialogue/voice acting in this game are great.\n\nIn essence, it's like a 3D platformer with good story and art behind it.  The gameplay is essentially simple battles, simple puzzle-solving, and a ridiculous amount of platform-jumping.  The amount of platform jumping really frustrated me, but I had to just deal with it to see where the story ended.  There is a basic upgrade system and there is DLC available (embedded in the game files) if you'd like to replay the game differently, many of the extra outfits for Alice change up the gameplay well.","June 26, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Personally I played it more for the art rather than the gameplay, but that's just how it appealed to me. Both the combat and the "graphics" are great. The game's combat can be challenging for an adventure type depending on the difficulty one plays the game at, and if one refrains from abusing the teapot cannon *wink, wink*. There are a few puzzles of average difficulty, but they can even be skipped if the player is so inclined. The game encourages the player to look for secret's and solve puzzles as they give one a clearer idea of what's actually going on in the story, but it tends to not be required in order to advance in the game. All it serves to acomplish is to give the player a clearer idea of what happened in Alice's past that lead up to the mystery that drives the game. The story is pretty dark and some of it is left up to one's own interpretation, but overall the game gives you a fantastic plot that has some great twists. The cinematic's are fantastic and ample throughout the game (but not annoyingly so) and the art style varries for the different cultures expirienced in it as well. Everything about it services to create a very ineteresting expirience that the player won't soon forget.","June 26, 2014","true","36.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

She suffers from a trauma which effects hear reality.\nShe often goes into the Wonderland. She suffers from this because of a fire in her family house when she was young.\nShe lost her whole family to this fire and therefore suffers from the trauma. But something is different. Her Wonderland suffers from destruction and madness. In the game she figures out what really happened in the night of the fire.\n\nPinpoiting the game to 1 Genre is nearly impossible because it has so many different ones.\nJump & Run, Hack & Slay, Puzzle, 2D, 3D, Action, Fantasy, Horror.\nI rarely seen a game with so many different influences. I really enjoyed it. The game got never tedious because of this great variety in gameplay. But the main aspect of the game is the Jump & Run and Hack & Slay gameplay. She has to pass several levels. To do so she has to jump and run, fight against monsters or solve riddles and puzzles. Or sometimes just explore the world. I really like the fighting system. Its really addicting for me because it has a learning curve. The game might be difficult to new players. I in fact died very very often when playing this game the first time. What helped me was a controller though. I dont think mouse and keyboard work well in this game. You have several weapons to attack the monsters like a blade or a pepper mill machine gun. You also have to dodge the attacks of the enemies either with an umbrella or just vanishing and appearing somewhere again. This game definitely needs skill! There are also many secrets and collectibles in the levels which are fun to explore and collect.\n\nThe whole game runs on the Unreal Engine 3 and it looks really beautiful!\nI rarely seen such amazing designed worlds. Especially the PhysX effects give the game an own touch.\nHowever, those can be quite taxing. Not even my GTX 970 could maintain 60FPS on High PhysX settings.\nI only had like 5% of the game slowdowns or whatever so mostly it went totally fine.\nSadly the game suffers from some annoying stutter from time to time. Like all 5 minutes it hangs for a sec and then continues playing. This is not that bad and I got used to it. I dont know what exactly is causing it. Maybe the texture steaming system of the UE3 or PhysX or even EAs badly and horrible implemented copy protection.\n\nPostive:\n- Very nice and diverse gameplay\n- Interesting Story\n- Never gets tedious or boring\n- Addicting fighting system with learning curve\n- Beautiful designed worlds and artwork in general\n- Stunning PhysX effects\n- Nice and fitting soundtrack\n- Nearly totally bugfree, even without any patches, since none have been released\n- Limited Edition content can be activated with an easy ini edit\n- Steam version automatically unlocks the game on EAs Origin aswell\n\nNegative:\n- Some small performance and stutter problems\n- Annoying EA copy protection which needs an EA account\n- The Steam version misses additional content like the American McGee's Alice HD version.\nCheck out my guide to obtain the HD version\n\nRating: 8.5/10\nI really enjoyed this game. In fact this game was one of the best of 2011. It was totally underrated by gaming magazines for whatever reason. The art design was just so beautiful and sick at the same time. This game is not meant for young people! I mean it seriously.\n\nAlso make sure to check out the first Alice. It might be a bit dated but its just as beautiful.\nWouldnt mind a remake of this one!","March 20","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's weird and twisted, sometimes bloody and violent, and makes for a very fun journey, if not the most polished one.\n\nGameplay is a mix of platforming and combat, both of which are so-so. Never too frustrating but never feeling especially engaging. The real strength is the setting and backdrop, exploring deeper and deeper to find out what creepy surprises await you as you press on.

Back in the day, it was well known for his beautiful graphics with a very nice horror vibe, a haunting soundtrack by Chris Vrenna and a great story. And these parts of Alice: Madness Returns as just as great as in its prequel.\n\nThe game continues the story of the alternative Alice we met in 2000. After the events in wonderland Alice is being released from the asylum and now lives in London under the care of Dr. Angus Bumby. She still suffers from her traumatic childhood memories and returns to Wonderland in search for comfort - but Wonderland once again changed accordingly to Alice’s psyche and a new threat to the whole land has risen.\n\nMadness Returns plays very similar to that of its predecessor, as in most of game consists of the player exploring Wonderland, fighting enemies, and navigating the environments along the way. The game is a great platformer, giving Alice the abilities to double jump and float. To make her way through Wonderland, Alice has to locate switches to open doors or make a new path available. Other means of furthering her progress include shooting flying pig snorts with a pepper grinder, shrink herself to fit through small (key) holes and place and detonate the clockwork bomb.\nSome obligatory minigames round the game up - though they are either interesting or annoying (mostly the latter).\n\nThe game is definitely fun. I personally enjoyed the ties to the old game, the way of telling the story through Alice memories she finds along the way that are filled with metaphors and hints to the events in Wonderland.\nThe gameplay can be repetitive, but is still enjoyable and fits into the nicely done levels and lore.\n\nThe game looks beautiful and has a very unique atmosphere that sucked me right in. Wonderland is interesting, though it could have been more lore-intensive. There aren't that many things to discover you wouldn't see in the main storyline.\n\nSadly, this game seems to be quite buggy. There are a variety of problems reported by the community, but most of them have an easy work-around.\n\nAll in all, I recommend to get this game on sale if you're interested in a unique story with a beautiful setting and if you're fan of platformers.","March 12, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The animation is absolutely beautiful, the music is splendid, the mood and atmosphere is creepy and chilling etc, the enemies are terrifying, and aesthetically it is absolutely great. I could foresee the fighting becoming menotomous, but so far it's extremely enjoyable and runs pretty smoothly. A lot of people complain about the controls without a controller (which worried me greatly,) but with my Anker gaming mouse, i can just set the dpi way down and it works great. I'd also reccomend (if you go the mouse option, which would require a gaming mouse, not just any off-the-shelf wireless deal) setting some of the utilities to programmable mouse buttons (instead of [Caps Lock] i've set the lock-on to one of my thumb buttons, along with the shrink and dodge. i'd recommend this game if you're looking for a pretty standard platform/hack-n-slash game with a good story and creepy feel. just a protip: when you use the mushroom-trampolines to jump, dont hit [spacebar] until you've reached the max hight of your bounce, otherwise you will waste the jump and wont be able to double-jump as effectively.\n\ntl:dr- beautiful game, pretty standard gameplay, mouse and keyboard works if you have a programmable mouse (low DPI), and i reccomend this game","March 10, 2014","true","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I will keep the review simple, list of pros & cons below.\n\n+Unique artstyle, creepy, eerie & dark is what it's best described as.\n+Game runs fluid for me, 60+fps all the time (a few stutters do happen mainly when starting a new level or due to physx)\n+Physx is amazing, dust, particle effects & other things all move around when touched.\n+Various locations to explore, half the time you'll end up just gazing at the wonderfully done environments & backgrounds\n+Platforming is actually fun and not tedious, you have the ability to double jump & hover.\n+Cheshire the cat and his quotes\n+Various enemies will be encountered along your adventure\n\n+/- repetitive combat, while I didn't mind it others will be bored to death because you're mainly doing the same moves over & over. You do have some different weapons to take on enemies, the vorpal knife & hobby horse for light/heavy melee attacks, pepper grinder & teapot cannon for light/heavy ranged attacks and an umbrella for deflecting some ranged attacks back.\n+/- Game takes about 9-11 hours average to complete, while I thought it was a decent length, it might overstay it's welcome to some\n\n-Some ugly graphics up close\n-Needed to edit a file to unlock framerate\n-Previous game not included\n\nWould definitely recommend this game to people who like Alice and/or adventure platforming games with a unique artstyle.\n\nPC SPECS\nGTX 980ti\n4790K 4.4ghz\n16GB DDR3 Ram","March 18","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

She suffers from a trauma which effects hear reality.\nShe often goes into the Wonderland. She suffers from this because of a fire in her family house when she was young.\nShe lost her whole family to this fire and therefore suffers from the trauma. But something is different. Her Wonderland suffers from destruction and madness. In the game she figures out what really happened in the night of the fire.\n\nPinpoiting the game to 1 Genre is nearly impossible because it has so many different ones.\nJump & Run, Hack & Slay, Puzzle, 2D, 3D, Action, Fantasy, Horror.\nI rarely seen a game with so many different influences. I really enjoyed it. The game got never tedious because of this great variety in gameplay. But the main aspect of the game is the Jump & Run and Hack & Slay gameplay. She has to pass several levels. To do so she has to jump and run, fight against monsters or solve riddles and puzzles. Or sometimes just explore the world. I really like the fighting system. Its really addicting for me because it has a learning curve. The game might be difficult to new players. I in fact died very very often when playing this game the first time. What helped me was a controller though. I dont think mouse and keyboard work well in this game. You have several weapons to attack the monsters like a blade or a pepper mill machine gun. You also have to dodge the attacks of the enemies either with an umbrella or just vanishing and appearing somewhere again. This game definitely needs skill! There are also many secrets and collectibles in the levels which are fun to explore and collect.\n\nThe whole game runs on the Unreal Engine 3 and it looks really beautiful!\nI rarely seen such amazing designed worlds. Especially the PhysX effects give the game an own touch.\nHowever, those can be quite taxing. Not even my GTX 970 could maintain 60FPS on High PhysX settings.\nI only had like 5% of the game slowdowns or whatever so mostly it went totally fine.\nSadly the game suffers from some annoying stutter from time to time. Like all 5 minutes it hangs for a sec and then continues playing. This is not that bad and I got used to it. I dont know what exactly is causing it. Maybe the texture steaming system of the UE3 or PhysX or even EAs badly and horrible implemented copy protection.\n\nPostive:\n- Very nice and diverse gameplay\n- Interesting Story\n- Never gets tedious or boring\n- Addicting fighting system with learning curve\n- Beautiful designed worlds and artwork in general\n- Stunning PhysX effects\n- Nice and fitting soundtrack\n- Nearly totally bugfree, even without any patches, since none have been released\n- Limited Edition content can be activated with an easy ini edit\n- Steam version automatically unlocks the game on EAs Origin aswell\n\nNegative:\n- Some small performance and stutter problems\n- Annoying EA copy protection which needs an EA account\n- The Steam version misses additional content like the American McGee's Alice HD version.\nCheck out my guide to obtain the HD version\n\nRating: 8.5/10\nI really enjoyed this game. In fact this game was one of the best of 2011. It was totally underrated by gaming magazines for whatever reason. The art design was just so beautiful and sick at the same time. This game is not meant for young people! I mean it seriously.\n\nAlso make sure to check out the first Alice. It might be a bit dated but its just as beautiful.\nWouldnt mind a remake of this one!","March 20","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

True to the vein of Alice McGee's first game, this beautifully macabre depiction of a different Wonderland will have you slashing and bashing through six lengthy chapters. If you're looking for plenty of exploration and collecting then this gorgeously rendered title is right down your alley.\n\nPros:\n-Gorgeous graphics which still hold up after five years\n-Memorable characters and settings\n-Gritty horror interchanges seamlessly with beautiful decors\n-Challenging platforming and battles\n-Long, rich gameplay with plenty to explore and collect\n-Lots of three-dimensional movement freedom\n\nCons:\n-Somewhat frustrating camera especially during combat\n-Limited arsenal/upgrades\n-Bit of a basic combat scheme, but very satisfying\n-Very forgiving checkpoint system, might not appeal much to those looking for higher challenge\n-Frame capped and a little unoptimized, might not run as smoothly on older machines (so I've heard)\n\nThe story comes with brilliantly simple and fun minigames that are all woven into the main experience in a way that makes sense but sometimes leaves one to wonder if they weren't pushing for too much, however, it all plays out nicely. I couldn't help but notice that some parts felt stitched in later on leading me to assume it got rushed at one point.\n\nEvery location feels like it's made with love and with an attention to detail, with a large and colorful variety of enemies to dispatch. A rich in-game collection makes up for the lack of achievements, and will most likely have you replay it a second time somewhere down the line.\n\nAll in all, Madness Returns is a big and beautiful, action-packed, sometimes frustrating but overall rewarding experience with a twisted story that combines both body and psychological horror which is bound to tickle your cravings for a solid action-adventure game.","March 11","true","29.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I did want to finish the game, but I'm not interested in re-playing 40 hours worth of the game. This issue aside, it's perfect if you're interested in experiencing a new, creepy twist to Alice in Wonderland. It's primarily a puzzle game, but the 3D aesthetic, unique mobs, and challenges makes it more addicting than it seems. The game is pretty lengthy, but it's a great time waster, at least. There are a few minor bugs and glitches, but they aren't too bad to the point where they get in the way of the gameplay. While there are several other twisted versions of Alice in Wonderland out there, this is by far my favorite.\n\nMusic: 10/10. I noticed the tunes played for every arc fits the mood and situation perfectly. It tops off the twisted wonderland feeling.\n\nControls: 8/10. I used a controller to play, so I can't say much about keyboard controls, but I was able to get the hang of it without any issues. Some of the control settings aren't the most convenient, but they're doable.\n\nGameplay: 10/10. Puzzle games by themselves probably don't sound very appealing. However, this game is the full package. There's a well done story, the 3D aesthetics are well done, and the chacter, mob, and setting designs have clearly been thought out and pushed the limits of creepy. Despite this being a horror based game, you can see that subtle enchanting affect popping up here and there. There are tons of other small details about the game that I love, like the unusual weapons and outfits changes.\n\nGraphics: 8/10. It looked a bit choppy and could use some smoothing out, but the creators did a great job in terms of visual affects.

(If you haven't played Psychonauts and you like this game, then you need to get on that.)\nNegatives would be the lack of options for camera controls (no invert horizontal camera), and the targeting system is very lame for how often you have to use it. Your target will basically lock on to whatever it wants and you cannot switch it directly, you have to turn it off and on (toggle or hold) until it catches onto the target you want, and often when surrounded by a ton of enemies, it's not going to typically lock on to the one you wanted. Then when you're locked on you cannot change the camera angle at all! This is fine when you just need to take out a bunch of mobs at ranged, but not when they get up close. This became extremely frustrating towards chapter 3. Melee/close range is flawed.\n\nAlso the blocking ability does not have its own button when you play on a controller. you MUST be locked on to something to bring out your blocking umbrella. And if "locking on a target" is acting up, then good luck trying to block anything in time, as you must also be standing completely still to block. Your umbrella does make you basically invincible when you are able to bring it out in time.\nTIP: Also get that DLC early, you just need to lookup what line to change from False to True in some text file. Easy but dumb that you have to do that. The alternate dresses you can unlock are really overpowered so if you have trouble, just use one of those.\nThere's some parts I wish weren't cinematics, they take it away from you and make you watch the little movie instead of letting you get to complete the bosses. That's kinda anti-climactic. The game definitely doesn't have enough real boss fights, just tons of "mini bosses" or over powered mobs who become redundant.\n\nThose are all my biggest complaints, these types of flaws wouldve been so easily fixed if they did slightly more testing or even a patch.\nOther than that, I definitely recommend the game if you're into surreal stories and you like platforms.","August 11, 2015","true","29.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did want to finish the game, but I'm not interested in re-playing 40 hours worth of the game. This issue aside, it's perfect if you're interested in experiencing a new, creepy twist to Alice in Wonderland. It's primarily a puzzle game, but the 3D aesthetic, unique mobs, and challenges makes it more addicting than it seems. The game is pretty lengthy, but it's a great time waster, at least. There are a few minor bugs and glitches, but they aren't too bad to the point where they get in the way of the gameplay. While there are several other twisted versions of Alice in Wonderland out there, this is by far my favorite.\n\nMusic: 10/10. I noticed the tunes played for every arc fits the mood and situation perfectly. It tops off the twisted wonderland feeling.\n\nControls: 8/10. I used a controller to play, so I can't say much about keyboard controls, but I was able to get the hang of it without any issues. Some of the control settings aren't the most convenient, but they're doable.\n\nGameplay: 10/10. Puzzle games by themselves probably don't sound very appealing. However, this game is the full package. There's a well done story, the 3D aesthetics are well done, and the chacter, mob, and setting designs have clearly been thought out and pushed the limits of creepy. Despite this being a horror based game, you can see that subtle enchanting affect popping up here and there. There are tons of other small details about the game that I love, like the unusual weapons and outfits changes.\n\nGraphics: 8/10. It looked a bit choppy and could use some smoothing out, but the creators did a great job in terms of visual affects. I couldn't pass by a new place without taking a screenshot because there was simply so much to look at and admire.","May 18","true","39.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I purchased it because the design looked so irresistable beautiful. And I didn't have to be disappointed. The world is awe-strickingly beautiful, crazy in the sense of fantasy and highly original. The running speed and jumping capabilities are really pushing the whole flow of the game and make Alice a sort of superhero. I played Borderlands 2 after Alice and I couldn't get rid of trying to attempt the double jump, that was so well embed in Madness Returns that I felt disabled from the lack of this feature in other games.\n\nI consider gaming an escapist hobby and Alice: Madness Returns has taken hold of this idea and put it to use. Alice travels between two worlds: the real world, which is a dark, distorted, unpleasant and dirty place while the other, Wonderland is a colorful, bright, interesting place where Alice gains superpowers - a true escapist vision and understanding of balance between fantasy and reality. And it's yet another aspect that upgrades the game once you discover that the creators have thought about it.\n\nSome negative aspects:\nThe game had an issue with the fighting script, especially when you were surrounded by several enemies. Executing the malee attack command caused Alice to either attack in the wrong direction or deliver several uncontrolled attacks. This put the player in a tight position because it's not a particularly easy game and every health bar was on count. This problem became more and more of an issue in the second half of the game.\n\nVerdict:\nThe game was and Experience with a capital. It was fun, the flow of the game was very enjoyable, the puzzles were challenging, the fighting script has potential for improvement but overall the game has great replay value.","August 18, 2014","true","27.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Struggling with her own mind you venture through her insanity and pick up the puzzle pieces together with her, figuring out what's really going on, what really happened. It felt refreshing and great to play as a young woman and I think many women will feel the same, she is fierce, witty and most of all, capable.\n\nNot only is her world and mind extremely beautiful, you will find many allies and really enjoy the combat. The world is so visually stunning and well thought trough. Her world is lurking with secrets and absurd creatures, and it is up to you to figure all this crazy mindboggling stuff out.\n\nIf you're looking for a game were absurd and crazy comes into mind this is really the game for you. The combat is simple but yet very satisfying and easy to enjoy and learn. It is a casual game that's hard to not fall in love with. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.\n\nWould absolutely reccomend this game.","February 1, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Please note that an Origin account is needed to register this game: if you already possess an existing account simply log in, otherwise you may need to create an account just for this game to run.\n\n... Played American McGee's Alice way back when it was first out... Recently in the past few years, I replayed it and though it lacked in the graphics department, still delivered in gameplay, story and overall atmosphere... I would recommend playing it if you find the time.\n\n... Alice: Madness Returns adopts the same atmosphere: gritty, dark, sinister and demented, even going as far to use similar art styles and level designs... While linear in gameplay, there are still the additions of secret and mini-puzzles that can be overlooked, and while combat only becomes a challenge on hard difficulty and up, you will most likely be dying from all the jumping and falling you will be doing... Yes, almost the entire game consists of navigational jumping and platforming, much like the first one... This in my opinion gives the game its charm and unique difficulty curve in today's games, as most tend to stay clear of this: to me it helps one to really stop and pace yourself, as well as look for alternatives methods of completing your goals.\n\n... I touched briefly on the combat earlier, and the combat is very similar to most hack and slash games like DMC and Bayonetta, though a bit more washed down and lacking a rating system... The addition to actively dodge and time your attacks in a crowd works well, and the Hysteria berserker mode when health is low really helps keep the fighting fast and menacing.\n\n... I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the old game, as well as those who are looking for a decent length game with a moderate challenge, unique dialogue and an almost tangible darkness one can enjoy.","July 28, 2014","true","47.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've played the first game, but was happy to find that you really don't need to in order to fully understand what's going on in this one regardless. The level designs are beautiful and well thought out, but some of the jump puzzles are a real pain. I love how Alice's dress changes to suit the levels; it was a nice touch on a great game. The characters in the game are a well thought out twist on the characters from the books and the voice acting is *phenomenal*. Being a fan of the original books, I like how they've chosen to represent the characters and their respective lands.\nThere are a few things I don't care for, though. The controls can be clumsy and it makes it difficult when fighting hoards of enemies. Sometimes the weapons will lock up and not let me switch them out, as well.\nOverall it's a great game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/knycoa/recommended/19680/","knycoa","knycoa#11774","http://steamcommunity.com/id/knycoa/","77 products in account","I've decided to update my review of this game after reading a few others' on the hub and ultimately agreeing with them. I'll try not to spoil anything for those wishing to purchase the game.\n\nFirst off, let me say I absolutely adore this story. It has definitely influenced my life as I, like Alice, feel that I often cannot escape my mind's tricks.\n\nAlice: Madness Returns is a much maturer, darker themed sequel to American McGee's 2000 game (*note: I have not played this*). We follow the story of Alice Liddell, whose childhood emotional trauma causes her to "fall" into hallucinations of Wonderland to escape the horrific reality playing out before her. She follows the sly and cryptic messages from the Cheshire Cat, who acts as our mentor through the game.\n\nWe begin by learning that Alice's family had perished in a tragic fire many years ago and the guilt still haunts her to point of insanity, despite being released from Rutledge Asylum a year ago. A ripe age of 19, Alice resides at an orphanage for the mentally traumatized, under care of Dr. Angus Bumby. It is in the first few scenes that my interest was tickled; the characters' appearances and graphics were very unique, bar a little odd to the eye. The atmosphere is not welcoming, with much younger orphans throwing taunts as we pass by. Alice's interactions with different characters indicates that she is still very much an outsider.\n\nAfter running an errand we encounter some creepy looking creatures that cause enough anxiety to fall back into Alice's safe haven, Wonderland. I think it's fair to state, this is where the true beauty of the game lies. The scenery, sound, graphics, colour... There's just SO much to see and spam F12 at (you're lying if you didn't). Just take a look at this screenshot[web-vassets.ea.com] and tell me you're not entranced. . This is Wonderland. But, sadly, it's not all butterflies and rainbows.\n\nAlice soon discovers there is a force outside herself that is causing the destruction of this once beautiful place; the Infernal Train. We venture through different stages of Wonderland, the first of which bring unique combat features, familiar faces from the original story and foes. However, as the game progresses and you've hit a few hours, you'll begin to see a pattern. It seems that the developers wanted to just drag us through the middle chapters and on to the end. I personally felt like I was doing the same level for hours at a time. The only thing that changed was maybe the scenery. Same foes. Same combat. Same old objective.\n\nThat being said, it definitely picks up towards the end. There's typical Alice in Wonderland features included that are necessary to continue ("eat me!") and some challenging moments with the bosses. There are also infrequent moments where Alice's mind switches back to London where her real self has been, well, out of it. These are scenes which I found interesting and wanted more of, as they often contained hidden explanations. It's all very fascinating to watch it unfold, but I felt that the time spent in Wonderland was too much, often finding myself pausing for a moment to remember where I'd actually last been in London.\n\nOverall, the ending was very satisfactory. After being admitted back into the Rutledge Asylum, in which many disturbing scenes play out, we make our way back to meet our ultimate foe, the Dollmaker. I personally did not realise the true identity of the Dollmaker for quite a while, as I had not made the time to collect many memory capsules along the way. The scene between Alice and this character was another interesting boss battle, with some unexpected moves catching me out and posing a challenge. As a result of this confrontation, we are overwhelmed with the despicable truth behind the Dollmaker's real-life counterpart. Alice's actions portray the true extent of his cruel betrayal here, however we're not treated with any gory details. We can deal with her brain being drilled into and scenes implying prostitution, but not blood and guts? Guysssss pls. I expected a full-blown revenge, instead I got a clumsily animated and out-of-time kaput.\n\nIn conclusion, I, for one, am very much looking forward to the next instalment, Alice: Otherlands! I leave with you a final perplexing quote from our friend, Cheshire Cat: "Only the savage regard the endurance of pain as the measure of worth. Forgetting pain is convenient, remembering it agonising. But recovering the truth is worth the suffering and our Wonderland, though damaged, is safe in memory... for now."","September 9, 2014","true","21.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

Read the game description for the detailed version of the synopsis.  Pretty much Alice has gone mad and can't let go of Wonderland.  If you thought Wonderland was crazy it's even crazier in this game.  The storyline and gameplay is really good.  The game design is excellent.  It has a mix of beautiful and dark environments, the enemies are cool and original (creatures not found in the Lewis Carroll story).  The gameplay is similar to the 3D Mario games and Tomb Raider games.  There's lots of parkour elements, puzzles, hidden items.  There's a storyline but the gameplay is mostly getting from A to B while jumping obstacles and fighting enemies.\n\nMy only complaint is that when you aquire a new weapon/skill the game gives you instructions on how to use it, which is fine, but instructions are always PC controls.  If you're playing with a controller you have to hope the game will tell you afterward what to do on the controller.  For example, when I aquired the umbrella the game gave me instructions on how to use it with keyboard controls but using the controller I had to press everything until I figured out how to use it. (Which is A while in focus mode).  Other than this I can't find anything wrong with the gameplay.\n\nPros:\nStoryline\nGraphics and art\nGameplay\nUnique enemies\nAn even more twisted version of Wonderland\n\nCons:\nSome on-screen control instructions are defaulted to PC controls.  If playing with a controller you sometimes have to press everything to figure out what the controls do.  On a good note though, all the basic controls are mapped in the options menu.","February 8, 2015","true","17.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Please note that an Origin account is needed to register this game: if you already possess an existing account simply log in, otherwise you may need to create an account just for this game to run.\n\n... Played American McGee's Alice way back when it was first out... Recently in the past few years, I replayed it and though it lacked in the graphics department, still delivered in gameplay, story and overall atmosphere... I would recommend playing it if you find the time.\n\n... Alice: Madness Returns adopts the same atmosphere: gritty, dark, sinister and demented, even going as far to use similar art styles and level designs... While linear in gameplay, there are still the additions of secret and mini-puzzles that can be overlooked, and while combat only becomes a challenge on hard difficulty and up, you will most likely be dying from all the jumping and falling you will be doing... Yes, almost the entire game consists of navigational jumping and platforming, much like the first one... This in my opinion gives the game its charm and unique difficulty curve in today's games, as most tend to stay clear of this: to me it helps one to really stop and pace yourself, as well as look for alternatives methods of completing your goals.\n\n... I touched briefly on the combat earlier, and the combat is very similar to most hack and slash games like DMC and Bayonetta, though a bit more washed down and lacking a rating system... The addition to actively dodge and time your attacks in a crowd works well, and the Hysteria berserker mode when health is low really helps keep the fighting fast and menacing.\n\n... I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the old game, as well as those who are looking for a decent length game with a moderate challenge, unique dialogue and an almost tangible darkness one can enjoy.","July 28, 2014","true","47.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've played the first game, but was happy to find that you really don't need to in order to fully understand what's going on in this one regardless. The level designs are beautiful and well thought out, but some of the jump puzzles are a real pain. I love how Alice's dress changes to suit the levels; it was a nice touch on a great game. The characters in the game are a well thought out twist on the characters from the books and the voice acting is *phenomenal*. Being a fan of the original books, I like how they've chosen to represent the characters and their respective lands.\nThere are a few things I don't care for, though. The controls can be clumsy and it makes it difficult when fighting hoards of enemies. Sometimes the weapons will lock up and not let me switch them out, as well.\nOverall it's a great game. I guess 'enchanting' would be a good word for it, since it's absolutely beautiful and has its own distinct personality. 9/10 I really recommend it.","August 29, 2014","true","18.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story premise is also very interesting, yet the pacing and dialogue falls a tad short for me in the game.\n\nIt's a good sequel to the original, and people looking for a nice romp through a dark game will find it enjoyable, as will those who like 3D platformers.

The platforming feels tight and I never had any issue with the controls other than the camera in a couple of spots but adjusting the camera fixes it easy enough.\n\nThe combat is basic hack and slash combat with a small variety of weapons to use such as a teapot, a knife, a pole horse and an umbrella. Each weapon is used in its own unique way and is needed for certain situations both in combat and for progressing through levels. Each weapon works differently from one another, for example the knife is quick but does weak damage where as The horsepole is strong but slow.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics in this game are very well done with sort of a steampunk goth horror style. Whether it be the dark streets of london or the beautiful mushroom forests of wonderland, this game knows what it wants to be. Its beautiful eye candy when it needs to be and digustingly creepy when it needs to be. Each chapter is very unique with its own setting and visuals. The levels are cleverly designed using things that would be naturally found in the environment as part of the platforming, such as steam from pipes working as sort of a boost between platforms in the factory levels.\n\nCharacter designs are unique and well done, with each chapter having its own unique characters, some being better than others. I personally enjoyed the mushroom forests and the card castle levels.\n\nAudio\nThe Audio is decent with the voice acting being very hit or miss for some characters, however the voice they chose for Alice was a perfect fit. Not sure if it was the same voice actor from the first game as I never looked into it or not, but they sound similar. The level audio is well done and makes the levels feel living and tangible.\n\nStory\nThe storyline is a dark one continued from the first game. However you do not need to play the first game to really enjoy this game, as I actually played through this one first without even knowing about the first game. I have since went back and played the first game and although it does help to understand the story slightly better, it is not needed.\n\nYou play as Alice who is a mental mess after her family dies in a house fire with alice being the only survivor. Events lead to Alice thinking she was the one who started it and blaming herself for the death of her family. This in turn does weird and disturbing things to wonderland, which is Alices sort of world in her head she can use to escape from reality. After noticing wonderland has gone into array and is in a very dark time, Alice sets off to find out wahts behind it and solve the issue and save wonderland as well as herself.\n\nSummary\nIf you are a fan of steampunk/Gothic horror visuals then you will love the setting of this game. The storyline is pretty well done and will take you through a variety of different chapters, each very unique from one another and no you do not need to play the first game to understand this one, as I actually played this one first. The platforming controls feel tight and fluent, however the combat can feel a little bit stale with it basically being a hack and slash format. You have a small variety of upgradable weapons with Some being needed to take down certain enemies.\n\nThis is definetly a game I would recommend with fun platforming and so many unique worlds to go through and explore. There was so much eye candy in this game, I couldn't stop taking screenshots. The game is decently long at around 12+ hours nad a variety of hidden collectable items can keep you playing even longer.

You have a small variety of upgradable weapons with Some being needed to take down certain enemies.\n\nThis is definetly a game I would recommend with fun platforming and so many unique worlds to go through and explore. There was so much eye candy in this game, I couldn't stop taking screenshots. The game is decently long at around 12+ hours nad a variety of hidden collectable items can keep you playing even longer. Worth it at full price.","February 6, 2015","true","13.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This happens on both the Steam version and the Origin version, and did not improve with a cracked version of the game either.\n+Relatively short experience\n+Combat camera can be exceptionally clunky at times\n+Boss fights are generally easy, even on the hardest difficulty.\n\nOverall: 9.5/10, but sadly, as a huge fan of this game, the PC version suffers from slowdowns even on very high end computers (tested with a 4770k/GTX 980 and had the same issues.)","March 10, 2015","true","34.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This games was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing! The game is about Alice, a girl who watched her parents burn in a building and was lead to believe it was all her fault. She remember the one time she every went to Wonderland, it was horrid. She never wanted to go back until one day an old mysterious lady leads her back into the wonderous land. She is stuck inbetween reality and fiction. She must fight her darkest nightmares to escape this dream. You play as Alice, with many different upgradable weapons. Each world you get a new dress, and are put against new enemies, the game is very diverse and has a non-linear game style. The art is done beautifully, the dark twist to the classic makes for a great story.\n\nPros ~ Art was done greatly\nFighting was always fun and simple\nAlice with a dark twist? ♥♥♥♥ yeah!!!\nStory was awesome\nThe cat :3\n\nCons ~ Some parts of the game got confusing\nGame had a few bugs\nThe game switches between Wonderland and the real world very weirdly\n\nSo all in all, I give it a 8.6/10, Game was great, never once wanted to stop, made me feel great and spooked :O\n","July 4, 2015","true","16.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

By which I mean you're constantly looking past the fact that she keeps treading on your toes, and at the end of the evening you're glad that you got to do it, but also kind of faintly let down.\n\nSo the game is interesting visually, with lots of colour, and the slow destruction of that vibrancy into a Tim Burton-esque Victorian London. I actually really enjoyed the black goo and the fire damage and the ebbing away of light, even if it was a little ham-handed in it's lack of subtlety.\n\nThe combat and platforming are fine - they're entirely servicable and combat in particular feels nice and responsive, but it's all very repetitive and nothing really interesting happens to shake things up. And, while the world seems large and entirely open, invisble fences artificially shoe-horn you along the plot.\n\nMy biggest issue - and it isn't really an issue, I just didn't really dig it - was the plot. The reveal is about as obvious as the screen in front of you, and yet it's teased so relentlessly. There's no real need to spoil it though, since you'll figure it out in the first 10 minutes of the game.\n\nSo yeah. It's a fun enough game, and definitely worth the price if you get it for a couple of pounds, but don't expect to fall in love - your bruised feet will be sore for a good couple of days.\n\n","February 9","true","14.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The graphics are very good for its age and most of the time, the combat feels great.\n\nHowever, every level feels the same as each other, with just a different skin dashed over the same mechanics, the same platforming, the same monotonous puzzles and honestly this is where the game completely lost me.\n\nThe story is barely there, the game feels drawn out purely for the sake of stretching playtime as it adds nothing to the story and when you've killed 1000 black baby blobs, you've killed them all and it starts to become a chore more than actual fun.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the game, on a technical level is objectively ♥♥♥♥. The performance is dire when compared to any other game from 2011, the numerous glitches forcing me to kill myself in order to restart the section because some how a giant monster is walking on air and it won't die, the slight jolt in game rendering as it places "moving objects" at the incorrect moment just adds to how frustrating this game is and ultimately killed it for me.\n\nSee, that is the worst thing about it, if you would have given me this repetitive but stylish game in a better engine, I would have been happy and would have more than likely completed it, but as it is, it's a repetitive, annoying, broken slug fest and that is a damn shame.","May 28","false","9.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I very much enjoy this game to the deepest part of my heart.","April 9, 2014","true","26.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

If you're like me, you probably looked at the screenshots and and trailer and thought "Damn, this looks like a good game". It is. It's exactly what you think it'd be like; exactly how it appears. Not only that, though, it's chock-full of dark humor, morbid moments, "WTF??" experiences, and some of the most beautiful and awesome views, scenery, and environments I've ever seen in a game."\n\n\nSince then, I've played a lot more...and damn, this game just keeps getting better and better. I'd rate it among one of the best games I've ever played, actually.  And it's a very looooong game too. I've spent 14 hours on it so far and I'm not even close to halfway through it yet.  You definitely get your hours worth for this game....an easy 20-30 (and maybe more)  hours worth of game for the price\nThis game is excellent.","November 18, 2012","true","38.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SweetRollExplosion/recommended/19680/","SweetRollExplosion","tiffany♡","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SweetRollExplosion/","75 products in account","This game is horrendous. Incredibly buggy, poor platforming design, the jumping must be so precise that it makes this game twice as long as it needs to be. You will die a TON if you are even slightly off with your timing. Tedious, my god is it tedious. This game is a chore, I'm so far into it at this point I'd like to just finish it, but every step of the way is incredibly painful and time consuming. I've played almost 16 hours and I'm only halfway through.\n\nPros:The game is very aesthetically pleasing and colorful. I've always really liked American McGee's take on the Alice in Wonderland tale.\n\nThe invisible platforms are a pretty neat idea.\n\nCons:Bug\nCertain platforming areas I've likely spent half an hour on just to get across to the other side. In the section where you must free the souls in the Lost Souls Locker, some of the platforms will glitch out and get stuck at the bottom if you've failed and died too many times. Of course you don't want to redo the entire section so you must let yourself die some more until the platforms actually start working again.\n\nBug\nThe side scroller mini games are also terribly buggy. I use shrink to dodge some fire cannons and of course it gets stuck in shrink mode, meaning I cannot jump and therefore must start the entire mini game over again.\n\nBug\nYou must change your key bindings in the config file as well as going back and changing them in game. It doesn't recognize your changes if you only do it in game.\n\nBug\nThe cube puzzles only let me move one piece up or down. I cannot select any other piece surrounding the piece I just moved therefore making the puzzle impossible to complete.\n\nPoor Game Design\nOh, you've just completed a really difficult part and then died soon after? Welp ♥♥♥♥ you because this game only auto saves (that's the best feature of the game btw). You must complete the entire section over again ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nPoor Game Design\nWhatever health you have is all the health you get when you are going into a boss battle. I was not warned that I would soon be fighting a Colossal Ruin so I didn't know that I needed to heal myself. I had 3 health going into battle and needless to say, died many times. Even when I died and restarted the battle it still did not give me any more health than what I had going in. Design flaw.\n\nPoor Game Design\nA very minor gripe I have is that when upgrading weapons it doesn't tell you exactly what is being upgraded. The weapon looks different but you aren't exactly sure if it does more damage, has a shorter cool down time, faster firing speed, etc. You just have to hope that it would upgrade all of those things ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nIf you're looking for a scary, thrilling game, this is not it. The enemies are more obnoxious and monotonous than scary.\n\nI really wanted to enjoy this game, but it's horribly disappointing.","January 7","false","24.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

However everything else is utterly shameful. Enemies are not there to present a demanding challenge as they are a horribly boring obstacle on your way to encounter just another senseless fight. And its mostly fighting the basic enemy in different versions (Ruins), annoying you the whole game instead of giving space for other enemies (Card guards were the most enjoyable ones). Puzzles are so stupid, you'll bash your head against the head hoping for more mental activity. You can fail only because of poor controls. Oh, the minigames... an atrocious attempt to make the game richer making it only even more dumb and empty. The story, dialogs, cutscenes, all of this is a bunch of plain and childish writing culminating in a "finale" of zero thrill, zero emotion, I could not care less. I was happy that this game and its frustrating save system ends. Alice: Madness Returns is a resentful sequel to American McGee's Alice and I deeply hate it.","July 13, 2015","false","24.4"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","16","31","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shafatR/recommended/19680/","shafatR","Raysh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shafatR/","655 products in account","Alice Madness Returns, whilst being quite derivative in it's gameplay, counteracts much of it's unoriginality in that department, by presenting us with a disturbingly delightful rendition of Wonderland, and of Victorian England. If you're looking a for a game with unique visuals and solid if derivative gameplay, Alice Madness Returns might just be for you.\n\nAlice Madness Returns is technically a sequel, though it makes few allusion to the previous game, and really, just knowing of the original Alice in Wonderland story should provide enough background for what happens in Madness Returns, and in case you're still lost, there is an in game "Previous on Alice" writeup, which explains this version of Alice's history. It is , all in all, perhaps the most disturbing rendition of Alice, though it still feels more faithful in tone than the most recent Disney adaptation.\n\nIn Madness Returns, you follow Alice Liddell, who, after being released from Rutledge Asylum, is sent to Dr Bumby's therapy sessions, whereafter she starts relapsing into her fantasy of Wonderland, though apparently things are awry. Alice must find out what is happening and stop Wonderland from falling to pieces, for bother her and Wonderland's sake. While the themes of madness and insanity is briefly touched upon (and when it is, it is at its best, from a narrative standpoint), the overarching story, and the conclusion kind of come out of the left field, with little foreshadowing, or any real reason to be (other than, for the "Oh Twist" moment). For the most part the story sort of serves as a push to the next level, and it never quite reaches the depth or complexity that you kind of expect it to. In the end the story, while disappointing, is still serviceable.\n\nGameplay in Madness Returns, while not it's strongest suit, is still surprisingly solid. Its a third person action hack and slash platformer, with platforming and hacking and slashing being distinctive segments of gameplay. Platforming is actually quite fun, with Alice being able to jump a total of four times in the air, and still glide for a distance. She can also shrink, allowing you to find secrets and solve puzzles, and also put down a clockwork bomb to destroy barriers blocking her way, overall giving quite a variety in movement and options in exploration, allowing for some interesting design.\n\nCombat is another beast entirely. There are four weapons in the game: The Vorpal Blade - a fast, but light attack, The Hobby Horse - A heavy but slow attack, The Pepper Grinder - A machine gun of sorts which does little damage per shot but fires quite quickly, and The Teapot Cannon, which is a slow but powerful ranged artillery shot. The weapons are almost never not used, as each different enemy might require a different sort of attack, such as large Hulking Ruins being able to block the fast attacks from the pepper grinder and vorpal blade, but can still be hit by the hobby horse and the teapot cannon. Combat generally is quite fun and varied, and some different sections are thrown in to keep it fresh from level to level.\n\nWhere the game really excels is it's absolutely brilliant artistic design. The game has some of the most imaginative landscapes, that are both beautiful, and sometimes extremely macabre and disturbing. While it graphically might not be the most impressive ( at least not technically), it's still one of the most creative, artistically stunning imagery seen in a video game, and sometimes you want to keep playing just to enjoy more of the surreal landscapes of Wonderland. Even the grim depressing reality of Victorian England is unique, with caricatured exaggerations of many of the characters, is still unique and offer a great contrast with Wonderland.\n\nUltimately, Madness Returns is a aesthetic treat, and while the story has interesting ideas, and the gameplay is derivative, both aspects are solid enough to recommend this game.","November 16, 2014","true","17.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I never found the jumping and fighting incredibly fun (Although it can be a little fun sometimes), the keyboard and mouse controls stink, the game has some optimization issues, sometimes the jumping is wonky as well as the game having frequent loading times. On top of that, the game runs at 30 fps unless you hop into the config files and change some stuff, which is a bit bothersome.\n\nDespite these issues, it's still one of my favorite games I've played in a long time. The story, the view on Alice's mental state, and the presentation of this game make it all worth the trouble. Wonderland is a broken mess, and so is Alice in a lot of ways. Wonderland is falling apart and a destructive force is barrelling through the land, tearing everything apart and threatening to destroy Alice mentally. Meanwhile in Victorian London, Alice struggles with finding answers to her family's death in a fatal fire. Frequently, Alice slips between London and Wonderland, switching between trying to find answers from people she knows, and looking within her memories, respectively.\n\nWeaved through all of these events is an odd mix of disturbing and beautiful environments that you'll be jumping through and fighting all sorts of nasty beasties in in your search for the truth. As the game goes on the environments become more gruesome, further signifying the slippery slope into madness.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys an interesting story and more interesting art. The platforming is alright, the combat is sometimes pretty fun, and the aesthetic is incredible. Just remember to look up how to unlock the framerate and use a controller.","September 12, 2014","true","22.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As a narrative, it picks up the story where it left off in the first game and intelligently brings it to a conclusion. When it's over, you fully understand why Alice was driven to her madness in the first place, a reason much more sinister than simply that her family died in a fire years ago. The story is told wonderfully through excellent voice acting in recovered memories and in sequences cleverly done in cartoon cutouts. Alice also communicates with Cheshire Cat throughout the game in the game's 3D world.\n\nVisually, Alice is beautiful and a treat for the eyes. The game uses a wide color palette based on the theme of the area she is in, and the level design and art direction are excellent and sometimes spectacular. London itself is appropriately dark and gritty, all done in greyscale, making the Wonderland segments pop more colorfully than they probably really are. Character models are also appropriately cartoony and slightly twisted. The musical score effectively evokes the mood of the game, though it lacks the disturbing discord that the original's soundtrack evoked.\n\nThe gameplay itself was mostly very enjoyable. The platforming was clever and challenging, and the combat (which there is a lot of) was very smooth (the "focus" or auto-targetting system works wonderfully if used correctly). The game also breaks things up nicely with various themed puzzles and even some sidescrolling mini games that were very fun. While a bit long for a platformer, Alice was nonetheless engaging all the way to the end.\n\nThere were some negatives that marred the overall experience, some significant. The autosave feature is probably the biggest problem with the game. Since you can't manually save (like in the original Alice), you can only restart from the last checkpoint. The problem is, it is very easy to unwittingly transition out of an area when you still had another path you wanted to explore that might have lead to collectibles or an optional arena fight (to gain HP), and you can't go back since the game only stores one auto save (it does allow you to revisit major checkpoints after you complete a chapter, but you would have to go back and replay several areas to get back to where you want to be). Some of the auto saves are well-placed, but not all, forcing you to redo a jumping sequence for example before you can get back to the mini boss who just beat you. The auto save feature really rears its ugly head in the final boss fight, as it saves at two points during the fight. This sounds convenient on the surface, not having to start the whole long fight over from the beginning if you die. The problem is, you could in theory be down to your last bit of health when it auto saves for the next part of the fight, so now if you die you will always restart from that point at near-death, you can't go back to the begnning. They needed to include two or three auto save slots in the game to avoid this game-breaking scenario.\n\nAnother issue with the game is the repetitive combat. Too many times in the game must you fight the menacing ruin, for example, which appears in various combinations with other enemies. There are many times in the game where you will run into one and say, "didn't I just beat this guy?" A similar experience happens near the end of chapter 2, where you defeat a mini boss called the drowned sailor, only to meet another one on the other side of a gate, then have to go inside three separate buildings to beat three more of them. This kind of gratuitous combat served to needlessly drag out the game and produce too many moments of "Oh, not again."\n\nThe bottle collecting in the game is rendered almost pointless because in order to unlock what I believe is additional concept art, you have to collect every bottle in each chapter. Unfortunately, I was always a couple of bottles short of the dozen or so I needed to find. It would have been nice if they unlocked "some" of the content based on what you found, instead of making it all or nothing.\n\nLastly, I found the jumping mechanics to be a little off, making some of the jumping sequences needlessly frustrating. Mainly, Alice would many times drop like a rock on the third jump in a three-jump sequence no matter how dextrously I hit the jump key, and this also happened a lot when hitting the jump key as she was hitting the apex of an air plume or off a jumping mushroom. They needed to fine-tune this, the jumping mechanics should have been much smoother and more forgiving.\n\nOverall, though, Alice is a fine sequel and is a must-play if you wre a fan of the original. Even if you aren't, it is a solid platformer and a very unique and original experience.","January 1, 2015","true","38.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Controlling the character can be a bit frustrating at times as the camera sometimes fixes itself into strange positions and the keys respond relative to how you view the screen not how Alice moves.. e.g. you have to run down a corridor "into" the camera, so S becomes forwards, W back, A/D revert left/right – tricky orientation to play with. Also includes a couple of mini-ingames: side-on and platform games, chess and slider puzzles, and a bowling ball style game which are short but mandatory. Probably best bought during a sale or deal, the full price seems a little on the high side.","March 2, 2014","true","22.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was simply amazing how bleak and uninteresting everything in reality looked and it's contrast with wonderland, which toyed with my own sanity. as close to everything tested the limits of my own comprehension abilities. I have to say, despite it's 2011 graphics, the style of art managed to almost blow me away with the occasional cutscène being artfully displayed as a puppet show portraying Alice's family's fiery death (charming, I know)\n\nNow, after dedicating a paragraph alone to the art style, it's probably time to talk about something else. The storyline simply stunned me, making me unsure of what was real, what was relevant and what was a hallucination which kept me guessing until the very end where it made it blatantly clear that how many memories I failed to collect. With re-imagined, corrupted characters from a franchise which was a part of my childhood kept me interested as this game hacked at my innocence with a rusty axe, this game kept me enthralled for it's entirety.\n\nProbably about time to talk about some gameplay. Now, whilst my heart belongs to open world games, I was surprised how much I enjoyed the lack of control I had over which missions my protagonist completed and it what order. It almost added to the sense of complete madness that was magnified by all aspects of this game. As for the level design, it almost felt like there were two parts to this game. The puzzle-platforming segment, which had Alice bouncing from mushroom to invisible platform to pressure pad, and the fighting segment, which had a interesting system of locking onto specific enemies and defeating them using different combinations of light and heavy melee attacks and ranged attacks which include a giant teapot-grenade launcher and a minigun that gives an entirely different definition to peppering your enemies (ADUHDUHDUH). Whilst the combat was comprised of simply mechanics, the creative enemies meant that you always had to be trying different things instead of spamming certain attacks.\n\nAlright guys, I'm freaking tired of the emotional rollercoaster that this game provided me, i think it's time I wrapped this up. In conclusion (If you were going to read any of this review, this would be the part)\n\nArt style: Sensational\nStoryline: Sensational\nGameplay: Sensational\n\n10/10 Would recommend.\n\nThanks for reading, I'm George, and I'll see you next time.","April 16, 2014","true","15.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

As a narrative, it picks up the story where it left off in the first game and intelligently brings it to a conclusion. When it's over, you fully understand why Alice was driven to her madness in the first place, a reason much more sinister than simply that her family died in a fire years ago. The story is told wonderfully through excellent voice acting in recovered memories and in sequences cleverly done in cartoon cutouts. Alice also communicates with Cheshire Cat throughout the game in the game's 3D world.\n\nVisually, Alice is beautiful and a treat for the eyes. The game uses a wide color palette based on the theme of the area she is in, and the level design and art direction are excellent and sometimes spectacular. London itself is appropriately dark and gritty, all done in greyscale, making the Wonderland segments pop more colorfully than they probably really are. Character models are also appropriately cartoony and slightly twisted. The musical score effectively evokes the mood of the game, though it lacks the disturbing discord that the original's soundtrack evoked.\n\nThe gameplay itself was mostly very enjoyable. The platforming was clever and challenging, and the combat (which there is a lot of) was very smooth (the "focus" or auto-targetting system works wonderfully if used correctly). The game also breaks things up nicely with various themed puzzles and even some sidescrolling mini games that were very fun. While a bit long for a platformer, Alice was nonetheless engaging all the way to the end.\n\nThere were some negatives that marred the overall experience, some significant. The autosave feature is probably the biggest problem with the game. Since you can't manually save (like in the original Alice), you can only restart from the last checkpoint. The problem is, it is very easy to unwittingly transition out of an area when you still had another path you wanted to explore that might have lead to collectibles or an optional arena fight (to gain HP), and you can't go back since the game only stores one auto save (it does allow you to revisit major checkpoints after you complete a chapter, but you would have to go back and replay several areas to get back to where you want to be). Some of the auto saves are well-placed, but not all, forcing you to redo a jumping sequence for example before you can get back to the mini boss who just beat you. The auto save feature really rears its ugly head in the final boss fight, as it saves at two points during the fight. This sounds convenient on the surface, not having to start the whole long fight over from the beginning if you die. The problem is, you could in theory be down to your last bit of health when it auto saves for the next part of the fight, so now if you die you will always restart from that point at near-death, you can't go back to the begnning. They needed to include two or three auto save slots in the game to avoid this game-breaking scenario.\n\nAnother issue with the game is the repetitive combat. Too many times in the game must you fight the menacing ruin, for example, which appears in various combinations with other enemies. There are many times in the game where you will run into one and say, "didn't I just beat this guy?" A similar experience happens near the end of chapter 2, where you defeat a mini boss called the drowned sailor, only to meet another one on the other side of a gate, then have to go inside three separate buildings to beat three more of them. This kind of gratuitous combat served to needlessly drag out the game and produce too many moments of "Oh, not again."\n\nThe bottle collecting in the game is rendered almost pointless because in order to unlock what I believe is additional concept art, you have to collect every bottle in each chapter. Unfortunately, I was always a couple of bottles short of the dozen or so I needed to find. It would have been nice if they unlocked "some" of the content based on what you found, instead of making it all or nothing.\n\nLastly, I found the jumping mechanics to be a little off, making some of the jumping sequences needlessly frustrating. Mainly, Alice would many times drop like a rock on the third jump in a three-jump sequence no matter how dextrously I hit the jump key, and this also happened a lot when hitting the jump key as she was hitting the apex of an air plume or off a jumping mushroom. They needed to fine-tune this, the jumping mechanics should have been much smoother and more forgiving.\n\nOverall, though, Alice is a fine sequel and is a must-play if you wre a fan of the original. Even if you aren't, it is a solid platformer and a very unique and original experience.","January 1, 2015","true","38.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You play Alice as her memories return and she has to come to term with what really happened to her family in a house fire and the reasons behind it.\n\nWithin the grimy Victorian seediness lies a fantastic platformer, and one of my all-time favourites, together with the orginal American McGee's Alice. The platforming is regularly interspersed with some surprisingly frenetic combat.\n\nYou have five weapons at your disposal: the Vorpal blade which is your standard weapon, the Pepper Grinder (read machine gun), the Teapot (read grenade launcher), and the Hobby Horse which is really a substitute for a Sledgehammer. Also the player can also drop clockwork bombs that either uses a timer, or can be manually detonated.\n\nThough the fighting can get frantic at times, it is only ever really difficult if you don't employ some kind of tactics. The bomb, for instance, is essential for distracting enemies and overturning crabs to reveal their weak underbelly.\n\nThe graphics of this game are gorgeous, but they have an 'ugly beauty' about them, inspired by the East European puppet animations of Jan Svankmeyer and the Brothers Quay. The music of A: MR also has a disturbing charm, as it moves between whimsical piano and grungey industrial ambience.\n\nI can really recommend Alice: Madness Returns to any platformer-lover, but with reservations about the adult themes that run through the game. Also, if activated (my Steam version was deactivated by default), the language can be quite mature at times, with the C-word used once or twice.\n\nMy only gripe with this game, and it's not the only game to be guilty of this, is doors shutting behind the player, thus closing off parts of a level without warning and without the player having fully explored an area. This often means completionists need to replay levels to get pickups they missed. Surely some warning that going through a doorway, or moving into an area, will end the level isn't too much to ask?\n\nApart from that, Alice: Madness Returns is a great old-school platformer with some of the most creatively inspiring environments I've ever seen in a game. Weapons are varied; Fighting frantic but fun; Lots of collectibles; Soundtrack is awesome.\n\nAlways been a big fan of this game: 9/10.","June 14, 2015","true","22.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nostalgiachan/recommended/19680/","nostalgiachan","Nostalgia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nostalgiachan/","120 products in account","tl;dr Great atmosphere, good story, average gameplay. Good for a playthrough. Pick it up when it's on sale next.\n\nBy far, the most striking thing about the game is its art and atmosphere. Everything feels as off-kilter as a Wonderland run through a trauma filter should, from the dodo-powered machinery of the Hatter's hijacked tea factory to the utterly peaceful, yet utterly terrifying heights of Cardbridge. Each world is absolutely engrossing and sprinkled with details, making you wonder just what strange, horrible wonder is waiting around the corner. The music is suitably downbeat and chilling, picking up with heavy drums during combat, while the occasional string piece brings it all together with Victorian Gothic flair. The character designs are wonderfully macabre, with many returning characters receiving updated designs as befitting of Alice's vastly altered mindscape, and the voice acting is strong. Of particular note is Alice's ever-changing wardrobe; each dress aptly reflects the environment she is exploring, and each appears to have been designed with great care. Each dress also gains a unique gameplay modifier on a second playthrough, such as the Steamdress rewarding more Teeth (used to upgrade weapons) and Roses (the resident health item) from breakables or the Royal Suit limiting the health bar to four Roses.\n\nThe story itself is similarly strong, albeit flawed towards the end. About a year after Alice's release from Rutledge Asylum at the end of the first game, Alice has found herself under the care of one Dr. Angus Bumby, a psychiatrist helping her to forget her past trauma. However, all is not quite right in Wonderland as once thought, and she finds her world being besieged by the Infernal Train and the Ruin, monsters of oil and machinery. She must return to her once-again fractured world to find the source of the corruption, unravel the mystery of this new madness and save her mind once more. The trickle of clues throughout the levels strings the player along fairly nicely, however it feels as though a few too many important details are left as collectible memories rather than presented at key points in the story. My primary gripe with the plot, however, comes in the last two or so hours of the game. Quite a few sudden revelations happen all at once, especially during two key segments towards the end, and coupled with the fact that some of the clues leading to these revelations are, as mentioned before, left as collectibles that could be easily passed over, the reveals felt jarring.\n\nNow for the game's primary issue: the gameplay itself. Now, the game isn't bad by any means. The platforming feels quite smooth, though at times shoddy camera angles can make some jumps harder than they would normally be. Largely, however, this is offset by the fairly generous and forgiving nature of the jump and glide abilities. Combat is relatively simple, with four primary weapons to choose from: the fast-but-weak Vorpal Blade and Pepper Grinder and the slow-but-strong Hobby Horse and Teapot Cannon. While fights can be a smidge on the easy side at times, stringing various combos with the different weapons, or landing a deflecting block with the Umbrella, is satisfying.  As a little personal plus, I liked that you couldn't acidentally dodge roll off of platforms; given the size of some of the platforms you fight on and how far you dodge, it would've been all too easy to launch yourself into the abyss if you could.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is repetitive, repetitive, REPETITIVE. I'll admit, on my first playthrough, I really didn't notice it all that much; the atmosphere and plot were plenty engaging enough and I was so interested to see what was coming next that I really didn't pay it much mind. It wasn't until my second playthrough for a stream, and particularly it wasn't until I reached Tundraful and Deluded Depths, that I started to recognize the patterns of the levels: Platforming segment, pull some levers, a Shrink Sense here and a Clockwork Bomb there, combat, repeat. Occasionally, there are mini-games found in the different chapters, but some (the Off with her Head game, especially) become incredibly tedious. While there are hidden collectibles and Radula Rooms (challenges) to be found just slightly off the beaten path, they don't do much to break up the feeling of linearity. The Deluded Depths and Dollhouse levels, in particular, feel as though they drag on for days.\n\nMy biggest issue with the game, though, is that you can see just how much more American McGee and Spicy Horse wanted to do with the game. Missed opportunities are EVERYWHERE, with the most egregious being the lack of boss battles. Each chapter has perfect setups for end bosses, but in the end, they all quickly get handwaved away and you're shuffled off to the next bridging London segment with no real payoff. A lot of features found in the beta trailer, like the expanded London segments and the ability to swim through the Deluded Depths, would've been more than welcome, the London segments especially; London would've felt more like a proper setting in its own right than as simply a bridge between Wonderland visits.\n\nIn the end, though, I can't say I didn't have fun with the game, and its art and atmosphere are truly wonderful to experience. It's a shame that the gameplay doesn't quite reach the same quality, but it's by no means a bad game; it's just not really one you'll want to play through more than once. If you're looking for an aesthetically-rich world and don't mind the gameplay being just alright, give it a look.","November 23, 2014","true","27.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/recommended/19680/","vallinek","Vallinek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/","82 products in account","Alice: Madness Returns is a 3D on-rails platformer with horror elements that tells the story of Alice Liddell - a teenaged girl who's suffering from trauma caused by the death of her family in a fire. The player's role is to guide her through the Wonderland, which represents different parts of her mind, to recover her lost memory and find the source of corruption that's been ruining it.\n\nIn terms of graphics, I wouldn't compliment their general quality as the models and textures aren't top notch, but the general design is splendid. The locations are beautifully done, dark and moody, which creates an incredible effect when combined with the game's psychodelic music. It all creates a borderline horror-like climate throughout most of the game. The imagery may not be as disturbing as for example Yume Nikki, but comes quite close.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the player has quite a bit of movement options in his hands, and even more when it comes to combat. Alice can quadrupple jump and float, making her one of the more nimble characters in the history of platformers. She also gets an assortment of different (upgradeable) weapons that she can use to battle the quite diverse library of foes she will encounter, as well as a dodge move which is basically a flash step. She can also lock-on to her enemies and aim automatically. This all makes the combat very satisfying and when you lose, it's usually your own fault, not the control's. For those who feel hardcore enough, there is the Nightmare difficulty which vastly bumps up the strength of enemies, and certain dresses Alice can wear albo make the game harder (like limiting her health). Of course, you can also opt for a low difficulty, if you're a casual gamer. Pretty much the only bad thing is the fact that the final boss is kind of easy in comparison to the rest of the game on any given difficulty.\n\nOne last thing to say is that this game is not for kids. More thanks to disturbing imagery than anything, really.\n\nOverall, this game is a great platformer, with moody, psychodelic environments and very good combat system. I recommend it to both casual players and hardcore on-rails platformer fans.","December 31, 2014","true","18.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The most important thing you need to know about Alice is that it is, at it's core, a platform game. If you hate those with a passion, then this game is going to really drive you...mad.

In between you will fight misshapen abominations with various kitchen gadgets and children's toys.\n\nThe combat is not really anything new, although I felt it was satisfying. The real appeal is in the twisted beauty of the levels. The devs really nailed it on it that front; Alice's wonderland is both whimsical and grotesque - a perfect backdrop for the convulsions of Alice's tortured conscience.\n\nThere's a part where you have to go through a tunnel opening that is, unmistakably, in a doll's butt.\n\n10/10 would enter butt again.","August 4, 2014","true","149.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And no the last few chapters aren't perfect either, but the story really excells here and you discover more and more the further you play.\n\nI recommend playing this game if you like platformers and games with a pretty hefty storyline, since it definately is not a children game. And if you find yourself being bored, expecially the first (and longest) chapter please try to make it through. Its a great game when you allow yourself to look deep enough since the lack of polish here and there really tries to kick you out.","July 7, 2015","true","16.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/onewingedweeman/recommended/19680/","onewingedweeman","onewingedweeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/onewingedweeman/","120 products in account","most certainly a departure from the novels O.O\n\nAlice: Madness returns is a sequel to the 2000 title "American mcgee's Alice", where Alice is driven insane due to her Family dying in a fire. in this game, we follow her story after she have been released from the asylum, but is still plagued by nightmarish horrors in wonderland.\nthe controls are tight and well-responsive, though dogding in lock-on mode is cluncky, because there seem to be a peripheral radius from the enemy that you are allowed to dogde in, making retreating maneuvers alittle awkward. but despite that, the platforming is nicely done to be a moderat challenge for the player, combined with a plefora of enemies that can attack you on both land and in the air (without directly interfering in the platform sections), the weapons and the four deficulty levels (easy to nightmare), there is alot to the gameplay (not to mention the histeria mode).\nthe atmosphere and tone of the game is certainly improved from its predecessor: in AMA, most of the horror Visuals came from the bloodiness of the surroundings and the enemies, while in this game, the horror elements are relying far less on the gore factor and more on the blurring of the lines between reality and wonderland, giving a sensation that Alice may be decending into madness Again. in the same way, the enemies are also given more detailed designes to depick the twisted nature of the new wonderland, though the design for most of the reoccuring characters are carried over from the first game (the mad hatter, the turtle, the chessire cat, etc.). for the design of the humans in the real World, they may look more exaggerated than the residence of wonderland, giving more a sense of isolation from the real World. the game is also generally more colourful than its predecessor, which should take away from the horror factor, but the way it is used actually kind of adds to the atmosphere.\nthe music is far from bombastic or grand, but more subtle and soothing with a hint of the unnerving elements in between, which fits quite well with the rest of the game.\nduring the game there is also acouple of mini-games that is intervowed into the story, which is skipable, with is good since the music ones isn't every precise. but luckily, they only make up a small percent of the mini-games.\nthroughout the game, there is also alot of collectable either in the form of rose paint to increase Health or memories, that tell of certain quotes from different people in her life, giving a good objective to Explorer the enviroment.\n\n\nfor all of my praise, I can't say that this game is completely flawless:\nI have mentioned the problems with the lock-on before, but since it also zooms somewhat more in on the target, when locked-on, it makes the camera more awkwardly angled and harder to see any surrounding enemy attacks.\nthe games story also have a bad habit of teasing us with possible bosses to face, only for the story to abruptly cancel them, for example the first chapter leads up to a confrontation with the  march hare and the dormouse pilotting a giant robot, only for the infernal train to crash into the Facility and destroy the robot, ending the chapter. and that is how it goes for almost every single chapter's ending.\nthe ending is also kind of weak for such a good story, but really open to interpretation. (I will not talk more about it for the case of spoilers).\nand finally, the music mini-games. the music mini-games have a delayed input-registration making it harder to time tunes (not by normal dificulty, but by faulty game design). and also, they require a full perfect run on three sets, so if you fail once, you have to start all over from the beginning, making it more frustrating with the music mini-games. but luckily, they are also skipable.\n\nso overall:\npositives:\n+ tight controls\n+ a broad arsenal of weapons and abilities for both combat and platforming.\n+ challenging enemies\n+ different modes\n+ lore-expanding collectables\n+ good music\n+ nice Graphics\n+ good Visuals and designs\n+ good psychological elements\n+ unlockable costumes\n\nnegativs:\n-awkard lock-on\n-trolling us with boss battles\n-weak ending\n-music mini-games.\n\noverall, if you are interested in a challenging platformer/combat game, interesting visual and story or want to experience a twisted version of the imagination of the Lewis carroll novels with psychological reality-bending elements, I would recomment this game to you. so you are always welcome to descend into the madness with the rest of us\n>:-)......(just kidding).\n","November 13, 2015","true","21.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Simply because you can play it on a variety of levels and you will still find something to enjoy. If you're a combat fan, the combat is fluid and responsive with the arsenal of weapons (while limited) finds its use in different situations; If you like a story you'll be absolutely taken in by the wonderful world and masterfully crafted descent into madness; If you like graphics, they are very stylized, there is no texture reusing (to the point of each level being easy to memorize, begining to end, simply because of how unique each segment is); If you like an intellectual game, this is where it really shines. It is more layered than "Inception" and the symbolism is there at almost every turn. The references for those who like something to even further probe their brains, are a plethora (so as to not spoil it, I wont say anything other than that there's a Shindler's list refence, among others,  that hits the nail on the head).\n\nIn short there is someone for everyone! Of course it isnt without its bad sides. But these come only in the form of bad coding, the eventual bug and/or freeze. Thankfully the game places checkpoints often so even if you have to restart you wont feel like you have to redo too much. I very VERY strongly recommend this one if you want to spend a few hours inside a trully polished and immersive game.","December 6, 2015","true","33.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Of course getting used to the controls in game took me a while and was confusing at first but I got the hang of them quickly. The plot is phenomal and I loved playing this game, it even ran on my crappy laptop (although I had my resolution quite low). This girl believes she burnt her families home down and killed her sister and parents, as you play the game you lean more and more of her story. The atmosphere is amazing in every second of the game.

It is the similar fantastic psychological horror. action-adventure, third person video game as the first one, however, you do not need to play the first one in order to enjoy this game as it isnt a direct sequal. It's extremely imaginative, unique and fun! You will enjoy a slew of great costume changes and a selection of crazy weapons you obtain as you advance throughout the game. Although I'd reccomend this game to anyone, I feel the story lacks the complexity I'd hope for from a psychological horror. Also, the ideas and theme of the game is extremely close to the 2000 version, and I was kind of looking for a new spin on things. 8/10.","September 20, 2015","true","33.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(I will not talk more about it for the case of spoilers).\nand finally, the music mini-games. the music mini-games have a delayed input-registration making it harder to time tunes (not by normal dificulty, but by faulty game design). and also, they require a full perfect run on three sets, so if you fail once, you have to start all over from the beginning, making it more frustrating with the music mini-games. but luckily, they are also skipable.\n\nso overall:\npositives:\n+ tight controls\n+ a broad arsenal of weapons and abilities for both combat and platforming.\n+ challenging enemies\n+ different modes\n+ lore-expanding collectables\n+ good music\n+ nice Graphics\n+ good Visuals and designs\n+ good psychological elements\n+ unlockable costumes\n\nnegativs:\n-awkard lock-on\n-trolling us with boss battles\n-weak ending\n-music mini-games.\n\noverall, if you are interested in a challenging platformer/combat game, interesting visual and story or want to experience a twisted version of the imagination of the Lewis carroll novels with psychological reality-bending elements, I would recomment this game to you. so you are always welcome to descend into the madness with the rest of us\n>:-)......(just kidding).\n","November 13, 2015","true","21.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Game is really athmospheric, and keeps me entertained. I do think that its hard enough and You need a trick for most of the enemies.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/recommended/19680/","ajpos","Andy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/","483 products in account","American McGee's Alice was incredibly popular for what it was: a generic third-person platformer/shooter. What made it stand out as a true joy and masterpiece was its phantasmic, whimsical art-direction and devious atmosphere. It is natural, then, that a sequal must either improve on the original's platforming, or at the very least give us "more of the same" of whatthe original does best. Alice: Madness Returns continues the trend of giving players a fantastic atmosphere and art style, but the gameplay is so atrocious that this game is hard to play, let alone reccomend.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* Absolutely stunning and interesting visuals, probably some of the best I have seen for a console game. From the backdrops, to the costumes, to the platforms, to the character models, everything about this game is ocularly incredible.\n\n* The ability to shrink at any time is a great idea and is fun. However, I think the developers missed a world of opportunity to really make the game shine with this mechanic. I was hoping for something like Tiny-Huge World from Super Mario 64 - the opportunity to explore a world from an entirely new perspective.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* Bugs encountered: red mouse pointer stayed on screen while playing after navigating a menu pop-up, one tooth (the game's in-game collectible) dropped but could not be picked up, sometimes auto-aim would randomly turn on while using the ranged weapon.\n\n* While Alice performs actions, such as turning a steam vent on, she is vulnerable to attack. However, you have no control over her for several seconds during this time.\n\n* When you start a new area, you will always jump down to it from a high-up area so that there is no "going back." This also seems like lazy level design.\n\n* In one area where they could not use an invisible wall, the power of Alice's double-jump is purposefully nerfed so you can't reach a certain platform early.\n\n* The collision mechanic when Alice walks into a wall, or jumps into a column or something, is a good effort but feels awful. Alice sort of "glides" past the obstacle rather than actually interacting with it. It's as-if Alice has some sort of anti-magnetism that does not allow her to physically touch objects.\n\n* I get better FPS while in the game than while in the pause screen. What's going on with the pause screen?\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n\n* Bad mouse control/aiming while using the ranged attack. My view was always being whipped around every which way because the computer thought I ought to aim in a completely non-sensical direction. I have a $100 mouse and this game won't let me use it.\n\n* Invisible Walls. They are everywhere. Even in places where the developers don't need them. even in front of Alice-sized holes. EVEN IN FRONT OF PLATFORMS DURING JUMPING PUZZLES.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nPlaying Alice: Madness Returns will certainly make your eyes very happy, but it's a mess of a game and not worth $20. I do think you should pick it up if the game is on sale, though, just to check out the amazing visuals.","January 4, 2014","false","1.7"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

First off, why does EA need DRM on an offline single-player game? Second, since it's published by EA, there's no cloud saving via steam. And on Origin, cloud saving doesn't work at all. I've lost my save file twice because of this. If you like platforming games with puzzle thrown-in, I definitely recommend it. When it DOES work, the game is fun. Controls are smooth, combat is similar to Legend of Zelda with it's targeting system, you upgrade your weapons by collecting teeth(similar to the red orbs from the God of War games).

The story is good, albeit very dark.\n\nThe reason I don't recommend this is that this game is mainly repetition. Chapters are insanely long of platforming. The game was charming for the first 3-4 hours, by after that, it becomes tedious. Chapter 5 in particular, is ridiculously long. 2 hours of no story-telling and simply jumping and jumping and jumping until you finally get the story bit.\n\nI completed it on a fast pace at 10 hours and the last 4 were painful as I only wanted to finish the story. The gameplay is good, but combat is, again, very repetitive. Later enemies are made uncessarily difficult, and the camera, dear god the camera, it's awful. It will random lock unto things. More than once you'll die to a platform when you jump > jump > glide and then teh camera shifts and you can't see where you're going.\n\n\nPros:\n-Really good story, good story-telling\n-Unique atmosphere\n-Unique Art\n\nCons:\n-Gameplay is REPETITIVE\n-Combat is made gimmicky to be challenging, mare worse by awful camera and targetting system\n-Camer is AWFUL\n-Gameplay is VERY repetitive\n-Platform areas are made stupidly long as filler, don't be surprised to go 2 hours of non-stop platforming, puzzles, etc... with no explaination and interaction. You'll sometimes see the cat, who will tell you something funny, then it's another hour of jumping and fighting for no reasons.

For example, if you change the button that activates the umbrella block, the umbrella block may just stop working altogether even after defaults are reset (unless the game is quit and re-entered), to name but one.\n\nDisregarding this, the game does tell an engaging story set in a "corrupted" vision of Alice's wonderland, which seems to exist entirely in her own delusions. A continuation of American McGee's first foray into the realms of Lewis Caroll (which I admit to not having played), this game makes many references to the game that preceded it, but not in a way that makes it impossible to gleam at the events that took place in said predecessor, making it an adequate starting point in the series. All in all, the world this game portrays is very absorbing, but you may find difficulty in being absorbed if the aforementioned control problems become annoying (which they easily can).","November 3, 2014","true","2.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It has some nice ideas but is too lengthy with too little variety and bored me throughout numerous parts.\n\nIt lacks difficulty and challenge and playing it can feel like a tedious chore. I got used to the looks of each level quickly. You change between reality and Wonderland scenes in a predictable succession. They can appear initially impressive but everything submits heavily to the basic mechanics. There isn't much feeling of consistency or meaning, the levels are cluttered and lack elements to excite you with. One could end in a minute and the other in hours and it would still amount to the same. Sometimes while platforming you change without too much of a warning between various graphical dimensions and visual styles or even have the game turn into a sidescrolling shooter. Some of these sections fit the themes of the levels they happen in nicely and were interesting to witness but gameplay-wise turned repetitive soon.\n\nYou hardly ever interact with anyone or anything that isn't a mob to slash at but move on and on traversing the always kinda same ways and exploring the kinda same secret passages to unlock collectibles you might care or not about. Having a deranged protagonist explore her mind to sort things out regarding her psyche, her real-life situation and that Wonderland of hers could've offered lots of possibilites to deal with your environments and their inhabitants, and the "interim" scenes of switching worlds were rather interesting but the game dares not to progress beyond it's otherwise predictable level patterns and fundamental platforming and combat mechanics which leaves the rather nice voice actors severly underused as well.\n\nThere isn't much substance to the characters. They aren't very tangible, they don't have too many lines and when they speak they do it in ways or making references to previous events or characters that can be hard to understand (without being necessarily complicated by nature) for non-native English speakers or when not knowing the book this is based on or the previous game "American McGee’s Alice". There isn't too much of story progression. You're jumping and slashing your way through the mind of Alice, sometimes moving around the real life, facing a predictable twist, some end boss and a relatively vague open end. My ultimate feeling was, I believe, that I haven't accomplished much. There really isn't much I would've missed had I not played this. I dare not go as far as I regret my time with this game but I wasn't particularily enthusiastic about it either.\n\nWhat is nice is how monsters (visually; the combat never becomes too diverse or interesting) and Alice are designed. The latter has beautiful hair and clothes (in grim Gothic style) flutter around (I suggest manually unlocking the otherwise hidden dresses DLC content) and the game makes pretty heavy use of NVIDIA PhysX which leads to very realistic and impressive particles and puddles of black goo one main set of enemies leaves behind.  The game is by default locked to 30 FPS which I advise fixing via some .ini file as mentioned by other reviewers because it makes the game look better (some menus load more smoothly then as well). That aside, within the context of its gameplay/story/characer limits, the game works techncially nicely and is pretty foolproof. So if you can forgive its repetitiveness, have the patience to go through it and don't expect any great story or character display you can still have an experience of something.","December 11, 2015","false","33.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The use of insanity to justify the ways of combat and dying are brilliant. I only have one major complaint. The game doesn't work at times. I have gotten to a part where you need to deflect explosives with your new found weapon. It just won't work. Simple as that. This makes the game a pain in the butt to play through, and it makes your rage.

A neat art direction though, some of the character designs are funky, and I particularly like Alices model, and how her hair, dress and ribbons blow in the wind when you're standing idle or moving around. Her boots give me the biggest boner.\n\nThe voice acting has bouts of god like vocalisations, and then some really iffy and forced lines that aren't delivered properly. For example, when you're interacting with the children in the home at the very start of the game after the opening cut-scene. Some of Alices' responces to the children feel very wooden and fall flat. I'm not sure if this is bad VA-ing, writing or just because Alice is meant to be completely insane.\n\nLevel design is linear with a few branches off here and there for hidden areas that don't really offer you anything except clues into the back story of the game and sub characters. Its not very hard either, hard mode is quite easy. The gameplay isn't very engaging either.\n\nAfter having played a good few hours if find that this game would have been better suited to a movie adaptation rather than a game. It's really boring to play and it feels like real a chore. Everything is the same. Jump here, jump there, shoot this thing that opens that thing, fight the same enemy you've been fighting for the past 3 - 4 levels, yawn. As a work of art and putting a black spin on the original Alice in Wonderland fairytale, it's brilliant. But as a GAME it falls on its face and really sucks.","November 5, 2012","false","5.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's the small details that I appreciate, and Alice has plenty of them. Just excellent !\n- The visuals are some of the best I've ever seen (but the voice overs could use a little work at times).\n- Skippable puzzles. I don't play chess, never have played it and don't intend on learning it so I was pleased to see that I could skip these puzzles altogether.\n- Big worlds\n- Enemies really do require different weapons and tactics\n\nThings I disliked:\n\n- It outstayed its welcome before it was over. Meaning it was overly long (yes, there is a thing as 'too long').\n- Hitboxes were a disaster. There are times where you jump and crash into a barrier that isn't supposed to be there yet, where you slide, hit NOTHING and still get hit anyway and more silly things like that.\n- The camera isn't always working properly.\n\nJust a great action platformer, but with some minor, annoying, flaws.\n\n[Rating: 75/100]","March 21, 2012","true","10.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Barely any graphical and other options. In-game menu seems to be slow for some reason. While it's playable with keyboard, some parts of the game are not. Also, some button prompts are shown for Xbox controller, while it is not connected. This may lead to a quite frustation.\n-It is, needlessly long and repetitive. The combat, the platforming, even plot elements seems to repeat themselves every chapter.\n-Game also constantly fails to tell you some key moments, which can get you stuck sometimes.\n-Most annoying and plain stupid minigames, thankfully, some of then can be skipped, but, unfortunately, not all of them. Seriously, did they actually think that it would be a good idea to throw in some qte, puzzles, 2d platforming or even pinball arcade !@#$ in the middle of an action? I can hardly imagine.\n-The secrets are met so often, they become generic. Even worse, finding them don't seem to reward you in any way, shape or form. In fact, they make you take longer paths, which result in major waste of time. Well, sometimes you get enough stuff from secrets to upgrade your weapons, but you can do it without secrets. You can, however, upgrade your health via secrets only. But, you have to find so many, and it give you so little, you would not want even bother in the first place.\n-Countless bugs and glitches. It's just terrible. Sometimes you have a cursor appear in game for some reason (they even multiply), other times Alice just starts running forward after cutscene or loadscreen and dies horribly in first pit.. yeah. Some invisible walls that you always hit every once in a while, some stuff glitch through, some enemies getting stuck in walls and you can't get them out, so u have to restart checkpoint. And so on and so forth. Countless, really.\n\n\nOverall ~ I would love to like this game, but I can't. It caused me too much pain. It could have been a good.. no, amazing game, assuming the team had a decent programmers and level designers.","September 29, 2014","false","11.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Gameplaywise its a third person platformer mixed with some melee fighting and to a lesser extent shooting - occasionally the game throws in a different formula tho. Of course theres hidden story and"just because" collectibles and this time you can upgrade your weapons with "currency" strewn about. The levels stay largely linear, the main difficulty increase is in the jumping sections/puzzles - the fights never are that difficult unless you really dont explore and therefore have weaker weapons i guess.\n\nThe not so great things are :\n\na) Origin account required, altho you just log in once to register, no need to have it open\n\nb) Its a bug free game but (and thats a big but) the developers either didnt bother or werent that familiar with things like "keyboards" and "properly programming key rebinding". If you use an xbox pad or keep with the default key bindings all will be dandy but start changing controls and all sorts of ♥♥♥♥ start to happen like commands plain not working anymore or directional keys being strafing and turning at the same time. Prepare to google and fart around with .ini files like its 1999.\n\nStill heartily recommended, its a fun platformer with great visuals and gameplay and i daresay a must-have for anybody who liked the original.","July 16, 2014","true","19.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

But it seems like even decent machine is not capable of running it with good details - optimization neglected?\n\nWhen I fell of the cliff for the first time it was wonderful. I didn't know yet how much I will hate this 'death' animation. Then I started to think - why do I repeat this jump. And again. And again. Because I really want to get there to check that item... Yes... Do I? Another place looked like a reachable one but it was not. Bad move. Get back for the same series of jumps again.\n\nIt is neither "adventure" nor "action", not even "platformer". It is damn arcade! And this twists whole experience and ruins possibly great game. And it changes my vote to one huge "NO!".\n\nFurthermore EA account is necessary. Unnecessary DRM, spying and God knows what else. Avoid.","July 28, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Her hair sure has more animation that I expected.)\nCostumes (Different one for every chapter it seems, one makes her look like Wednesday Addams.)\nStory\n\nCons:\nGameplay, honestly just this but it's enough to have me not recommending it. The combat gets repetative since there only a few enemy times per level and only 4 weapons. The collectables feel pointless, in the beginning I'd hunt them down, by the middle I would get them if I could and at the end I was ignoring them completely. Even the memories are usually only a character from Alices life saying a single sentence or maybe two when you pick them up. The game seems like jumping puzzles and some hack n' slash wedged into a story. It felt more like the gameplay was a chore you had to do to get to the next bit of story, because the gameplay itself doesn't seem to tell much of the story.\n\nAlso the multijump function in the game screwed me over even when I did know what to do for the puzzle. You can jump in mid-air to gain height but if you don't do it at the perfect time she just spins in the air staying the same height, multiple times I watched her twirl right next to a ledge she was only maybe 2" under and then fall to her death. The side scroller bits in chapter 3 were really bad for this, trying to jump on a tiger statue head that's shooting fireballs at you only to barely fail the jump and get shot in the face.\n\nI enjoyed the feel of the game, the creepy atmosphere was really well done, if the gameplay elements don't sound that bad and it's on sale I wouldn't be against someone picking it up. But for full price I don't think it's worth it, for me the gameplay just didn't live up to the rest of the games elements.","November 16, 2014","false","13.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was in the mad hatters domain, near the end of it where there is a maze of pounding fists you need to navigate.  At the last part of this maze there is what I call a mini-boss area.  You jump past some pounding fists on to a ledge and there are a bunch of baddies around you need to defeat.\n\nThe big guy in the middle is a tough one you faced before where you had to block and/or reflect his attacks with an umbrella by hitting the E key.  However this game is so flaky 75% of the time when I hit the E key, nothing happened.  I could not harm this guy because he was blocking 100% of the times. I assume the trick was to bounce his bombs back at him, yet I could NEVER get that damn umbrelle to pop out when I wanted it to.\n\nFurther more there are a bunch of other things attacking you at this point.\n\nThis next part brings up another major annoyance.  Check point saves.  Now while this can be OK, it depends on the developer putting them in intellegent points.  You might think the right before and after a boss fight would qualify as MUST HAVE check points.\n\nNot in this game.  Nope, if you fail the boss fight you have to do the ENTIRE AREA all over again.  I mean there is even a LOADING SCREEN betten the last save and the boss fight.  Thats how far it is.\n\nAfter trying about 9 times on easy (I have no idea what that setting does, I lowed to the bottom just for this one fight) I gave up.\n\nI paid $2.99 for the game.  Don't waste your money.  Its super linear and very unispiring.  The controls are very wonky and difficult to use in combat.  The camera is also wonky which is bad for a puzzle platformer.","August 9, 2014","false","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was in the mad hatters domain, near the end of it where there is a maze of pounding fists you need to navigate.  At the last part of this maze there is what I call a mini-boss area.  You jump past some pounding fists on to a ledge and there are a bunch of baddies around you need to defeat.\n\nThe big guy in the middle is a tough one you faced before where you had to block and/or reflect his attacks with an umbrella by hitting the E key.  However this game is so flaky 75% of the time when I hit the E key, nothing happened.  I could not harm this guy because he was blocking 100% of the times. I assume the trick was to bounce his bombs back at him, yet I could NEVER get that damn umbrelle to pop out when I wanted it to.\n\nFurther more there are a bunch of other things attacking you at this point.\n\nThis next part brings up another major annoyance.  Check point saves.  Now while this can be OK, it depends on the developer putting them in intellegent points.  You might think the right before and after a boss fight would qualify as MUST HAVE check points.\n\nNot in this game.  Nope, if you fail the boss fight you have to do the ENTIRE AREA all over again.  I mean there is even a LOADING SCREEN betten the last save and the boss fight.  Thats how far it is.\n\nAfter trying about 9 times on easy (I have no idea what that setting does, I lowed to the bottom just for this one fight) I gave up.\n\nI paid $2.99 for the game.  Don't waste your money.  Its super linear and very unispiring.  The controls are very wonky and difficult to use in combat.  The camera is also wonky which is bad for a puzzle platformer.","August 9, 2014","false","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The elements disapear after a while so you need to be spot on when it comes to speed and timing.

I fondly remember playing American McGee's Alice in high school but Madness Returns is volumes better in all aspects of concept, storyline, graphics, and gameplay. This game takes on more of a platform concept which incorporates plenty of jumping, twirling, and floating in the air. This is a beautiful psychological horror game with jaw dropping artwork and a very developed storyline. It is a highly grotesque game in all the right ways. Mcgee takes an even further step away from the classic Alice prototype and recreates an even more disturbing and grown up Wonderland. The fighting in this game is much more complex than the original and it is gorgeous to watch. The vorpal blade is the only returning weapon, but there are new and more exciting weapons including the hobby horse, which was probably my favourite addition. Alice's outfits change with her state of mind and the parts of Wonderland which she visits. There are "mini-game" sections added throughout that are fun to play. Absolutely brilliant game. Highly recommend. 10/10","June 23, 2014","true","86.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a game that takes the familiar wonderland and turns it on its head, making it a morbid, gruesome and dangerous place. In this game, Wonderland is the delusion of a disturbed girl who is seeking an escape from her dreary life and forgiveness for her failures.\n\nAlice really delivers in terms of striking visuals and an art style that is reminiscent of the films of Tim Burton, but different enough that it doesn't feel like a direct imitation. Alice herself changes in each zone of the game, her dress taking on different elements of goth, S&M or Steampunk attire. Enemies and npcs are bizarre and magical and discovering more of them compels one to continue playing.\n\nThe only thing I dislike about Alice is how familiar it feels. It is very much an action platformer at its heart, with Alice taking on the monsters of Wonderland and of her own psyche with a magical butcher knife and a pepper grinder which acts as a machine gun. However, it is a very strong action platformer with plenty of hidden areas and challenging jumping puzzles that make the experience compelling, challenging and rewarding.\n\nWhile the game is in a genre that I feel stopped being intresting in the early 2000s, Alice has interesting enough scenery and characters and a good enough overall story to keep most players interested. It is worth it for the visuals alone. Play this one if you want to play a fun, challenging game that is not too deep.","August 10, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The elements disapear after a while so you need to be spot on when it comes to speed and timing. If you fail too many times (I'd say around 6-8 times) you are thrown out of the 'arena' and need to try to do it all from scratch. Well no, I value my time too much to go through that ♥♥♥♥.

My favourite was the level called ’east’.\nSfx/Music[10/10]: Very chill, situation-fitting music and great sounds.\nStory[10/10]: Great plot, interesting storyline, evens out as you descend into the story. You get to know the characters’ perspectives.\nGameplay[9/10]: Nice gameplay mechanics, a bit strange aimstyle, definetly great parkour mechanics\nDifficulty[Normal]:  PLAYED ON NORMAL DIFF. Not a hard game, but as you descend into the game, it gets interesting. The parkour , the puzzles, and the enemies get harder.\nCombat[10/10]: Great variation of weapons, upgrades you can use. You can do combos and such. There’s a nice variaton of enemies too.\nCharacters[10/10]:  The main character, Alice is the most interesting. You don’t really get to know all characters, but like the Hatter, the Doctor, and Lizzy are also shown.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nOverall[10/10]: Great game if you like parkour, gore, and grotesque things.\n","May 17, 2015","true","15.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Artistic design is marvelous, level design ain't no bad at all (and it isn't banal as the reviews say), the gameplay is funny, the unlockables are great, the story is sublime and crude and the finale will make you think a bit.

You'll find the truth to who actually killed your family!\n\nPros: Good visuals, good level designs and voices. actual good story. Dresses that not only make you look good, give out some abitities to make the game harder or easier.\nNew game plus +, allowing you to carry your stuff over if you decide to play again.\nCombat is good as you have weapons for different enemies, who are fast or may have high defense.\nCollectables.\nCons: the game has a frame cap set at "30" and you want to increase it by checking out the guide.\nSome dress and weapons are locked for some reason and you also need to read the guide to unlock them.\nThe game rarely, but sometimes freezes for a good 2 seconds before resume.\nCamera shifts a bit funky but doable.\n(Ending was a bit strange, but you decide on that one!)\n\nOver all it was a fun and good game, it had those moments where you felt, alone, scared, One moment everything is all nice the sun is out, birds are chirping and boom it gets all scaryand dark!,(like the under the sea level, those poor fish...)  Also its not all just about combat, but exploring, jumping, platforming, finding hidden items and solving puzzles. If you didn't know a puzzle you could just skip it if your not the puzzle type. Also Razputin from psychonauts is there, go find him, he's been wanting to "pick a bone" with you. ;)\nI give it a 8.9/10, pick it up when it's on sale I recommend it.

While visually interesting at first, the polish and freshness runs out in the first half hour or so, and  the game turns into endless copy pasted envirnments. The screenshots above are not representative of the game as a whole, and that trailer is even worse. While I'm not one to gripe about graphics, the character models look and move like ps2 era npcs. The game also runs fairly poorly, with freezing and frame skipping on a regular basis, and whenever anything chaotic happens the game slows to a crawl. The enemy designs are not particularly varied, and the main type of enemy is repeated ad nosium, the only variants simply being bigger versions of the small ones. The plot is virtually none existant, and isn't communicated much to the player except through vague and incongruently drawn cutscenes. Perhaps those who played the original (or prequel? the relationship is unclear in this game) game American Mcgee's Alice would get more here, but as for this game on its own, practically no story. Voice acting gets irritating very quickly, especially the main npc's like hatter and march hare, and a lot of the clips sound like they don't even belong in the game (muted or too quiet, jumpy breaks between lines). The voice actress playing Alice sounds incredibly bored the whole time. Game play is straight forward and gets stale very quickly, and the few minigames end up being tedious. Platforming is not great, as alice's jumping mechanics are hard to control. A section around the middle in the souls locker area is particularly tedious thanks to the bad controls. Overall, a great first thirty minutes, but it overstays its welcome beyond that and becomes a generic, gray hack and slash. Might as well just play God of War or any other game with this exact formula.\n\nTLDR: In conclusion, gray and generic.  Best parts are the menus and the first two areas. Runs like crap with bad controls. Mind numbing and time cocnsuming as it goes on, even the characters are bored. In a word, Mediocre.","May 14","false","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This was easily the best impulse purchase I've ever made in my life.\n\n---\n\nI was going to leave this short and sweet, but seriously, dat combat system. The game focuses heavily on large brawls, where you'll be fighting 3, 5, even 10 enemies at once. There are dozens of enemy types and the devs keep things fresh by constantly changing up the mixture of enemies you're fighting. I have never played another game that captures the action-packed, cinematic feel of a large brawl as well as Alice. You will feel truly badass as you are weaving between enemies, stabbing one and then dodging his attack, switching to your hobby horse to pummel the next guy, tossing down a clock bomb, and then jumping to the edge of the fray and pummeling them with your pepper-grinder cannon. Your movement is extremely fast and fluid, your weapons precise, and overall everything about the combat is sex from start to finish.","September 20, 2015","true","39.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I chose not to recommend this based on the game-breaking bugs.  The plot is fantastic so far, and the worlds are gorgeous.  No gripes on that.\n\n2.  Read the EULA. Apparently somewhere in there it mentions you MUST log in to an EA/Origin account. I didn't do this (I usually don't), and at my own expense--but I've chosen to ignore it partly because I wanted this game that badly.  I hate EA/Origin but for this game I tolerate the (so far) seemingly one-time login to EA/Origin.\n\n3. If you are not great with understanding how to tweak the files of a game (even minimally), DO NOT waste your money.\n\nFurther Elaboration:\n\nI have no idea who's at fault for the coding here, if I can even call it that, since I've never once had to do this in my life beforehand, or else be forced to give up on a game.  But within three hours of gameplay (at least one of those hours letting it idle on my computer while I looked up how to FIX the damned thing), it has become quite apparent that the game exhibits several crushing, game-breaking bugs.\n\nThe first (and so far, only game-breaking one I've witnessed) of these bugs happened to me when she picks up the umbrella to learn to block (NOTE: YOU CANNOT PROCEED FURTHER UNTIL SHE BLOCKS).  I understand it that if you don't change the standard controls (which, by the way, are utter crap for controls) that there shouldn't be any problem. Well, this was not the case for me.  I tried several of the fixes, most of which were people condescendingly talking down to others like, "You know you have to focus on an enemy first, right?" Yes, obviously, thank you, AND IT'S STILL NOT WORKING! I also, obviously, tried to reset the original controls or assigning them elsewhere to no avail; so I was absolutely stuck and could proceed no further in the game.\n\nI finally found a video on youtube explaining that the spacing between the command words in the .cfg file AliceLayout (something along those lines) is so freaking messed up that the umbrella use simply WILL NOT WORK unless you go in and manually space everything yourself.\n\nThat's downright ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, folks.  I'm not being paid to clean up somebody else's mess.\n\nOther glitches include Alice running while nothing is being pressed (cut-scene glitch of some kind), Alice not spinning/floating/jumping properly while in mid-air, and the Giant Stomp (which I have not encountered since I'm not far enough into the game) not working.  Supposedly manually editing the crap-excuse of a .cfg file fixes these problems, according to those with more expertise on the issue.\n\nThe problem with altering said file, however, is that it could break the ♥♥♥♥ out of your game; which is why, typically, only those well-versed in such things do this--and why I hope I NEVER AGAIN have to try and manually tweek files.  That said, I REALLY WANTED TO PLAY THIS GAME!\n\nThe fact that it's an older game means there's no support for it--and like EA would ever give support anyways--I recall the ♥♥♥♥♥torm I went through with SimCity 5 and Origin.\n\nBottom Line: If you are prepared to face the hardships and challenges that await you, Alice: MR is very captivating and so far seems to be worth my ten dollars.  But all that said, I just cannot recommend a broken game to the general population.","December 28, 2014","false","64.8"," 36 of 74 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","36","74","0","3"

There's so much detail to everything. I can't even wrap my mind around it. The game play it self is nothing special, but it works just fine. Target lock is a bit shoddy at times, but you'll manage.

I originally picked this up on sale after seeing a friend play through a level or two and thinking it looked like a relatively fun platformer, and it helped that I am also a fan of the multiple variants on Alice in Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass. But after playing through the entirety of the story mode and reaching the game's conclusion, I was more than happy to be done with it for good.\n\nThe plot wasn't too complex, though I did wonder if there was anything in the first game that I had missed out on. The story flowed rather well through each of the levels and interludes between them, following Alice as she walks the line between the real world and Wonderland, trying to find out why her visions of Wonderland persist even after she's supposedly "cured" by her psychiatrist. The art style of the levels themselves is fantastic, bringing life to the eccentric and often gruesome aspects of both Wonderland and 1875 Victorian London. Even the combat and platforming elements had a little flair to them, with varying puzzles, multiple different weapons and tools, a triple jump and glide ability, and enemies that follow certain patterns during a fight, but can be defeated in a number of ways.\n\nHowever, I felt the problem with the game was a lack of diversity in platforming elements and puzzles. Platforming didn't get that much more difficult from the start of the game to the finish. Some portions of levels seem like reskins of sections contained in older levels, and though a few of the puzzles were unique, at least half of them were revisited throughout the course of the game. Though the first few hours playing the game were fresh and entertaining, it quickly devolved into seeing how quickly I could finish the rehashed bits of the levels to attempt to move on to something new. There was a level of progression that just wasn't there. It got rather boring fairly quickly, and the repetitiveness of the game is most definitely the main cause of that for me. (The addition of requiring activation through EA as well as Steam was also quite frustrating, as sometimes the game was rendered unlaunchable for periods of time.)\n\nUnless you're a diehard fan of either Alice in Wonderland, American McGee, or both, I would not recommend picking up this game.","April 10, 2014","false","18.9"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

I don't even feel that it belongs to puzzle category, all the areas are directed by cinematics and chalk markings. It becomes a second nature to shrink to find these hints. Annoying camera lock whenever the floor button is triggered. Combat is terrible especially when you had to use cap lock. In the combat mode, you keep facing the primary target and you can't jump! When dodging, it kept running towards target then running away. Camera just stuck there and you cannot see other targets around. Monster health feels like counter as the number of hit required is almost the same as the upgraded weapon. I ended the game with 1.2k tooth and all upgraded weapon. More consideration should be taken, 4 levels of weapon definitely not enough.

Well I've been playing Alice: Madness Returns for now 17 hours and I've just begun the fourth chapter, I would have prefered to finish it before publishing my opinion about it but I can't help warning you now, all the more since if you've played the whole first chapter you can consider you've played the whole game...\nA few months ago a friend of mine showed me the trailer, saying "Look! A dark version of Alice In Wonderland!" and I was like "ahmagad I must get it!", and it was indeed the first game I bought on Steam. I was about to regret it very soon.\nFirst impression, I was amazed by the universe and the landscapes, and more than anything the representation of madness and the new interpretation of Alice, which keeps the main elements of the Carrol's version. Let's be honest, the cathedral train, the steam punk-like chapter, etc, were pure artistic genius. I was also pleased with the gameplay, which I found pleasantly fluid, and was a good point for me as I'm a beginner with PC games. The fights were cool, in short it seemed to be a really cool game.\nBut now I'm in chapter 4 and I promised myself I would finish it, but my word, I'm so bored! I've never played a so boring game in my whole life! It is way too repetitive, seriously, it seems like they kept the same paterns through the complete game and juste changed the skins. You almost always fight against the same three or four kinds of ennemies, who never get harder, and in each level you have a puzzle that can be solved by an eight-year-old kid, a long slide where you can catch more teeth (the sort of money you use to improve your weapons) and platforms, platforms everywhere, moving platforms to make it more difficult to reach, just like in games for children - and I know what I'm talking about, I played Monsters & Cie on PS when I was six and there were all these elements. It's just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3D platform game (and I hate 3D platforms, I die more often by falling than in the battles) dudes !\nI still play Alice to relax when I'm tired but the developers have been really lazy (except the ones who created the graphics), I'm really disappointed and I think you'll be too.

With that said, on with the rant...\n\nThe very first problem with this game is the ridiculous EA Login to verify the game. This alone would have prevented me from buying the game if I'd checked/been warned.\n\nThe level design is maddening. Keeping track of secret cubbies to collect memories was headache inducing. At times, I felt like the whole point was to collect memories and teeth, but luckily for me, the previously mentioned level design made that close to impossible to collect them all on the first go, even being extremely careful. Not that it matters since this game lacks achievements (GRRRRRR!)\n\nThe Voice Talent was weak. The main character comes off as spineless, which in this specific story makes her unlikeable. Talking about story, for a game this mediocre, a good story keeps people playing, but there wasn't even that to enjoy. I found myself wishing Wonderland would just be nuked into oblivion, just so that she'd stop whining.\n\nI constantly felt like I was being sent on fetch quests, except when these happen in other platformers or MMORPGs you at least get some level of satisfaction for completion. Not in this game.\n\nUnless your goal is to subject yourself to a Tim Burton-esque Mediocre Platformer, stay away from this game.","March 19, 2015","false","5.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

This is a propper arthouse game, no doubt about that. But to experience it all you must grind for hours and hours on end. The length of this thing is ridiculous. There are five chapters there. Sounds reasonable? Not so, unfortunately. The length extends enormously, because you will die/fail and retry hundreds (literally!) of times. When after a series of lengthy action/platforming sequences you think that you're finally at the end of the chapter, you're usually not even one third way through. The change of scenery helps combat this, but everything brakes down again when you are  forced to stay in the new environment for much longer than is actually required. This is irritating as hell. And the emphasis on arcade-like (and even 2D sidescrolling!) timed jumping - mind boggling. There is no proper feeling of flow at all here.\n\nSure, if you're a hardened gamer specializing in third person action games, get this game. You should have a blast! But if you are not (I myself have 20 years of experience, but mostly in first person action games), think twice. And if you do buy it, don't even contemplate playing it on anything but the easiest mode.\n\nDevelopers of this thing should point their attention towards regular people next time and get rid of this tedious platforming and trial/error based mechanics of grinding out enormously drawn-out levels.\n\nBTW, Steam says I'm 13+ hours in (actual number may be even higher, as usual), but in the game, I'm about 50% done. So for me this is a 25-30 hours game, and that is way too much for a story driven linnear action experience, imho.","December 6, 2014","false","14.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The gameplay is quite repetitive, and a lot of the originality that was in the first part is missing. The controls are absolutely awful (console port, yay). Playing the same part over and over, not because it's hard, but because the controls make you do something else than you wanted is terrible. Even aiming with the mouse is so nasty, that they added a key to focus on an enemy. Obviously you'll always focus on the wrong one, and you have to tab through them to even shoot in the right direction. With some of your moves (that more or less chain together involuntarily) you can't control where you're going, so expect walking into enemies, or not being able to get away while shots fly at you.\n\nSo - if you like to have that console gaming feeling on PC (press random keys and restart until you win), give it a go.

You know, the one that gave it a 6.5 which, by IGN standards, meant it wasn't worth playing to them? They're main complaint was that there was an overabundance of invisible walls, and I found that sufficiently idiotic to be interested.\n\nI have no past experience with American McGee's games so I was looking at Madness Returns with fresh eyes. All the screenshots I saw as I looked into it made it look more and more intrigueing, but at the time I wasn't really interested in this genre.\n\nFastforward to the 2013 Christmas sale, and I finally got around to buying it. Boy did it ever live up to expectations. I have simply not played a game with as diverse an atmosphere, as creative a world, and as well-realized a story.\n\nLet's start with the atmosphere. I think many would be tempted to say that "dark" is the atmosphere here. While that is a prevailing theme, the method of presentation of that theme varies significantly between each of the worlds. From the slight perversion of the Vale of Tears signaling things to come to the oppressiveness of Hatters domain to the heavy, heavy irony of the Deluded Depths, this game uses every trick in the book to convey the same message.\n\nWhat message? Well, that's simple: "Something is seriously wrong."\n\nEvery world feels incredibly distinct and dear God is that ever refreshing. None of the worlds really feel borrowed from anywhere else, and because of the distinctness from every world that came before it, starting a new level is a true exploration.\n\nSome of the levels are just awe inspriring, both when you first see them and while you're making your way through them.\n\nAs for the story, it may seem to be somewhat hamfisted at first glance; the somewhat melodramatic voice acting, the comic book cutscenes, and the over the top characters. But once you start hitting the ends of levels, that all changes dramatically.\n\nThe keys you find to your sanity begin to unlock the subtle turnings of the story. Obviously, without giving any spoilers, let's just say that a story of this magnitude and gravity has very rarely ever had the dubious distinction of being attached to a video game.\n\nMost writers in this industry would have beaten us over the head with the plot twists, having the characters wallow in their self pity, all  while stripping everything resembling a truely grotesque detail.\n\nAs an example of everything this game DOESN'T do, I need only point to Bioshock Infinite's handling of racism with kid gloves. Every punch that game pulled, this one delivered with follow through and, while the subjects being covered were dramatically different, they were also so much more pertinent, so much more dangerous, and ultimately leagues more risky.\n\nThrough level design, art, characters, and dialog, this game accomplishes a hundred times more towards elliciting an emotional response than any other game I've played outside of an RPG.\n\nOf course, no diamond in the rough is complete without some rough edges. Though I absolutely loved most of this game, as the game reaches the end, several nuisances within the combat system become major irritations, then progress well past that into infuriations.\n\nAuto-targetting is almost useless except against very specific, and powerful, enemy types and, in a very misguided effort to increase difficulty late stage, the developers intentionally exploit this irritation to make combatting those powerful enemy types artificially harder. This culminates in an end-boss whose PITA Level I have never seen equalled by a game of this quality.\n\nThough that issue and the overall repetitive nature of the enemy types towards the last third of the game can easily be explained by EA's ceasing of funding, that really doesn't change the fact that combat is at best more boring and at worst actively angering in this later stage.\n\nBut it is still absolutely worth it to play through to the end. When those answers are finally given, even if you'd figured many of them out already, the result is a terrifying resolution to a plot that NO other major publisher would touch with a 39 and 1/2 foot pole.\n\nThis is something only Spicy Horse is giving you right now, and for all its faults in the late-stage gameplay department, I have no reservations about recommending this game to anyone not completely brainwashed by the media's hype-machine.","October 5, 2014","true","40.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I can't understand how developers could release product  with the glitch THAT vast?!","January 11, 2015","false","3.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

Why: I love the characters and the graphics/design of Wonderland are really neat. But the story is just a joke, as is the ending (if you make it that far).\nThe other thing is the gameplay, which repeats itself after the first chapter. Then it's always the same: slaying some enemies, solving some very easy riddles and jumping across Wonderland.\nToo bad, because I love Alice in Wonderland and still think that this game yields great potential! But if you're 15, female and the Steam Sale is on: grab it, I guess you'll like it anyways!","November 29, 2014","false","9.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Alice is such a beautiful girl in this game. She's my ideal emo/goth female. Her voice is hot too.","April 16, 2014","true","22.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","1"
