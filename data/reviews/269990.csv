So I encourage players to participate in this early access and give comments to developers. Devs are very friendly and listen to the community;\n2) Even though it is “work in progress” – one can already enjoy the game, it is in a solid playable state now and very stable;\n3) Devs update the game on regularly basis so any possible bugs and game crashes (if any) are handled very fast.\n\nBasic game mechanics explained:\n\nIn a very simplified form:\n- find yourself in your home system\n- buy a ship that meets your strategy from a range of various hulls;\n- get some equipment if you can afford it\n- find an unexplored star,\n- fly there;\n- each star has just one planet that allows a player to: discover some equipment (shields, guns, propulsion systems and etc.), find some commodity, encounter an ally, hire a mercenary; trade with aliens; fight with aliens; some other event or a combination of all of these;\n- if one has to fight then keep in mind that combat is not complicated and does not take a lot of time;\n- upgrade your ship with new equipment if it gives you better stats and/or buy a new ship;\n- find a new target to explore;\n\nThe Universe for you to explore is randomply generated each time you start a new game (items and encounters are also randomly placed);\n\nThe game has a time limit for your exploration (measured in in-game days) that depends on the galaxy size (now there is just one galaxy size) and the speed of your ship or ships in your fleet if you have more than one ship (that in its turn depends on the size of the ship and installed space drive; The better drives you find - the faster you fly, the less time it takes you to get to new stars, the more of the galaxy you can explore); Timelimit does not spoil the game process at all.\n\nComments about the game:\n\nI) It is fun;\nII) It is not complicated;\nIII) If one has only 15-45 minutes to play, then this game is a must; Yes, you can enjoy the game if you only have 15 minutes available.\nIV) Some game mechanics is be a bit simplified but you are not purchasing this game because you expect it to be a Microsoft Flight simulator, right?;\nV) In comparison to many “early access” games this one is already a finished product, stable and playable).\n\n\nBottom line: Buy, install, enjoy.","April 19, 2014","true","27.6"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","45","53","0","7"

It plays very much like its predecessor, but with a 3D universe map. If anything, my quibble is that it plays a little bit TOO much like its predecessor. For the record, it's been about a decade since Weird Worlds, and we are not getting too many new ideas or upgrades with Sea of Stars. The ship models are cartoony and not very impressive, but the 2D art has improved overall. The unusual weapons, aliens, and planets are just as clever and enjoyable as before. The space combat actually seems to be a little more forgiving, and as a result, is more fun. Weird Worlds was ahead of the curve and was an unusual roguelike game before roguelikes became popular again. Now with games like FTL and Binding of Isaac out there, Infinite Space III feels a bit dated and dusty. Still a great time, just don't expect anything groundbreaking. Hope to see more innovation when Infinite Space IV hits the market in 2025.","December 4, 2015","true","1.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

As a result, I'd dare say that I have more experience with the Infinite Space series than anyone who hasn't actually worked on the games or made a large-scale modification of their own (Hi, sgqwonkian!)\n\nI say that to say this: if you liked Weird Worlds, you will probably like "Sea of Stars", but the game's future will depend greatly on how much Digital Eel has put into this game's engine. If the modding options really are "all that and the kitchen sink", SoS should be able to have a good run... if not, it's little more than an incremental upgrade, with a few jarring changes from the comfortable SAIS-derived interface that will disconcert both newbies and veterans.\n\nThe most obvious change is that the game is now 3D. Unfortunately SoS seems to get all the worst aspects of this change: the ship models are not especially detailed, arguably being a downgrade from the 2D graphics in Weird Worlds. The combat is a 2.5D compromise, which retains a lot of the simplicity of the original game, but sacrifices perhaps the game's best chance of distinguishing itself from its predecessors. The star map is fully 3D, and this is every bit as disorienting as you would expect. It's pretty, but that's about all I can say for it; as the actual gameplay doesn't seem to differ in any way from what's provided by a 2D starmap, it seems like a change made for the sake of change. Various fans have suggested making the starmap a 2.5D map, with all the systems shown on a flat plane, and I can't say that I disagree with the idea; right now attempting to navigate the purple void is downright painful, compared to the easy play that was present in the previous two games. That said, the planets and stars look spectacular on a full screen, and the ability to freely rotate gives the player a lot of interesting views that they would have missed in the previous games.\n\nThe combat system is very similar to the one in WW, and retains many of its flaws, while adding a couple more. I'll start by mentioning the biggest improvement: you can now set exact paths for your ships to follow. Previously, your ship would go in a straight line to the coordinate you directed it at; now you can do something a little more elaborate, without having to keep your mouse over the ship.\n\nAs a tradeoff, though, It is now painfully difficult to control fighters in combat; ships don't seem to stay selected the way they used to. You have to drag in the direction you want the ship to go, and when you're in a fighter, that is simply not convenient... they keep slipping out from under the mouse. The way the game is set up discourages giving fighters the precise orders that made them so helpful in previous games in the series.\n\nOne interesting change is how the ships are deployed; in the previous game, you would pre-set a "formation" that your ships would appear in at the start of the battle. Now, you can dynamically deploy your ships anywhere on the map at the start of the battle, which gives you a few new tactical options that weren't available before. You also have the option of which ships to put into the fray; if you don't want to risk your weaker vessels in a hard fight, or your fleet on a first contact mission, you don't have to. Retreating is still cheap and easy, but your ships are now delayed for a second or two while they go into light speed, which gives your enemies a little time to hurt you before you run.\n\nAll in all, though, the combat is not a big improvement on SAIS or WW. It retains the same problem of being largely pre-determined after the initial ship deployment. I had mentioned in a post on the old WW mod forum that WW (and obviously, any successors) might be better served by having a more arcadey combat engine, and this is still the case. There isn't much in the way of tactics or ship maneuvering; most of fighting is just point your ship and shoot. For something that is such an important part of the game, that's less than desirable. Nowadays FTL is the definitive combat experience in space Rogue-likes, and SoS doesn't match up. The combat mechanics were decent back when SAIS first came out in the early 2000s, and tolerable in Weird Worlds in 2007, but it's looking very dated in 2014.\n\nThere are a few enhancements to the general game. Hope's Haven Station now handles transactions in credits, which has potential to make things very interesting for modders if the purchasing is handled as flexibly as it ought to be. The combat simulator now allows you to customize your ships, and includes a "tech level" slider for opposing fleets. This alludes to the possibility of having enemies that become more advanced and invent new ship classes during play, which is obviously exciting for modders. You can buy new ships from Haven Station with your earnings, which makes losing ships less painful and allows you to get better use of your profits from exploration.\n\nThere are also a few curious omissions in the current game. Firstly, there doesn't seem to be any option for customizing your mission's length. Secondly, the flavor text that existed at the beginning and ending of WW is entirely missing. You no longer return to Hope in glory to retire as the Fleet's new admiral, or get shaken down by thugs and left to rot as a funny-spore farmer; instead, you just get a short blurb that notes you retired/died in combat/got eaten by a space whale/whatever, and your score. I suppose dedicated players will write their own narratives, but at a first glance this definitely seems to take away from the immersion in the game. Finally, the combat simulator lacks the friend/foe options that existed in previous versions of the game, which makes it a little harder for someone who wants to create a multi-side grand battle. SoS is still in development, though, so perhaps these problems will be resolved in later versions of the game.\n\nThe bottom line... do I recommend this? Like I said before, a lot of what SoS does is based on the previous games in the series. If this was 2007, I could say that it was the best thing still going, but with new competition like FTL, other new Rogue-likes, and a growing interest in procedural generation, I'm not sure that SoS (or WW, for that matter) is really at the head of the class in any particular area.\n\nThat said, though, SoS has the potential to be everything that WW was, and then some. Considering that WW retailed for something like $15-20, and this game's price seems to be capped at $10, that's something that you need to think about. The Infinite Space games have always been at their best when modded, so if the interface's rough edges are smoothed out, and the developers' promises of extensive modification options (presumably greater than WW's) hold true, SoS should turn out to be well worth the expenditure. I'm giving it a qualified recommendation. Here's hoping that Digital Eel can close the deal and make SoS into an unqualified success.","November 29, 2014","true","108.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","3"

As it stands, I think there are a lot of problems - if you're happy with that (which you might be, if considering an Early Access game) then that's okay, but as of the moment, this feels a lot like the previous game but with less going on and several irritations layered on top.\n\nForemost of these is the 3D layout of the map. In theory this should give a better feeling of exploring space, but in practice I find it makes it difficult to tell where I've been and where I'm yet to visit. Where in the second game I could easily plan a route around the system that makes sense, here it's difficult to figure out which order to visit places, and not in a way that's fun.\n\nI hope there are plans to address this in future updates, but I think it'll have to change quite significantly to fix this issue.\n\nIf that's fixed then I would be able to reccommend this, but only really as a re-skinning of the second game, because so far there doesn't seem to be a whole host of things that are new. Again, hopefully this might be addressed but as it stands there is simply no good reason to play this over the previous game, aside from curiosity.\n\nI wish the team the best of luck with the project and if it arrives at a state where I can recommend it, I'll be sure to update accordingly!","October 9, 2014","false","0.8"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","1"

So I backed it on Kickstarter ($25). Then it appeared in a really cheap bundle before the official release, so people who paid like $1 got the game much earlier than me. Yay!\n\nThe game... sucks. You know the quote how "every improvement is two steps back", right? That quote is about this game.\n\nThe universe is now 3d space instead of 2d plane, but THAT DOES NOT MAKE THE GAME MORE FUN. You fly somewhere, but you dont know where the planet exactly is, or how much nebula (a thing which slows you down a lot) you will fly through. The planets overlap each other, and some of them are really hard to spot and/or click on. All of this makes the exploration really frustrating. None of these problems were not present with the 2d universe.\n\nThe UI is horrible. In the previous games you could have opened multiple panels (ship equipment, cargo...) at the same time in the corner of the screen, and you could still play the game. Now everything opens in the middle of screen. So every time you want to do anything, you have to juggle with different panels overlaying each other. When you want to close the panels, you automatically hit Escape, which does not close the panel, but it asks you if you want to quit the game... and after some time you will realise that is actually the best thing you can do.","December 18, 2015","false","0.7"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","16","25","0","0"

With stress on 'lite'. But I wouldn't necessarily hold it against the game, sometimes you need something that is not wishing to murder you viciously in your sleep.\n\nIt surprised me first couple of times but then I found it easy to "figure out" and subsequent playthroughs were just permutation of known events while you fullfill your main goal i.e. exploring 100% of the randomly generated galaxy within time limit, trading along the way for better gear and fighting or fleeing to fight another day.\n\nIt is early access though so hopefully fully finished product will have more events going on in the universe.\n\nThere's one big challenge twist here, however - galaxy map is fully 3D. It is arguably more "realistic" this way but such feature is often sacrificed on the altar of user experience and instead games (even predecessors of this very title) feature 2D star charts. And I see why.\n\nThis may make or break the game for you, since exploration is main goal here and navigation is integral part of it, and making it a fully 3D star system makes it harder.\n\nMyself, I embrace and welcome this new navigational perspective with literal extra dimension added. I remember seeing something like that only in Sword of the Stars, as an option, and enjoyed it there, too.\n\nBut I can understand how it may be viewed as "fake difficulty" by "screwing with your interface". It is harder to see where you've already visited and to plot your route compared to the usual 2D simplifications.\n\nPerhaps bit different camera work would be more useful like have an option for it to be more "inside" the space so you can look around well from the point of view of your current system?\n\nIt's not a huge title and I'd say there are more interesting space games out there but I did have my fun with it and I wonder what the final product will bring.","November 27, 2014","true","49.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

Embark on a galactic adventure for exploration  and profit spiced up with deadly combat, and do it all in twenty minuites or less. Sometimes that less is your first encounter the game will neatly explode your ship even on the easy setting.\n\nLong before the terms "Rougelike " and  "Sandbox" this game was all those in it's past two lives.

So, yeah, they mopped the floor with me. Second try went better, but still abysmal. Third game, I explored everything, completed my mission, and had amassed a fierce armada.

It's not the game I play for hours on end, but it has a firm niche as the game I'll play when I have just a half hour or so to play.\n\nThe 3D map is a bit hard to work with; it could really use a way to pan around so you can see more distant parts of the map (and a way to reset to your actual position, of course).\n\nEven more desperately it needs a search function to find systems (whose names are known from the start) or planets/features that you have discovered. In several of the possible plots there are messages that name a specific system, leaving you squinting at the map trying to find it.\n\nDespite those QoL problems, this game marks the point at which there are finally enough random things in various pools (especially possible plots) that playing it several times back to back doesn't become boring.\n\nI've come to despise the label "rogue-like", which more and more is the refuge of game designers who can't come up with anything better than a random map with no story. But this game is really as interesting and deep as Rogue was; if you've never played a game in this series you will likely be discovering and trying new things for a dozen or more playthroughs before you start to work on "winning". Unlike Rogue, though, even a successful playthrough is only a few hours of your life spent, not days - and that makes dying and restarting a cause to decide whether you want to go to bed yet, instead of a cause to decide whether you want to throw your computer across the room.","January 7","true","119.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I've owned and played the previous 2 for years and looked forward to this 3rd installment.\n\nThe 3-d is unnecessary, confusing, and poorly executed.  The gui is non-intuitive, the controls more so, and general usability suffers, especially in light of how the previous 2 worked.\n\nGame play is similar, with the expected races and worlds, treasures and artifacts.  The "value" of an item isn't as obvious now, and they've added a credit system of sorts, both of which are interesting improvements.  There's a few new twists on some old favorites, but combat seems even flukier and one sided than the first...  I went from steam-rolling fight after fight to getting annihlated in the blink of an eye, with no in between or warning.  Sure, this is a rogue-like, but even rogue didn't pit you up against Dragons in dungeon level 2.\n\nI can't recommend this game, and it bothers me that I can't.

It's great for a 30 minute break, although since the game is procedurally generated, you could end up either dying on the first battle, or finishing the "story" cruising the sector with a six ship fleet, killing everything in your way. Anyway, I think it's fun, and at least it's fully playable at this stage in production - unlike many early access games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnwh/recommended/269990/","johnwh","johnwh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnwh/","376 products in account","A lot of games have tried to fill in the space exploration roguelike niche recently, but I find that none of them do it nearly as well as Digital Eel's classic Infinite Space series (Strange Adventures In Infinite Space and especially Weird Worlds: More Adventures In Infinite Space).  Now, at last, we have a third game in the series.\n\nWell, it's great! However....  There are some changes to the structure from previous games.  The biggest one is that the starmap is now 3D!  This makes the process of getting around the Purple Void a bit more challenging than before, and makes navigation a much larger part of the game.  It's now no longer as obvious if your route will go through a nebula, in particular.  (My advice: if the travel time says "at least X days", then a nebula will slow you down somewhere along the way.)  The starmap screen is rather confusing.  I can tell that some effort has gone into making it easier to understand, but it's easy for a new player to get overwhelmed by it all.  I urge you to spend some time with it, figure out how to rotate and zoom in and out with the mouse, and treat its challenges as part of the game instead of a barrier to entry.  It is definitely worth it.\n\nFor the most part the game content feels like a logical succession from Weird Worlds.  There's a couple more races on each map and there are a few new items (not enough though, I'd say!).  A few particular items, however, have been removed or nerfed: Hyperdrives are no longer as awesome as they once were, and the Aethric Mirror and Mantle of Babulon are gone completely.\n\nPartly because of the missing items, and partly because of something I'll reveal next paragraph, combat is much more important to the game.  You could often play entire games of Weird Worlds as a complete pacifist, or else just drag out a Chromium Gong for the one battle you have to fight.  You end up having to fight to explore territory more often now.  By the way, most alien races now have the ability to travel between systems, and sometimes you can explore a system you couldn't get to before because its guard has abandoned it.\n\nNow, the biggest change.  EVERY GAME HAS A MISSION NOW.  In Weird Worlds, the primary game was exploration, building value, and getting back to Hope on time.  But the game would secretly decide randomly, with a one-in-eight chance, that the current game would be a Mission Game.  In those games, in addition to the normal quest given by Lextor Mucron/Col. Brass, you would have to do something extra to protect your homeworld.  You might have to fend off an invasion by Ravians, locate and destroy the Yellow Kwangi, or in a complex sequence locate a powerful starship and use it to destroy the base of an evil space lord.  Since the missions were rare, the all had an air of specialness, and knowing when you got one that you might not see it again for a long time was a great way of upping the stakes.\n\nWell now, every game is a mission game.  The missions from previous games seem to be back, and there are a couple more now.  The stakes are not always so dire: at least one mission type doesn't result in the end of human life if you don't set it off!\n\nHowever, there is a feeling that the mood of the game has changed.  Because every game will have a mission somewhere, the goal of getting back home on time has been dropped; not only can you now retire anywhere with no penalty, but the game will ask if you want to do so the moment you finish the mission.  The wonderful and quirky opening and closing text has been greatly abbreviated, and the special goals of Weird Worlds when played with the Science vessel, which could prioritize different aspects of exploration, are gone.  In short, the game doesn't feel as much as it were /a bunch of strange adventures/ any more, which may be why that phrase is now sadly missing from the title.\n\nWell, truthfully much of that stuff is still in the game.  I wish it played more of a role, that it had been expanded, that the adventures were even stranger and more fun than Weird Worlds.  Well, Weird Worlds still exists (and hey, now its $5!), it's still just as fun, and it's not going anywhere.  Sea of Stars does not obsolete Weird Worlds: More Adventures In Infinite Space, and it is still lots of fun to play, even if the learning curve is a little steeper than before, and I'm sure the mod community will help it to thrive just as it did with the previous entires.","December 11, 2015","true","29.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

'Tis I, Skeletor! Once again, I have deemed a game worthy of my immortal eye, and all of you should know what that means; I find this system WOEFULLY INACCURATE! If you are an impatient crudscuttle and want to see the points you should consider before buying this game, search for ~tildes and you can get back to using the internet for looking at cat pictures and updating your social media! Pah!\n\nDo know that I've spent more then my in-game time playing it as I, Skeletor, often choose to play games offline, where that bumbling Beast Man can't bother me!\n\nLet's start by getting this out of the way - I'm sure you know this, but in the downtime between trying to conquer Eternia, I like to look to the heavens and imagine... What if I could fly, free like a bird, up into the stratosphere? OBVIOUSLY, YOU FOOL! I would melt in the upper atmosphere, then fall to the ground in a blaze of cinders and ash - never to defeat my rival, HE-MAN!\n\nThere are a lot of games out there that try to make that dream a reality; most are suitably epic in scope, though I'd argue that rather reduces the effect some of them have. Infinite Space is a long-running franchise from the fine folks at Digital Eel; Weird Worlds and Strange Adventures (in Infinite Space) coming before it. Strange Adventures is the first, and by far the title I've played the most; but Sea of Stars is rapidly climbing up to match it.\n\nLet's start with the things that leaved to a lot of tiny, 0.5 hour reviews; the game is audacious enough to attempt a 3D star system while it's previous titles used tried and true 2D space; most people play a game, don't like or learn the system, and leave. And that... Is valid. What! Neanderthal, did you truly expect me to judge someone for disliking electronic media?! Well, I do, but that's beside the point -\n\nI feel that the 3D system is done incredibly well, it's just incredibly counter-intuitive to how we're used to playing games, especially games like Sea of Stars, especially if you're familiar with the previous games. Most people give up on it, which leads to them missing all the new content, which leads them to decrying the game as not having as much as it's predecessors...\nAnd that is a tragedy.\n\nFor in a sea of epic games that have epic starlanes, great clashes of fleets, superhighend graphics and whatever bells and lights you fleshlings like, Sea of Stars is the title that keeps pulling me back, and grants me the greatest feeling of story and involvement.\n\nEach planet and star is lovingly coloured and rendered, the array of events both old and new never fails to tell an interesting tale whomever I choose to captain the S.S. SKELETOR and it's brave crew of myself. Many are old events I am familiar with, but just as many are small things from older games fleshed out, entirely new events, characters, or objects, or things that just work differently then they did in earlier jaunts in Infinite Space.\n\nThe bone-chilling music from the Digital Eel Nightmare Band grabs me in a way no over Sci-Fi soundtrack has; it is atmospheric when exploring, each sound delightfully plucked from the best of brainstuff. And the songs that play as my fleet dares to broach the Garthan Red Zone, or play with the laughing colours of the Urluquai... Fantastic.\n\nI love this game. That doesn't mean it's for everyone, but I genuinely love it.\nThe thrill of defeat as my wounded capital ship lingers past the Tan-Ru drone fleet, Ripcord crashing once again as electric death sizzles through the void - only to be saved by the timely arrival of the Klakar, their weapons tearing enemy craft asunder - but for nought. My Zorg Helmsman flees. I am alone in the void.\n... I, Skeletor... Have perished.\n\nA tear to the eye, truly.\n\nThe game is not perfect; it requires you to learn it; I did so after one playthrough, you may require more, or even pick it up on your first run. It has errors though I have not had one crash or failure to launch; it is short, but requires you play it through multiple times to truly appreciate.\nBut at the cost and the amount of time I've put into it on and off-line (roughly thirty hours and counting as of this review) if you like humble stories of space, aliens, laughter, told personally and in the back of your brainbox...\nI would strongly recommend this game.\n\n~Cons~\n\n* Can require multiple playthroughs to learn and become skilled with the UI.\n\n* Some people will never like the UI; this may be more or less important to you.\n\n* Random events can be frustrating to those unfamiliar with roguelike gameplay.\n\n~Pros~\n\n* Rich and involved random chance creates interesting playthroughs whether you're just killing time, or trying to go for a high score at the end. Will you end up losing your entire fleet save the mighty Thunderbucket, or fleeing with what you can load on your capital ship..?\n\n* UI is incredibly useful and impressive when you adapt to it, or so I find it. There are many aspects I wish other games would implement. This may vary for you, see the above con.\n\n* Difficulty can be as gentle as a stroll down Snake Mountain or as harrowing as fighting that dastardly He-Man.\n\n* Everything is filled with a charm and love that stands out against the sterility of many space-based games. For those who enjoy roguelikes and are willing to give this a try, there's a lot that stands out and feels authentically 'sci-fi'. This is more subjective then anything else I have said, but that makes it all the more important! The colours, ambience - everything are fantastic.\n\n* Combat is deeply satisfying, especially when you start to get a feel for the various weapons and ships; as is using cunning and intrigue to avoid or subvert encounters. Ship explosions are also quite satisfying, but watch out for bugs, they can be surprisingly enduring pests..!\n\n~ Final Review ~\n\nDon't purchase this if you are an old hand and have no patience for re-learning the UI, or if you're unwilling to lose a few times while learning the game.\n\nConsider purchasing the game if you are a fan of science fiction, rogue-lite gameplay that can be quite challenging if you ratchet up the difficulty, and stories that can be quite humorous but surprisingly impactful if you give them a chance.\n\nStrongly consider buying this if you enjoy ambience and atmosphere, excellent stellar music, great space combat, and an even better sense of humour, do not mind investing some time into learning/re-learning the UI, and are looking for something that can either be played several games at a time, or over your human 'lunch' break.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I need to wreak vengeance upon the Calatians for stranding me with their crummy Thunderbucket, those furry fools!","May 17","true","7.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","2","4","3","0"

Keeping in mind that this is an Early Access title, the game obviously has some rough areas. From what I've seen, the game has about, if not more items than RtIS, and it's still in the early phase. That's including new items by the way.\n\nAs for new features:\n\nThe map is no longer 2D, but 3D. Many people say that's pointless and annoying, but I disagree. While it could use some work, as I found it a bit sensitive, I found this way more immersive and fun to use, though a 'pan map' feature would be nice.\nTo go along and expand the 3D point, the star/system are laid out in a 3D fashion, and it looks nice, and gives alternate paths to various places as an option.\nAlong with new items, items now show actual visual stats, like a weapon will have '2 of 5 bars' worth of damage. This is definitely an improvement in my eyes, as before we'd only have a text description of the item in most cases, and had to go off what we thought sounded better, with the exception of Drives, which told you how fast it went with a number.\nThere are different ways of 'paying' for things now. There's the 'money' method, which you first enounter if the system you start out in. Every item has a buy and sell price, which I refer to as Dollars($). Next up is the 'Credit' method from RtIS, which remains the same. And finally(I think), the ever popular Klackar Traders, where you just exchange one item for another regardless of worth. I don't know if there are more methods, but those are the ones I've encountered so far.\nThere are now more ships, with a total of 5 to choose from, all having different base stats and different amount of equipment slots. Initially, you have a choice of 3 ships, as you start the game with around $1800 and only 3 ships are in that range. What the game does is that you immediately go into the game, rather than choosing a ship and being put in the game. Before you can do anything, you need to buy a ship, obviously. You can always come back later and buy a new ship, though I'm not sure if you can trade-in your current one, though I assume you can.\nCombat has been changed a bit. It's still the top down view, though you can rotate and tilt it too, but instead of just clicking where you want them to waddle over too, you drag/draw a path for them to follow and they'll follow it.\nAnd the Cons:\nSound is a bit uneven, where some sounds will be louder/quieter or sometimes distorted a bit, though the latter is rare.\nThe camera rotate control is a bit too sensitive in my opinion. A slider to adjust it would be nice.\nDue to the color of nebulae, stars, and the lines between planets, it is sometimes hard to distinguish the depth of the various systems. I think this is the main problem people have with the 3D view. Changing the color scheme, particularly the color of the lines leading from your current system to the closest ones would help this problem. Adding a map pan feature, and a 'center on ship' feature would help too, in my opinion.\nThe animations and sometimes framerate can get a bit choppy, which this games specs should not be having.\nThe difficulty/length/size options from the RtIS are not yet present at the moment. Though, like I said, this is still an Early Access game.\nI'm a bit tired at the moment, but that's all I can remember right now. This is basically RtIS plus some new features and improvements, and it will only get better from here. I'll addon and/or change this review as time goes on, since up until I got Infinite Space III I had played RtIS a few times a day, and now I'm playing Infinite Space III.","October 11, 2014","true","5.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The series is quite unique and has that "one more game" kind of addictiveness that keeps you coming back. Werid Worlds has always been one of my favorite games to take a short break with. Unfortunately, I can't reccomend Sea of Stars. Aside from the 3D models and world map, there is almost no new content, and what is new is superficial at best. What's more, the addition of another dimension does little to improve the game, rather making maneuvering through the menus much more confusing than the previous title. If the developers had just focused on adding as much content to the established engine as possible, I would likely be much more enthusastic about Sea of Stars. In it's current state, however, I am dissapointed.","March 14","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
