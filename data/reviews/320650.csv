Exactly 70. Not 250 "missions" as stated in the description above.\n\n----\n\nClassic match-game just like 4-Elements for example, nothing much to say.\n\nSmooth backgrounds, nice soundtrack - Everything looks fine, but nothing special.\n\nI managed to finish the game and get 100% achievements within 3hours due wild clicking, no tactics needed.\n\nThis game is good for the quick and brainless fun. Or for people who want to grab another 100% quickly ;)","October 12, 2014","true","3.1"," 47 of 56 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","47","56","0","3"

While I didn't mind breaking up the monotony of the regular matching boards with the hidden object screens, I did find the inconsistency in the arcade mini-games a bit jarring. In an otherwise relaxing and calming match-3 game, I found the timed arcade clickers to be a bit reflex heavy for the experience I am typically looking for in my mind-numbing gem-cascade funtime. Honestly, these minigames just didn't seem to belong in this game.\n\nOther than that, Season Match 2 has gorgeous graphics and a pretty solid "plot" as far as a match-3 can be expected to have. However, like in the previous title they still don't seem to have solved the problem where some of the smaller boards will repeatedly get stuck with no possible matches. Also, gems are often blocked from falling into areas of the board where they are necessary to free trapped blocks.\n\nFor an inexpensive match-3 game, it's not bad. The Steam integration features such as cards and achievements add to the overall experience and probably make it worth picking up at its reasonable low price (and even more so if it's on sale).","January 4, 2015","true","5.4"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","3"

It's a non-standard Match 3 title with every other stage being hidden object "goals" on the same map per world, and an incredibly bizarre story about warring... seasons? Months? Whatever they are, a bunch of differently-Asian people representing these concepts all bicker and magic at one another until you help them out or repel their opponent. Via matching and breaking and clicking all 20 of the things that sort of blend into the map.\n\nCompetently done though! Gotta give it that. They polished up the original's rough edges.","November 15, 2014","true","1.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Montezuma's  much better.   Puzzle Quest again much better.\n\nFor the game lay, Match-3 click as fast as possible in the areas with largest groupings.  the HOB are easy/straight forward.  The mini games are mildly fun except the daisy one - that one isn't fun, frustrating is the most generous description I can give it.\n\nThere's nothing brutal about the game, but neither is it overly captivating.   Last achievement is difficult.\n\nI gave it a borderline thumbs up, but I can definitely understand why someone would have an opposing point of view.\nDefinitely wouldn't pay full price.","September 17, 2015","true","12.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Which seemed pointless.\n\nAlso, each level includes a hidden object round - which is fine. The problem, for me, came with the occasional challenges that you have to pass to get back on to the match games: one protecting daisies from being blasted, and the one that entirely blocked me from going further: one clicking on an expanding flurry of snowflakes. Both of these were all about extremely fast reflexes, and clicking furiously for a couple of minutes.\n\nI'm not adverse to fast-action games, but I'd not expected them to crop up in a match game, nor to be as challenging as they are, quite randomly in a completely different genre. I bought the game for relaxation, and quick-thinking strategy, but it ended up being a frantic click-fest.","December 20, 2014","false","14.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I'm completely against the stupid minigames with the glitchy cursor which won't move/doesn't respond in anything approaching relative ease. It's completely impossile to kill the fast moving obstacles in some of the rounds with the responsivity given in the controls. I turned OFF the custom cursor with no resolve to the slow responsivity. It's literally just the game. Lagging. Like a lagger who lags. Add in that I really, really, really do not like games where the whole point is mindlessly clicking as quickly as I can with no strategy whatsoever involved and no, I would not buy this game again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Will I mindlessly click until I get 100% on this game? Maybe. I don't know. I can't decide if I want to waste more of my life on this or not. If I get beyond this minigame? It will be due to pure random chance.","February 7, 2015","false","4.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Season Match 2 crams in more mini games with horrible controls. The art for the "enemies" you match battle against looks like it was stolen from a different game due to style choice. Not fun even for someone who sort of liked the first game because it's not enough like the first game. This game auto pauses, which SM1 didn't, so that's a plus. The screenshot ability didn't work for me in either game.","July 7, 2015","false","10.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There are many more better match 3 games out there especally since this one doesn't even really have matching its more just spot 3+ and click it. Infact on most of the game you can just randomly click all over the screen and beat the level really fast. I bought this game for my Aunt, she enjoyed it aswell but found herself randomly clicking as well. I own all three games I must say they do get progressively better storywise. And the minigames do break up the game a bit so its not just the same thing over and over again, at somepoints the minigames proved more fun than the actual game lol.\nAll in all it is a simple casual game, I'd recommend it only if that is what you are looking for. If you wanted better gameplayed I'd say get season match 3 it being the best of the lot that I played but the characters are recurring through the franchise so if you enjoy these type of games getting all three for the story wouldn't be too absurd even if they are short and the plot isn't too thick. lol","June 22, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
