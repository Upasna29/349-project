Part of it is the game itself, but the majority of it is the community around it. The community I am specifically referring to is DayZAnarchy. The founder of DayZAnarchy, known as skunk, spent countless hours slaving away at his keyboard, scripting his server to be the best it could be. The work paid off, and I considered DayZAnarchy to be the best DayZ server there was. However, skunk passed away recently. No longer will DayZ be the same for me, or my friends. It makes me realize how much of his work I took for granted. I only knew him for a year, but I considered him a friend. If not for skunk, I would not love DayZ. Therefore, this is not only a review for DayZ, but a memorial for skunk.\n\n69/10 would f*** a pumpkin again.

All servers use unique player-created missions.\n\nThe missions are normally PvE, but PvP also exist to a lesser extent. Missions can range from being in an escort of military vehicles, rescue hostages, or attack/defend outposts. The game has a built-in mission editor that is easy to manage. ARMA II have plenty of realistic weapons, vehicles and characters. There are also hundreds of mods that increase the amount of everything.\n\nThe game suits people who like sandbox, simulations and action games. However, it's not a very fast-paced game like the CoD or BF-series. In the ARMA-series, you might die unless the wound is treated. You have no visible healthbar and you require a map and GPS to know where you are.\n\nUseful links:\nClans & Communities - Find a clan that fit you.\nArmaholic[www.armaholic.com] - One of many sites with plenty of usermade content.","November 26, 2013","true","134.6"," 133 of 147 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","133","147","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067844927/recommended/33930/","76561198067844927","Ex Inferni","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067844927/","145 products in account","After playing this for a few years now and obtaining over 1000 hours on this game, I think it is time I reach my verdict on it. I believe that, though this game has its challenges, it is one of THE greatest games ever devised for the Personal Computer. I feel like simply doing a Pro/Con review because it's the easiest to format.\n\nPros\nDEDICATED playing and modding community - even after being out for several years, many people, myself included still play this game religiously.\n\nIncredible mod support - There are literally thousands of mods for this game. Hundreds of new, GIANT maps. Thousands of guns. Thousands of new unit types. Even entire overhall mods to change it into the Vietnam war or World War 2. Mods exist to change every sound in the game and graphical mods exist to ease the strain on lower end PC's or make the game more beautiful than it already was.\n\nAlready expansive game - The game, minus mod support, already contains hundreds of units, vehicles and guns in the case of Combined ops\n\nMaps - 15km by 15km maps, enough said. Maps contain multiple towns and villages, and often 1-3 large cities and/or settlements. There are also large area with beautiful landscapes such as rocky cliffs and washing oceans.  Some custom maps can be even bigger. But to put it into perspective, Skyrim's map is about 37 square kilometers, where as the default OA Takistan map is 164 square kilometers (About 12km by 12km corner to corner). Think about that one.\n\nReplayability - I do not mean the story when I talk about this, I talk about the virtually INFINITE ability to create scenarios in the editor. Want a tank battle 20v20? You got yourself a tank battle complete with terrain big enough to house it and FOBs for both sides. Want a small special ops team to assassinate a middle eastern dictator from 1.2 km away with a 50 cal? You got it. Want to fly an attack helicopter or CAS jet into the heat of battle? You get the idea. Infinite.\n\nGraphics - Though this is something that many people would argue with me about, Arma 2 came out in 2009. Even though it was released later, OA's graphics are no better because the game is still from 2009. It's the same engine and the same game, with a different setting. Given the circumstances, I do have a very nice rig, so the graphics look pretty to me. I constantly find myself looking off a cliff while preforming recon on an enemy position and thinking "Wow, look at that view."\n\nRealism - This may be a turn off point for many. I, for one, live for realistic games. I often b!tch to myself about other games not being realistic enough. This game, with the addition of a few mods, can be as close to real life as you want it to be. Mods to check out for added realism are ACE 2, Retexture mods for units to make them up to date and state of the art (Changing the US Army units to Multicam from that dreaded UCP camo comes to mind), and the Zeus AI mod.\n\nMultiplayer - 100 + player games. Nothing else to say.\n\nNow for the cons, these are all the problems that I've found with the game that personally annoy me.\n\nLag/Desync - This is only an issue with larger servers, usually. It can be annoying but rarely 100% game breaking\n\nPoor Performance - This game is not very well optimized, and if you have a weak computer, you will struggle to run it with more than 10-15 FPS. Even if you have a good rig, it will usually only max out at about 35-50 FPS. Don't let this turn you off though, you really just get used to it.\n\nOcasional hackers - This happens very infrequently, and it only happens on big servers.\n\nExpensive - For a game as old as it is, it is a bit pricy, I reccomend waiting until a Steam sale comes around to make a purchase in the Armaverse.\n\n\nLack of Realism in Some Places - This is more of a pet peeve of mine rather than an actual flaw. It annoys me that all the US Army units use the SCAR L, considering it was rejected by the Army. The light version of the SCAR is just ugly to me, and when I can, I always mod it out of the Army. This will probably not bother 90% of people considering this game, but for those that enjoy absolute realism, check out the RH M4/M16 pack on Armaholic and it's respective replacement packs.\n\nSTEEP Learning Curve - Patience is a virtue. You need patience for this game. A lot of it. You will die. A lot. And you'll die some more. Guess what still happens to me regularily. You guessed it. This game is a tactical simulator, if you try to play Call of Duty, you will be swiss cheese every time. The controls can be hard to learn, and I changed them right away so I was more comfortable. Modding the game is not reccomended unless you have experinece modding similar games. Though modding is very simple, things can be screwed up if you delete or put a file in the wrong place.\n\nTime Consuming - Processes in the game take a very long time. Firefights can be anywhere from a few seconds to 30+ minutes. The time it takes moving from place to place ranges widely. If you are on foot, expect about a 35-40 minute walk from one corner of a map to another. By plane or helicopter, you can travel long distances in minutes and seconds.\n\nFrusturating - It feels really bad when you're almost done with a mission or objective, and get killed.\n\nOverall this game is by far my most played and one of my most treasured games of all time. Very few games have the scope of Arma 2 and its many addons.\n\n\n\nPS: Arma 3 is much less realistic in terms of units and gameplay, but still has the giant maps and mod support. It does have better graphics, as well. I reccomend getting both if you can afford them.\n\n\nEDIT: MAKE SURE YOU BUY COMBINED OPERATIONS OR THE GAME WILL SUCK.","November 24, 2014","true","214.4"," 108 of 114 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","108","114","10","6"

It is recommended to buy both games so you get all of the content and can join all the servers.\nArma 2 is a realistic Military Simulator. Below I will review each aspect of the game.\n\nAspect        Review                Gameplay        The game has very enjoyable gameplay, with many different weapons and vehicles. You can do missions, play with the editor or play on multiplayer servers with many different game modes. Even if you aren't a fan of realism, this game can still be played casually.                Graphics and Optimisation        The game is horribly optimised. Even people with top of the line PCs get around 20-40FPS at times. I personally have old hardware so cannot test the graphics properly, but at low they are still decent, but don't expect Arma 3 like graphics. The game gets extremely frustrating after a while due to the poor framerate. It should also be noted that the controls for this game are extremely uncomfortable to use, by that I mean it is unsatisfying and is the main problem I have with this game.                Additional Content        The game features some additional DLC, however not owning the DLC is no problem at all, since the light versions allow players to gain all of the content from the DLC. However, the DLC content will be low resoloution, unless you buy the DLC. The game has no microtransactions. The game can be somewhat pay to win depending on the server, as some servers offer better weapons for premium players, but this isn't every server.                Value        The game is worth the full price, as it is very enjoyable and you can get a large amount of hours out of it (for me it doesn't even get boring!). However, some people do not like the game. I recommend trying out the demo before buting the game. The game also goes on sale frequently, so it is worth waiting for that.\nAspect        Score (/10)                Gameplay        9                Graphics & Optimisation        3                Additional Content        10                Value        7                Pay to win?        No                OVERALL        8\nNotes: This game is enjoyable both offline and online. It is one of the best military games I have played, but It is not to be confused with fast-paced action FPS games such as CoD. The 2 games are very different.","November 2, 2015","true","193.0"," 90 of 105 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","90","105","10","24"

My friend got his neck snapped by a tree because he went prone the wrong way near it. I drove a bike over a small bridge and it flipped over and crushed my spine. I drove a missle truck over a slightly larger bridge and it bounced up and down until it landed nose-first into a ditch and exploded the second I exit out of the rear left tire. I vaulted over some barbed wire and it teleported me under the map and I fell to my death. I combat carried my friend out of fire and he disappeared into the a black void where no light or cry for help escapes. I vaulted over a dam and got stuck under water. I rode a bicycle slowly over a bridge and made it safely to the other side where the rear wheel got stuck in the bridge and I got launched into the stratosphere when I got off. My friend landed a chinook on top of me and I survived until I climbed a ladder that teleported me to the ground instantly. I ejected out of a helicopter and survived the 230 meter drop because I landed on a 80¬∞ angle. I shot a bicycle with a tank and it didn't get damaged. I rode said tank over the bike and it flipped over while the bicycle remained standing. I unpacked a machine gun into the side of a building and could shoot out of it while no one could directly shoot at me. I got called an autist for not saying "Copy" and "Over" when talking in Independent faction chat. A hacker teleported everyone in vehicles into a hangar and they all exploded and the server crashed. I rode my UAZ off a ramp and the back wheels got stuck on it until they slipped off and the car exploded. I ran my armored car through a tree and took 0 damage to any parts and didn't get slowed at all, I then drove through a bush and took massive hull damage and the front tires were destroyed and was stopped instantly. I landed a helicopter near a bush once and it destroyed my rear rotor. I drove a tank at full speed over a small rock formation and it worked like a normal ramp, while an actual ramp damaged my turret and hull and brought me to a full stop. I planted a mine near a bridge and it didn't detonate when a tank drove over it, but when a civilian on a bicylce rode past it, it triggered. I wanted to be a cop in a roleplay server to abuse my power and they demanded I get on their teamspeak and do a job interview. I shot down an admin's jet on a wasteland server because he was carpet bombing every event area, he called me a hacker and banned me.","December 23, 2015","true","759.2"," 58 of 69 people (84%) found this review helpful 87 people found this review funny","84","58","69","87","2"

As usual, I was sitting in the woods, listening to the majestic sounds of nature, the birds chirping, the wind murmuring through the trees, as I waited to see other people. All of a sudden, "POWPOWPOWPOW". Instinctively I dropped down, and heard the sounds of bullets rushing past me, which sounded completely different than how Hollywood makes it sound. I judged the direction of where I was taking fire from. 40 ... 43 ... 45 ... 3 o clock! I saw a dark clad man jogging forwards holding a Russian PKM, which he probably found in a helicopter wreck. As I raised my gun, my M16A2 ACOG, I adjusted the scope to compensate for the bullet drop, and leaded my target."POP! POP!" I heard the scream of the man, and decided to slowly inch forwards. He wasn't done yet. 20 meters away, he suddenly opened fire. "RATATATATA!" He was injured. Instead of his shots hitting me, they went right into the ground, because he was forced to prone after his legs were broken. With one shot, I silenced him.

While his efforts were largely conceived as honorable and patriotic, there were those who would create their games regardless of Forman's rule. Even though the ban on simulation games would be lifted in 2003 they were still regarded as low-class toys and shameless attempts at controlling the masses. People know to the public as simulation developers were shunned from society and declined their right to vote.\n\nThis all changed in 2007 when Bohemia Interactive released a game so superb, so innovative that it's release is commonly seen as the greatest moment in gaming history, in all of history. ARMA 2 captured the imagination of audiences the world over. Its riveting story and enthralling graphics made the game an instant hit, and at the same time threw the simulation games into the mainstream, no longer would simulation developers be banned from voting and eating using cutlery, instead they would now be encouraged to vote, as their opinion meant more than that of the common man.\n\nMany have tried and many have failed at reproducing the feel and social and political impact of ARMA 2, Microsoft Train Simulator and Farming Simulator have nearly single-handedly cast the simulation industry back into the shadows from whence it came. Was it not for ARMA 2‚Äôs focus on replay value the world would not have survived the onslaught of terrible simulation games. Every attempt at recreating a game as tremendous as ARMA 2 has been futile‚Ä¶ until now.\n\n20th of May 2013 will go down in history as the day when Bohemia Interactive released their greatest creation yet: ARMA 3. Its gameplay is like nothing no-one has ever seen and will revolutionize the gaming-industry, if not the modern world. Bohemia has managed to create a game that will suck players into its massive world that encompasses a single island, and on top of that tells the most spellbinding and creative story ever told. One may laugh at the idea of creating a game where the player is expected to sympathize with an ENEMY MAN, 200 METERS and care for its actions, and struggles in the world, but Bohemia's extravagant game put‚Äôs those claims to the test and proves once and for all that Bohemia is the greatest gaming-company the world has ever seen.\n\n11/10","February 10, 2014","true","738.8"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","5"

A fun simulation.....\n\nSeriously this game gives so much bang for your buck. The amount of hours you can sink into Arma2/OA are insane as there somethng for just about anyone here from the vehicles and weapons to the walking and the missions/operations. There are communities within the game that put on 40+ men operations that take hours and have an insane amount of detail and coordination. Just watch any of the shaktac community's videos and all the different perspectives you can see of a single operation. It's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing awesome and however I myself have never gotten this close to what seems to be the true arma experience I have gotten a more toned down taste of it with several friends doing small missions that just give you this sense of scale and enjoyment you wont find in other games. Outside of its military simulation and the mods that further improve on that aspect you've got mods that have become something like garrys mod in there selection. To name a few; Takistan life, Wasteland, DayZ, Escape Chernarus, a hunger games type and many many more. Your options of play are endless and the mods are just as well done and provide just as much if not more than the base game. Hell Im sure a majority of people that have bought the game did so just to play DayZ. That itself spawned a stand alone game (That is and probably never will be on par with the mod). This game is the represent what it means to be a PC gamer. The experience and freedom you simply cannot get on console. But seriously there are so many key bindings and actions some arent even binded by default and you have to manually go in and find what else you need or want to bind. I've tried rebinding keys to make it more functional for me but I always end up missing a key or running out of keys in a comfortable area. The worst part is I cant tell if this is black mark on the game for being complicated or praise for its complexity and amount of input.... its just brilliant.","May 16, 2014","true","203.8"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","2"

Besides DayZ mod you can do so much more like Wasteland (base building and pvp gamemode), make custom missions, player made maps and playing around in the armory with your friends in an online server. Pretty good singleplayer, although I think the multiplayer with all it's gamemodes is where this game truly stands out. If you missed out on the hype and still want to play DayZ mod, I would highly recommend Overpoch by CCG. Either Taviana or Chernarus are both great maps for this mod. Taviana being the best in my opinion.\n\n+ Gameplay and general feel\n+ More content than Arma 3 at the moment (e.g. weapons, vehicles, items)\n+ Operation Arrowhead DLC was free\n+ Custom maps made by modders (Taviana, Lingor, Namalsk, Sahrani, Panthera)\n+ DayZ Mod\n+ Comes with alot of default maps (like Takistan, Chernarus, Utes, Bystrica)\n+ Alot of different gamemodes\n+ Great fanbase and community\n\n- Graphics (depending on what settings you play on, but on overall high settings it becomes laggy in multiplayer)\n- Uses more CPU power rather than GPU\n- Clunky inventory system compared to ARMA 3\n- Vehicles drive like a cereal box\n- No weapon customization\n\nThis game is in my opinion better than ARMA 3. Mainly being because of the timeset. I like the weapons better (M4's, AK's, DMR's) and there's alot more vehicles to choose from. ARMA 3 is a bit too futuristic for my taste, and the weapons in that game do not make any sense.\n\nOverall 10/10 and highly recommendable.","January 6, 2015","true","564.7"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","3"

ArmA 2: OA is the only standalone DLC pack for ArmA 2. Multiple other DLC packs play part in Takistan, Including the BAF (British Armed Forces) DLC and PMC (Private Military Contractors) DLC.\n\nThe Map(s):\n\nArmA 2: OA is set in the fictional Middle-Eastern country of Takistan. Takistan has many towns, villages and cities to explore, with two airfields on either end of the map. The map of Zargabad, A Small desert city in the middle of nowhere, quite small compared to Chernarus or Takistan, but the city is hugh compared to Takistan's largest, Rasman. Zargabad also comes with an airfield and a few buildings here and there. the PMC and BAF DLCs use this map as well.\n\nThe Gameplay:\n\nArmA 2, as a military simulator has many aspects involved in succeeding. To me, and many others, the most important is Teamwork. You have to work as a team to get things done in this game, and I love that consept. It is very slow paced, very tactical, and aimed at people that don't like to get things done rambo-style. Movement is extremely fiddly with the inability to walk through clearly enterable spaces and breaking your legs on the oddest of places. The game is fairly old, however, coming in at a 2010 release, a year after the original ArmA 2.\n\nGraphics/Voice Acting:\n\nGraphics and Voice Acting are quite shameful, but the game is old and developed by a Czech developer making an english game, and the quality is tolerable.\n\nThe Multiplayer:\n\nThe ArmA Multiplayer is quite easily where the most fun is to be had. With excessive mods and gamemodes developed plus the original gamemodes implemented to play with your friends, i've spent 99% of my OA Experience on the Multiplayer. My most enjoyable moments on the multiplayer moments were on Takistan Life: Revolution servers. TLR, as it is abbreviated to, is a Roleplay Mission File for OA.\n\nMy Issue(s):\n\nMy only Issue with OA is the fact that when update 1.63 was released, it wiped out an extremely large fraction of all multiplayer servers. I took this as a sign of BI telling us to go to ArmA 3, which is quite rude. Luckily, servers are popping back up here and there, which is a very good sign.\n\nSummary:\n\nOverall, All ArmA games are amazing in my opinion, but ArmA 2: OA gets the cake. Congratulations to Bohemia Interactive for making such an enjoyable, but serious game and I hope this review was found helpful.\n\nOverall rating: 9.5 out of 10 / 4.5 out of 5.\n\n\n","October 17, 2014","true","385.9"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Wants us to check this nearby hill, so we hit the road and floor it for some action.  400 meters out, we park the jeep behind a village hut, hearing .50 rounds and grenades being fired into the targeted hill.  We check the map.  A box with an oval in it -- armor of some sort, low numbers.  Luckily, we're suited as tank hunters.\n\nWe ditch the jeep -- too loud, too big, and load AT.  Our three man team stealths up the side of the hill, hearts pounding, eyes darting left to right.  Once at the top, we find some sort of ruins, and take cover.  There's light brush around it, providing additional concealment.  The perfect position.  200 meters away and slightly elevated, past the folds of the hill top, light flashes.  We watch as an enemy transport, small, boxy -- retreats as small explosions pepper along its path.\n\nI raise my weapon, a tiny fraction of myself exposed, and take am.  I take time to line the shot, but know the vehicle's frantic retreat and distance away do not favor a successful hit.  We let it vanish in the folds of the hill.  The explosions follow, and suddenly, we can't hear the engine.\n\n"Ugh."  I say.\n\nMy companions respond.  "It happens."\n\n"No, I left the jeep running."  We laugh.\n\nSuddenly, rounds impact our position -- big ones.  We hold steady and follow the tracers into the desert, but find nothing.  The AT's still hot -- no infantry had been marked on this hill yet.  We wait for something, before I finally decide to return to my rifle.\n\nScrolling down I find the correct item, and click to select it.  Instead of switching to my rifle, the AT fires into the ground at my feet.\n\nJust another day with arma.\n","February 4, 2014","true","223.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

What to me makes this game different from the others was of course the mechanics, clunky as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• but I loved it. It also has a somewhat enjoyable but steep learning curve (if you're a fps kid like me) but it was all worth it, even though my first 5 deaths was because I didn't know how to bandage finding my first gun (an M1911) was a very awesome feeling (this was ofc when there was 1 heli per server and guns weren't everywhere like in epoch now) And it was always satisfying going up north, knowing that you can always find better things like M14 or M107's or even a car, the thrill was exciting. This is something the standalone doesn't have to offer and I am slightly annoyed that they're trying to replace this awesome game with that piece of Sh*t. Also this game made me get an i7 I used to have 13-20 fps playing this xD Different maps were a big part too, about half of my hours were on Taviana which is pretty much dead by now... (I'm gonna flip ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• if it doesn't return it SA)  I've also met many people through the game some of which I've become good friends with which I still know today, without them dayz would've been a more boring and doomed game to me, so thank you Ian, Markus, Larry, Jack, Alex, Folke, Per, David, Justin and the GR guys for making this game even better than it already was\n\n\n10/10 best 25 euros I've ever spent","June 16, 2014","true","267.2"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","6"

I cant stop playing as bad at the game as i am, i find it so fun, i could play this game for hours and i plan on it. The gunplay is the most realistic ive ever seen the graphics are great, driving is mostly solid, and the map is huge and ive only been to a section of it. The wasteland mode is the best part of the game, where you scavenge for food, water, weapons. and you can build your base pretty much anywhere and its a great game to play with friends. there is a huge lineup of modes of transport. But now the main game, its a great realistic military shooter with accurate combat and many maps, modes and players.","December 16, 2013","true","67.7"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RemrotS/recommended/33930/","RemrotS","RemrotS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RemrotS/","36 products in account","Arma 2: Combined Operations REVIEW  Just so people don't get confused Combined Operations is Arma 2 + Arma 2 OA.\n\nArma 2: CO is a fun military shooter while being realistic but not too realistic if you get what I mean.\n\nI can't say much about the campaigns as I have only gotten past the first mission on both Arma 2 and OA so I'll skip that section.\n\nThe multiplayer is massive and can go upto nearly 100 players! (I've actually seen a server with a 200 player cap!) there is also a wide range of missions both default and user-made. However not all user-made missions are perfect and can have weird framerate drops, missing scripts and glitches. These missions range from generic deathmatches to total domination of the entire map with up to three factions brawling it out which is very fun if people ya know... Work TOGETHER. Which leads me to the community side of things.\n\nThe community is rich with mods that add stuff like: armies from around the globe, weapons ranging from sci-fi sniper rifles to classic bolt-action rifles, maps of real world locations or comepletely made-up islands! There is so much modifications yyou just have to see it for yourself! The community is  most of the time  friendly and have loads of groups that play together with teamwork. Now here come the more dissapointing parts of the community. See you won't get much teamwork or friendlyness outside of these groups or clans. You WILL come across people who love to ruin the experience with people ranging from lowlife teamkillers (Sometimes its on accident) to hackers. You also get racists, random banners (Doesn't mean Battleye ban) etc. There is just a bad chunk of rot in the game so beware.\n\nYou may also find it hard to actually PLAY ARMA 2! My goodness what ever you do if you want to PLAY ARMA 2 please for everything that is Arma USE THE FILTERS. The serverlist by default is spammed to absolute hell with DayZ. Which I consider a TOTALLY different community (They don't "play" Arma 2 they play DayZ).\n\nNow you may be thinking by most of the screenshots in the Community Hub  "These graphics are terrible"  Well...\n\n1. The graphics most people set its LOW, LOW, LOW, OFF, OFF, OFF and LOW with a hint of 800x600. These people are A. People who struggle with the game's unoptimized performance or B. Have ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• PCs that cost $400.\n\n2. The graphics are quite nice maxed out (Not that I can max them out ;_;) and if these are below your standards may I suggest you give it a shot.\n\nNow the fun part! Gameplay is... Fun? Is that the right word? I don't care I think it is fun to play, bit clunky at some parts but it is generally all good. The main focus is infantry combat which is nicely in-depth with range finding, sneaking about, misc buttons, etc. The game has A.I. companions that tell you to do ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• but where it's really at is commanding them... Which is a interesting experience. The A.I. ISN'T the best I will tell you that right now! They can go through walls (Only really happens with LOTS of A.I.) They can't drive properly even if their life depended on it but there are mods that make the A.I. better. You also have the ability to use heaps of cars, trucks, bikes, planes, jets, APCs, jeeps, tanks and helicopters all with a little difference or a massive difference in speed, mobility and armour.\n\nNow before I wrap this up this game is VERY far from flawless and you will experience bugs and glitches that will only ever happen in Arma 2 depending on what is happening these can be downright annoying or pure hilariousness! These are the following examples of what we call being "Arma'd"\n\n1. Death By Physics\nYou may be wondering  Wait other games can kill you by phsyics!  While you may be right but Arma 2's "physics" engine provides the most hilarious and interesting experience I've ever had in gaming.\n\nI've been killed by running into a non moving vehicle 3 times, I've had my legs broken or have been killed by rocks or similar objects more times then I can remember, I've been flung by vehicles further then the longest sniper shot and I've had my own vehicle flung into the air so high that it puts NASA to shame.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=472298009\n\n2. Clones\nThis may actually be a rare event but I have had my character produce a COPY of himself... I-I-I don't have the words to explain it! http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=564987491\n\n3. Invisible But-not-invisible Buildings\nThis was annoying but yet so hilarious! I could see, interact and collide with buildings that other people could not! Just look at the screenshots!\nBuilding  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=549549987\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Building  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=550165759\nThis picture doesn't show like the rest, weird\n\n\nOverall this game has been one of the best experiences I've ever had and I recommend that you just give a shot because it may become one of the best experiences YOU may ever have.","December 10, 2015","true","382.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","8","9","4","0"

It's a tactical shooter/military simulator that has singleplayer, coop, and PvP. There are hundreds of vehicles, weapons, and player models for you to use, so each time you play, you try something new. However the game also has some parts that bring it down. I will list all the good/bad points.\n\nThe good:\nEmphasis on realism\nEmphasis on multiplayer\nWide array of equipment, all usable in-game\nSmall but active, mature and helpful community\nGood graphics\nGood atmosphere\nEasy to learn, difficult to master\nLarge map, open world. Able to travel over entire country\nGood inventory system\nFun custom missions\nReplayability\n\nThe bad:\nBad voice acting. Every time you order people around, it feels like all the words are spliced. For example: "team RED. go to that TANK"\nClumsy infantry movement. While sprinting around for kilometers in open areas feels fine, moving around in buildings is slow, clumsy, and innefecient. You will notice that you either move too fast or slow for CQB, and that your gun won't fit through doors unless you're holding it down.\nLarge amount of HDD space taken up. This game can take up around 15 gigs on your hard drive.\nNo low-spec computer support. While you can turn graphics options down, you will find it hard to target enemies over 1 kilomenter away when everyone's texture is just a blur and there's a great big wall of fog right where they are.\nThe engine. There are no ragdoll physics at all, object collision doesn't always work, shadows take up much processing power\n\nAll in all, if you can get past the poor engine, you will find this game extremely addictive and fun. 8/10","March 16, 2014","true","133.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

It is one of the few shooters that has a learning curve. Playing smart, knowing your limits, and understanding tactics will give you the edge every time. I enjoy the large maps and the ability to play terrain. Its not a bunch of hallways and passages covered by an army of snipers. Vehicles and emplacements are powerful modifications and enhance the style of play. Everyone has a job to do and the team suffers if someone comes short. The DayZ mod is also enjoyable and employs some of the same tactics and skill with the "zombie" aspect. This is a great game and offers varied forms of play and there are a TON of mods available. It is worth getting Operation Arrowhead even if it is outdated. All of the Arma Games are a great option.","October 5, 2014","true","502.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It's the one and the only ArmA II: Operation Arrowhead, probably one of the most well known games amongst the PC gaming community. This game has everything for everyone. You want to stroll around in a zombie infested wasteland full of players trying to kill you instead of zombies? It's got that! You want to fly in a special ops raid on an insurgent filled town at night with the glow of green illuminating your room while tracers fly on the screen? It's got that! You want to play as an abusive cop and beat down the local civilian population for driving in the middle of the road? It has that too. Yes ArmA II:Operation Arrowhead has just about everything you could ask for, but it does have stuff you didn't ask for. Like AI's that are either blind of Vasili Zaitsev, Zombies that come through walls to get you, and other weird glitches that although are not game breaking, are annoying at the best of times.\n\nWhatever your fortay me be in video games, I am sure that Operation Arrowhead can fullfil many of your hopes and expectations from a now old, military simulator that is at the top of its respected genre of games. Whether you want to be a pilot, infantry soldier, tank operator, marksmen, civilian, rebel, or police officer this game can give you what you want. It is for these reasons and more that you will discover, that I recommend this game even so long after its initial release.","January 23, 2015","true","597.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

The realism is   amazing *second only to ArmA 3), the massive open world nature of the game  and the different modes of play that are available, plus the   extra non essential  DLC that you can purchaseall add  depth to this superb game.  It's not  a Call of Duty, in yer face shooter, with  a linear   SP campaign, but a versatile, open   game with a mission editor  and loads of  free  custom made content that'll see you playing this game  for years to come. (I've played more than double the hours  that are quoted on my profile as I originally owned the  disc version of the game before I purchased it via Steam)\n\nThe environments you can explore in  ArmA II and expansions  are massive, covering  hundreds of square miles of  forest, country side, towns, villages and desert regions.  There's  masses of  weapon types, loads of vehicles and   airborne  planes and choppers that you can  play with and the online community  is  massive.  The game    is also   set up to use the track IR (a tracking device that allows you to look around  the games environment and frees up your hands  as you can lean around corners just by tilting your head instad of using  the Q & E keys, or you can look behind you , lean forwards and you zoom in on your enemy.  The hardware is expensive, but it gives an unparralelled   immersivness to the game.\n\nFor me, ArmA II is  by far one of the best military simlation I've ever played (the only exception so far being ArmA 3).\n\nIf you like to  play a stealth game this is definitely the game for you; no run and gun, but a real military simultion.","November 23, 2010","true","706.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

I would say that unless you're interested in DayZ or have some friends to play some missions with look for this while it is on sale.  I would recommend getting ACE realism mod for the added realism improvement.  The possibilities are endless as you can customize your own missions if you want, and with mods and addons, you'll have a lot to experiment with.

Since I've started playing DayZ, I've been hooked ever since. It was a little bit of a pain in the azz to get it all setup my first time, but once I did, it was worth it. Despite all the bugs, I do find DayZ to be a good game.\n\nWhen I first started, I played in PVE (Epoch) servers. No PVP is allowed in PVE servers. It gave me a chance to grasp the game without being interupted by other players. Then once I grasped the game enough, I wondered off to the PVP servers. Starting out that way might be best for you (or not), just thought I would suggest it.\n\nYeah, it has its buggy moments -  it's still an awesome game... yes, this is coming from a DayZ-holic so take this as you will. :D","April 1, 2015","true","926.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","6","8","3","0"

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Domination mode and DayZ mod will burn hundreds of hours of your time and you won't regret it. The engine takes quite a long time to get used to, and there are plenty of bugs, but the Arma 2 engine is unlike any other. There's something about the gameplay that is really fun and interesting once you're used to it. The DayZ mod is no doubt the best game you can play with your friends. The funniest moments I have ever had playing a video game took place in the DayZ mod. There's is so much freedom and endless possibilities for hilarious moments. There is nothing quite like how the anarchy works in DayZ mod.","June 28, 2014","true","427.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As long as you know atleast two friends who own this game.\nIf you're gonna buy it, buy Combined Operations because both ArmA 2 and Operation Arrowhead are so cool and unique that you gotta have both of them.\nVery realistic military simulator but if you're playing on easy it can still be played like an action movie where an RPG takes down your tail rotor so you start crashing into a forest, everyone gets down and takes cover behind the chopper as your enemies converge on your position to make sure you're dead and an epic gun fight starts.\nThe best aspect of this game is the scale and the amount of content. There's hundreds of vehicles, hundreds of weapons, hundreds of units, tons of maps, and like 10+ factions in total, all with their unique arsenals, vehicles, tactics and appearance. This game can either be played with a clan on huge scaled battles with medevac choppers on standby and armor swishing over the plains while getting carpet bombed by Warthogs or it can be played as a small rebel force, fighting either russians or americans or whatever you want, basically, hiding in the woods at night with only flashlights, waiting to ambush a convoy and steal their weapons and medical supplies.\nThe best experience you can have in this game is with atleast 15 people because then you can experience the realism that this game is intended for and people don't have to multitask, such as one person being infantry and chopper pilot at the same time etc.\nThis game is a solid 10/10 and most of the bugs in this game are managable and/or hillarious.

Its great game and has so many things you can do, from fighting in the battlefield with your comrades to living a peaceful life as a civilian in the beautiful maps of Takistan, or Chernarus. But, don't mistake this for a simple sandbox FPS, It is far from it, I don't recommend this for people who are used to simple controls, unless you are willing to spend some time in the tutorial for a couple of hours. The campaigns with the DLCs and without them are amazing to play, except the one in the Army of the Czech Republic DLC. I personally give this game an 8/10 for great storyline in the campaign, the amazing modding capabilities in the game. The only faults I find are some bugs, the Army of the Czech republic dlc was disappointing since I couldn't really see the story behind it.","March 26, 2014","true","198.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Game plays best with the 'ACE' mod and 'ACRE'. Level of realism never really found in any other type of game. Some of the the most intense moments and craziest stories come from this game. Huge selection of weapons and vehicles that all feel very different from one another. The game still isnt very well optimized so runs weird even on high end machines, still a massive multiplayer scene with lots of servers and choices.\n\nThe singleplayer missions are alright, but really feel empty when playing by yourself and the AI, being able to play any mission custom or offical is great and adds lots of life to the game in the long run. But if your looking to buy ARMA to play wth some friends in Co-op I would suggest going with ARMA 3 as it makes the process of getting missions and joining much more easy.","September 23, 2014","true","62.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

So, why not recommend? One word: Battleye. Quite possibly the worst anti-cheat system I've ever seen in all my years of gaming and now that Steam has integrated with the servers, you may not even purchase new CD-keys for the same account. Thats right. Legally and legitimately bought CD-keys for this game have no use if you've already bought the game on Steam.\n\nBattleye has proven to be a stable as a house of cards, kicking people and denying them online play for nonsense such as ' Battleye failed to intialize ' and other such technical problems that plague the system which unfortunately was never perfected. It's a shame, because the game has a LOT to offer in terms of online and i'd personally jump to ARMA III if my computer could handle it but alas, I'm stuck in the single-player limbo of this game and confined the hacker friendly online servers.\n\nIn short: Good game, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• devs ruining it with an unstable ' Anti-cheat ' nightmare system.","August 2, 2014","false","84.7"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","25","46","0","2"

A fantastic tool for tactical war-sim gameplay if you're so inclined and you bring a bit of brain matter into the equation.\n\nGrab your friends and roll in a tank, build up an outpost, dominate a crowd of kids in a plane or ditch the whole public domain, install ACE and ACRE, find a platoon and immerse in tactical infantry gameplay the way you did when you were still in boot camp many moons ago.\nBe a leet sniper and parachute into the action in hopes of quickscope headshots just to get mauled by enemy fire every two minutes or learn about the range of firearms and proper range estimation and use camouflage to your advantage as you work your way from one objective to the next under the cover of friendly surveillance.\nShout into Voice-Over-Net because mommy doesn't understand you or join an ACRE server, learn about the use of radios and broadcast your grid reference to your platoon commander on VHF, over.\nThe choices are yours to make once you realize that no two servers are the same and you don't actually have to play with toddlers.\n\nI will love this game forever and for always.","October 18, 2013","true","367.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Defiently spend the extra money to get Operation Arrowhead for ARMA II. Worth every cent. 10/10.","July 31, 2014","true","96.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

ARMA II and its expansions were a welcomed breath of fresh air to mainstream FPS/TPS games. Everything about this game is military ops to the letter. Real Time, Open world combat where one wrong step over a ridge can end you up flatlined. Tactical thinking is requierd in most situations on the campaigns, and sometimes even micro/macro management of your forces. Be aware that even though this game is kind of getting long in the whiskers, setting your visual settings to all high and max draw distance is not advised. The max draw distance of 10,000 (meters) will crunch even the best of Graphics card, and you will notice and performance drop. Every building in the game is descrutible (from what I have experienced). Also there are some bugs with ARMA II base game. They include, but are not limited to weapons/gear disappearing when exiting water, vehicles not spawning in when you buy them, AI getting vehicles stuck for no good reason or not properly moving to a waypoint, and in certain situtaions, losing command of certain purchased units, notably in your squad. Despite these flaws, ARMA II is still and fun and challenging series. And the multiplayer has loads of fun as well. Everything from testing weapons, to dropping a bomb on a group of civillians and watching them go sky high while your frames drop to the teens.","June 21, 2014","true","46.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For those who saw the good in the Gulf War, saw how many people America helped and was proud to live in the Western world.\n\nARMA II: Operation Arrowhead is an anti-war game. Its opening scenes are not the declaration of war, but soldiers celebrating its end. Then coming to grips with its consequences.\n\nIt's hard to really adequately describe this game. Let me try. "Operation Arrowhead" does an excellent job of showing just how gonzo modern warfare has become. You've got unemployed reservists going to the Middle East for kicks. A takastani army who uses gas attacks, electric shock torture and other atrocities to fight the rebels. Thrown in the mix is a U.S.-educated taki whose businesses were destroyed by the Americans.\n\nNot the best role playing game in the world.

Though in recent weeks ive discovered that both OA and Arma 2 have even more to offer as an online game. The use of the ACE and ACRE mods opens up the online skirmishing to a whole new level of realism and combat, and the extensive community which consistently develops more and more modifications for both Operation Arrowhead and Arma 2, means that theres always something new and interesting either being added or updated.\n\nEven still, if you're not too interested in the online aspects of the Arma series; the Single Player aspects offer much too - and the detailed and expansive world which has been created for you to battle in is both vast and utterly brilliant.\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend this game, and the base Arma 2 game, as a must have for your Steam Library.\n\nRecommended?:  Wholeheartedly yes\nScore:  9/10","June 21, 2014","true","315.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ghost18A/recommended/33930/","Ghost18A","A.Mitchell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ghost18A/","23 products in account","Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead/Combined Operations is a excellent military simulator that can be easily modded to fit the players' needs and can be a good Tactical Realism game when utilized to its fullest potential. Not a game recommended for players who expect aspects from Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Battlefield, or other popular First-Person Shooters. In this Mil-Sim game, players are to think before they act; playing through the multiple scenarios in their head before executing their tactics. Communication is highly recommended since this game generally requires teamwork, collaboration, and team playing in order to accomplish missions. In addition, new players are highly recommended to play the "Boot Camp" scenarios in single-player mode until they feel confident enough to play on multiplayer servers. This includes, but not limited to Infantry Combat/Warfare, Controlling AI, *Flying Aircraft*, Driving Ground Vehicles, Understanding Logistics/Support, etc... The few flaws of this game are:\n\n1) HACKERS & Team Killers. Indeed, hackers tend to lurk in multiplayer servers and to reduce the amount of gameplay from being ruined, join a server with an active admin. Team killers are an often occurance since new players do not identify targets before they shoot.\n\n2) Poor AI. Although there are many mods that can fix this problem, the default AI behavior can be irritating for certain situations (e.g. piloting aircrafts, driving ground vehicles, infantry combat).\n\n3) Bugs/glitches. There are low chances that bugs/glitches may occur and can happen in the wrong place and wrong time. This is especially hazardous when you are flying an aircraft. Players tend to have to restart/reboot the entire game/computer to fix this problem.\n\n4) Lag and Frames Per Second issues. This common if you do not have a high-preformance computer, poor internet connection, or playing in a server hosted on the other side of the world (e.g. you live in the US but play on a server in the UK). Another common cause of lag is smoke and explosions. Smoke grenades, demolishing buildings, firing high volumes of Hydra rockets, explosions from artillery/mortars, and others can cause a significant decrease FPS which can reduce gameplay performance like player movement, camera panning, and others.\n\nConclusion: Overall, this game is best Mil-Sim game avaiable to the public.\n\n*For the best Player Tips, Manuals, and Tactics, Google: Dslyecxi for entertaining videos on his YouTube channel, read/download his Arma Manuals from his website, or learn how to play like a professional.","July 9, 2014","true","858.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can't hold to ADS and are forced to toggle your ironsights/scopes, the overall movement feels very clunky and the ability to go 3rd person contradicts the sim nature of it.  It's also poorly optimized in the CPU utilization department. However where this "game" shines is providing a superb vehicular simulation all around. Air vehicles in particular are extremely well done with extensively detailed interiors and smooth physics and controls. If you have any passing interest in a good MMS vehicles sim you should definitely give it a try, however as an FPS mil sim its weaksauce.

Arma has without a doubt one of the most active gaming communities that create endless amounts of content. Without these moders and script writers the franchise would have ended a long time ago. In steam alone I have 62 hrs played but out of steam using play with Six launcher and other launchers I probably have close to 1000 hrs played. Arma will disapoint at times when you get killed because you rolled into a tree but its worth it!. It can be slow but you can grow to love that, it's not for everyone but i highly recommend it even with the Release of Arma 3. It simply does not have the same feel or enough content to surpass the classic Arma 2.","May 21, 2014","true","202.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

Play almost 100 hours and I will never regret those hours spent playing the  DayZ mod optional with the game, which I encourage you to try. Look up popularly known Youtube content creators like JackFrags, FRANKIEonPCin1080p (I know he had a couple of scandals regarding the hacking incidents, such a shame) and PsiSyndicate.\n\nFantastic game DayZ is.\n\nAlthough a bit more expense required to play this game compared to other survival games (Rust, Romero's Aftermath and Minecraft etc.) it is still worth a buy. I bought the package with most of the DLC (ArmA 2: Complete Collection, costing $39.99 USD without any sale) making the game look fantastic. Runs extremely well on Windows 7 - 10.\n\nThere is a deep aspect of survival in this game, making it one of the most realistic zombie post-apocalyptic games on Steam. Heavily refined over the years, Arma 2: DayZ Mod is a fantastic game to play. Great fun with friends and can get lonely playing solo in the in the zombie apocalypse.\n\nDoes require deep concetration and skill to maximize enjoyment.","December 13, 2015","true","271.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

In all honesty, I've had a blast regardless of the few glitches and bugs I've encountered, the wonky optimisation (or lack of it, if you have an AMD processor you're in for a world of hurt) and the occasional 9 year old with an unhealthy obsession with the TAB key.\n\nAt the start I focused on lonewolfing my way through but, as expected, it's when you team up that this type of experience is enhanced and my greatest highlights always involve the people I've met and befriended while trying to survive, one dead goat at a time.\n\nAlso, reloading a hatchet is hilarious.

I originally bought this game mainly for Dayz but quickly realized this game has extremely unique and untapped potential in its singleplayer and other vanilla multiplayer modes if you are patient enough to learn how to play them. This game is everything in one a military simulator, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• around and troll simulator, building and management, player crafting, open world exploring, mass vehicle battles, zombie apocalypse survival, you name it. This game will give you a unique experience everytime no matter how many hours you place into this you can make friends, have amazing friendships, and betray them and steal everything they love within minutes. Drive around, kidnap innocent people, make them undress, and then shoot them in the legs forcing them to crawl to survival while they get eaten alive by zombies. What's not to love? 10/10 most realistic and unrealistic simulator ever, best to play with a couple of friends. But be wary of strangers you meet, they may shoot you and steal your baked beans.

The possibilities are endless. I find it comparable to the Source games that Valve has released, in that you can make any kind of mission, or game mode, or install a diverse amount of mods to be able to play Arma in a completely new view.\n\nThe downsides to Arma 2, and the mods, are that you really need to know what you are doing, especially if installing mods. It can become a pain to manage multiple mods, and you might find yourself using third-party programs to manage and to start different kinds of mods. These third-party programs include, but are not limited to: DayZ Commander, Six Updater, et cetera.\n\nHonestly, as said before, the possibilites are really as far as your mind takes you. You can play seriously, or just screw around with a few friends in a private server/match for a few hours. The Arma series of games are a "MUST BUY" on the Steam Store.","March 4, 2013","true","54.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is slightly "clunky" to play, in tending towards realism, but it manages to pull it off. It's hard to make a sandbox game immersive in my opinion, but nothing makes you feel like you're in a real world like dropping into Chernarus for one mission or another. Definitely not a twitch game, but you can experience what feels like total desolation wandering around the landscape with your rifle, coming across another player only infrequently, making the experience punctuated by panic. Of course everyone mostly bought this for DayZ and that mod is excellent, but I would recommend checking out some fun other basic OA missions like "Wasteland" or "Takistan Life".","January 12, 2013","true","163.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

In all honesty, I've had a blast regardless of the few glitches and bugs I've encountered, the wonky optimisation (or lack of it, if you have an AMD processor you're in for a world of hurt) and the occasional 9 year old with an unhealthy obsession with the TAB key.\n\nAt the start I focused on lonewolfing my way through but, as expected, it's when you team up that this type of experience is enhanced and my greatest highlights always involve the people I've met and befriended while trying to survive, one dead goat at a time.\n\nAlso, reloading a hatchet is hilarious.

I heavily enjoyed it for that purpose and also the fact that it was heavily moddable to create a unique community filled with plenty of games to play. There is just one problem that was very very much so of a problem within this game; The game's Engine. The engine that makes this game run is absolutely terrible, it's incrediblyt clunky, and extremely unoptimized, even though this game is made when it was, it still can struggle to run on high end PC's of today in 2014.

Apart from that, the game is amazing. It has a steep learning curve but if you can stick with it and get past that, the game is too good. The map(s) are huge and Chernarus in particular is something special. The amount of different game modes (excluding DayZ variations) is enough to keep you playing for many hundreds, possibly thousands of hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imjustgettingstarted/recommended/33930/","imjustgettingstarted","Saunders","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imjustgettingstarted/","315 products in account","Don't be fooled by my low playtime. Most of my time playing has been through mod launchers that didn't include steam overlay. My actual time played is likely between 500 and 1,000 hours.\n\nI can't recommend the base game without mods because I've never played the base game without mods. ACE and ACRE on a multiplayer server are what make the game amazing, and I don't think it's worth your time to play the single player game unmodded.\n\nArma II is riddled with bugs and problems. It's an incredibly demanding game, even on modern machines. It hogs your CPU and can crash for literally no reason at all. If you're playing with other people (as you should) you'll likely spend hours standing around doing nothing, then get shot in the first few seconds of a firefight and spend the next five minutes staring at a black screen until the death screen pops up because you bled out.\n\nYou'll drive down a dirt road at a snails pace watching for IEDs, only to get blown up by one you didn't see hidden in a bush. Then you'll drive down the same road, again, and when you arrive at you area of operation you'll take a bullet to the head and die instantly.\n\nSometimes you'll have to sit around on a hilltop looking at enemies for 30 minutes while you wait for your fireteam leader to radio the squad leader, who then has to radio command, who then has to radio back questions, which are relayed to your fireteam leader, who answer them back to the squad leader, who radios back to command, who radios back to squad leader permission to engage, who sends back to your fireteam leader, who then tells you you can engage. And that's if everyone is listening to each other. More likely you'll sit around for thirty minutes while the fireteam leader tries to contact the squad leader who doesn't even have their radio on.\n\nOccasionally you'll gear up for a halo jump or fastrope operation, gather everyone on the tarmac, load up into the helicopter, wait for the pilot to discuss drop zone with your officers, then after fifteen minutes of flying your screen will go black with the sound of a surface to air missle blowing a hole through the cockpit.\n\nBelieve me when I say Arma II has been the most fun and engaging video game I've ever played and if I could only have one game for the rest of my life it would be this.\n\nArma III is apparently getting ok but it makes me sad that Arma II is being replace WHY CAN'T WE KEEP ARMA II OPERATIONS CAPTAIN? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME???","September 18, 2014","true","164.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The voice of the squads' Corpsman crackled through my headset; asking if his microphone was working.\n\n"Lima Charlie..." a dozen voices call out from various parts of the Merlin. I sit there, with my M110 sitting alongside me; the light of the setting Takistani sun glinted off the shiny beige paint of my rifle. I turn towards it, and slowly remove the scope caps; and place them in my small bag. I withdraw my Kestrel from a small pocket on my arm; I cover the top half with my hand in a meagre attempt to shield the screen from the light. After calibrating it, a small group of numbers flash onto the screen; satisfied with it's answer I place it back into the pocket.\n\nAs the division's only Designated Marksman, I had quite a few different priorities; one was to keep my assigned squad alive, not that, that happened very often though.  In the distance I could see a cloud of purple smoke rise up into the sky; we were nearing the LZ. The Merlin shuddered as it quickly landed; within seconds the squad had set up a perimeter around the large helicopter. We could hear the crack of small arms in the distance, the newer member of our small squad shuddered at the sound. After a few minutes of sitting near the helicopter in silence, we began to hear the sound of a truck moving towards us. 'Technical' the word flashed through my mind; these modified trucks struck fear into the hearts of infantrymen. Less than a kilometer away, I could see the large MG mounted in the truck's bed; I slowly looked down my sight, and took aim at the driver.\n\n"CONNECTION TO HOST LOST"\nThe words flashed across my laptop's screen; in the Teamspeak channel various derogitory curses arose from the throats of my comrades. Lost in the myriad of curses, I could faintly detect someone yelling the word banana; a smile played on my face.

As his blood splattered across the hot desert sands I holstered the weapon, walking around to the back of my truck and retrieving a handy tool-kit which I used to replace the flat tire.

She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I love the cold. Thirty years later I get a postcard. I have a son. And he's the Chief of Police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care.

It has it's bugs, and doesn't do too well on physics, but if you can forgive those flaws this game will give you COUNTLESS hours of mindless fun on the editor, and scenerios. Now modding it is a whole other story, It adds a whole new layer of fun on top of it by adding tons of new FREE content. If you do intend to pick this up for DayZ, be sure to try out the vanilla game. I assure you it will keep you entertained for days and weeks on end. It has a learning curve I'll admit but once your 100 to 200 hours into it, you will be addicted. 10/10 Great game, worth the money.","March 25, 2014","true","689.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It really has something for everyone, and can also be modded to play the famous DayZ mod which has countless hours on its on. Arma II: OA really shouldn't be called a game, its more like a sampler. You can literally play exactly what you want, if its an idea there is a mod it really is a shining example of what cooperation between a developer and their fanbase should look like in the whole industry.\n\nThe game can be demanding on your setup so make sure you have a good CPU, lots of ram, and decent graphics card. The settings cranked in this game make it pretty damn gorgeous so you will not be dissapointed. The game is often on sale as are all of the initial dlcs, which add various new things, and also unlock the full potential of high res texturing.","December 30, 2013","true","409.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lets see lets see lets see...\n\n\nArma 2: Operation is a shooter Military simulation game. Were you can take your own squad into battle.\nOk. First of all. If your just looking for another story mode game. Were you can just run and shoot. Then this game is not for you.  And stuff like that. Because if you gets shot 3 times your dead. Now. This game. Got me playing for a few hours now. And it ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• me off a little bit. When it comes to Lag. But Arma 2 Has more lag Then Arma 2: Operation. But your computer has like runs like 1000 frames a ####ING secound. Then you don't have to worry about  the ####ing Lag. If you cant buy Arma 3. Then i would buy this with Operation. I got the Dlcs. And i like the Dlcs. Ok So forgot about that. So the gameplay. It's really looks real. When it comes to Military. You shoot Al's from far away. You can control your own squad. And one of the missons on Arma 2. You can even buy units. And If you Think. That this is another one of those games. Were you just level up. No This game is not all about that. It's about Military. And that buy units Part. You could just buy cheap units. [Ingame money] And they would still be useful. Don't think this is Army of Two. [Well you could just do Army of two on a misson.] But you would have to be very skilled. 3 Shots your dead. If your looking for a game. That looks real. And just like real life Military. This game is for you. If your looking for a game were you can just, Run and Gun.[Which means like Call of duty Story. Were you just shoot then. And Run.] Then this game is not for you.\n\n\nSo this game is ? Worth a buy\nüëç üëç üëç üëç üëç üëç üëç üëç üëç üëç üëç\nYES","September 6, 2015","true","217.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Arma II Operation Arrowhead is what i would describe as the best Mil Sim that is commerically available. Released in 2010, Operation Arrowhead expanded the features of Arma II and enhanced the game a lot. Instead of playing in Chernarus, a new map, Takistan was introduced to the Mix. A combination of Dunes, Settlements and Airbases is what made this map special for me. Honestly, Most of my time was spent on the mission editior, just making new scenarios for my friends when we would play multiplayer. You have to have a basic understanding of programming in order to make Fluid and Fun mission, as the Mission editor does not hold your hand, it throws you out into the big world, where you either consult forums or learn by trial and error. In regards to gameplay, the game feels right, the game world can be very dynamic. Vehicals and Weapons is what really makes the game here. There are over 300 weapons (including Variations) and 80 Vehicles. The Vehicles handle nicely, and weapons feel authentic, except for the gunfire sounds. Squad interaction and Commanding is a big thing in the game, and it works very well, the AI will move stealthily, hide, and ambush on your command. Moving on, The Graphics are nothing spectacular, but they are not bad either, mostly the textures and lighting are a bit dodgy. Another problem is that the game is not very well optimised, so AA and ATOC will drop your frame rate by a lot unless you have a high end card. Apart from those issues, the graphics are okay. There is a campaign in the game, however, it is seldom played through to my knowledge. But the campaign is solid, nothing special to it, and not to forget that the voice acting is quite frankly, terrible. Finally, the main reason to why people love this game, is the Multiplayer. Servers can handle up to 100+ players, and many of these servers often have an emphasis on millitary simulation, so you have the full package; Real tactics, Radio Chatter, and team play. The multiplayer world is also a bit unforgiving, as it can happen that you play for 20 minutes and not encounter a single enemy, and as soon as you encounter your eney, he kills you in one shot. well, such is warfare. I recommend this game to millitary enthusiats and people who want to play a realistic team based game\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nCampaign: 5/10\nGraphics:   6/10\nMultiplayer: 10/10\n\nP.S\n\nThere are thousands of mods for this game","February 27, 2014","true","250.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In all honesty, I've had a blast regardless of the few glitches and bugs I've encountered, the wonky optimisation (or lack of it, if you have an AMD processor you're in for a world of hurt) and the occasional 9 year old with an unhealthy obsession with the TAB key.\n\nAt the start I focused on lonewolfing my way through but, as expected, it's when you team up that this type of experience is enhanced and my greatest highlights always involve the people I've met and befriended while trying to survive, one dead goat at a time.\n\nAlso, reloading a hatchet is hilarious.

Whilst it is not totally accurate, I don`t think any game can be, the developers have come very close to replicating real word weapons and vehicles. The combat itself is ok, although either the standard SA-805 is not in here, or it is in disguise. Minor niggles aside, I can whole heartedly recommend both this game and the DLC.  I have had, and look forward to many more hours of fun, only this time, if I get shot or killed, I can just start again  lol.","December 14, 2013","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

See my profile pic? Yeah. The game is super realistic, because it is a mil-sim. It is optimized to the max, and has many game modes like prop ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and Battleblock Theatre. There is all sorts of cool thing in game, like shooting somebody 30 times in the chest, and then running around in circles trying to make sure they dont kill you while the game registers they actually got shot and should be dead. But dont worry. He will die in about 5 minutes. The fact that your car randomly flips and you can instantly heal yourself just goes to show the intense work that went into this game. Remember, its a mil-sim. Also, I like the way you can hack this game with no penalties what-so-ever. Its fantastic.

Wait for everyone to get in.‚Äù Jesus, the waiting is killing me I thought as the engine puttered and choked back to sleep. Sitting inside the hot and cramped M113 armored personnel carrier I was patiently waiting for everyone to get ready. To my 2 o‚Äôclock a tall warehouse rests no more than 500 meters away. Nearby are small adobe huts and a few other scattered buildings. In the middle of it all is a derelict gas station. Over my shoulder I see Kilo and Tangible get out onto an open field. They walk to the left in front of my M113.\n‚ÄúAlright ground team you all ready?‚Äù\n‚ÄúReady!‚Äù\n‚ÄúYup!‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhat about you Billy?‚Äù\nBilly close to the palm tree forest yells out,\n‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm here.‚Äù\n‚ÄúOk let‚Äôs get moving.‚Äù\nMaj. Kilo is leading the ground team while Ice and I are on standby with the M113s. The ground team consists of Kilo, Tangible, and Zer‚àÖ, with support from Billy and Jack. The ground team walked on an exposed dirt pathway to the warehouse. Kilo taking the lead, they inserted through the front garage and started clearing the building. I heard shots fired behind me and turned around to see the support squad under fire. I watched as Billy rolled on the ground to dodge bullets. With each round nearly missing I could see small plumes of dirt flying through the air. I looked toward the enemy base seeing tracers fly out window. Returning my eyes to the support squad I see Billy‚Äôs dead body lay on the ground. Bleeding, his head lay in the dirt blood seeping through his thick camouflage. Jack quickly sprints into Ice‚Äôs APC and closes the hatch. This is no time to mourn our lost brother, we have to find the shooter. Silence.\n\nSilence. The only sounds I hear are the chirping of the birds in the nearby jungle. I‚Äôm just sitting here looking. Looking to find the killer. I shout out,\n‚ÄúHey I think I see something on the top of that hill. Its at my 11 o‚Äôclock.‚Äù\nIce replies, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see that way its behind me.‚Äù\nJack says, ‚ÄúI can, I‚Äôm lookin‚Äô.‚Äù\nOne minute passes, two minutes, three.\n‚ÄúHey I see someone, yeah I see someone he‚Äôs running down the hill!‚Äù. Jack shouts!\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see anyone. Where is he?‚Äù\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right there! On the left side!‚Äù\n‚ÄúI see him I‚Äôm going after him!‚Äù\n‚ÄúWait Vbud.‚Äù\n‚ÄúCome on he‚Äôs right there!‚Äù\nI feel like a dog on a leash seeing a cat for the first time. I rev the engine and get ready to plow straight through him!\n‚ÄúVbud go get him!‚Äù Kilo says, relieving me of my building excitement I charge at him full speed, while listening to the chirps and chimes of 7.7 rifle rounds deflecting off the M113s frontal armor. I fly across the grassy field, careful not to hit the sparse but clustered palm trees. The enemy runs away as he realizes his mistake. He dodges to my right side. I slow and turn my vehicle around a large tree. I catch him getting back up from his futile attempt to evade revenge. Calmly, I throttle up and watch his body slowly disappear out of view.\n‚ÄúThud‚Äù\n‚ÄúI got him!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAlright nice.‚Äù\nNow, I don‚Äôt remember what happened in between Ice and I rushing towards the enemy base, but I do remember Ice shouting,\n‚ÄúWhat the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•! I‚Äôm hit!‚Äù\n‚ÄúIce come on get out of there!‚Äù I say rushing towards him.\nI drive up to about five meters from his M113. I hear a ‚ÄúFwoomph‚Äù then an explosion. I watch as Ice‚Äôs M113 bursts into flames. The fire burning the paint and its victim inside. It must have hit a fuel line I think to myself as I call out again, ‚ÄúIce get out!‚Äù Then I realize if they can destroy an M113 they can destroy me too. Once again my focus must change from mourning the loss of one of my best friends to not becoming one of those losses as well. I quickly turn right and make my way out of there. To save my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and an expensive piece of equipment. They must have run out of 203 grenades because they started firing rifles at me. I was still a little worried but felt better knowing I was safe inside the thick armor of the M113. Drip, drip, drip. Red liquid runs down my face like wine. Dark red blood flowing from my head has covered the dashboard. Cleaning off the blood I realize the throttle is maxed out and that I‚Äôm slowly spinning in circles. The left track must have gone out. Facing the warehouse I quickly reverse and spin myself towards a road leading west away from the warehouse. Fighting the drag of the left track I pull the wheel to turn the M113 left and right to wiggle just a few inches of distance between me and the warehouse.\n\nFor 15 grueling minutes I slowly crawl the M113 towards a small row of houses. Bleeding out, I feel my hands and my feet getting colder. I watch as the color of the grass becomes more pale. The vibrant and vivid greens and blues slowly fade on to cold colorless grays. Like an overcast sky on what would have been a sunny day. As I feel my body slow down, I also slow down the M113 and park it next to the only semi-standing building within the area. Half of the living room has caved in on itself and I can see through to the kitchen. I attempt to park the M113 by the house, but I end up just hitting the tracks against some rubble. After a few minutes of waiting, most of my wounds have clotted up and I bandage up the rest that haven‚Äôt. I briefly mourn the loss of my good friends Ice and Billy, and then grab my radio and call to Kilo, ‚ÄúVbud here, ready for extraction.‚Äù","April 1, 2015","true","236.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
