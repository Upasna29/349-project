You are left with deciding what upgrade suits your playstyle best, as every character you recruit can be moved around a small grid, positioning is important as it can boost your damage tenfold of what it originally was, whilst in return slicing its potential if you don't give your positioning any thought. It's a welcome twist because it gives you something to do besides just clicking and idling.\n\nThe game manages to take it up by yet another step, allowing you to chat with other players, which in turn can help you make friends and design the best possible strategies, making "you" the player feel like a part of the community from the start. With this on top there is a variety of seasonal events in which you unlock special achievements that grant you new characters and items.\n\nWith all that being said Crusaders of the Lost Idols is very much a welcome change to the standard click and idle formula, and will definitely be on the list of games I play for a while, so if like me by any chance you happen to be addicted to clicker games, go right ahead and pick this game up.","November 2, 2015","true","4.7"," 67 of 78 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","67","78","2","1"

An interesting take on the formula- it's still a game that plays itself but when you tune in, there's actually something to do for you. Instead of countless heroes you're given control over a formation of ten heroes, and the skills you unlock depend on position and make swapping out heroes a nice and interesting little metagame. One character may become super strong when alone in its column, another benefits all characters in from of him. It's fun.\n\nThe game also looks nice enough and has a chill, moody soundtrack as you plod through level after level, always on a (silly)  quest...\n\nIt's an idle game and you KNOW what you get with these.

The ability to set formations keeps you busy for a lot longer the other game.  And optimizing an idling formation for gold is not the one you would use for bosses, requiring you to think a little bit more and offering more things to tend after.\n\nAnd then the rebirth system is also better, unlocking more objectives upon each reset, and later on allowing new formations.  So replays are much more meaningful than just collecting time cubes or angels just for collection's sake.\n\nSo if you're gonna play an idle game, go watch anime instead.  or play Lost Idols at least.","October 19, 2015","true","11.9"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","21","27","3","0"

The game has everything you love and adds some really interesting elements that take the game to that next level. You do have a band of heroes; but you can only play 10 of them at any 1 time. The position of these heroes determines their bonuses and overall effectiveness, a perfect integration of the strategy element.\n\nThe game also has monthly events, a chat box to keep you from playing alone, tons of upgrades, levels and characters to alternate between. There is the ability to passively play and farm gold for upgrades or you can choose to push forward and actively participate in epic battles. I'd personally pick this game over clicker heroes by a hair; but overall it seems to have a little more depth.\n\nIt's Free.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/terty/recommended/402840/","terty","Pastry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/terty/","144 products in account",""Gameplay" is decent for an idle clicker game but the UI is terrible and needs a lot of polishing as it is extremely unresponsive and unintuitive. The game can do with some more talents as they call it to give some more progression and variation since skills are all quite similar and only shuffled a bit between the heroes to fit their kit. Events are quite annoying since there's not really a reliable way to finish the objectives to fill the new crusaders' inventory slots unless you're willing to pay. Would still recommend it since my gripes with it wouldn't really mean that I couldn't recommend it as it is an idle clicker game and free. It appears to also require an internet connection to run so if your internet has small hiccups or anything like that it'll ruin the UI even more since the windows can't be dismissed that inform you about game errors caused by connection issues, also means the game takes ages to load on slower connections and several buggy stuff (like not showing levels number, not showing crusader portraits or crusaders on the grid, not showing items in crusader inventories, and not showing several other UI elements) when it doesn't load properly, once again, due to slower internet I assume. Running a 4 mbps internet connection for reference.\n\n+ Free\n+ Decent gameplay\n+ Well designed characters + kits\n+ Pretty simple game\n\n- TERRIBLE UI\n- Not enough progression\n- Not enough variation in most aspects\n- Poor loading on slower internet connections","May 12","true","231.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Clicker Heroes? Loot Clicker? A Dark Room? The Monolith? Adventure Capitalist? Or maybe none of any of these? Clicker games are almost a loophole in each human bieng's mind, while playing it, the numbers of your "atk" or "econ" grows higher and higher, and then you "unlock" areas which are typically non-game changing in terms of play style. and with each "level up" you feel accomplished, which is way so many people feel inclined to play these games. Usually with these games, the player will play quite far into the game and then end up deleting it because they finally realize how pointless it is. Trust me, so many of my friends have raged. But Im here to tell you, this game will not make you rage, or feel like its pointless, so, what makes Crusaders of the lost idols stand out as a game?\n\nCrusader Of The Lost Idols Is The Best Clicker/Idle Game Out There.Crusaders of the lost idols is an idle game, but it breaks multiple boundaries. Not too many, as there is still the core gameplay of a clicker game, where after awhile clicking isnt worth it and its more based around idoling, where you can reset your current game in exchange for something to help you on your next run. However, this game adds a much needed aspect to clicker games. Strategy! And thats not all! It also adds a very nice loot system with different rarity based items, events that ACTUALLY AFFECT your runs even AFTER the event has concluded! With me having spent 240 hours on this game, i can tell you personally, its a really fun game, it may take up a bit of your time, but its well worth it.\n\nThe actual physical gameplay is simple. There are hordes of monsters coming in on the right side of the screen. Your Crusaders, Like the heroes from Clicker Heroes, are the ones that can kill these beasts! Each crusader has custom abilites that can help benefit your other Crusaders or stick it to the monsters. As you play, bosses will drop silver, and other types, of chests! These chests can contain loads of different items that help you get farther through objectives. There are 36 objectives, more constantly bieng added, that give you a certain goal you will have to accomplish. As you continue to go through each of these, you will be givin idols! These idols give you a small atk boost so you can go to other objectives more prepared! The game may seem a tad overwhelming on paper, but once you get in game, it all is quite simple really. Here are a few aspects of the game drawed out.\n\nThe Strats\nStrategy is a huge part of this game. You start out with 1 crusader, that you have to click with to kill the monsters, as you get more gold you will start unlocking more crusaders. There are a total of 24 crusaders (not including event ones). These crusaders each have a special ability to give to the team. You can arrange them in a way so that your front line of crusaders takes barely any damage and heals quite fast so that monsters cant destroy you, you can arrange them so that you give tons of extra gold per kill, you can arrange them so you have massive attack. Each Crusader can be upgraded which increases thier health and attack by using the gold you get from monsters, but some are worth more to upgrade than others. So, each arrangement can offer pros and cons, moving, or upgrading, one crusader could be the difference between 100 atk and 100k atk, so you must use logic and problem solving to figure what is the best formation to suit your playstyle.\n\nThe Areas\nThe areas in this game are amazing. Like alot of idol games, the areas repeat, the background for area 22, will be the same background for area 122. However, each area has a unique quest, it has nothing to do with the gameplay, except that you need to either retrieve X amount of items or kill X amount of monsters, but each of these quests are often references to games, tv shows, movies, fairytales, and more worlds are still bieng added! Its an amazing little extra thing the developers through into this game, but makes it that much enjoyable, the background are nicely colored and the bosses fit in with thier environment\n\n\nThe Events\nThis game has MONTHLY EVENTS, thats right FREAKIN HYPE! Each of these events introduce 1 more, limited time, world, that is totally unique, a new currency (in which to buy event chests and do event quests) TWO BRAND NEW CRUSADERS, that you STILL KEEP even after the event is over with, items for these crusaders, objectives for the world and its amazing. The monthly events are one of the things that really makes this game shine, and with unique crusaders bieng added for each of them, it really can change what strategies you commonly go to on other non-event worlds as well.\n\nOther than all that, the loot has alot of variety, there are items that benefit all crusaders, one crusaders dps, one crusaders ablities, certain types of characters dps, loot abilities that you can only use once to give you dps, or to give you gold, or to increase your click multiplier. The idols in the game are lack luster as of now, but they are currently working on expanding the idol shop, where you spend your idols in exhange for unique perks, so thats something to look forward to.\n\n\nFinal Judgement 8.5/10 BUT 10/10 For the clicker genreI would rate this game an 8.5/10. If you like clicker games, you will LOVE this one. The game introduces strategy, rng, and fun, into a genre that has been lack luster for quite a while. The game seems to get repetitive, but each event draws you in to get new crusaders and then explore what kind of strategy you can make next. The movie and book and popculture references this game makes are quite funny and interesting and adds so much in such a small feature. The only widespread problem the players have been having is connection issues, and this lowers the score a bit, it sometimes takes multiple attempts of launching the game in order for it to actually start the game, CrusadersOTLI requires internet connection to ensure players dont change the date in order to cheat the system. The game is still adding things quite frenquently and the in-game chatrooms help newer players and older players alike, discuss strategies and just talk about whatever they feel. This game is one of my favorites at the moment, trying to grind through each of the objectives to get all the achievements.\n\nYou should try this game out, its free, so why are you looking at reviews anyway? :)","January 26","true","586.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I am not going to bash this game though because unlike most clicker games they did try to add gameplay and tactics to the mix which I like. You also have HP rather than the usual timer hese games have.\nI honestly don't understand how they expect to make money because I couldn't find any microtranactions and the game is in Beta without being in 'early access'. Honestly, I have nothing bad to say about this game. It adds a lot to the clicker formula in a simple, easy to understand way while offering clear, easy to follow "quests" and synergy between the heroes you recruit. You can even arrange them into formation and they gain boosts and/or properties based on where you slot them. Its not the deepest system but for a clicker game I very much welcome it.\n\nIn the end, the game is not even finished and its the best clicker game I have played. I admit the bar was set low anyway but this game has all the things you know and love(?) with idle games. Reset the world? Check. Sound on/off? Music on/off? Low footprint(graphics)? Check, check and check.\nOne of the few games in Beta that could stop development right now, and still be head and shoulders above other games in its genre!\n\nIf you like idle games, I highly recommend this game and I hope, I HOPE, the devs go on to make other games after this project.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","October 13, 2015","true","2.2"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","59","24","41","11","6"

It also merges the reset feature and the idea of campains with different objectives to create a quest-like experience which is a welcome improvement over the standard "reset to increase the numbers even further" element.\n\nWhile it's graphically very unimpressive with the industry standard "cartoony" look and the audio is extremely limited, this type of game is generally muted and running in the background making numbers grow. CotLI does indeed seem to be doing that in a enjoyable manner. Recommended for fans of incremental games.","October 19, 2015","true","249.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Set in a fantasy world, your goal is to pass through levels, with your party which is moving by itself and with enemies coming to you. Complete the quest of the level to access the next one. Every five levels, you get a boss to kill, which gives a chest. The latter hides cards with permanent bonus, new gears, new clothes or buffs to use during a quest.\n\nThe money you're collecting will serve to upgrade your characters, to recruit new ones or to unlock new abilities. Some of them are specific to your character, others will affect those next or in front of you while special ones will be used during the levels. In other words, each character can be useful.... if only you weren't stuck to 10 characters maximum.\n\nThat's the core of this free-to-play. Only chests are for now a paying item if you want to advance faster.\n\nThe graphics are quite cheerful and colorful, the soundtrack is nice. I must say that you don't need an account somewhere to play it. However, you can play it elsewhere and link both accounts.\n\nI'm just disappointed that in-game achievements aren't counted here. Apparently, you need to reset the world (where you don't loose your acquired trinkets for example) so that Steam is considering that achievements can be unlocked. I don't know as I need to reach the requirements for it.\n\nAnyway, the game is surprisingly addictive and simple to handle. Cards are just bonus, you don't have to build a deck, which is a relief for me. Given the fact that it's free, without account to make, give it a shot. Be warned though, you may find it slow without chests. I could enjoy the potential of this game thanks to orly and its key giveaway.\n\nEDIT: I had to uninstall the game - apparently, it was causing a problem with launching games freshly updated or uploaded.","January 28","true","4.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

You can't use all your heroes at the same time, which means you have to choose which bonuses/skills are most important.  Plus, some heroes get bonuses based on where they are in relation to other heroes.\n- Lots of different campaigns to choose from, with varied goals, formations, and gimmicks.\n- Seasonal events are fun for the most part, and can be completed in time\n\nCons:\n- Starts and stays pretty grindy.  Doesn't have any of the insane explosions that you'll find in games like Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes, or Adventure Capitalist.  I've only managed to complete a small portion of the campaigns, and it doesn't seem like I'll complete many more soon.\n- Idols (analog to heavenly chips/hero souls/angel investors) don't do much except increase DPS/gold.  Almost nothing to spend them on so far.  Still seems early in its development in this regard.\n- "Free to play" but you'll need to spend money on the seasonal events to get the most out of them\n- Seasonal events can permanently unlock new heroes, but if you didn't start playing when the game came out you'll be stuck missing some heroes forever.  Makes strategy discussions/guides more challenging.\n- Takes an insane amount of RAM, and leaks memory like a sieve.  Typically needs to be reloaded about once a day or it slows to a crawl.  For what this game is, I have no clue how it can use 1.5GB+\n- No mobile version, probably due to the memory usage.","December 30, 2015","true","235.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The complexity (in comparison to other members of the genre) could be seen for example in the fact that you need to aim a little while you click, because the enemies move slowly towards your party and when they reach it, they start to deliver damage. And yes, you have a party here! There are lots of characters for hire, a special 10-member grid to place them with bonuses coming from their interconnections, there are also loads of boosts and weapons to equip, there are party abilities and char abilities, boosters you find in chests and gain through in-game achievements, 3 types of currency for different aquisitions.. and donations for the biggest fans! Studying all this eventually opens a hell's depth of strategical approach, and still you can quit it anytime like a normal clicker, and the party will fight for itself (dead chars get instantly resurrected at a level replay). So I guess if you can imagine yourself playing games like Clicker Heroes, Sakura Clicker or Adventure Capitalist you should by all means try this as well, might like it even more!\n\nЭто качественный продукт - существенно усложненная щелкалка, которая всячески старается предоставить игроку опыт какбы ролевой игры. Сложность (по сравнению с другими представителями жанра) видна хотя бы в том, что надо слегка целиться мышью, так как враги медленно движутся в сторону вашей команды, а когда достигают ее - причиняют урон. Кстати да, здесь у вас также есть команда! Есть множество героев, доступных для найма, специальная решетка на 10 мест для их расстановки с бонусами взаимодействия, а также масса улучшалок и оружия для их снаряжения, есть общие способности и способности отдельных героев, бонусы из найденных сундуков и в результате внутриигровых достижений, 3 вида валюты для разных приобретений... а также донат для фанатов! Изучение всего хозяйства постепенно открывает адовы глубины стратегического подхода, и все-таки игру можно бросить в любой момент как обычную щелкалку, а команда сама за себя постоит (мертвые воскресают при перезапуске уровня). Так что, если вам по нраву такие вещи как Герои щелкания, Щелкатель по сакуре, и Капиталист-приключенец, то надо попробовать и эту - может понравиться еще больше!","February 8","true","15.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","0"

Have to change formations often early on, and learn the different crusaders synergies\nOnce you 'complete' the game, you can choose game mode, eg. 4 evil bunnies are hot on your tail, so you can bring along only 6, instead of 10, crusaders to complete level 100.   There are over 20 game modes to reward gameplay.\nGood music.  My bf said too it's one of the better game music he's heard.  And no, he doesn't play games, but that's his loss.\nRandom chests and power buffs to use when your progress is slowed down.  It's tempting to use them, I know!! But sometimes it's better to save up for the critical times.  It is exciting to unleash multiple spells + buffs + chests to get over a speed hump.\nWell it has come to negatives now, hasn't it ....\nIt is on beta, the game is updated almost weekly, so there is a chance that you have to wait for an update.\nGame lag.  Yes, this is shocking.  My PC is 2010, and hasn't been updated.  And I experience a little lag when I use multiple spells, buffs, etc.  The second latest patch fixed a little of the lag, but it's still there.\nSince it's a clicker game, I had to wait and collect gold.  Sometimes I have to wait an hour or two.  That's fine as I close the game (it auto-earns gold) and I get house chores done.

It offers significantly better illusion of control than pretty much any other idle game I’m aware of without ever making you feel stressed, straining the brain cells too much, or introducing any kind of competitive element (there is no leaderboard, no clans and no pvp).\n\nOf course, it is an idle game and your results will therefore vary depending on your tolerance for such things – Call of Duty or Civilization this is not. You’ll either like this style of relaxed micro-progression or you won’t and if you don’t Crusaders isn’t going to change your mind.\n\nLike most other idle games, play consists of completing a run, resetting for boosts (idols), then running the game again to get a little bit further next time. This is a bit more interesting than many other idle games, however, as there are five different 'maps' to run each with half a dozen objectives of varying difficulty to complete (as well as short-term event-only maps at least monthly).\n\nYou start with a basic bench of 20 crusaders that you unlock as a run progresses. Depending on the objective between 9 and 13 of these crusaders can be added to your base formation in various ways to increase overall damage (dps), add other buffs (like heal or splash/aoe damage) or to generate more gold. More crusaders can be unlocked during frequent events.\n\nA fair bit of the thought in this game is about tinkering with your formation to squeeze an extra few percent out of things, one way or another. In practice, however, the boosts gained are pretty marginal as your damage is multiplied fourfold every 4-5 zones anyway. It’s an idle game, after all, don’t expect it to burst any brain cells.\n\nOne of the particularly nice things about the game is the built in chat server. 99% of the players are really chill and helpful – it’s a lovely community – and that certainly helps to pass the time while watching the ridiculous numbers spiral up into unpronounceable multiples of infinity. (You can, however, turn the chat window off if you find that kind of thing distracting.)\n\nThe devs are extremely active, with new events at least every month, new crusaders to mix up your formation, and the occasional addition of new objectives and achievements to aim for. They also pop into chat regularly to discuss the game and are enthusiastic and approachable.\n\nThere’s been plenty enough content added already to have maintained my interest for five months straight, with more additions regularly being added – none of these are particularly onerous or complex and all of which are well integrated into the game’s basic systems (unlike, say, the tacked-on additions of some other clicker games, such as Clicker Heroes).\n\nThe game’s free to play income model is pretty reasonable. There is the option to buy additional chests for a chance at gear to increase the stats on crusaders (these chests also drop normally during play).\n\nAdditionally, every event there is also a ‘free’ ‘golden epic’ awarded for buying two chests ($2.99), and these are typically a little overpowered in one way or another.\n\nRegular players generally see the occasional purchase as a nice way to throw a couple of bucks at the developers, although if you are a collect-the-lot type who is a little cash-strapped you might resent the implied pressure to buy so that you don't 'miss out'. The best any gear can do, however, is help you to get 3-4 zones further before hitting a wall and needing to reset.\n\nIt’s not a pay to win model in my view because, well, there’s no actual winning nor is there any direct player vs player interaction. The only ‘win’ to be had here is something to boast about in the in-game chat. But seriously, the developers have to make some cash to fund development and in the scheme of things this is pretty mild.\n\nFor an extra starting boost, use these codes in the in-game shop for free gear.\nNATE-932D-42BB-BOOM ../.. BB49-JHAE-3891-U546 ../.. B53S-432A-9LTT-003J\n\nAn additional code is mailed out for signing up to the developer’s newsletter at their website (with additional free codes emailed to subscribers on a fairly regular basis):\nhttp://www.codenameentertainment.com/?page=idle_email","February 26","true","144.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've played tons of hours so far on Kongregate, and will probably play many more here on steam.\n\nBecause of how this game is set up, how your heroes will gain gear and enchantment points randomly, there is never a single best formation. You will always be adjusting your formations to get the maximum gold, dps, or click dmg. While some heroes are definately more powerful than others, with a bit of luck, even the biggest underdog can be a main dps.\n\nIf you enjoyed games like Clicker Heroes, AdCap, and other idlers. You will probably enjoy this game a little bit more.","October 14, 2015","true","055.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Played a few clicker games before but this one has something about it that makes it more interesting and more worthwhile to come back to. I love the formation and objectives. It gives you a form of strategy and challenge. It feels rewarding with the chest system being able to receive gear for Crusader upgrades and more. Being able to switch to a clicking formation sometimes pushes you past the level you're stuck at. The events are great as well, keeps it exciting and fresh.

I got more stuck to this than I did clicker heroes or taptap infinity, despite the game (currently) lacking ways to spend the restart currency.\n\nDownside is, I guess, that the events can give out crusaders that vastly improve your formation (I rarely leave home without Robo-Santa now) and currently it doesn't seem like you can get them until, I guess, next christmas(or EventDate for other events)\n\nHate myself for getting stuck to an idle game AGAIN, but what can you do\n\nEnjoying this a lot, though some various memoryleak-ish issues (game crashing after being on for a while) and major  lagspikes even during times of low amounts of clicking (about 10/sec can get the game to slow down), if you like clicker/idle games, this is a good one at the moment.","January 13","true","787.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It\'s an incredibly simple concept, your crusaders are walking along, enemies show up, and they kill them, gold drops, you level up, ad nausium.  The game designers have managed to turn it into a surprisingly deep bit of strategy with combinations of gear, formations, abilities, missions, etc that all interact so that no experience of the game is the same until much later when you\'ve got most of the gear and the math begins to flatten out.\n\nThe time recorded in game is a bit deceptive, as I leave it running in the background.  Actual interaction time is FAR lower, that said it\'s an epic grind to get all the campaigns completed and will likely take you months or years of on-off play unless you shell out lots of $$$.\n\nIt won\'t win any awards for exciting action, but it\'s a fun little game to play at work in 1-2 minute spurts","June 1","true","458.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

TC has more sparkly shiny booms that may be better under certain influences, but this has chat and interaction, giving it a good reason to not hang out in the background for a large majority of the time.","April 14","true","364.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So it is more an Idle game than a clicker game.\n\nWhat makes this game special:\nYou have 20 different Heroes and 3 different Formations.\n\nSo you don't only have to find a good formation you also have to think about the best use of the Heroes you have at hand. This becomes more and more challenging with certain Objectives.\n\nThis game offers quite a lot for being an Idle game. To be honest this is the first Idle game i actually feel like playing a game. The next part which i did enjoy quite a lot is the Chat. This game offers a Chat for it's player which is really nice. You can talk about different Formations, ask for help if you are stuck. Defend your Favorite Damagedealer because, you gotta do what you gotta do, right? As a little bonus you encounter from time to time a Dev which is ready to answer all your ingame Questions :3\n\nThe Artwork seems Charming.

Progressing quickly from 0 to 100+ in 1h and resetting game is kinda most effective way to play this game and what you get is 20-30 idols per shot.\n\nBUT\n\nMe, as longterm kongplayer having few months playtime invested with 3k+ idols, plenty of gear and upgrades... you know it. Devs have our savefiles, but they don't allow us to migrate to steam, like other games have been allowing customers to do. Steam is better than flashy and laggy kong. I think they will lose large amount of old players, as losing all real time/cash invested in game goes to waste if changing here. My thumbs down goes for bad customer service, and won't recommend their games to anyone. My review might change, if migrating opinion change. But I wouldn't hold my breath.\n\nEDIT:\n\nLooks like devs have been listening for rioting community and changed their minds. Merging accounts should be available soon.

Once you "solve" the game's formations, it just stops being all that interesting, and you spend a ton of time distracted by the game running in the background.\n\nIt isn't that it isn't a clever application of the idea so much as that you're just likely to waste a ton of time on it and not get great returns on your time investment.","March 10","false","5.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leafdj/recommended/402840/","leafdj","leafdj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leafdj/","607 products in account","Wow, where do I begin? This game is an excellent next step in the idle game genre, but I really don't think you need to be a fan of idle games to enjoy it. Unlike most idle games I've tried, it really is a fun game first: the fact that you progress even while the game is closed just feels like a bonus feature.\n\nThe biggest differentiator from most idle games is the formation system, where in addition to pouring upgrades into heroes you also have to place them on the battlefield. Crusaders have skills that affect the heroes around them, making it a really fun puzzle game to try and maximize your damage in different ways. Unlocking new Crusaders, formations, and equipment open up a lot of really cool options for formations that keep the game fresh and interesting even after you've played it for a long time ( I'm glad Kongregate doesn't track time, and I'm a little worried now that the game is on Steam!).\n\nAnother crucial thing is the reset system in this game: in most idle games you can reset your progress for some bonuses, but then it just feels like you're playing the game over again but faster. In Crusaders when you reset you get bonuses as well, but you also have the option of taking on really crazy challenges for a run instead of just playing the normal game. Challenges that change the formation really bring out that puzzle game feeling, and you learn techniques and tricks from them that you can use in your normal games when you try to go for deep dives ( going as far as possible before resetting ).\n\nI know this review is pretty glowing, but every problem I've had with the game over the months I've been playing has been addressed by the devs, and there's no sign that the updates are slowing down. I've been really impressed with their open communication with the players, it's not something you get from every developer these days.","October 13, 2015","true","3.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheeseburgermafia/recommended/402840/","Cheeseburgermafia","Cheeseburgermafia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheeseburgermafia/","2074 products in account","Crusaders of the Lost Idols is an incremental clicker/idle game featuring a customizable adventuring party and a simplistic tower defense playstyle.\n\nClick to deal damage to enemies as they advance from the right toward your party on the left. Kill them and they drop some cash, which you'll automatically pick up if you don't do so manually. Spend that cash on upgrades to your click damage. Purchase automatic damage over time, and upgrade that. Unlock special skills and use them to defeat enemies faster, or earn more cash per kill, and invest that cash into more upgrades so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest...\n\nYep. It's one of these types of games. There's a prestige system that gives you Idols, which increase the damage your Champions deal, and increases the value of cash that you pick up.\n\nEach Crusader has gear that can be found within chests that randomly drop from boss waves. Crusaders have skills that can be purchased. Gear and skills can improve single or party dps, gold find, provide an activated skill, or have some interaction with other Crusaders. The position you place each Champion into changes the overall effectiveness of your party, and the best formation will depend on your gear.\n\nIt's an idle/clicker/incrementer with a twist. If you're embarassed for liking idle games, give this one a try.","December 10, 2015","true","914.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Because you know, that bar was so high.\nTL;DR - If clicker games are your thing, you'll enjoy this one.  It has most of what made Clicker Heroes so great, with a little more strategy.\n\nThis game has everything that has made similar games of the genre so successful: heroes, skills, levels, addictiveness, and the never-ending loop of getting stronger, beating quests, and trying to overcome that next boss.  But it takes it a step further with main quests.  Before you begin the game, and each subsequent time you perform a world reset, you will have to choose a main quest before you start.  A main quest is an overall goal set for you for that particular run, and it comes with a nice reward of the in-game currency that can also be bought with cash.  There are also a few worlds these quests take place in, so you won't always be seeing the same backgrounds and monsters as you progress, which helps freshen up the environments you will be seeing over and over.\n\nThis game is also more strategical in how it's played versus other clicker games.  In most clicker games, you can buy every hero and they all add DPS to your total.  In Crusaders, each world that you visit requires a unique formation that varies in shape and quantity/size.  For example, the initial formation you will use allows for 10 heroes.  From there, you will unlock other worlds, that require different formations.  This is where the strategy comes into play.  Sometimes you will have to swap out multiple characters to see what gives you the best DPS.  There are also quite a few heroes that offer nice DPS bonuses to heroes in the same row, in front of them, behind them, or all heroes.  You'll also get a few heroes that give you insane gold bonuses, but at the cost of low DPS.  You will soon be testing what works best between heavy hitters, and weaker units to bolster those powerhouses.\n\nThere is a Halloween event up as of me writing this, which has a formation allowing for 12 in a unique Halloween world. It's a limited time event so I've recently reset and chosen that world.  What the game failed to tell me was that in 1 of the slots, I have a Witch that screams, giving all adjacent heroes -2% or -4% DPS for each monster on the screen.  The reason I mention this is because this Witch is in the middle of my formation, causing me to be a bit more selective with who I put around her.\n\nThere aren't many negatives to the game.  The sound is nothing memorable, but not awful.  I was going to say the graphics are mediocre, but compared to games like Adventure Capitalist, whose only animation is bars, or even Clicker Heroes, whose only animation is the monsters when clicked, this game actually has animation.  So that's a plus.  All in all, it's a pretty good clicker with more depth than most.  My strategy, a.k.a. possible spoiler but something you will inevitably figure out as you play so not really a spoiler:\n\nIn the end, Nate Dragon will end up doing 99% of your DPS, so the best strategy is to keep people around him that give him % DPS bonuses.  Basically have everyone give Nate DPS buffs or give your party gold buffs.  Always use the sleuth at end-game and put him in the biggest column, and use the gold bear/lion, and ALWAYS use Natalie Dragon because of the buff she gives Nate.  Profit.\n\nSpeaking of profit, if you've come this far, enjoy a free legendary item that gives Nate Dragon a 200% base DPS increase:  NATE-932D-42BB-BOOM  (the code input screen is on the same screen you buy/open chests)","October 24, 2015","true","49.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Kill them and they drop some cash, which you'll automatically pick up if you don't do so manually. Spend that cash on upgrades to your click damage. Purchase automatic damage over time, and upgrade that. Unlock special skills and use them to defeat enemies faster, or earn more cash per kill, and invest that cash into more upgrades so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest...\n\nYep. It's one of these types of games. There's a prestige system that gives you Idols, which increase the damage your Champions deal, and increases the value of cash that you pick up.\n\nEach Crusader has gear that can be found within chests that randomly drop from boss waves. Crusaders have skills that can be purchased. Gear and skills can improve single or party dps, gold find, provide an activated skill, or have some interaction with other Crusaders. The position you place each Champion into changes the overall effectiveness of your party, and the best formation will depend on your gear.\n\nIt's an idle/clicker/incrementer with a twist. If you're embarassed for liking idle games, give this one a try.","December 10, 2015","true","914.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AngeloOlteteanu/recommended/402840/","AngeloOlteteanu","Angelo Olteteanu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AngeloOlteteanu/","280 products in account","I have just unistalled the game now after playing (although it was mostly idlying with my computer open) for over 150 hours over the course of a few months and several events. Do I recommend this game? The answer is no.\nAnd here is why:\nFirst of all, what is important for me in games is how they are able to bring me happiness and more importantly long term happiness because I remember the wonderful experiences I had with that game. This game however has none of that, now that I uninstalled it I feel relieved because i am free from it's pressure, it's urges that it created through this kind of gaming to just play forward for the short term, one small little feeling of 'progressing' a little bit more although there is no real progress here, no story, no real achievement. The only 'achievements' in this game are robotic tasks such as achivements for clicking a certain number of times or gathering x gold and so on and so forth there are dozenz of them and at the end there is nothing really from this. All the campaigns in the game including the event campaigns (although the developer does give plenty of those in the course of a few months) are rather small, especially after spending a bit of time with the game and they only offer about 100 mini-level maps with lazy objectives with no real challenge in terms of having players play the game. They are all just about boosting your Damage per second and letting the crusaders idle.\nThe areas are all recycled and if you get to area 101 in any campaign it's actually area one again and it goes on like this, you just get bigger numbers for the levels.\nBesides this, the game has microtransactions. Not any kind of microtransactions but microtransactions with random results. Every crusader in this game has only 3 items with 4 tiers each. This implies in reality that after you get an item you will mostly be getting lots and lots of duplicates while waiting for a random drop for the epic and paying real money for that random drop. I had my main DPS crusader get 55 duplicates. 55!!!! Imagine that. And I didn't even buy the magic jewelled chests with real money, My frustration with the game would have been even bigger had I spent 40 euros to get useless duplicates of the same thing. I know randomness has an appeal for some but for me it's a frustrating business model. This now links to my main issue with the game.\nTo get those 55 duplicates it took me a lot. I mean a real lot. More than resetting 60 times, and that's a lot of time actually wasted in real life. Time wasted to just grind through the same recycled levels lots of times. I wonder what that is doing to my brain really...In any case I am done with idle games. But back to the matter at hand. I put a lot of time in the game and although now I can get to a much further area than in the beginning I still don't really feel any satisfaction since it just goes on and on and on, the areas get recycled and new numbers are added. If you want to get far in this game you have to play it a lot, and reset a lot...and it takes a lot to get to the point of resetting. Especially in the beginning. Either that or you need to pay to get gold and damage boosters and items so I couldn't honestly recommend this game as a relaxing pleasant experience for other customers to relax in their daily lives. It's more of a very stressfull experience.\nMy next qualm is with the events. Although there were events like every month or every 2 or three weeks which each had a few objectives and some new but really not that usefull crusaders unless you decided to put real money on them, these events are really a big source of pressure. I mean, every one of these events sends out a mail to tell you the event has started. You go in but you can't really do much since on every event you need to accumulate a certain currency for that event which means you have to grind when that event is active. I grinded for a month before and didn't like it. Ok...New event is up, I have to grind again to get the currency which is only available that week. And then these events are always limited in time with achivements which are really grindy- one of them is actually to spend, that's right, spend 17.500 or something like that of that event currency. See what I mean, just earn it to spend id, big grind with no real purpose, no satisfaction. The game with its event and pressure I feel only hammers on the urge to get more achievements which in the long term gives no real gaming value.\nMy last claim with the game is that it automatically puts you in a game chat with other people who play. The game is not competitive so you don't need it, but still you are automatically put there and I was enjoying it for a bit when playing it at the beginning because other players shared their experience... But that went untill I asked something and some idiot decided to randomly insult me because that's the case of things especially when Steam links you into a sepparate account for this game only and you will meet lots of other people who play but don't have any real tools to interact with them and sanction them for this kind of behaviour since it's just pretty much a random chat. So that really made my experience unenjoyable, especially since it's a single player game and you have to ignore that chat. I later found out that you can disable it, but I don't know why it was on there in the first place because when the community is not solid and it's not because of these sepparate umoderated accounts, you get this behavior. That's a another reason why I like steam because I can choose who to interact with completely.\nTo sum up, if you are a new player who wants to try this game I would advise against it. It takes a very long time to get anywhere, the satisfaction is not really great and you might end up like me regretting the experience. If you put dozens of dollars on it and you only got duplicates and random trinkets to just get you past a few more levels you will definitely regret it. And generally I think the idle genre is just an empty marketing thing, with no real gaming value, so it will probably hook you up for a few months then make you regret you didn't play the Witcher or any other story-rich game during that time which will give you fond memories for decades to come. Speaking of that, I got more time on this than I have on each title of the Witcher...I might solve that :).","March 30","false","155.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But it's not a quick cheevo run as you get 1 cheevo per run. Negative time waster advise.\n\nTL;DR review:\n\nThis game is getting worse with each crusader update. New crusader replacements are getting introduced every 8 weeks now. There's hardly time to finish a single run. Although the idea of formations and using crusaders (heroes) and the interactions between is nice. The use of alternative crusaders is pretty much useless as you will not be able to upgrade them after the initial 10 day period of getting them. Any chests (either bought with rubies or received through boss kills) only drop upgrades for the regular crusaders anyway. So in the end it doesn't make much sense in building a strategy based on alternative crusaders.\n\nAlthough I initially like this idle/clicker game, I am seriously getting bored because I focussed too much on getting these alternative crusaders, some of them being extremely useless anyway.","March 30","false","465.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","3"

Over the course of playing this game I've spent quite a pretty penny. You can only get the best weapons through those limited time deals, which is why they would sucker me in.\n\nThere is a problem when the best content is locked behind a never ending pay wall. That is where I draw the line between a "good" free to play game and a bad one. This is a bad one with grabby money tactics. And for every new flavor of the event crusaders that are added, there a "special limited time only" chests to buy to get equipment just for them!! It honestly just feels so scammy. The prices are a LOT for what you are getting. You do NOT get a good value, at all, don't let their "sales" fool you.  Don't waste your money on this game.\n\nThey add only benched heroes, no actual new ones...so, in other words, you are perpetually swapping out your favorite crusaders for the new cash-grab flavor of the event crusaders (that are almost always better).\n\nThere are a few positives, such as a nice passive trait tree they've added. But, let me warn you, this game gets very repetitive when you do the exact. same. thing. over. and. over. and. over. You will hardly ever switch up your technique (until the new flavor of the event) because that one group is effective for anything you'd do.\n\nI am a lover of idle games...just not this one. Try Tap Titans instead. It is superior to this game tenfold. And they don't lock the best stuff behind a never ending treadmill of purchases.\n\nNote: if you have a lot of self control so you do not spend money, and you don't mind the best items being locked behind event pay walls that refresh every month or so, don't mind the pointless grind (because you aren't really working towards anything worth getting, even though they do have a passive way to spent idols...it just doesn't feel rewarding), and if you don't mind using the same crusaders (because they never add any new heroes, they only add heroes to existing benches... it's hard to explain if you don't play the game. You'll have to swap out your favorite heroes for the flavor of the event)...if you don't mind any of that, you will like this game.\n\nI, on the other hand, am tired of supporting these horrible free to play market developers who, when all is said and done, gets a lot more money from people by their sly tricks than AAA/Indie developers of REAL GAMES will get... and that is just sad. From now on, I pledge myself to only purchase from legit game developers...those that care about more than just money and releasing an endless treadmill of cash grabby crap.\n\nEdit: I wish that I could find a screenshot. I can't help but laugh hysterically... the new shop page has two special event chests promotions going on!!! A set of 3 chests costs 5$!! They used to be 2.99$!! And, get this, "Buy an event jeweled chest bundle today and get a FREE GOLDEN EPIC CARD that you won't find anywhere else!". And there are two unique ones because there are two unique event chests going on... holy scam.\n\nPlease, please, don't support these developers.\nStop giving them money. I beg you not to do it. Don't fall into the trap.\nWe, as people, have to tell devleopers that this is the wrong way of making money. Why are these online prices, something you will never see or feel in your hand, something that is temporary, something that is completely RNG (you most likely will get crap out of your 3 chests you buy for 5$ because they want you to buy a bunch of them... 42 chests for 50$ would still give you crap once you get going in your game and have a few hundred hours of time spent...)...something that is not guaranteed should NEVER BE THAT MUCH MONEY!!\n\nThis market isn't for the customers, despite it's "free" nature...those that actually pay and support the developers are being ripped off by ridiculously high prices for what the stuff is actually worth.\n\nMaybe I am alone in this...maybe not. Only time will tell how this market goes.","May 28","false","721.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Not only do you unlock new heroes, you place them in formation (10 on screen at a time) and certain ones will interact with others causing bonuses to damage and such.\n\nOn top of that, there are the expected items to gain that boost damage and gold gains.\n\nThe biggest difference I noticed, between this one and Clicker Heroes, is that this one scrolls from left to right, as if the characters are walking through the forest or environment.\n\nAdditionally, if the monsters get to your heroes, they actually damage and can kill them for that round, causing you to need to go back a level and earn more gold.\n\nThe interface is great, easy to pickup and understand, and the gameplay is just fun.\n\nThere's also XP gain, which means that after 5 hours of having a hero in formation, their DPS will double due to XP gained. It's a small but nice touch.\n\nThere's really a lot to like about this game, and it's done something very right with its entering the clicker scene. Not only has it got its own charm and style, it sets itself apart enough from the crowd that it has managed to truly bring something new to the scene.\n\nCertainly worth your download.","November 2, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","0"

I will start by saying this, the game mechanic is fun and the game itself is enjoyable.  The team formatting is unique and diverse.\n\nThat being said.\n\nThis game represents all of the unbridled greed that game developers seem to find themselves filled with these days.  In terms of raw micro-transaction COST, this game is the most expensive game on the market.\n\nIn addition, this game has been out for quite some time on Kongregate.com prior to being released on Steam.  As a game developer I find Kongregate to be a great community and I've enjoyed seeing other titles such as AdVenture Capitalist, Time Clickers, and Clicker Heroes make amazing transitions over to the Steam community.\n\nThe same can NOT be said for this game.\nWhy?\n\nAll the aforementioned titles all had one thing in common.  If you spent money on in-game micro-transactions on Kongregate ALL of those bonuses carried over to the Steam platform.  Players were given the ability to "Export" their save game code and then "Import" it once on Steam.\n\nEven for idle/clicker games that are only on Kongregate this is common practice.  At this point it has become an expected "best practices" within the industry.\n\nCrusaders of the Lost Idols does NOT do this.\n\nKongregate users have been calling for ages for the ability to import/export save codes.  Even more-so once it was announced that this title would be being released on Steam.  Users repeatedly reached out to the developers attempting to make contact with them.  The devs were silent for over 4 months.\n\nFinally, one day, the devs decided to finally appease the masses and actually engage themselves with their community.  That's when we all discovered the awful truth.  The devs were simply trying to rob their players.\n\nThe developers announced they were making the CONCIOUS choice to refuse data transfers to players in their community who spent real money on in-game bonuses.  Spent $50 on chests when the game was first released on Kongregate-only, well you don't get to keep those bonuses.  Better spend another $50 if you want all your perks again!  Eh?\n\nWhile I have not EVER spent money on this game, and have thus not lost out due to this, I find this to be one of the most unethical decisions I have seen a non-EA/Blizzard game developer make.  It undermines the entire indie community.\n\nDespite the fun gameplay, due to the underhandedness of the developers, I would advise everyone to avoid this game and not support it.  Heck, since it's free to play install it then downvote it with a review.  Players, and consumers in general, need to take a stand against greedy developers like Code Name.\n","October 16, 2015","false","16.0"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","10","25","0","1"

The progress is very slow mostly because of important upgrade prices and minibosses (each 5 levels) requiring grind.\n\nWaiting is long - as an example, being AFK for a day or two won't take you further than 5-10 levels. This kind of shows in the achievement ratios: 16% of players have achieved a "reset", 8% have completed area 100 and rest of the achievements are done by very few.\n\nI wouldn't recommend right now.","October 22, 2015","false","1.9"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

And I did enjoy the game to an extent. But, unless you want to engage in a mind-numbing, one-arm bandit style gaming experience, steer clear. It's addictive and time-wasting. You get to the end only to find there is no end and that the best option is to save up gold for what would be a week for me at this point to have your highest character reset the world and do the entire thing over. Most of the time you don't need to do anything to survive a level. Clicking is a waste of time until you reach really high levels. Configure your team, make sure they are the best, hover over the game as it advances unlocking new chars and attempt to configure them to maximum advantage, then wait for the same series of things, over and over, ad nauseum. Or walk away for a week, come back and do the same things for two hours, realize you aren't getting any of this time back for better things, walk away for a week, come back, do the same thing over with the money you've saved, etc., etc. Meh. I've lost 23.4 hours to this game. Almost an entire day of my life. If you're the kind who sits at a slot machine and just sits and sits, doing the same thing over and over, hoping for the big finish, you might love the stuffings out of this game.

In my opinion it was trying way too hard at making jokes/internet references.. Anyway;\n\nIt's an okay concept, obviously some ideas came from clicker heroes. I understand that the game's in beta, and  there's a few glitches like emo wolf's "%100 more dps if not next to a human" not working, but what really confuses me is that there's no resolution option. When it goes to full screen it doesn't take up your entire monitor making the quality look like utter sh*t.\n\nI think the most annoying part of this game was the tutorial wizard (literal tutorial wizard), it really shouldn't take 5 minutes for it to go away and let you explore the game yourself, instead of it staying on your screen just make it pop up whenever you find something new (which it does, but consider cutting out most of the beginning tutorial..).\n\nTry it if you want to waste a few minutes and see if you like it. I can see some reasons why you'd want to play a game like this but I just find it really annoying, for some reason.","October 15, 2015","false","1.3"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

When I'm looking for a clicker game, I want a game that will allow me to endlessly (other than at the limit of my patience and diligence) build upon my stats.  There's too much strategy involved in Crusaders of the Lost Idols.  You can only have up to 10 characters in your party at a time which requires you to pick and choose your team based on their abilities and stats and how they interact with each other.  It's too much RPG, not enough clicker genre in my opinion.\n\nIf you like complicated clickers though, I'm sure it's a lot of fun.","December 22, 2015","false","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
