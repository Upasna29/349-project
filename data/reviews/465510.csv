It just feels incomplete and like one of those crap games you bought on the Xbox Live Indie section for $1. Stay away from this unless there is a 90%+ mark off\n\nThe main cons of this game:\n1. "Reputation" is mainly earned through a single minigame (a 4x4 block puzzle, where you get a different picture every 5 stages). These pictures are usually just pictures of women in underwear/lingerie. This game gets old VERY quickly and the only other method is by working (which is only allowed on Tuesday) that consists of taking random guesses at the answers to questions that you recieve. You also earn rep by gifting items to girls (but this is difficult, which is explained in point 3) Every time you sleep to advance time, it eats away at the reputation you have gained. So you end up sitting there doing nothing for quite a long period of time since you don't want to lose your "rep"\n\n2. There is straight up nothing to do in this game besides go to every area that is currently unlocked and click on "sparkles" that give you $5 at a time.\n\n3. There is no sensible way to make money. You start the game with a whopping $20 from your mom. Like in every dating sim, you need money to buy gifts. The only way to get that money is by going to the casino (which has TERRIBLE luck). Or working your 1 day a week job. Or by going to different areas and clicking on the sparkles that give $5 more at a time. While gifts range from $20 at the cheapest to $200 for the expensive. So, you end up spending most of the time going the casino and losing your money and running back home to mom to beg for $10. If you somehow manage to obtain $100, you can put it in the bank to earn a small interest.\n\n4. The girls that you are supposed to date and go after have next to no personality. Seriously, they just repeat standard lines such as "I like reading about archeology" and the sort. No voice acting. No real dialog. The girls are just cookie cutter stereotypical "smart librarian" and "stuck up rich girl." You do not get to pick which response you give them. You literally stand in silence and give them gifts and clicking on talk gives you lines such "Maybe i will go read about greek history later" No background to any of them.\n\n5. There is no tutorial and you are just thrown into some guy's life and you are expected to know from day one what his daily routines are. No real backstory, you are just thrown in and have to discover along the way. The only real help is an instructions page on the main menu.\n\n6. There is no settings menu, you are forced to be in full screen and can't change the resolution.\n\nI have honestly seen better flash game dating sims on Newgrounds. This still needs A LOT more work to ask for any type of price tag on this.","May 9","false","1.3"," 96 of 103 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","96","103","5","0"

(Meaning you have to do certain things to unlock new places.)\n\nCons :\n- Like someone said, the girls have no personality, they repeat the same thing after 3 - 4 lines.\n- The game is short. Really short.\n- The way to earn money can be annoying at the beginning. It's really slow and since you can only work one day out of 7, it's kinda limited.\n- Same goes for the Reputation, which you earn by gifting, good answers at your work or the annoying "Goddess Board" mini-game (I hate those puzzles).\n- No Options nor Settings? Please.\n\nSo, I'm sorry, but no. I don't recommend this game except if it's really low-priced.","May 9","false","4.1"," 71 of 78 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","71","78","0","5"

I was definitely disappointed. The main difference is that HuniePop was match3 and had fun mini-games. Sinful Eden's are just tedious and boring.\n\nPositive:+ Steam trading cards\n+ Good graphics and art\n+ Multiple Endings\n\nNegatives:- Price for what you are getting, worth $1.49, very short game\n- No settings menu, game is very loud, can't turn down sound, also no way to play in windowed mode or change resolution\n- No achievements (developers response in the forums, " I didn't have the resources to also include achievements before launch, sorry dude..."\n- Minigames are very tedious\n- No way to pause time\n- Girls are very dull with no personality\n\nBad Game: 3/10\n\nIf you are expecting anything close to HuniePop, you will be disappointed. Not worth the price, and not even worth the sale unless its $1.49 or less and you are a huge fan of the genre. Probably should have been a mobile port.\n\nWHO DESIGNS A GAME WITHOUT A SETTINGS MENU?

Most of it is just gambling at the casino (luck is best, don't hit the skill button or you'll get more awkward reloads) and shoving most of your money in the bank.  No real strategy, no consequences of giving the wrong gift to a girl... about the only saving grace to this game imo is the goddess board game.  I'm a sucker for a sliding puzzle, and will probably just replay the game for the sliding puzzle minigame tbh.  Would have been better if you could get money easier instead of casino every day and a 1-day per week job.  Maybe more minigames.","May 10","false","5.5"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

The main objective for this game is to find a girl who you will marry, since your previous girlfriend dumped you so marrying her is out of the question. So instead of proposing to her you decide to hook up with other girls in town, gaining their affection towards you then you will be able to choose one that you will marry.\n\nThe gameplay seems to suffer a lot throughout the game, there is no helping hand or tutorial as to where to go or what to do as you (slowly) progress through the game. Your two main priorities are money and reputation. You can gain reputation in a number of ways. Some of which include going to the cosino and winning in the two games that they offer there. Another way is to do your job, but your job is kinda weird and difficult to undertake.\n\nIt seems that in the game you have a part-time job that only last a single day, which so happens to be a tuesday. You are required to pick up a phone and answer random questions that the customer will ask. Now some of these are seriously just like wtf how am I suppose to know that. I guess the plus side would be that the game offers multiple choice answers, but still some of the questions you get asked are either so obscure that you wouldn't know or  just blantenly obvious. If you answer these questions correctly you gain some money and rep, however answering them incorrectly will minus rep.\n\nNow you might be asking why rep is so important in this game. Well in order to give a girl a gift you are required to have a certain amount of rep before it allows you to do that. In otder to talk to the girls you need rep, pretty much everything that you want to do to the girl will cost a certain amount of rep. I guess the rep system is alright, because it makes you work to be able to talk and gift each girl.\n\nI feel like the game really pulls itself together with the graphics of the game. Obviously this is a adult dating simulator, and I feel like the graphics of each of the girls and areas you encounter have been carefully thought out and well presented throughout the game. I mean if you are into these types of adult dating simulator then by all means this game might just be for you.\n\nPros+ Really good graphics\n+ A alright rep system\n+ Really good game if you are into adult dating simulators\n+ Not a bad asking price\n+ Steam Trading Cards\n\nCons- Needs a tutorial\n- Gameplay seems to suffer\n- part-time job feels out of place\n- Slow progression\n\nResult / Final ThoughtsI feel like this game would be enjoyable for those people who really, really enjoy playing dating simulators and would appriviate the work and effeort that has gone into this game. The game does lack a tutorial and slow progression of the game, but makes up for it with the graphics overall. For this reason I would ONLY recommened this game to thos of you who are really, really into adult dating simulators.\n\nRating: 5.2/10\n\nThis key was provided to me by Yolo Army","May 22","true","3.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amaimagi/recommended/465510/","amaimagi","amaimagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amaimagi/","309 products in account","Product received for free\n\nSinful Eden follows the standard dating simulator format, in which the main character is given a limited amount of time to raise enough affection points with a specific girl to avoid a game over. Among all the other sims out there, I have to say that this game is rather challenging, but not impossible to finish. As mentioned, however, due to the fact that the game is following the standard formula, it seems to be deliberately struggled to shine on its own. To those who doesn't enjoy playing this genre will probably not enjoy their time while playing Sinful Eden. From calling different girls to know what their interests are, to writing down their birthdays and phone numbers, it was quite a ride.\n\nI've played a fair share of visual novels and dating sims via both Steam and Newgrounds, I have to say that this game is quite entertaining. There are at least one hot spots in each location and plenty secrets to find, many of which would give you $10 to spend, a gift to seduce a particular girl or a crumbled note for you to open lockers with. Little things such at these really shows that the developer(s) cares about his game and is willing to plant in a little more for players to discover.\n\nThe mini games that most have found themselves struggling with are indeed quite challenging. In order to unlock the secret girl, as I've read via the discussion boards, one would need to complete all 4 mini games (20 games in total). Whether or not the secret girl is worth all the head scratching though, to each their own. I wasn't able to pursue her, because frankly, I'm not good at the Goddess Board mini game. But in the end, I'm quite happy ending up with Esther, she's pretty cute, reminds me of Hatsune Miku.\n\nIt would be great if the game offered more opportunities to develop feelings with the girls, like going on dates with them, and adding a more in depth back story for each one of them, to make them see more realistic and not just a hook up.","May 23","true","4.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Its for those who dare to finish the game alternately. so even when you finish this review you will not be able to guess the real ending, your ending in the game.So read on at your peril.\n\nfirst things first, this is a dating sim, adult in theme. Where you play as the protagonist in a female dominated World. In the game your main objective is to find a bride who will marry you. Failing this means game over.You start off with your girl friend breaking up with you at your nineteenth birth day. So that you are left with no options but to find another potential wife.\n\nNext you find out that there are four potential girls who you should pursue. You must befriend them within the given time frame of the game, and pick your potential wife.Now to  woe the girl you like you must buy her presents, This is the fun part for to  give her gifts you must do odd part time job and to make her accept it you must put your reputation up . You do that by performing the job every tuesday at a call centre. But apart from that you must also talk to the girl and know more about her.\n\nThe game has multiple endings, for not only might  you end up with one of the chosen girls or failing which die , but you can also end up in jail. Here it must be mentioned that to save the game you must get to your room and use your diary. Which also adds to the realism of the game. Overall the game is nice,  for a dating sim if youre an anime graphic novel fane you must get it.\n\nThere are a number of pros and cons to this game, to list a few.\n\nPROS\n\n+Youre always in a race against time\n+Multiple endings to the same story\n+Good music\n+Doesnt take a toll on your pockets (But still advisable to wait for a sale)\n+Even though you must work at the call centre by profession, for reputation and money.
