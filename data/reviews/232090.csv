"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehknight/recommended/232090/","tehknight","OG Red Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehknight/","25 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs a fan of the original Killing Floor mod and stand alone game-this feels like a pure upgrade.\nLet me just put the pros and cons up for people who might wanna buy it.\nLets kick it off with PROS:\n-Some of the best feeling guns ive used in a while.The sound is perfect, the looks are just sexy and the pure carnage they spit out is amazing.\n-Enviorment is as good as it gets. Nothing better than walking into a dark room and wondering if youre going to get murdered or not.\n-Ranking up actually matters now. You can recieve perks which make you a killing machine.\n- The visual overhaul of all the enemies brings a breath of fresh air to every single enemy we face.\n- The zeds actually evolve as the difficulty goes up. They become a pleasure to watch as they move...from the moment they spawn, right to the moment when you blow their limbs off.\n- The G.O.R.E. system. A.K.A. the "blow every piece of the zeds body off" system. A true masterpiece.\n- General update to KF1.\n- I am sure ive missed a ♥♥♥♥-ton of things but you get my flow.\nAnd now sadly-CONS:\n- Class balance isn't that great at the moment. A support character can easily mow down tons of enemies with the AA12, while most other classes don't have that ability...YET.\n- Sprinting could be faster than it currently is. It gets the job done, but if i was running from something with a chainsaw for an arm...I'd be running faster. And probably s*****g my pants a little as well.\n- I am out of cons. ♥♥♥♥.\nFriendly reminders:\n-The game is still in EARLY ACCESS, so a very little part of its content is live at the moment.\n- Its better to have 20 weapons that funcion well and aren't glitching out, than 100 weapons that are literally as broken as they get. Same goes for maps.\n- Don't whine about the slow updates. None of the people who whine know how tough programming is.\nDefinately recomment buying the game.","August 20, 2015","true","98.8"," 1,002 of 1,130 people (89%) found this review helpful 115 people found this review funny","89","002","1","115","27"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/illuminatty/recommended/232090/","illuminatty","Natty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/illuminatty/","256 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReturn of the Patriarch + Microtransaction thoughts below the review!\nIt's been a long time coming, and was it worth the wait?\n\nOh yes, it was.\nI loved the first Killing Floor, so I was very excited to see a second one. While I normally do not buy into these early access titles, how could I say no to Tripwire?\n\nSo, let's get started.\n\nThe Gameplay\nAt the writing of this review, there is currently 4 classes with about 4 weapons for each, as well as a few off-perk weapons like the Katana or the Flamethrower. You can use ANY weapon at any time, just like the first. The weapon you use will give you points for that class, so say you have a medic pistol with a commando rifle? You will be able to rack up points for medic using the healing function whilst using the rifle to earn yourself the commando points. ZED time is still prominant, and it is so, so satisfying. The visuals will run into a sin-city like look, with only red standing out amongst the black, gray and white filtered backgrounds and characters. Most weapons have a reasonably large amount of kick, but this further emphasizes the need to have trigger discipline.\n\nWhat makes it different from the first?\nAt the moment, you can see the obvious. The graphics upgrade, the animations, and of course the enviroment designs. However, in this game there are tons of small things that all compile into what sets this game apart. You can shoot out lights, blood is persistent, and there are TONS of different animations, both for players and zeds. Enemies flinch when shot, and it varies heavily on what weapon you are using. Shooting a clot in a shoulder with a pistol will only make him flinch a tiny bit, but upping the ante and shooting him in the chest with a rifle will cause him to violently flail backwards and nearly lose his balance. You can shoot off several parts of their body, head wounds will start small and slowly wear their flesh away until there is only a meaty remnant that looks nothing like what it once did until that satisfying head pop. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING feels much more alive and less clunky than the first, from the reload animations to the death animations.\n\nShould you buy into it?\nAt it's current state, it's hard to say. You will get 4 perks and limited weaponry, with only 3 maps to spare. As it stand, there is much more content in the first game. However, if you buy into the early access, you are not only supporting Tripwire, but you give yourself a chance to watch this game bloom. You get to experience a game that has lots of love in it, and you can see that Tripwire cares about this game. Yes, it has bugs. Yes, there are glitches. No, there is no buyers remorse from me. If you expect a full game, you may want to lower your expectations, but this is certainly not a bad way to start off a early access game.\n\nThe Characters\nWow. You have about 10 characters at the moment, including a female one. These characters are all unique, and have their own voices. They will talk a LOT, and this is not a bad thing. They will call out ammo, kevlar, and weapons. They will talk to each other with idle banter whilst you're shopping at the trader, and they will also pitch a few jokes. There are a few stereotypes, but it adds to the quirky and goofy traits they all have, and they even have things you can add to them, like gas masks or face masks. You can also change their clothing colour, hair colour and a few other neat features absent in the first game.\n\nThe Zeds\nThere are 3 different clots, and so far I don't see much of a difference between them. However, they behave much like the same game, spare their animations. They will oftentimes hold you just as that gorefast is charging, or the fleshpound is roid raging. The gorefasts move fast, and are tall hulks that you do NOT want to get close to. The siren is short and blends into groups, often hiding behind clots or bigger enemies. The stalkers are nearly invisible, and are disturbingly quiet. The skrakes and fleshpounds make roars when they enter, that strikes that scene of "oh no" into you. And the final boss is HARD. This game makes the zeds feel more alive than ever, and I love every second of it.\n\nMy final thoughts\nAll in all, this game is a newborn. It shows promise, and it has loving parents, as Tripwire has shown itself to be. I can see this game becoming just as, if not more, of a classic game as the first one. The game feels much smoother, much faster paced, and it has a few moments in it that will make you jump and scream when that clot turns you around and holds onto you as a fleshpound is nearing you. I would highly reccomend this, even to those who like to wait to see if early access games grow at all. Time will tell, but I firmly believe in Tripwire.\n\n8/10, at it's current state, with the only thing bringing it down is the lack of weaponry and classes, however both of which have been promised to have their numbers bolstered, so this review will be updated as the game grows.\n\nReturn of the Patriarch\nWell, this has been interesting. A new class, an in-game store, skins and crates all kind of thrown all in. Maybe I haven't been playing this game enough, but I'm going to change that. So, with that said, let's move on.\n\nThe Patriarch\nI'll just say right off the bat that this guy isn't as tough as I thought he would be. His attack range isn't as amazing on easier difficulties and will generally tend to focus on the group rather than a single person, making his kill potential relatively lower than Hans. He still uses his signature stimpacks to survive after a certain amount of damage is taken, and still only has three. It seems with each one he takes, the health he gains is less than before, which doesn't make him insanely strong. However, he cloaks a lot more often than the Patriarch from the first game, but is also extremely loud when he moves, making it relatively easy to pinpoint a location as a non-commando player. Furthermore, just because he is easier, does not mean he is not fun to play against. I have had countless laughs against the Patriatch with friends from his sometimes erratic behavior and his obsession with getting right in your face before unlcoaking. I believe he could do with some buffing, though, to bring him a bit more onto terms with Hans.\n\nGunslinger\nA pistol enthusiasts dream, what more could you want? The Gunslinger has a wide array of weapons, though this is mostly because every weapon he can buy has a dial wield function. Two deagles, revolvers, or 1911's? Oh, the choices. He is a relatively mobile class that enjoys the benefits of being able to harvest weak zeds very easily, and using the stacks he earns from farming these smaller zeds to tackle the bigger ones with tons of damage. Plus he has style in his reloads, so go give him a try already.\n\nThe Microtransactions\nOh boy. Anyone else remember Payday 2? Neither do I.\n\nIn the wake of Payday 2's rather controversial move to introduce microtransactions into the game, Tripwire has done the same, and this community outcry has been quite large. However, let us remember that the first game also had similar marketing, just in the form of DLC packs for skins. Skins, people, skins that don't give any stat boosts or mobility, just make your character stand out a bit more. While I do agree that releasing these micros in the aftermath of the Payday incident, I do not believe that we should be reacting as harshly as we are. Let us remember that Tripwire has yet to release any weapons OR characters that we have had to pay for, and that they have done this practice in the past with the first Killing Floor.\n\ntldr; Do I think they should have released them when they did? No. Should they even be in the game? Sure. Do I forsee this getting out of hand? No.","April 21, 2015","true","62.3"," 549 of 602 people (91%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","91","549","602","36","25"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThorcraftGames/recommended/232090/","ThorcraftGames","Alnatair","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThorcraftGames/","132 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAre you good sir, a fan of Dosh perchance? If so, this is the game for you!\n\nSequel to the original Killing Floor, Killing Floor 2 follows in its footsteps and shows how much work and effort Tripwire puts into their games: Now including microtransactions, PVP (players vs other players as Zeds), and crafting.\n\nWARNING: INFO HEAVY REVIEW, NO TL;DR - RUN IN FEAR!\n\nThe original Killing Floor 1:A 6-man co-op wave-based defense game with 7 classes called "Perks". Zeds would come at you in waves, increasing both in difficulty and in numbers as the game progressed. Killing Zeds awarded Money, allowing you to buy weapons between rounds from an entity known as The Trader. A boss known as The Patriarch would appear on the final wave. Wielding a Minigun, a Rocket Launcher and some devastating Claws as well as a few Healing Syringes; He was your final challenge, and he was damn fun to fight.\n\nKilling Floor 2:Improving on the original, I find the gameplay of Killing Floor 2 to be a lot more fun and refreshing then the first game.\n\nIn in its current Early Access Stage, Killing Floor 2 features a single boss, three maps, 4 perks and 19 weapons (excluding Knives and Grenades, which are unique for each class).\n\nThe most notable changes:1. The Graphics:\nThis is the most obvious change between Killing Floor 1 and 2, the Graphics and Animations are beautiful in the second game. You can really appreciate the amount of Time, Effort, Skill and Money put into creating this game's graphics.\n\n2. The Gore\nYou've seen videos of Killing Floor 2 probably where they talk about it being the most advanced gore system currently in ANY game, whether Indie or an AAA title. I can easily say that Killing Floor 2, has hands down the best gore system I've ever seen. Once you've entered Zed time (the randomly triggered slow motion event in-game), and chopped a Zed up into 13 pieces, cleaving him down the center, cutting in half the legs, arms and head, then proceeding to cut those pieces in half; You'll know how awesome it really is.\n\n3. Weapon Hotkeys\nThis is the third major thing I noticed. In the old game, weapons were scattered across the 1 through 5 keys. Some assault rifles being the 3 key, while some being 4. It has now been categorized into four sections: 1 Primary (Assault Rifle/Shotgun) - 2 Secondary (Pistol) - 3 Melee (Knife/Katana) - 4 Equipment (Welder/Healing Syringe\n\n4. The Perks\nThe Perks in KF2 carry over the core values of perks from KF1 but have Abilities which you can assign every 5 levels. In KF1, everything you got from perks was a passive trait; like spawning with a weapon, or getting more ammo for assault rifles. In KF2, you can select an ability every 5 levels (25 levels max) which will grant you some neat bonuses.\n\nThese bonuses are more or less giving you the same thing from Killing Floor 1's perks, but you get to select less bonuses.\n\nI like the way the new perk system is, but they need to add some more abilities.\n\n5. The Characters\nYou'll notice a huge difference between the characters of KF1 and KF2. The design of these characters (the ones that were in KF1 and are in KF2) remains very similar. For example, Mr. Foster still has his unique gas mask; but now instead of a suit, he wears a leather jacket.\n\nThe biggest difference between KF1 and KF2 characters is that each character in KF2 has a different voice-over, multiple "skins", accessories (glasses, gas masks) and overall have a lot of production time put into them compared to KF1's characters. The characters will actually talk to each other, A LOT. You'll constantly hear "How's everyone on ammo?" or "I like how this is going, but this is just the eye of the storm folks!".\n\nOf course, player-based character lines are still in place. On all characters, if you toss Dosh out; you'll hear a unique line to that character. Rob Briar and Mr. Foster both retain quotes from the original Killing Floor. They'll both say "Money money money" similar to the first game, but not in a "sing-songey" tone. These quotes are played randomly among other quotes when throwing Dosh.\n\nAs of the content update, they've brought back "Classic" Masterson and Briar, which are older looking versions of the characters from this game; but have the voices of the characters from the first game! I'm very happy about this!\n\n\nThe first game is amazing, Killing Floor 2 (to me) is perfect. While it's true that it lacks content, this is only because Tripwire did us an amazing favor by letting us play it in Early Access. It has a few bugs, of course; but what game doesn't?\n\nKilling Floor 2 is extremely polished, with the looks of a AAA game and the price tag of an Indie game. Tripwire is its own developer and publisher, so the profits go straight to them instead of a greedy publisher; meaning the price can be lower without lowering quality.\n\nKilling Floor 2 runs off of a heavily modified UE3, with tons of optimization capabilities. You can make it look insanely good, or perform wonderfully with the game's config.\n\nExample of how much optimizing can be done .\n\nIf you're a fan of gore, this game is for you; It's a fast paced action game with 22 ways to cut a Zed up with a Katana. It has really good physics that launch said cut-up body parts flying when you toss a grenade into the body pile. The lighting is amazing and overall the game is too.\n\nThe gameplay compared to the original Killing Floor:\nKilling Floor 2 has a huge difficulty difference compared to the first game. Zeds are unique, their AI are much better and as you up the difficulty; much smarter. I played Hell on Earth in KF1 and all the Zeds charged at me from the same spot. I play Hell on Earth in KF2 and Stalkers/Crawlers will ambush me while other Zeds form patterns to surround and corner you.\n\nYou always have to keep moving in KF2, there isn't "The perfect spot" to defend at in the current set of maps. I imagine this will change with community maps, but hey; Good maps will be separated from Bad ones very quickly.\n\nI really enjoy this game, enough so that I bought 6 copies for good friends who couldn't afford it. I want to support Tripwire and help make this game flourish as it should. If I were capable of rating higher then 10 out of 10, I'd rate this as high as it could go.\n\nSummary\nTRIPWIRE, TAKE ALL OF MY DOSH!\n\nThis game is amazing, simply put. I see no reason to not buy it if you're a fan of zombie survivals/co-op games. Even if you're not, it's quite a fun game series to get into.\n\nBuy this game, you won't regret it.\n\nAs this review is based on Early Access, I will update it as the game is updated. There are a few bugs, most are graphical and not game-breaking. I really enjoy the game and it's definitely a good sequel that's worth buying.\n\nDeluxe Edition, is it worth it?\nThe artbook is a really interesting read, I really enjoyed it and it alone to me was worth the $10.\nDJ Scully looks the best out of the current set of characters (I believe).\n\nScullyphones” headphones for DJ Scully, Mr Foster, Hayato Tanaka and Donovan Neal\n3D Glasses for Ana Larive and Hayato Tanaka\nBowler Hat for Mr. Foster and Reverend Alberts\n\nKilling Floor 2 OST Album (Vocals, not Instrumental). Most albums on iTunes are worth $7-10, this was an awesome thing to add.\n\nCopy of the original Killing Floor 1 game, which is currently priced at $20 (which I gave to a friend, he is now in love with the game and I'll be getting him KF2).\n\nThe Deluxe Edition is definitely worth the money, I bought the game and then the Deluxe Edition. If you're not interested in the extra Character, Cosmetics and the Artbook/OST, then buying this will not effect your KF2 gameplay at all.\n\nThank you all for reading, please upvote this so others can see!","April 26, 2015","true","164.3"," 297 of 321 people (93%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","93","297","321","20","3"

I didn't ask for them either and priorities have been misguided, but I could see the good intentions they had with them.\n\nHowever, recently Tripwire has begun to crackdown on some fans concerned with the direction of development, banning even the most civil of community members. These are respectable people, who have been voicing their opinions for some time, but now their threads have been locked, moved, and strictly monitored. So now I'm speaking up, this censorship is unacceptable and has severely hurt their image. I've enjoyed my time playing, but I cannot in good faith recommend this game.\n\nHere is a link to a disscussion, showing evidence of censorship. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TWINOMICROTRANSACTIONS/discussions/0/371918937258389095/","May 4","false","283.4"," 634 of 734 people (86%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","86","634","734","17","39"

Currently (Early Access), you get 4 perks (classes) to choose from and level up - each with their own playstyle, pros and cons. Despite clearly being at it's best and based around co-op gameplay, you can also play solo - perfectly viable too as it gets 'rebalanced' for it.\n\n\nNow for the veterans of KF1 such as myself, we start with an important question. Is it an improvement? Yes!! Yes it is. Remember how going up in difficulty was nothing but numbers? The Zed's HP, speed and damage would increase while the player's money gain and item pickups would decrease? Welp, those days are over (for the most part ;D ).\nIn KF2, the difficulty increase respects the weapons and players - no longer turning Zeds into bullet sponges as they keep the exact same HP as in any lower difficulty. Now the real threat is how they become more aggressive and behave differently (i.e. - jumping and dodging) which makes it even harder than the previous game.\n\nAnother great aspect is that using weapons from other perks is now -very- viable due to the new difficulty system and the perk level bonuses not being too focused on their own weapon category.\n\nLeveling is now XP based instead of meeting specific criteria, so no more AFK welding for the Support Specialists! And the levels now go up to 25, making it feel a bit less grindy since you level up more often.\nEach 5 levels you also gain a skill point to spend in one of two choices for that tier (i.e. - Commando gets to choose between higher damage or faster reload).\n\nAll in all, this game is a must buy for the new players and veterans alike despite still being in Early Access!","May 5, 2015","true","127.7"," 261 of 286 people (91%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","91","261","286","20","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilverNicktail/recommended/232090/","SilverNicktail","Silvershock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilverNicktail/","1253 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n**Review is from the closed beta, will update on later versions*\n\nKilling Floor 2, like its predecessor, is my kind of multiplayer game. It's a class-based co-operative shooter where you're pitched against wave after wave of increasingly powerful zeds, and if you manage to survive that, the map boss will likely eat you alive. Money is earned for both kills and performing actions relevant to your perk - medics earn money for healing, for example. Between rounds, you use the cash you earn to buy new equipment, Counterstrike-style, or share that cash with teammates who need it more. Each perk (class) is designed to operate in some way unique from the others, and they complement each other extremely well, with some perks being better against certain enemies, and a variety of roles being essential for success.\n\nWhat I love is that the balance in these games is very carefully tuned for them to be survivable, but only if you work together. It's not about getting the most kills, it's not about calling other people noobs; it's about survival and survival only, and liabilities cannot be tolerated.\n\nIf you hoard cash, the players will kick you. If you solo for most kills, the players will kick you. If you throw abuse at the medic, if you refuse to switch out to a higher perk level on high difficulty servers - if you act like an ♥♥♥, the players will kick you. The game absolutely requires teamwork to be survivable in most cases, so if you're not interested in working as a member of a team, don't bother buying the game.\n\nEdity edit time!\n\nSome people were concerned that the community doesn't like new players. That's not what I'm trying to say here. I should clarify: Killing Floor has difficulty ratings on its servers, and you'll be helped out on the lower difficulties, taught how to take enemies down, etc. I've put in time on beginner servers myself, doling out cash, pointing out hold points, protecting people from getting ganked.\n\nIt's when you graduate to higher difficulties you'll be expected to know your ♥♥♥♥. For those people saying "Oh, so you kick everyone you play with" - no, not at all. It's rare we kick anyone because the community is solid, but as I said, this is not a game for people who want all the glory and to tell everyone how awesome-sauce they are.\n\nEdity edit ends.\n\nAnd how does Killing Floor 2 hold up? It is everything I wanted it to be as a KF1 veteran. It takes the same formula - co-operate or die - and adds all the polish that the original was arguably missing. Animations are fantastic, and the game runs smooth as silk, the modified Unreal 3 engine and Tripwire's art style giving it a gorgeous look. I'm seriously impressed by how well it runs and how stable it is, given that the game isn't even at the early access stage yet. There's not a lot of content yet, but many years of experience with Tripwire lends me trust that it will arrive. These devs are some of the good guys.\n\nKilling Floor is designed to be hard as hell, and KF2 doesn't disappoint. The replacement for KF1's patriarch is somehow even more of an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and I love it. The Fleshpounds will still kick your ♥♥♥ without breaking stride, and the stalkers are way more of a pest than before, being now nearly impossible to see for non-Commandos. More spawn points and spawn types have been added, making it harder to find a safe spot, and forcing you to watch your back. Expect a *lot* of kiting before players get the hang of the new maps.\n\nLevels initially look a lot cleaner than previously, but that doesn't last long. The gibbing system from Killing Floor 1 has been turned up to 11 in KF2, and persistence has been added. Where you kill enemies, their blood and body parts will persist, often for the rest of the game. This can lead to your berserker standing in a pile of blood and corpses, and it's really something to behold when slow-mo kicks in.\n\nAdditionally, damage to the levels is now permanent for the match. Blow out a door, or let the zeds smash it in, and it will not respawn between rounds. Blow out the lights throwing grenades around, and now you can't see for the next half hour. It really adds something to the frantic feel of the game, having the area you're holed up in get slowly trashed over the course of the map.\n\nThere are a ton of other small tweaks and improvements, too. The addition of dedicated "sprint" and "melee" keys are welcome to anyone who knows what the "Trader Trundle" is like as a Support or Pyro player. The little meters on medic guns sights that show their recharge state, the "ammo check" or "weapon clean" animations that play if you hit reload on weapons that don't require it, the automatic (and useful) conversations that take place between player characters based on their actions; it all comes together.\n\nEverything about the Killing Floor 1 experience has been upgraded. It sounds better, it looks better, it plays more smoothly, and (even at this stage) it feels less buggy. If you liked KF1, KF2 is an essential purchase. If you haven't tried KF1, or its lack of polish from its UT2K4 mod origins put you off, you should definitely give KF2 a try. I have a feeling that, as with its genesis, this will be one of my favourite multiplayer games ever.","April 21, 2015","true","23.7"," 411 of 488 people (84%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","84","411","488","17","25"

I think that is highly unlikely with Tripwire, but its possible-\n\nAs of right now, Killing Floor 2 is in a very polished, but still very early state in early access. There is only one mode, 4 maps, one boss and a hand full of characters. However, if your looking for a zed shooter that feels so good, look no further than Killing Floor 2.\n\nThe game isn't even close to complete and already I feel it has some of the best gunplay out there. Every gun I've shot with feels amazing, shotguns feel heavy and strong, assault rifles feel fast and shred through weaker enemies, and so on. Of the weapons I've played with, they all feel amazing and not samey at all.\n\nThe game already has several enemy types that do a variety of things. I think I counted about 9 different types of zeds so far. That number might be off, but its around there. It has a lot of variety, is the meat of what I'm saying.\n\nThere is a lot of work needed to be done, more game modes, more enemy types, more guns. But for what it is right now, its already worth it if your looking for a zed shooter that has great feeling. Tripwire knows what they're doing, so no need to worry about that, I can pretty much guarantee this game will be finished. If your even considering picking it up, dot it. Don't be like me and wait, then regret not picking it up immediately. Killing Floor 2 is a joy to play.\n\nBuy At Full Price","April 24, 2015","true","9.4"," 223 of 249 people (90%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","90","223","249","13","1"

Based on the BETA, it's 10/10; and remember it's only BETA lol.\nIt was EXACTLY the game they promised to deliver, and hell, there are even more things in the game they didn't speak about.\n1. They nailed the gore\n-When you kill zeds, their bodies would dissappear, but the blood remains; so by the time the match finishes, the entire stage will be covered in PURE.. GOREY... RED... BLOOOOOD\n- Zed time is fun with this as well.. The entire colors change into black and white, with a twist: When you shoot the zeds, you'll see that pure red blood spew out of them! And it'll be in RED... REEEED\n- Their "Meat system" gives you 22 different death animations for the ZEDS... It's called detail, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n2. The weapons are as amazing as they described them\n- They animated the weapons perfectly at the high framerate animation thing... They animated them at 200FPS. When you're normally shooting the weapons will look nice and fire smoothly but with 30 FPS as usual. However, once you go into zed time the animations will be so detailed that you'll notice the barrels flexing, the weapon magazine wiggling, and it'll feel extremely realistic. (Check Weapons and gore part 2 dev diary)\n- They made sure they didn't take away the weapons we all loved in Killing Floor 1. That means AA12 is back for you supports... Katana for you Zerks... And SCARs for you Commanos :)\n\n3. Perks are now much better\n- So far, in the beta, we got 4 perks out of TEN.. That's right, we got 10 perks coming in the final game! 7 of which are the ones from Killing Floor 1, with 3 newcomers : Gunslinger, some perk with a Dragon Head (NOT firebug), and some other perk with a soldier wearing a flak jacket and a helmet: http://i.imgur.com/yGGn4d3.jpg?1\n- Levelling is less of a grind, because:\nA. You got 25 levels, meaning you'll level up more often and enjoy it.\nB. Your XP objectives are all optional. That's good news for me and you, support specialists... We don't have to weld anymore :D. Instead, dealing damage alone gives you XP and allows you to level up. That, and welding will still affect it. (You can go on a challenge if you like... Just weld doors and don't kill ****) it's all optional for you to level up the way you want. Again, better news for commandos who had to work themselves out killinng those stalkers :P\n- You got your perk skills.. They're a nice little touch :). They can be tweaked at any given time, either before or during a game to your own liking :D.\n\n4. The game is beautifully stable. Little to NO bugs/glitches for me; runs smoothly for me; AND the servers run great. No problems with the net-code, nor the ping. *And this is coming from a dude living in the Middle East, where all the servers run at europe and the USA 9410940219402194 miles away from me.. So be thankful you westerners :(*\n\n5. You still got mod support.\n-Custom servers with 20 players... 50 community-made perks... custom-modded weapons and zeds... etc... We enjoyed them in the first game and they're coming back strong for this sequel :D.\n\nThis game hasn't dissapointed me, I had high expectations and they were delivered the way they were meant to be on a BETA STAGE.. The final product is gonna blow our minds away, hopefully. Of course I know it will because I trust Tripwire. They've outdone themselves and have took our experience to the next level.\n\nIn-terms of Quality: A solid 10/10 experience; and im being serious when I say 10/10.. This game is flawless!\nHOWEVER: Quantity does affect it. This game as just been out so there arent as much zeds and perks as promised. :) By the time the final product is released; you might develop new fetishes (im not joking)","May 2, 2015","true","125.8"," 279 of 328 people (85%) found this review helpful 140 people found this review funny","85","279","328","140","10"

I tend to agree with them. TWI is double dipping on DLC, microtransactions, and the initial cost of the game. Keep in mind that this game is in Early Access, and has been for over a year.\n\nFirst, the game has an exclusive weapon for the owners of Chivalry. If you really have your heart set on using the zweihander, it amounts to a $24.99 DLC item.\n\nThe game also has "crate and key" style microtransactions. These types of microtransations are exploitative, and in my opinion, should be regulated by gambling laws. Others games that have a similar microeconomy (TF2, Dota 2, and CS:GO) are free, free, and $14.99, respectively. This is a $30-$40 Early Access game. It's also worth noting that the cost of keys in KF2 is almost twice the cost of keys in CS:GO or TF2. There are also 10+ different types of keys, all to ensure that the marketplace value of these items remains artificially high.\n\nThe last straw, though, is that TWI promises to release DLC weapons in the future. Die-hard fans of KF2 will be forced to purchase these weapons in order to stay competitive in coop mode. The cynical side of me believes that TWI introduced PvP mode (which none of the player-base asked for) so that they can boost DLC weapon sales once they are released. The game has a fairly high chance of being pay-to-win in the future.\n\nAll in all, the exclusive content, gambling-style microtransactions, and promise of pay-to-win weapons DLC leaves a very unpleasant taste in my mouth. Especially for a game that has a $30-$40 price tag.","April 26","false","132.8"," 373 of 477 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","373","477","6","14"

It gets worse too that rather than adding in perks people have been asking months for, Tripwire goes and adds in a paid marketplace skin system (which no one asked for) and a worthless PvP mode (which again, NO ONE asked for). With such an incompetent company behind the wheel of a decent but very barebones game, I absolutely cannot stress enough that you will not get much out of the game in its current state, but what you do get is fairly decent.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Honketh/recommended/232090/","Honketh","MightyHonk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Honketh/","227 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhen president of game development company that wants to offer you hell-on-earth killing fest with lots of guns and knee-deep levels of gore also wears Impending Doom t-shirt in his interviews, you can expect some really serious stuff.\n\nTripwire is gradually growing to be my favorite shooter developers, and that's why:\n\nI was one of those guys who got tired of first Killing Floor really fast, but even then i remember how well done weapons were in this game. Then Red Orchestra 2 arrived and i swear to god i was ready to marry this mosin rifle. Then, there is Killing Floor 2. In ungodly early access. By the same studio that couldn't make RO2 work for half a year since it's release (With satanic Punkbuster i swear to god i will find the ones that made this monstrousity and i will slap them in the face with overused condom for making mandatory useless software that was conflicting with two of my motherboards in a row).\nAnd i can't say a single bad thing about KF2, nothing. There's nothing to nitpick. It just works. And offers so much fun for a modern game it's unbelievable EVEN with only 3 maps and four classes available so far.\n\nWhile being modern shooter without archaic mechanics, it still offers you this old forgotten feeling when you're alone against horde of infernal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with ten ammo up your mag and a rusty knife. Same feeling that you have in Doom when you dodge Arch's flames hiding behind fences and try to find any medkit or ammo ahead. Same feeling when you walk through the map and it looks like actual location instead of bunch of rooms. And feeling when you shoot your gun and feel the recoil. You only get this when developers really love their work.\n\nAttention to detail in design of characters, maps and weapons is high enough to make online shooting gallery atmospheric. You reload a gun with bullets left in the mag - character puts this mag into his pocket. You blast off zombie's head while it's still crawling from the manhole - it will keep crawling blindly a bit before dying. Fat puking mister dude, while being decapitated, can still puke. Flamethrower zombie dude sets little ones blocking you behind on fire, effectively putting them into panic and killing them, so you can escape to get killed elsewhere. Invisible infidel women chant some kind of "don't leave me..." stuff, so you want to put them out of their misery a bit sooner. Siren also speaks something like "kill me" when she's not screaming, killing half of your team that was running from frenzied Bane from Batman movie. Playing on higher difficulties gives monsters new behavior patterns: some start jumping like crazy, some will use different attacks and so on. You don't expect this kind of detail on "play_two_rounds_go_jack_off_and_then_go_to_bed" kind of game for sure.\n\nSo far i don't see any reason for not buying this game (especially when it was gifted to me anyway, keks) and give it 100 angry scrakes out of 100. What bothers me a bit, tho, is design of enemies themselves, would be a bit cooler with some Dead Space like stuff than "let's make mass produced skinless male soldier, take one arm off and then put a blade onto other (without removing the skin from this arm of course), for science of course" nonsense, but it's just a personal preference.\n\nGrab it while you can, lads.","April 27, 2015","true","124.7"," 112 of 132 people (85%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","85","112","132","19","1"

And there is a base for an extremely great game here.  The optimization is extremely good and gun play is fun. The main problem here is an extreme lack of content. The game is still missing a sharpshooter class, and the official map pool is tiny. And most perks only have 3-5 guns with usually only 2 viable towards the end of the match. Content updates have been few and far between, expect to wait up to 3 month for a small amount of content. For example our last update that gave us any real content was on 3/24/16 it was two gun, one map, vs mode, and some bug and balance fixes. The last major patch before that was on 12/3/15 and added a new boss, two maps, a perk, new character, and micro transactions. The game has been in Early Access for around a year and very little has been added in terms of content. At the current rate of development it will take another year or two to have enough content that I would consider this game as a full release. I would recommend that you wait another year before considering this game because you’ll have a way better experience and hopefully more content. I’ll update this review when I feel this game is ready to be recommended.","May 4","false","161.7"," 155 of 196 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","155","196","0","2"

I have played KF2 for about 45 hours. My opinion below is only of my experiences and secondhand experiences of others.\n\nKF2 feels a bit like a shadow of what KF1 is.\n\nThe mechanics are all basically the same: a squad of guys running around, killing zeds and trying to stay alive. One of the most popular things in KF1 was to find a place to solidly hold up for a while, be it a long hallway or a room with one or two doors to watch. Even with the camping technique it was still very easy to get overwhelmed. KF2 is not quite teh same. There are usually 2 large open areas on each map which everyone congregates in, and then everyone runs around in circles trying to outkill everyone else. Pretty standard stuff to expect, I suppose. But then when the larger zeds come along, either everyone runs away or doesnt help.\n\nMap LayoutYou might be thinking, "That's a problem with the community, not the game itself" but considering the map designs, which mostly consist of large open areas with a LOT of obstructions all over, it makes it the only viable place to kill and still be able to keep an eye on teammates. The majority of maps have head-high obstructions, so you find yourself weaving in and out of obstacles, with teammates doing the same in a frantic 'who can kill the most' race around obstacles... except of course for in the 2 large open areas. Which is why everyone goes there, because you can see more than 20 feet without things getting in your way. There are exceptions to this of course. Not every map is cluttered with debris in every area, but it is enough to force players to the two large open areas nearly every time on nearly every difficulty.\n\nWeapons: Starting Weapons, Class-Specific and Weapon FeelStarting weapons in KF1 consisted of a pistol and a knife - unless you were a high level. With limited weapons, it challenged the player as soon as they stepped into the game to be able to hold their own as well as it provided incentive for others to share wealth and weapons.\nIn KF2, everyone starts with a class specific weapon. Support starts with a shotgun, assault starts with a .22 rifle and so on. The weapons that you start with are decent enough to get you into the game fast. You can keep up with kills fairly well, but the fear and reliance on others is diminished when you already are starting off strong.\n\nIn KF1, the weapons you hd to choose from were noticeably different from each other. You could have a sniper rifle that was insanely powerful or pistols to deal with trash zeds with the sharpshooter class. Players' choices in weapons were always seen.\nIn KF2, with one of your class specific weapons already given to you when you join a game, you're limited to only a few other weapons specific to your class to gain. They're all pretty much sequentially better than the previous so you wouldnt choose one weapon over the other. You go for the more expensive, better gun. And I know that there will be the typical crowd saying, "BNut its still early access. They can change the weapons around or balance them" but at this point, the changes they make will not be drastic changes and the starting shotguns, grenade launchers, assault rifles are here to stay.\n\nMonetizationThis is a sore spot for a lot of people, myself included.\nKF1 had the option of purchasing character packs and weapon packs for a reasonable amount of money. I believe about $10 on release, later dropping down to $2ish.\nKF2 has gone a completely different route. The crate+key system is a way for people with gambling addictions to spend their money away and the Tripwire teamhas embraced their gambling mechanics. In my experience playing, I would have lots of crates (in the form of 'thumbdrives') drop. They'd be sitting around in my inventory and they'd have descriptions like "has a chance of dropping an extremely rare weapon skin!" and when you have a bunch of those crates kicking around in your inventory, you kind of wonder what it is you're missing out on. So you have to get some keys to open them now... and all you have to do is buy an individual key to open it. You spend the money on a key and unlock the crate. Aww too bad, all you got was a scarf for your character. Better luck next time. But thanks for spending $7 on a virtual scarf! Dont worry though because another crate will drop next game for you. Just keep buying keys...\n\nDeveloper's CommunicationTripwire has been pretty quiet on a lot of topics in the forums, mostly revolving about suggestions or asking questions about updates. Its their game and they can choose who they interact with and how many times they answer the same questions over and over so I'm not going to fault them on their silence.\n\nWhat I take issue with is the fact that their game is early access and are publicly putting this out there for the public to play and help test. From all of the testing, there have only been a few large updates released with actual content. For the most part, the mechanics are done. They spent a LOT of time getting the blood effects working and devoted loads of resources into that. They spent time on microtransactions in early access, making sure that they can keep the money train rolling with people buying virtual nonsense all throughout testing, and even with the hordes of people asking,"When will sharpshooter class be released?" Tripwire stays silent, only saying, "Here are some screenshots of some sharpshooter guns. Thats it."\n\nTripwire doesnt have clear goals or release dates for content set. They're basically just saying it'll be released when it is released. Their playerbase screams for updates, any new content to keep them interested, they demand Tripwire stays on task rather than devoting large amounts of time to unnecessary stuff like making more virtual content for characters and instead focus on getting the classes of the game finished and Tripwire stays silent.\n\nIt makes me think that they only released KF2 as early access to get money, then they released microtransactions in the middle of early access to keep the money ocming and they dont actually want feedback or care what the community thinks.\n\nServer PopulationRelated to the developer's communications, a lot of players have disappeared from the game.\n\nThroughout the life of KF1 and even up to today there are still a lot of players logging into KF1 servers and killing zeds.\n\nKF2? Well, the servers have died off quite a bit. Sure the population on KF2 is higher than KF1 but a lot of the players are playing one class to max level, stop when they cap out, then wait till another class is released and play that to max level, etc and they disappear from the game for weeks at a time waiting for another class to be released. When KF2 is finally released as V1.0, hardly anyone is going to stick around. Why should they when they've played each class ad nauseum to max level waiting for more updates.\n\nCommunity BacklashI cant speak directly to this as I havet experienced it first hand, but recently there has been a great culling in the forums. Mods are being very heavy handed silencing any people who have negative comments to say, purging their comments from forums, banning users and locking threads. Are they trying to clean up the forums of any negativity in preparation for another content push and therefore another chance to get the game some sales on Steam's main page? It'd make sense. Get rid of dissenting opinion and whitewash months of neglect by hiding those who dont kiss butt fom the public's view.\n\nAny time you get a fascist mod running forums, you get many times more the negtive response to your game. Its like the Streisand effect.\n\nSummaryI cant reomend this game. I've sunk lots of hours into it, sure, but that was mostly me hoping to recapture the greatness of KF1. Its all due to Tripwire's direction of the game.","May 16","false","43.0"," 147 of 185 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","147","185","5","1"

Gameplay is smooth and fluid, guns look, feel, and sound great, melee combat manages to be better than Shadow Warrior, it's very satisfying to kill enemies in every way possible. Graphics are better than many "next-gen" AAA games out there, doesn't even look like this is made by an Indie company, maps have an incredible attention to detail, everything is very colorful, enemies have superb animations, lightning effects are very realistic. As much as I don't like "christian death metal" this style of music fits in this game like a glove (luckly the vocals switched off by default. also, I think it's the first time I see a game that allows you change between instrumental and  music with vocals. That's pretty neat). Voice work is also good.\n\nCons: The game still doesn't has the same variation of the original. Currently you only have 4 perks and 4 levels to choose, and the development has been pretty slow. The only real downside this game has so far is Zed Time. The grayscale filter is ugly, and the excessive bloom makes you blind. Hope they add an option to make Zed Time look like KF1 again.\n\nNeutral: I miss Alan Wilson's old lines from KF1. In KF2 he still dubs one character (Mr. Foster), but he only has a few bunch of lines. Most of his iconic lines such as "It's raining moneeey", "Dosh, grab it while it's hot!  Loaaaads of money" are gone. He has few new ones, but still much less lines than he had in KF1. I know many people found his voice annoying, but I miss him. If somebody knows a mod that can restore his old lines from KF1, please PM me with a link for it.\n\nNonetheless, this is shaping up to become one of the, if not THE best co-op game of all times.

But I can't, in good conscience let this slide. TWI has lost sight of their goal. They have their sights on sources of income. I am mostly fine with their cosmetic microtransactions (the prices could be tweaked a bit, and the different qualities such as battle scarred, field tested, mint, could be done away with), but they no longer have the original spirit as when they started. Whether this is because they are running out of money or any other reason is speculation at this point, but they are handling it completely wrong. I'd like to go over the primary reasons for my rant: things that they have promised and have done.\n\nCensorship in the discussion board? Not cool, and completely undermines the United State's constitutional rights. Why are they doing this? well there could be various reasons: to promote their game in a more favorable light, or maybe since they have heard the criticism long enough they have built up tolerance for it and no longer deem them important. Maybe they hired some new guy who is going ham as a moderator. Regardless of what their intent is, censorship is not the answer. As people, we need positive and negative feedback to challenge ourselves and improve. Because of this, the only way to let others know about the issues in the game is to read reviews such as this one or find it elsewhere.\n\nAttention to detail? Maybe, but I still see some slop in areas. I thought you guys had gun nuts on the dev team? The 9mm casings flying out of the Desert Eagle; double action trigger of a Beretta that is cocked is in the double action position instead of being in the single action position; hitting reload to mess with your scar or ak's ejection port and it stays closed.\n\nEarly Access done right? Again, maybe. When the game first launched, there were only 4 perks. Even then, switching between them caused some perks to carry over. Parry was pretty broken and inconsistent as well. Every update since then has had various bugs:\n-Incinerate and Detonate? RPG and other shots do not go where you aim if you turn too fast and fire (I believe this is still an issue).\n-Sharpshooter weapons release for feedback with a Prison map? Map crashes with the crossbow when picking up bolts.\n-PVP? PVP had human players invulnerable to big zeds when a melee weapon was out. These just go to show how much testing they do before releasing these quality updates. Hell, we didn't even ask for PVP. It's a nice afterthought, but development time should have been spent on the core game. Afterall, we the consumers, and TWI wanted to retain that "core gameplay loop" that made the original so fun and successful.\n\nThey have stopped pushing originally planned content and are now focusing on other areas: PVP and Microtransactions when their main game is not even completed yet.\nNow you may be wondering, "But Sam, why are you still playing? Why do you support these practices?" The answer is simple: I don't support these practices. As stated earlier, I love this game. Unfortunately it's the only one of its kind. Same goes with Aliens Colonial Marines. It may be underwhelming and not as promised, but its all I got, (either forever or until something better comes out). I am not buying anymore items from the market until TWI gets their crap together. From the looks of it, things are bleak and veering towards following the footsteps of Payday 2: Not listening to their customers/fanbase, and only focusing on greed. They may very well be hurting from lack of income but again, this isn't how it should be handled.\n\nTL:DR - TWI is no longer great and went from Lawful Good to Chaotic Evil.

The game goes on sale TWO WEEKS after its release.\n- Promised game would be completed before the end of 2015. As of the writing of this review, only 7 out of 10 perks are in the game and it has been 4 months since the last content update which added a single perk.\n- Frequently criticize its own fanbase of being too demanding. In a live stream they recently said they have basically not worked on the game at all since the release of RoTP, plus a lot of their employees have quit.\n- Have not said ANYTHING about the PS4 version since its initial announcement.\n\n- Released Berserker in a broken state, which has taken MANY buffs to "fix" and they still managed to dumb it down from not only KF1, but also from its initial KF2 release where parrying took some form of skill.\n- Nerfed Support into near uselessness. 50% damage falloff after 4 meters.\n- Nerfed door welding into complete and total uselessness.\n- Released Demolitions in a weak state and has only been nerfed since then.\n- Failed to implement bug fixes that would not take more than a few workdays to complete. For months you could circle the Scrake and Hans which made fighting them trivial, and you can still stunlock Fleshpounds with the Pulverizer.\n- Released a horribly unoptimized graphic setting known as Nvidia FLEX only to later remove it which both cost tons of development time and money.\n\n- Advertise their updates as "free content packs" as if it's expected for people to PAY MONEY FOR "CONTENT PACKS" IN AN EARLY ACCESS GAME\n- Crossovers in Early Access.\n- TF2-style microtransactions in Early Access.\n- Cosmetic crafting system in Early Access.\n- Player-created workshop cosmetics funding their development in Early Access.\n- "Early Access done right."\n- "Stay tuned!"\n\n- Precious development time spent on useless features NOBODY asked for, such as a PvP mode.\n- Unreasonably long (I don't care at all how patient you think you are) times between updates.\n- Very infrequent (once every 2 weeks) WIP news posts.\n- Even after a year the game is still not *on par* with KF1 yet, let alone a worthy sequel.\n\n- New dialogue loses almost all of the British charm and campiness of the original, thus a notable step down in atosmphere.\n- New trader is terrible.\n- Despite there being a poll for which characters the fans most want to return from KF1, nothing has been said about returning cast since the initial announcement of the poll and no new characters have been added since Tom Banner and Anton Strasser, both of which are new additions.\n- Quick commands menu turned into a chat wheel; gimped dialogue for PC so that it can still be used on a console (remember how nothing has been said about the PS4 version since its announcement?)\n- Removed the INSULT PLAYERS command.\n- Removed the THANKS command.\n- Intentionally got "clip" and "magazine" wrong in all dialogue.\n\nUltimately, this game is not broken by any single one of the things I just listed. People love to bash TW for adding microtransactions to Early Access, and while admittedly it is disgusting, it doesn't kill the game.\nAll of these issues, big and small, add up to create a massive shitcake of a game. At its core, it's a great and enjoyable game, but Tripwire has time and time again proven they not only HATE their own fanbase but that apparently everything they did right in KF1 they got right by pure luck, as almost nothing that made KF1 good carries over into KF2.\nKF2 feels like it was developed by Ubisoft or EA, but at least one of those two developers would FINISH THE GAME, which Tripwire is woefully incapable of doing.\n\nIf you're seriously thinking about buying this game, save your money or buy KF1 instead.\nIf this game is finally finished in (and I'm not exaggerating here) 2017 and it's good, then MAYBE it's worth the purchase. For now though, do not support Tripwire's failed abortion of a game.","April 4","false","295.3"," 1,137 of 1,643 people (69%) found this review helpful 82 people found this review funny","69","137","1","82","112"

No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nI'm going to be really honest. I own and have played the original Killing Floor for less than an hour. I don't know why, but I just couldn't get into it. It seemed alright, but something about it just turned me off. I'm not very good at shooters either, but every now and then I find one that is so much fun that I keep playing and eventually get to be a little decent at it. Killing Floor 2 is one such shooter. This is a game that I could immediately pick up and enjoy. Even better is that it's not a competitive shooter...it's a co-op shooter! Also of note is that it's currently in Early Access, and is probably the best Early Access title I've played to date.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nKilling Floor 2 takes place one month after the events in the first Killing Floor. Horzine Biotech's failed experiment has had some disastrous results, and it's up to you and your companions to go into Zed hot zones and clear them out! The game's matchmaking system nearly instantly matches you to a game, where other players can join in/drop out when they please. The game is played on a wide variety of maps in what are called waves, and in each wave zeds are coming from nearly EVERYWHERE to kill you. Each wave has a number of zeds, and as you clear these waves they get more numerous, more diverse, and harder to kill. Each kill earns players dosh (money) and experience points that apply to their chosen perk (class) depending on their actions. Gain enough points to level up. Every 5 levels the player gets to choose a skill to unlock for their chosen perks. These skills vary in nature, but are extremely useful.\n\nA bit about the players and their avatar: characters are somewhat customizable. There are a little more than a dozen characters to play as, each with certain features and accessories you can choose to customize them. It also looks like you can unlock more things for them to wear and more weapons to use by completing challenges or owning certain other games on Steam (example - Chivalry: Medieval Warfare).  There are 6 perks to choose from: Commando, Berserker, Support, Field Medic, Demolitionist, and Firebug. Each one levels up by performing actions pertinent to that perk. For example Firebug gains experience by using incendiary weapons, while Field Medic gains experience by healing teammates. You can earn experience for your perks even if you are not currently playing as that perk.\n\nOne of the neat things you can do is use a welder to seal strategic doorways shut for a time to allow your teammates time to regroup or heal. I thought this was a really cool concept, but make sure you use it in truly advantageous locations and coordinate with your teammates, or else it can just be a waste of time. Another thing is Zed Time, which is when time slows to an absolute crawl for a few seconds, allowing players to make very precise shots or maneuvers. This is triggered by certain actions, such as perfectly timed headshots.\n\nAs you clear waves, you get the opportunity to spend your hard-earned dosh at Trader Pods to buy new weapons, ammo, body armor, and many other items. Weapons and ammo can also be found scattered about map. After a period of time (I think it's exactly 1 minute, maybe a tad more), the next wave begins. After the last wave, a boss will appear. Once the boss goes down, the game is won...and it just starts over on a new map, which players can vote on in their results screen. The results screen shows your "high scores" and how much experience points you get from your actions, as well as your most used weapons. If you die in a wave, you will not respawn until the next wave starts. If all players die in a wave, the game is over. New players who join in the middle of a wave will spectate until the next wave starts. There are 4 difficulty modes, and as the difficulty goes up, you will notice zeds behaving very differently. They will approach you in different ways, have new attacks, and generally act smarter. AI was very well programmed in this regard.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nKilling Floor 2 is all about the gore. Everything you kill can have their heads blown off, limbs shot or chopped off, etc. You will see a lot of blood and entrails as you destroy waves of zed. And it is glorious! The amount of detail put into how the game looks in regards to the blood and gore is amazing. The zed designs are pretty awesome as well, with each type of zed (there are about a dozen different types) having specific details they adhere to.\n\nWeapons look really great. They are pretty detailed and look true to life (the ones based on real life weaponry, at least), and the ones that aren't look realistic enough. Some of them light up or have lights on them, like the Field Medic weapons. Fire looks very realistic and behaves like it would in real life. The amount of work Tripwire has put into this game looking as good as it can is mindblowing.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe soundtrack is unbelievable! It's completely metal, featuring artists such as zYnthetic, Demon Hunter, Impending Doom, Living Sacrifice, and Rocky Gray. I honestly have never heard of any of these, but after looking them up online they are now part of my YouTube playlists. I love every track in this game...they fit the theme of Killing Floor perfectly and really put you into the game and into a killing mood! I am quite partial to this one:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6PQH5m8ZGg\n\nThe rest of the game's audio is as it should be...bullets, explosions, zed noises...all sound great. The sound direction for this game was top-notch. Nothing really sounded out of place or odd, and was very fitting in all situations. Even melee weapons like the katana sounded great when swinging them or chopping up zeds.\n\nEvery character has a lot of voiced lines and thanks/responses that players can use. The match commentator/trader pod operator will give you updates on each wave's progress as you go as well.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nThis game....my gosh, it runs so well considering the amount of stuff going on all the time. Even with tons of zeds attacking, explosions and bullets everywhere, and bodies piling up on screen each wave. My FPS was in the 50-60 range at all times, which is perfectly fine with me. Mouse/Keyboard is the recommended way to play. Controllers are fully supported, and I recall picking mine up briefly...but I went back to M/KB very quickly.\n\nMatches take a little bit to load when found, but once in-game everything flows smoothly with no loading screens or waiting. I didn't experience any odd bug or glitches, lag, or stuttering at anytime. The game is pretty polished for an Early Access title, but given Tripwire's attention to the rest of the game, I'm not surprised.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nGet this game. Seriously, it's great. Infinitely better than the original Killing Floor in nearly every way. Tripwire knows what they're doing, and they are very hard at work turning Killing Floor 2 into the best co-op shooter ever, As far as I'm concerned, they've already succeeded. Active community. Great to play with friends, or anyone really.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/TMEI-dMCKZM\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\nIf you liked this review or found it helpful, please consider rating it up.

But alas, due to the recent actions overtaken by the developer of the game, TWI, this potential is all but wasted.\nFirst of all, ill elaborate a bit more on what makes Killing floor 2 a good game in principal. The graphical upgrade over its predecassor is clearly visible, and much welcomed. The new gore system, along with the persistent blood mechanic is also a nice and fitting addition to the game. Weapon handling is moreover, heavily improved, with loads of new animations, and weapon features. All of these make for a solid base, in which KF2 could build so much on, and become a truly amazing game.\n\nAs for the actions that completely undermine the current and future success of the game, they seemingly have no end, but ill try and sum them up.\n\nFirstly comes Balance. One of the very reasons TWI decided to go the EA route with KF2, was that they wanted to balance out the game, before they released it. However, since release, the game has become progressively even more and more unbalanced. This in it of itself due to a plethora of reasons. First of all the Devs seem to be of the mindset, that if something is overperforming in contrast to something else, the "OP" weapon is to be brought down, to match the underperformance of the other equipment. This would make sence in a PvP game, were you go against each others equipment, but when this principle is used on a PvE game, the result is that in the end, you end up with everyone on the human side having equaly underperfoming equipment, that is useless against the normal, but in contrast overperforming equipment of the AI. This has resulted in many classes and weapons having been rendered useless, and only but a few last pieces of equipment and classes, remain META and useful. Secondly, the artificial enhancement of the difficulty of the AI, also plays a part in the inbalance. Namely, absurd systems, as AI teleporting magicly on the map, or magicly raging for no reason, when the AI numbers are diminished play a huge part in making the game unnesseserily hard. In this way they also force the player to stay on the move, thus taking away any prospect of playing defensively, a strategy option that brings much needed life to PvE games. Lastly, contrary to what the developer has promised, community and player feedback is listened to rarely if at all. They ignore issues brought up by the community, or even suggestions based on data, and instead only change stuff that are easy to change, or that they themselves agree with. Overall, they seem like they are more interested in making a game they themselves would like to play, and not something the community and the players would.\n\nThe second nail in the coffin, so to speak, was the poor handling and introduction of the completely consumer unfriendly Microtransaction system. With the system at hand, anyone interested in interacting with cosmetics in the game, be it because they like fassion gaming, role playing, completioning or because they would like to support the developer, are bound to get ripped of, That is because currently, theres only 2 ways to acquire cosmetics. 1) spend away money at RNG keys and crates, in hopes of getting what you want. 2) paying the arbitrarily set ludicrous prices in the steam market. (There is also the "option" to get cosmetics by crafting low tier drops into them, but based on calculations done by many, expecting to acquire anything of value from this, will require you to play for an absurd amount of time. Therefore this isnt really an option). In both cases, you should expect to pay upwards of 10 dollars, just for a few cosmetics, and god forbid you go for, again arbitrarily, "precious" or "master crafted" items, as these will cost you the price of the game itself severalfold. As if this wasnt enough, this horrid system, often found in F2P games, is put in a 25 euro game, about 7 months into EA, almost without any notice.\n\nThe third major hinderance to the success of the game, is the development plan and time scedule. First of all, the game has surpased the developers own estimation, and the end is nowhere near. By the time it is finished, if at all that is, it will surely be half a year late, if not more. And while the game is already way past its deadline, the developer is still messing around with modes and ideas, no one asked for, like PvP modes, while also retracting on key features promised to be in the game (like crawlers walking on ceiling and walls). The update scedule is also severly lacking. They release an update every 4-6 months, by which time everyone has left, because they have played the same thing over and over, and when they come back they play the new things over and over for the next week then get bored again. This vicious cycle results in players loosing interest, even when new content is released.\n\nThe last but not least flaw that has to do more with the developer, but also with the game is transparecy. EA is supposed to be a platform, in which developer and player are in close relation, having constant discussion over the game. This can only happen when the developer informs the consumers over their plans, shows that they take into consideration their ideas, and implement the best of them, and give heads up on the progress they are making on a weekly or monthly basis. None of the above are achieved, ironicly so, since the developer even wants to claim they are "doing EA right".\n\nIn conclusion, there is no doubt, that given proper care, and management, this game can really shine, and thrive. However, if the current corse is sustained by the developers, its future is bleak at best, non existant at worst. Radical changes ought to be undertaken, in order for the aformentioned core problems that infest the game to be solved, and right now, no will for reparation is epxressed by the developers. Thus I can not recommend the game, especially in its EA fase. Its surely a game you should keep tabs on, in case the developers get their act together, but for now, its only good for just that.","May 4","false","62.8"," 126 of 161 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","126","161","0","0"

I used to.\n\nI have many issues with this sequel, the main one being the disappointment at this group of developers. I was expecting them to continue on their successful model "passionate work and originality = quality = $$$" in this saturated market, but instead they embraced the exact attitude of those producers whose eyes are solely on the money and all employ the same tactics which, somehow, have not gone downhill yet.\n\nTheir decision to go Early Access, and the way they presented their work (right from the beginning there was basic, working gameplay and a few maps that offered entertainment), I was led to believe they would continue upon that aspect.\nBut no.\n\nLately rather than finishing their promises for a complete game, they are wasting time implementing  MICROTRANSACTIONS.\nKilling floor 2 has so far been a financial success, these microtransactions (similar to the CS:GO crate system) are *NOT* needed to finish the game, they are what they are, a moneygrabbing scheme.\n\nThey did not warn loyal customers (yes, I AM a loyal customer, as I purchased this in Early Access in order to help their fund, I gave them my trust and faith, did I not?) about such disgraceful marketing tactics if not a few days/weeks before their implementation. I know that an "early access" title can be subject to changes, but this is unacceptable, unfair, wicked, shameful, shamefuru dispray COMMIT SUDOKU, cowardly, devious, foul and absolute BULL ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥\n\n\n\nBut I said "many" issues about this game, so now I'll talk about some game features that, well...they speak for themselves:\n\n-soundtrack: KF1 was renowned for its excellent (in its heavy metal genre) soundtrack, it was original and appropriate, what can you expect in KF2? Commercial, lower-grade more-popular "nu metal" without the vocals. If you like that, then it should be great news! But if you were expecting more of the original, you'll be sorely disappointed;\n\n-final boss: The Patriarch from KF1 distanced himself from the overused and overcommon archetypes of bosses, he looked unique, was unique, original, even if the theme of the mad scientist is overused.\nKF2? They made him a mindless mountain of muscles, of course, more flesh is always better, right?\n\n-characters: in the original KF the base, standard characters were soldiers of members of the police force, not the unrealistic 'murica f*ck yeah archetype. Boring? There were additional characters released as DLC, and others for free (if I am not mistaken), some sillier, some whatever, at least it gave the option not to choose a soldier.\nKF2: "mercenaries", because the story also went from "catastrophe just happened, you're the first team sent in to contain it" to "the whole world's military force is paper maché, now who wants money?", so FOR ME there is no more sense of communion between the players, mercenaries just want to deal with it and ♥♥♥♥ off, soldiers are doing their duty.\n\n\n\n\nSo in conclusion: this is a microtransactions-filled betrayal of an original game with fancier graphics. It had a lot of potential, and it still does, if the developers get a slap across their face and return to sanity.\nAnd I'll try refunding this game even though I'm quite sure Steam will tell me to ♥♥♥♥ off, 15 hours on record.\n\nSince I am probably stuck with this game, will you please do something like, writing on their forums that you will buy the game if they drop their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t?

School work bringing you down? Girl problems? Nobody understands you? Just having a rotten day? If you are like me sometimes you just want to forget about life’s problems and take out your aggressions with some mindless fun. On the surface, that’s what Killing Floor is all about. Head shot hordes and hordes of Zombies (Zeds) to survive the wave just to do it again. If you dig a bit deeper there is strategy to be found and tactics to be had but nothing your brain doesn’t have to think too hard about. Your biggest decision is picking out what weapon you want to use to impale some Zombies with.\n\nIf you have played the original Killing Floor you know exactly what to expect here. It’s the same formula with new maps, new weapons, and new Zeds.  As of the Early Access release there is nothing gameplay wise that sets it apart from the original. No jet packs, no vehicles, no air strikes, just good old fashioned Killing Floor. It is far more polished then the original, the graphics have greatly improved, and somehow TripWire made it even more fun. This is partially due to the amazing frames of motion in Zed time that has greatly improved over the original.\n\nAt its Early Access state you are getting a well-polished game. I have not had a single freeze or crash. I have only witnessed a few very minor graphical glitches and have had no issues joining servers. You are only getting three maps and one boss at its current state but Tripwire promises plenty of more content and we have no reason not to believe them based on their previous track record.\n\nThis is a definite buy in my book.","April 23, 2015","true","24.2"," 83 of 99 people (84%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","84","83","99","17","4"

But with the overall choices done to the sequel of such a great game I just in good conscience cannot recommend it in its now current state. Its moving way too slow...\n\nDevelopers are censoring all who talk badly against the game or giving all their negative feedbacks to the game shlock. Now first off I love the game when it first came out and was showing a lot of great promise all around. I played a lot of Killing Floor (Both Games) and coming from the original I have many great memories. But this is when the comparison comes at a grinding stop because I see the issues with what they have done to one of my personal favorite franchises on Steam, and one of the few true Co-Op games I grew up with.\n\nThe game is still an Early Access unstable mess and loss of priority. Even though their original intentions for the game were pure with "Early Access Done Right." has shown all evidence recently that this is not true anymore. The game still is incomplete, bare bones, glitchy and almost Hell on Earth unplayable mess with Zed Teleportation, Unbalanced Perks and a small roster of Official maps after being out over a year of its development. Also the game is already over 6 months beyond its finished release, putting it behind schedule. Another issue is that they have been cracking down on people's opinions and feedbacks on the Early Access game creating bans, moderatings and locking discussions from public eye on anything about their beloved Mts system. A big concern no matter how you look at it is the Key'n'Crate Gambling Crate System. This MTs system is junk, and expensive when it is 2.49 a shot and all by random dupes and overpriced saturated market prices when a DLC or a Digital Store would have sufficed all of this issue, but they refuse to change it. The game also suffers from long grueling 5-6+ months in between updates to add new content to the game, but they never slow down on skins and crates, that is for sure. Making junk cosmetic items and content very cheap, and the good unique customizations over the price of the actual game. And just downright giving the community right winged answers.\n\nThe positive things is that all I can say is the graphics, effects, audio and customizations are better in every way from the first game, but it still loses to the original game because this sequel is just missing its charm, care and replayability. Not to mention that a game that was purely Co-Op survival horror is now a Counter Strike/PVP skin call of duty game that has no real grit and grind the original has. Also the Flex still does not work, the game still lacks variety, and obviously a biased and divided community on the game. There is no strategy, the maps are small and contained, forced group locations. Fans of the original game flocked and adored the news of hearing about this game coming out, and we have supported it for a long time to get even better. A true successor to Killing Floor 1. But so far it has now become a letdown where keys/crates and a gambling/crafting market system and Player Vs Player (L4D2 Style Versus) has become the main focus instead of fixing the game.\n\nThe game can be fun with friends, no doubt about it but if you are expecting it to be a lot like KF1 you are dead wrong. You will get your fill of this game within a few matches, unlike the first game where you could end up playing it endessly. It is a real shame that when I look into the future I don't want to see Killing Floor 3 be flooded this way by MTs, long updates and a toxic multiplayer community thinking that this is where Killing Floor should go and I just can't agree to that mindset. They even stalked and removed major threads to this game, and now the playerbase is slowly dwindling. I just hope the creators do a 180 on this game and fix it the way it should be. Because it is not the new school that got them where they are today with this sequel, it was the fans and supporters of the original that got them where they are today, and basically they pushed that all away and ditching the die hard fans of the original.\n\nIt is really sad.","May 22","false","441.2"," 85 of 102 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","85","102","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuebic/recommended/232090/","kuebic","Kuebic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuebic/","338 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReview after Revenge of the ZED's update:\nApril 8, 2016\n\nTL;DR: The current game is polished, exciting, and a lot of co-op fun.  It holds a lot of potential as a finished product but the development process is leaving a lot to be desired, thus all the negative reviews as the community is making their disappointment known.\n\nIt appears the community's cumulative morale is significantly lower than a few months ago.  Understandably so as TWI just spent over four months creating a PvP gamemode that does not appeal to the majority of their fanbase and the current lack of balance makes it appear more as a tack-on gimmick.  Although I somewhat understand TWI's viewpoint of attempting to expand the playerbase, postponing the long-awaited sharpshooter perk which many have been waiting for since early access release almost a year ago is not doing any favors for the community.\n\nThe added Game Conductor could use some tweaking, but it adds a very nice dynamic to the games that was not previously present.  It certainly makes lower difficulties more enjoyable to play casually but playing on higher difficulties for the challenge while having the game punish players for doing well is absurd.\n\nAs many other reviews states, as the price will not change between early access and full release (not regarding currency fluxuations or steam sales) either wait for a finished build (most likely around early 2017... serious estimate) or purchase now and deal with the bugs that comes with early access games and development.\n\n==============================================================\n\nI did not write a review for the Return of the Patriarch patch back in December 2015, so I think I'll put my few cents here for now.  That content update not only had the Patriarch and the well-received gunslinger perk, but it included microtransactions and opened an entire can of worms for the community to digest.  Very many were unhappy for essentially the following reasons:\n\n1. The game is not even close to getting out of Early Access and TWI had the audacity to implement this system as if their game is complete.\n\n2. The devs diverted time and effort to add this feature which prolongs the wait before the game's release.  Do note that 95% of the content are from community submissions and a seperate team worked on this implementation.\n\n3. The community has never asked for a microtransactions process nor was it mentioned at all in the early access statement although it is clear with the implementation of the curating workshop near the beginning of early access that it was their plan from the very start.\n\nLong story short, many are not happy, but the system is still present.\n\nPerhaps the biggest positive about the microtransactions system is that currently it is cosmetic only and is not mandatory for enjoyment of the game.  I feel a factor for the huge resistance from the community was due to the Payday 2 fiasco with their poor implementation of microtransactions mere weeks before and also TWI announced this news to the community that were waiting months for an update and heard what they never wanted to hear.\n\n\nOLD REVIEWS!\n\nReview after Incinerate n' Detonate patch:\nSept. 6 2015\n\nThe way TWI is treating this Early Access game is very unlike "traditional" Early Access games.  The game is very polished, surprisingly well optimized, and updates come slowly, but in a large package (4GB for this one) and well thought-out.  Considering TWI's track-record and similar development style with their previous games, this is definitely not your typical Early Access game where you should worry if the devs will abandon or never finish the game.  Although their plan on finishing the game before the end of 2015 is questionable, I'd rather they take a few extra months than rushing to get it out before the new year.\n\nThe recent update invited a plethora of much needed updates after 4 months, especially the two new maps, perks, additional weapons, audio and game mechanic tweaks, additional gore features for high-end Nvidia cards, and a ton of other stuff they've been working on since release.  With more explosions and fire, it adds a lot more chaos into the mix and making it feel a bit more like the Killing Floor many fans loved about the first game.\n\nThere is still much debate on the current balance, but considering how four other perks and additional zeds are being implemented that will undoubtedly change the overall balance in the future, where it currently is at is fine and TWI shouldn't worry too much about getting balance perfect just yet.\n\nAs the free-weekend is currently going on, many of the servers are jam-packed and matchmaker's issues are very apparent.  I would suggest new players to browse servers manually to avoid getting put into a higher-difficulty server than you intended.\n\nAs TWI does not plan on raising the price after completing the game like other Early Access games do, whether you buy the game now or later will depend mostly on your willingness to put up with the handful of glitches and bugs.\n\nReview at launch:\n\nConcerning the small number of negative reviews:  they are just first-day reviews and like most multiplayer games, when EVERYONE gets on at the same time, servers aren't able to compensate.  Where have we heard this before?  Diablo 3?  Battlefield 4?  SimCity?  One problem is no linux servers, but based on TWI's track record, linux-servers will be developed sooner rather than later.\n\nWhen beta-testing/stress-testing servers with 3k tops then suddently getting 20k?  Just give it time.  The time in beta showed what it's capable of and it is totally playable at this time.

It's fun to play, the system itself has a few flaws but none of that makes me unable nor does it make me refuse to play the game. In short my negative review is due to how the company handles certain things. Basically, Tripwire needs to take a step back and really consider how they are speaking to their fans and how they can better react to criticism that they recieve without throwing bans left and right and speaking down to fans who have supported their franchise from the start.\n\nLet me start off by saying that I didn't have a problem with the slowness of updates because I generally figued it would take time to make them great. In my opinion, the maps and perks that were added during updates were enough to keep me satisfied and happy. Microtransactions were kind of a "huh?" moment for me, but AGAIN, didn't really care because they could be avoided. However, if you take a gander on the local forums, you will see that people are being banned apparently due to opinions, or points that they bring up about the game and how it should be changed. It seems when you voice your opinion you run the risk apparently of being banned simply for disagreeing with their views (even if you were respectful, professional and only stated what you disliked about the game, and then gave some points that could be improved on). They are also using other website information to ban people on steam (i.e, people are saying something about kf2 on reddit but then being banned on steam for what they have posted on reddit. Even if they have never posted anything bad on steam. Ever).  Here is the thread if you want to read more: http://steamcommunity.com/app/232090/discussions/0/364040166669631173/#c364040166692388095. and see other examples of ridiculous banning here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TWINOMICROTRANSACTIONS/discussions/0/371918937258389095/\n\nAnd I quote," Second, several users have been banned for their recent actions. This includes openly arguing against moderation (on other websites as well as in the group directly linked to)". Opinions should be allowed to be stated freely as long as they are not threatening ones safety, using racial slurs or being generally disrespectful and/or rude towards another individual (such as name calling for an example). There will always be people who will disagree with another person and it doesn't make either one right or wrong. You literally can't ban everyone for not liking what their favourite series has turned to. Do customer's negative opinions not matter because it isn't a glowing review? Shouldn't negative reviews HELP actually improve the game itself, so they can see what players are having issues with and attempt to improve them to allow a better experience for most, if not all, players?\n\nAnyway, that is why I am giving a negative review. Love the game, but don't agree with how the company itself is treating a large percentage of the fanbase.","May 7","false","216.3"," 121 of 157 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","121","157","2","3"

Sadly, Killing Floor 2 has been a complete let down from what I expected. Killing Floor 1 has combos/strategies which after a lot of practice in test maps, allowed you to become a master in certain perks and weapons to kill Scrakes and Fleshpounds. In Killing Floor 2 you just need to aim and shoot (unless you are a Berserker or a firebug, which don't even require aiming). I used to have some hope for these to be implemented, since they seemed to be most important feature of KF. But now after seeing how many other features that deviate from the core of Killing Floor have already made it into the game, it's clear combos are not part of TWI's plans for this game.\n\nThe core mechanics that allow for a higher skill ceiling, a deeper understanding of the AI behavior, and a precise/advanced application of the available perks and weapons, are just not present. This is what made the game fun for me during hundreds of hours in KF1, and this is why I am now bored of playing KF2.\n\nIt is very disappointing that there is no M32. Demo is my favorite KF1 perk, but it is a true disgrace in KF2 with how underpowered its tier 1 and 2 weapons are, how boring the RPG is, and the uselessness of the C4. Don't even get me started on the perk skills which always have an obvious choice and seem to have been designed by someone who hated being handed that task (to be honest, all the perks' skills give off this vibe; very few of them are actually interesting and useful).\n\nI also loved to do combos on FPs and Scrakes as Support Specialist in KF1 but it is severely underpowered in KF2 as well; little ammo, a weak hunting shotgun, and no nade stacking makes this perk a sad representation of what is once was. Meanwhile, noobish perks like Berserker and Firebug that just require spamming mouse 1, can deal with these easily.\n\nIt is also insulting that the developer was so quick to push Microtransactions onto the players' faces, trying to cash in as much as possible on the very audience that once trusted them to develop the potentially great sequel to a game that they love. This to me is utter disrespect, because the game is in Early Access, sharpshooter is not even out (MTs were released even before gunslinger came out), the current perks are not properly balanced, the AI mechanics are super basic, and there are still annoying bugs that need to be fixed. But the cash machine had to be released first.\n\nOn top of that, the developer decided that a Player vs. Player game mode was also more important than working on the Sharpshooter perk which EVERYONE loves and were expecting. I don't know of ANYONE who wanted a PvP mode in KF. I have ZERO interest in PvP in Killing Floor. Four months were wasted working on this ridiculously boring and subpar PvP experience.\n\nLastly KF2 has excessive head bobbing. So much that I get dizzy after playing for a while. the screen shakes too much while running, shooting, and reloading. It's incredibly annoying and makes the game look very gimmicky. KF1 successfully manages to display feedback effortlessly and without screen shaking. In fact, many weapons feel even more powerful in KF1 than in KF2 (Hunting Shotgun, LAR, 9MM, Handcannons, Trenchgun).\n\nHow is such a regression Possible?\n\n\n","April 14","false","222.7"," 137 of 187 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","137","187","5","10"

First let me say that about 90-95% of the items we're shipping with the Trading Floor were made by the community. Second, the developers working on the Trading Floor backend are not the same developers that make maps, weapons, monsters, gameplay, etc. So to put it another way, the Trading Floor in no way delayed or impacted when new gameplay content would ship." - John Gibson aka TWI President\n\nSource: http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2015/11/24/tripwire-on-killing-floor-2-microtransactions-this-is-the-right-thing-for-the-game\n\ndownvote, complain, be butthurt, I'm just informing you of how wrong you guys are 8^)\n\nI'd also like to argue against this:\n\n"Gibson and TWYoshiro have stated several times that TWI is so small they can't complete things faster. How then can you spare the people to work on microtransactions? If those people have nothing to do with game development WHY ARE YOU SPENDING OUR MONEY TO PAY THEM?"\n\nChrist that's ignorant. Those people were bloody art developers, they've already did most of their work so they're getting some more work to do to make the most of their pay.\n\nAs for my real review of this game [you know, the part where I address gameplay while other people focus on MTX], I will say that balancing is a different beast (see Firebug = broken, Support/Demo/Commando = needs buffs) and content is definitely lacking compared to the first game (but it's in early access whereas KF1 has had 6 years of updates, give it some damn time people), yet it's still a ton of fun - melee has been improved and is 10x more fun/engaging than in the first KF game, each character has their own kickass voice actor (that's why we have so relatively little compared to KF1), and zombie AI/animations have been improved dramatically. Maps are huge and detailed, and the addition of running really gives you a feeling that maybe you'll survive that raging FP (probably not though).\n\nApparently, KF2 currently caters more to casual players than to the hardcore vets of the first game (at least what I've heard from my KF vet friends). Not necessarily a bad thing, though veterans may have some trouble tackling Suicidal/Hell on Earth (the second to last and final difficulty setting, respectively). Normal and Hard are IMO perfect the way they are right now - enough challenge for the whole team where teamwork is rewarded.\n\nIf you expect a full game right now, don't even think of buying (or judging) KF2. Early Access for this game, however, has been done much better than other EA games - if you're looking for some casual horde fun (and are escaping from the PAYDAY 2 fiasco - seriously, if you liked PAYDAY's horde gameplay, you'll like this), this may fill that niche you need.\n\nNow some decently major gameplay issues are as follows:\n\n- Balancing. There are 4 difficulties in the game; Normal, Hard, Suicidal, and Hell on Earth. For the most part, any class will work from Normal to Suicidal (depends on your level as well), but for Hell on Earth one would need a specific set of classes to play to even have a chance at winning with pubs. Right now, the weakest classes are Commando, Support, and Demolitions (to an extent). The Commando's "job" is to clean trash zeds more easily than the other perks so that the other classes can focus on their jobs/bigger zeds. The problem is, Commando can only have so much ammo before running out - IIRC, they only have half the reserve ammo that they could hold compared to KF1. Support also suffers from a similar ammo problem, only their ammo cost is too high for the damage/ammo they can hold. Demolitions doesn't have the "uumph" from the first game - at level 20 it gets much easier however, so their problem is reaching a milestone (for balance) instead of not having one.\n\n- Leveling up - not exactly a huge problem, as KF1 had a pretty bad way to level up for some classes (welding door hitpoints and killing stalkers when they were rare as hell - really TWI?). The nuance with this is that the bonus xp (i.e. xp you get for doing your class's job) is much too little compared to the potential xp you could get for killing/assisting on a zed kill. This is most noticable in the Medic class, where literally 4000 hitpoints healed will round to 400 XP given versus 200 zombies killed giving roughly about 3000 xp. Pretty ridiculous, yeah\n\n- Kiting. In the first KF game, you could kite pretty easily instead of camping if you wanted, making the game a little more fresh in terms of strats. Here, however, they input teleportation for zeds when not in their line of sight long enough. Some call it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, others call it fine - what really needs to be done is a huge workover on the whole thing. It's not too noticable in sub-HoE (IMO, at least I haven't seen it being too big a problem), but HoE - where kiting is practically a must - it's messed up the game.\n\nP.S. Most of these negative reviews are coming from many hardcore vets of the old game - if you're a new player or if you enjoyed blasting heads off on Normal, Hard (maybe Suicidal) from KF1, ignore them - some overexaggerate the issues of the game (not without good cause, mind you) + they play (and rightfully criticize) the hardcore difficulties (most casual players won't be going HoE anytime soon, balancing is not a problem pre-Suicidal difficulty)\n\nShoutout the the antiMTX group blindly hating on this review :)","December 18, 2015","true","194.1"," 417 of 622 people (67%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","67","417","622","38","40"

JUST BECAUSE I'M ADDICTED LIKE HOPELESS DRUG ADDICT, AND CAN'T STOP, DOESN'T MEAN I MUST AGREE WITH ALL ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THEY CAME UP WITH TO MILK MONEY OUT OF THEIR FANS!\n\nI'm gonna keep this as short as I can. Here are things Tripwire finds ok to do in what they consider product, that is STILL in development. Don't forget this is not F2P game, this is not even 10 € game, so they made plenty of money just from people who bought the base game:\n\nThe game is clearly designed for consoles, and that heavily affects gameplay for us PC gamersLet me say that the boss of the company that made the game said they will not dumbed down game for consoles, but they clearly did, and anyone, but mindless fanboys will agree. Here is link to what the boss of the Tripwire said: http://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/showthread.php?t=102726\nFirstly, there are many situations in game where you lose control to the game. The most common is when clot grabs you. Now if you played first game, you knew that happens there too but here's where it gets dirty. You lose control to aiming, and your camera turns so you face zed. There is no way you can look around after zed grabs you, you are stuck and game forces you to kill him first. You don't have to aim, because game will just point at him, just click left mouse button, or bash key, and you're good. This happens every time you get grabbed, and all 3 most common zeds have ability to grab you, so you gonna get grabbed a lot. This is clearly because the game is fast paced, and gamepad players on consoles won't be able to move their camera as fast as we PC gamers can with mouse. It's the biggest annoyingance and cheap mechanic no PC gamer should embrace.\nSecondly, they removed welder from menu. Wanna prepare welder while behind chased by fleshy who will kill you if you don't kill him first? You can't because you need to go right next to door to equip welder, because they removed it from inventory menu.\nThirdly, some zeds were dumbed down. Fast perks (medic, gunslinger, and berserker) can move so fast, that they can outrun raged scrake for as long as they want. That means that they can just sprint, shoot few bullets, and repeat forever until scrake dies. In first game it was either you or scrake, you couldn't outrun him. I think this is really bad, and makes scrake a joke.\n\nPaid weaponYou need to buy non-Tripwire game which costs 23 € when not on sale to use that weapon or be lucky to have someone in server that owns that game.\n\nPaid characterYou need to buy non-Tripwire game which costs 23 € when not on sale to use that character. Otherwise it's locked for you.\n\nExclusive features that only 700+ series of nvidia cards can useYes you read it correctly, even Nvidia users with older GPUs cannot use these features. And on top of that it causes stuttering so it's pretty useless. Now I know what you are thinking. Who cares about some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t effects. But they added better gore which makes (yes I mean it) default gore look lame. They also promoted gore as CORE feature of their game, yet they are so money grabbing that they make these features exclusive. And everyone knows that this features could be to some degree avaliable to AMD and Nvidia 600- users as well.\n\nItem dropsChances of getting the most common item that everyone hates aka headband is big, chances of getting crate that you have to pay 2.20 € for to open is even bigger, chances of getting anything else are very slim.\n\nCraftingI made some math and you will need 81 years of constant playing to get 1 rarest item by crafting items that you get 90 % of the time.\n\nMICROTRANSACTIONSMainly random, you buy key for 2.20 €, you get random item. Chances of getting something common are good, chances of getting something rare are low.\n\nSteam MarketYes you can make money! You will get 0.01-0.10 € items that will drop in most cases so good luck. They didn't add market so people can have fun making 3 cents per week. They made it to make money. That's the truth. They obviously make money of every item that gets sold. They even take 1 cent of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3 cent item you sold. TOUGHT LIFE!\n\nAlso they promised refunds on forums during early access. They later removed this to save their wallets, as many people would probably refund game after microtranscations, as many would probably refund. Here's link to quoted developer who later removed his post:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/232090/discussions/0/618459405708087070/#c618459405708091620\n\nOh I forgot to mention. Don't say anything bad about microtransactions, their shady business, or the game itself. Actually ♥♥♥♥ that, don't say anything at all, necause if you do, you will get banned.

Kennedy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KennedyLeon/","2064 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo probably first of all I should say I really enjoyed the original. So much that I actually got all 285 achievements in it, hence you might assume I was quite excited when they announced the sequel. The game is everything the original was with a handful of enhacements to the gameplay itself and several new features like character customization to stand out from another person who might be using the same character.\n\nCore gameplay remains the same, so fans of the original will get what they expected with an added challenge as the difficulty has been ramped up thanks to the new AI and map design. There  essentially are no safe spots and enemies seem to crowd you even more than in the original title. You want a challenge? You will definitely get one with this game.\n\nSpeaking of difficulties, the only thing you ever see in a game with difficulty increase is one or more of the following: Enemies have higher HP, deal more damage or there are simple more of them than on a lower difficulty. Now this game changes everything about this cheap standard as in Killing Floor 2 with higher difficulty, also changes the bahaviour of the AI and the enemies get entirely new attack sets that you never see them using on let's say "Normal" difficulty. The enemies, get more aggressive, attack more, get enraged more and tend to run instead of just slowly walking at you. This is a really unexpected and intriguing development in the game world.\n\nIf we consider the technical side, then even in Early Access the game plays like a finished product. Of course, there is a bug here and there to be found but visuals are impressive and you can't really complain about the performance either. However, be warned that this developer, as many others these days, do not support integrated graphics cards, so if you are on a laptop chances are the game won't work at all for you. Also, the game uses the integrated card by default so be sure to change to high performance in your control panel before playing it.\n\nNow you might wonder why it is in Early Access if it plays so great? Well quite simply it is a finished product with a lack of content. There is quite a selection of weapons to choose from (almost 30) but there are only 3 maps to play on and even though the 4 perks (classes) that are present in the game work perfectly together, those are only 4 of the planned 10 perks in the game currently.\n\nSo in conclusion, the game runs perfectly fine, visuals are great, soundtrack is fitting for the massive killing that happens in the game and amazingly incorporated too, replay value is as high as it can possibly get in a game and entertainment levels are over 9000 but the downside is the current lack of content. Even so it will keep you playing for quite some hours, especially if you are gonna want to level those perks up.\n\nIf Killing Floor 2 was a zed itself, then figuratively you could easily say that KF1 is its skeleton and the new additions are its meat, and we all know the meat is the good part here ;)\n\n\n\nExtra note: For some people an issue might be the lack of player hosting, as you can make your lobby but you need to find a server to be actually able to play the game. I ended buying a private server just to be able to play together with some friends.","April 22, 2015","true","156.8"," 64 of 77 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","64","77","8","5"

It\'s clearly just more pressure for TWI and they\'re steering away from refining their core gameplay. i'm personally all about the PVE gameplay as this is what Killing Floor is all about. If PVP was added after early access, that would have been better; players bought this game since the start for its PVE aspects, not PVP. Just because a game is in Early Access doesn't mean that features need to be added to make use of the community. That is...if there is anyone listening to the community. TWI could easily use discussion boards and forums outside EA for the development of more features...but no.\n\nI\'ve played with different perks through KF2's development but due to how slow the game's been updating i've just been using Commando and have since been playing the game much less.

It continuates the system of Killing Floor 1 with far better graphics, smoother gameplay, more gore, more different zeds, etc. The gunplay feels as good as ever. Dismembering zeds is very satisfying and in slomo it's even better. There are more perks, there is a better progression system, and that's all very good.\n\nBut here is the big 'but', 'however' and 'yet'. There are fewer guns for each perk (only 4 each instead of 5-10 for each perk) which doesn't allow for much diverse gameplay. And, despite all their promises, the game is still in early access and they appear to spend time on other projects (like a mobile version or a playstation version) instead of finishing the game first.\nYes, there are more perks available now than at the start of the Early Access but even after almost a year, the game is still not finished (even though they said they needed only 6 months). We are still waiting for at least 4 perks and updates are very sparse.\n\nIn its current state and because of broken promises, I can't rate this game very high. There is promise, but they screwed over their fanbase and the players who had faith in them, myself included. They should stop mucking about and finish this game already.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eckojay/recommended/232090/","eckojay","Fisto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eckojay/","222 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet me preface this review like most people do by saying that I love the Killing Floor series and Killing Floor 2 is no exception to that. Think of this review as a warning against the greater problem that this game faces, Tripwire Interactive. Tripwire are, and always have been, responsible for the mishandling of this project since its very inception. Killing floor 2 is the beautiful child with plenty of potential that's abused by its parent with a troubling past, Tripwire Interactive.\n\nLet me make this clear. Tripwire Interactive do not respect you, your money, your time, your contributions to the project and least of all, your opinions. In the words of Mr.Foster, "You're just a bag of dosh to me". I understand that this company has needs to generate revenue, after all they're a business. However, this title reeks of project mismanagement.\nFrom the introduction of microtrasactions this game has been less about being a polished and improved Killing Floor experience and more about ways to milk the game for all it's worth before it completely dies out. This hurt the communities impression of the game really heavily and caused a lot of people to abandon the project altogether. While I don't believe microtransactions hurt this game in any meaningful way, the poor explanation of the reasoning behind them caused a huge rift in the community.  The next part of Tripwire's master plan was introduce a player vs. player mode, VS Survival. This is a feature that literally nobody with over 10 hours of playtime wanted yet Tripwire pushed ahead blindly insisting it was a community demand. This was ultimately another way to extend the playerbase of a dying game at the expense of the core experience which many know and love. PvP was thrown out as an undercooked, unbalanced mess at the expense of development time into other, more meaningful features such as promised perks and weapons.\n\nNow for the crux of the problem with Killing Floor 2 and Tripwire, community interactions. Tripwire is easily the worst company I have ever encountered for engaging with their customers. The official forums are little more than a placebo for people to vent ideas and suggestions only for Tripwire to ignore them. Roughly 40% of valid threads of the forums have a developer response and that's on a good day. Tripwire are completely unwilling to be transparent about the development process for unknown reasons and I believe that is what has hurt the community’s opinion the most. Most, if not all developer responses are reactionary after huge community backlash saying 'Here's why we did this horrible feature and we're not sorry'. Many issues would be resolved by quick and simple updates on the development process and all the technical details involved. They can't even manage their stated goal of bi-weekly updates consisting of less than 500 words.\n\nTripwire have managed to judge two mapping contests and yet have offered little to no feedback of the contestants entries. Many of these people spent weeks to months developing maps for Tripwire out of their love for the game. Some were even shafted out of thousands of dollars as a result of sheer incompetence from the lead map designer of the game. Even after weeks of delays to the map judging results, Tripwire could not even spare a paragraph of feedback for any of these maps. They simply arbitrarily placed maps into 1st, 2nd and 3rd while not letting the community know of a single reason why.\n\nSo no, I absolutely do not recommend buying this product as Tripwire do not deserve any of your money. Tripwire are not the most competent devs out there. This was never a problem for me. It's the sheer arrogance and hubris of the company and those involved. To think that they always know what's best for the game is the downfall of Killing Floor 2. All the forums for Killing Floor 2 are a complete hugbox for the developer where any criticism or feedback of vilified by devout fanboys which insist Tripwire can do no wrong.\n\nThere is no way to get through to these devs, they exist in their own echo chamber and your constructive criticism isn't invited. This review marks close to the one year anniversary of the release of Killing Floor 2 into early access and here is what they have to show for it:\n\n-A broken workshop tool\n-Massively imbalanced perks, both ones which have been here since the beginning and which were introduced at a later date\n-Completely redundant weapons\n-A complete failure to uphold standard of community interaction\n-RNG microtransactions\n-Totally sweet PvP\n-Audio that is functioning at a premium\n-An admission that promised features such as crawlers on walls are too hard :(\n-Less Tripwire employees than we previously had\n-Crossover characters\n-A system of graphs that act of Tripwire's overlords and tell them how to make the game\n-Janky player animations ported from Red Orchestra 2\n-3 missing perks\n-An ugly command wheel with 100% less useful commands and 100% more console layout\n-Forums jam packed with Tripwire's finest secutiy and armed thought police\n-Ana Larive","April 10","false","351.0"," 99 of 135 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","99","135","4","2"

I'm not going to review negatively a game that I really enjoy because of MT. As far as I know, as the number of enemies is tied to the number of players, any inactive person will be kicked quickly.\n\nKilling Floor 2 is a co-op game (6 players max) you can play in Solo. You can be a medic (healing), a commando (rifle) , a support (shotgun), a berserker (melee), a firebug (fire weapons), a gunslinger (pistols) or a demo (explosive). Your goal is to survive 4, 7 or 10 waves of enemies until you meet the new boss, Hans Volter, more vicious than the Patriach in KF or the Patriarch himself, revamped and more wanting to be at close contact. Your perks can be leveled up, improving their specific skills. Every 5 levels, you can choose between two skills and activate it (but you can change later, you're not stuck with it for the rest of the game).\n\nI can't really speak for a lot of classes. For me, the commando and the support didn't really changed, like the firebug. Berserker felt a lot harder and medic.... I'm a medic first in that game. And leveling the medic was kinda hard before. I mean, the only way to do it was to heal. But now, the medic weapons can help! And these are more efficient than in KF. At least, I feel like I can do more damage (but still less than a good AA-12 as support) and heal and leveling up to be better! For the demo, I feel like it's missing some more explosive (I'm missing my pipe bombs or the M-32 launcher). The gunslinger is perhaps only wielding pistols but the 500 Magnum is so powerful compared to KF that I've been feeling good with that class.\n\nAnyway, some new weapons are really good in their looks: the medic weapons are in a flashy blue, or the ultimate weapon for firebug is coming from a sci-fi movie. The guns for the gunslinger are coming from the Far West.\n\nFor the maps, they're varied: Horzine labs, Paris, an outpost in the mountains, a manor (well, belonging to the boss), catacombs in Rome, a harbor in Denmark... True, playing these maps is making you an expert on them at the end. But given the enemies (they didn't changed, they just added a new type of zed and they changed the Fleshpound and Scrake behiavor), you'll need to know every escape road. Black Forest is itself a new experience: you begin with a sunny weather before going progressively to a foggy and nightly ambiance.\n\nIf several characters are already present (with a female one included), the new feature is that you can customize them: hair color, clothes, accessories.... They're also from different cultures, which is also nice. You'll find Mr. Foster and DJ Scully as veterans from the first opus.\n\nGraphically, it's beautiful. I can't really say that I don't enjoy the snow or Paris by night or even the extravagant manor. But the fact that you can move chairs, tables, destroy lamps and diving into the dark suddenly (that's Catacombs mainly). And for the sountrack, while some tracks are just a remix of the original KF, others are new and it's really fitting with the atmosphere.\n\nI'm not sure if I did justice to KF2 with that review. But it's better than KF if you love being a medic. At least, hitting a character with the syringue will always result in a heal and not one time on two like in KF!","October 15, 2015","true","246.8"," 132 of 188 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","132","188","7","2"

All Tripwire had to do to make this game great was copy paste all their community made maps from the original plus all the classes, and then create 2 extra classes in this case "Gunslinger" + another class which I'll just make up suddenly "Zedgeist" Half human, half zed, uses abilities instead of guns, controls zeds. Seriously Tripwire, what is this? "Free updates" when the game is still in early access, I'm pretty sure you're meant to take it out of early access first.\n\nLet's get serious but:\n\nPros\n+ Nvidia Flex System, Fluid and Gut physics galore\n+ Redesigned zeds look decent\n+ New game engine\n+ Full reload animations\n\nCons\n- Small "console sized" maps\n- no more trader shop with physical trader, just random pods around the map that cycle\n- new perk system isn't really that amazing\n- slow development\n- "free updates" for an early access game\n\nTripwire really tried making this game appealing to the eye rather than what made the game fun in the first place. Cool the guns are animated at 120 frames per second so when you go into zed time you can see all the bits jiggle on the gun. But is the game itself fun? sure for about 10 minutes at a time, coming from the old killing floor I feel like they had so much potential but they just wasted it on this new engine.\n\nA year and a half later after being on early access, killing floor 2 has accomplished:\n\n- 1 new class\n- 2 new maps, I wouldn't call farmhouse a map but whatever.\n- PVP with Human vs Zeds\n\nLet's talk about that actually the PVP, you see the idea is great! GOOD JOB TRIPWIRE! But you forgot one thing, there's no point being on the zed team. There's no class system for the zeds so you don't get rank 5 fleshpound or whatever, you don't get anything, oh wait, sorry, my apologies, you get a % chance of a gear item dropping for the human team, oh and did I mention that if you do manage to get one of those items they cost money to get a key to open them?\n\nThis is great, seriously, Tripwire literally killed themselves by turning into the smallest ♥♥♥♥♥est company and doing all the big risky moves a big company can do, but something as small as Tripwire no. You can't hire a marketting team for your Early Access game tripwire, you have to FINISH IT FIRST.\n\nAND IF IT'S FINISHED,\n\nTAKE IT OUT OF ♥♥♥♥ING EARLY ACCESS.\n\n1/10 kept me amused for a solid ♥♥♥♥ing day and then some.\n\nI'm actually amused, watching games turn from what they were: an escape from life, ideas of imaginations and fun. Then to watch them roll into this new age of corporation owned games: maximum profits for little amount of effort.","June 1","false","25.6"," 47 of 54 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","47","54","2","0"

Killing Floor 2 doesn't have any of the core features nor the depth that made Killing Floor 1 a great game. For example, every perk in Killing Floor 1 could hold it's own no matter the threat. Soloing wasn't a problem, the game had combos, the zeds were huge threats but could be tamed and killed very quickly if you knew what you were doing. You had no room for error unless you got SUPER lucky. If anyone fails to kill a large zed then that could cost you the whole game. As for Killing Floor 2 all that is thrown out the window. Perks are now very easy to use and most your problems are solved by simply running away (Every perk can outrun a Scrake in Killing Floor 2, mistakes don't matter if you're faster than everything chasing you. In the first game the Scrake was the fastest zed in the game). Also, there isn't a way for a player to show off their skill in Killing Floor 2 since most perks are just trash cleaners, some better than others, most can't even solo the large zeds in a 6 player Hell on Earth game. While Killing Floor 1 gave you tools to take out the large zeds with a wide variety of weapons and express your skill, Killing Floor 2 removes all that completely for the sake of having you go from Tier1Weapon > Tier 2> Tier 3 > etc. It's basically a modern shooter with zeds, perks, and guns from the previous game stamped into a new engine.\n\n\n\n*AS A COMPLETELY NEW PLAYER*\n\nYes, you'll love Killing Floor 2. It plays very modern and it's an enjoyable casual experience if you just want to relax with friends and mess around. The game is in early acess so most of the things i'm about to list are in relation to that. Updates are currently really slow, all the perks from Killing Floor 1 are in the game, and new perks get added like every 4 months. Balancing is a huge issue in this game, there is a severe lack of ammo (IN A ♥♥♥♥ING SHOOTING GAME) around the maps, not to mention the perks that really need ammo have really low magazine sizes. Most games just consist of people using the useful perks because some perks are just horrible for what they were designed to do. The game doesn't have many weapons so you'll pretty much know every weapon after playing a few games. The soundtrack is great, the visuals are great, the community is great (usually very nice people even the good players).\n\n\nEDIT- Forgot to mention a few other things. A broken mechanic introduced into the game a WHILE ago. Depending on how many zeds remain on the map (5 or less) scrakes and fleshpounds will permanently rage and never stop running at you. While you can outrun scrakes, you can't outrun fleshpounds. It's basically GG if you have a remaining fleshpound because it will always catch up to you and the game gives you no ammo. On top of that the other zeds teleport A LOT and so blatantly ♥♥♥♥ing obvious, like in your face obvious, which makes the gameplay just not fun and even more boring. The matchmaking system is (still) broken. New players not using the server browser will join any game no matter the difficulty just so it can place them in a game. This causes a lot of toxic behavior in the community because new players don't understand the difficulties and the veteran players don't like seeing low level players in the really tough difficulties. Vote to kick is also abused, I mean it's not surprising but also very annoying.\n\n\nNot recommending this game because it just has so many problems right now to be enjoyable."You have 1,000 hours in the game how could you say that, how could you possibly not recommend it to someone?" I listed all the problems with the game. Just because you played something a lot doesn't mean you CAN'T recommend it. This game is a grind, people like me just stick around to help the game change. It promises to be good in the long run. I hope it is, but right now it's very lacking and you'll just be waiting most of the time for new things to be changed or added.\n\nJust consider most of the things I said about this game before you make a purchase or not, as everything I said is still present in this game.","February 8","false","080.9"," 294 of 447 people (66%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","66","294","447","13","26"

It WAS great. But now it's just sort of... meh. Sadly, I have to say that Killing Floor 1 beats this.\n\nThe base game itself is fun and all, but it's what they did with it that bashed it down to what it used to be.  From an interview, Tripwire had said that when you buy the game, you get everything that comes with it. Maps, weapons, everything. But what do they do? Add a microtransaction 'tf2/csgo' kind of ordeal. Seriously guys?\n\nAre microtransactions necessarily bad? No, not quite. If it's used the right way, that is. But in this game, they aren't.  It's one thing to put them off to the side and are optional. But here, they flash something like one of the 'crates.'  They say, "OOOO! LOOK AT ME! PAY US MONEY TO OPEN THIS AND POSSIBLY GET NOTHING OUT OF IT."\n\nThe PvP mode in the game is somewhat entertaining.  The major problem is the fact that the Zeds need to be toned down a little bit.  It added maybe 3 or so hours of playablility, but that's it.\n\nWithout trying to get that much into depth, Killing Floor 2 was an amazing game when it traditionally came out.  They promised and they delivered.  But after a while, it just seemed they're not listening to the community anymore. I will change my review stance once I find everything to be satisfactory in HOPEFULLY a few updates.","April 26","false","43.0"," 87 of 118 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","87","118","0","2"

They don't seem to understand what made KF1 so great and have made a "game" that does not feel like KF1 and does not feel fun in general.  Anyone who has played KF1 for a great length will have developed an equilibrium, a certain baseline of expectation from gameplay.  Things that you might expect to do or see in KF2 if you're used to KF1 would be understandable but let's just run through a brief list of things that Tripwire decided to change and have left me scratching my head as to why they chose to do so.\n\nSirens scream no longer pull you towards them or really obscure your vision.\n\nClot variants when grabbing you force you to look at them... Why? Who knows.\n\nStunning was more or less removed and replaced with a cluster♥♥♥♥ of crowd control effects that are on wacky cooldowns and suffer from unreliable usefulness.  Stumbles, and knockdowns and knockbacks sound good, but in practice a large number of skills and weapons can trigger these effects and there's no way of knowing if the random guy on your team is going to waste a stumble on a zed before the fight even starts because he accidently shot it in the leg with his medi gun.\n\nSprinting was added but melee move speed was removed for everyone except zerker.\n\nMeleeing was added to every weapon.  This sounds good on paper because meleeing with weapons is a decent way to cause a stumble on a zed.... except that everyone else on your team can do exactly the same thing which means that when you really need to stumble that scrake who's destroying your face with a chainsaw it's already on cooldown!  So you waste time meleeing the zed for barely any damage instead of shooting it.\n\nMedic gun darts can home in on wounded targets.  Because challenging the medics aim skill instead of just making them dart dispensers is too hard?\n\nWelding doors was removed from the game, well not really but it's the most ruined mechanic in a game I've ever seen.  Doors don't respawn and that's fine, but WHY DO DOORS HAVE A FINITE AMOUNT OF HEALTH?  Nobody wastes time welding doors because there's no telling when they're going to break! What are you thinking Tripwire?\n\nYou spawn with a tier 1 weapon now for every perk at every level.  This fosters a sense of self reliance among new players instead of gently persuading the players to work together like kf1 where you just spawned with a knife and 9mm unless you were level 5 or higher.  This also dilutes the experience of upgrading your arsenal and progressing through the weapon ranks.\n\nMedics get far more xp for killing than healing.\n\nZED DIRECT ATTACKS HOME IN ON YOU.  Let that sink in.  If it isn't a whirlwind from a scrake or a few other things like the husk shooting at you the zed will literally turn in mid air and his meat blender or claw will connect with you as you dodge past him.  I imagine there are some scenarios where they won't hit you but in KF2 the zeds will hit you while you're dodging about as often as the zeds in kf1 would miss you if you were dodging.\n\nZed's have sprinting animations and while it looks cool it makes them a nightmare to shoot in the head especially when coupling in the strange fact that...\n\nZed's no longer seem to focus on the closest player.  Back in KF1 if you had a team set up in an area and a zed walks around the corner he would almost invariably target the closest player to him.  But in KF2 anything goes!  I've had crawlers and clots and husks and scrakes just walk right past me to go attack a random guy on the other side of the room with his back turned to the zeds.  Shooting something walking perpendicular to you is much harder than shooting something walking straight towards you and that leads me to my next point.\n\nEven on the easiest difficulty it's just too chaotic for your average housewife or dad to enjoy.  I played kf1 a LOT and with a lot of friends and family.  Even my wife's mother would play KF1 with us and while we were only on hard or normal she enjoyed it.  Her job was simple "sit in this hallway and shoot all the little guys with your bullpup, if you see a big guy yell for us and we'll come help you"  That ♥♥♥♥ doesn't work in KF2 because everything is sprinting, all the players are  moving, all the weapons take forever to reload or switch so you're never able to hold one spot because you can't weld doors and the zeds aren't targetting the closest person to them so you can't shoot them in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ head.\n\nThey recently adjusted these values but I'm still going to bring it up because it should never have happened in the first place.  The amount of time it takes to switch weapons and reload is waaay too long.  Given the more "fast paced" nature they were going with for KF2 it seems the only more fast paced thing is that the zeds move faster, your move speed when sprinting isn't much different from the move speed in kf1, but in kf1 you could shoot while you were moving instead of being locked into a sprinting animation.\n\nThe maps are bigger, but you're still going to camp in the same 2 spots just like in kf1.  All this means is that you have more distance to travel every time the new trader pops up.\n\nThe only "new" thing they've added that feels balanced and fun is actually the patriarch.  Probably because the pat from KF1 was fun and balanced and they basically copied it over.  WHICH IS WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE FOR EVERYTHING ELSE.\n\nSeveral effects are chance based.  This one really pisses me off, in kf1 if you headshot a scrake with a crossbow and you're a sufficient level sharpy CONGRATS YOU STUNNED HIM.  In kf2 you need to use a specific overhead swing with a certain weapon with a certain skill loadout and hope he isn't using an animation that prevents knockdown AND EVEN THEN IT'S STILL CHANCE BASED.  This blows my mind, you've committed to going toe to toe with a scrake, you've commited to exposing yourself with a long powerful swing that will largely only affect the scrake because it's a forward overhead swing exposing yourself to flanking attacks, you've commited your skill loadouts and even weapon type to this attack that is about to take place, and they still just leave it to the roll of the dice.  You may need to hit a scrake 2 or 3 or 4 who knows how many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ times it'll take, the problem is that there's no telling what is going to happen.  It isn't fulfilling, it isn't fun, it doesn't reward skill or risk and I don't like it.  Also once you actually knock the zed down you activate the knockdown immunity timer so who knows how long you have to wait until you try again.\n\nThe crates.  I'm not even going to bother going into this.  I spent money and time on it because I wanted to know first hand how it is, and it's bad.  Go ahead, go look at my inventory for KF2, I've spent a decent amount of money on this ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI'm sure I'll think of more bewildering changes later on but that's enough for now.  Long story short I think Tripwire were afraid of being labeled as the developer that just made Killingfloor 2.0  so they wanted to stray as far as possible from the original formula  and in their misguided attempts forgot that if it isn't broke, don't fix it.\n\n","May 21","false","169.4"," 63 of 82 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","63","82","2","5"

I was excited to witness and provide feedback in the development of "Killing Floor 2" and was happy to contribute economically, given your previous track record of a solid title lineup and reasonable business practices. However, I was blindsided by your decision to include a complex microtransaction system 7 - 8 months into Early Access while failing to disclose your clearly long held intentions to incorporate this Zedconomy into the game.\n\nI exhort you to reconsider your business and monetization approach to a more open, honest endeavor where a healthy relationship of mutual respect with your fanbse can be achieved. I really wanted to enjoy your game and had high hopes for the successor of KF1, but the addition of a key crate microeconomy is an unacceptable practice in a game at this price point. Even though DLC style microtransactions would be expected and understood, given KF2's success with this model, the current/planned model is ridiculous due to its insistence on restricting the player to utilize the key crate RNG microeconomy on one hand or the inflationary Steam Market on the other. This is unacceptable, especially when you take into account that there is already an in-game store in place. Please reconsider the Zeconomy, I cannot in good conscience support or recommend your titles anymore until you fix this broken system and address these issues with your fanbase.","June 2","false","28.4"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","40","45","2","0"

I joined in on KF1 only a few years ago, but it quickly became one of my favorite games, so of course I hopped right on the KF2 hype train. I didn't expect a perfect game upon release of early access, but I was at least confident that it would turn out all right. Boy was I wrong. I can excuse the slow progress for new content; they're a relatively small company. But there's a lot of things that they did that really don't make sense. They claimed they wanted to balance the game over time, yet they had no method of making small balance patches until a month or two ago, resulting in often terrible balance between major (quarterly) updates. They added a pvp mode that nobody wanted. Sure, they say the game mode development team made it, but what does having two modes imply? It implies they either need to balance guns with consideration for both modes, or create separate balance changes between modes. Both solutions result in requiring more work. Microtransactions wouldn't be so bad if they weren't pure randomness with crates and keys. As it is right now, your only options for getting that one accessory you want are either to spend lots of dosh hoping for what you want, or to buy the item from other players for more money than its probably worth. It doesn't help that in recent months, Tripwire has only added fuel to the fire. A majority of their recent patches have given the impression that they are prioritizing pvp, and forum moderators are becoming trigger happy with the bans for anyone critical of their game. I still get the impression that Tripwire intends to finish this game, and that slow development (at least recently) is partially due to the fact that they lost developers and are having a hard time replacing them. However, a long series of bad decisions and lack of communication has resulted in a snowball of (understandable) negativity in parts of the community. Now, they have resorted to hiding this negativity as much as possible, both on the steam discussion pages and on their own forums. There's so much more I'd like to list but for the sake of brevity, I hope anyone who reads this has already gotten the point.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long tangent. Back to the actual quality of the game itself: the visuals are great and everything looks amazing compared to killing floor 1.  Game balance is poor, but hopefully that gets fixed eventually. For me, KF2 lacks the replayability of KF1, in its current state. I don't know exactly why, so don't ask. Basically what you should take from this is that if you liked KF1, it doesn't mean you'll like KF2. And now for the bottom line: Is KF2 fun? It's fun when playing with friends (whether they're real life friends or ones you made over the net). But when those friends give up on the game and uninstall because they've lost faith in the developers, it stops being fun. In other words, don't get this game if you want to join public groups with randoms.","April 28","false","48.5"," 54 of 69 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","54","69","0","0"

Why again? Because they should've learned what happened with Rising Storm, RO2's DLC that literally killed the game.\n\nPros:\n- Decent graphics.\n- A lot of gore.\n- IMO, weapons sound good.\n- New perks and rebooted old ones.\n- Metal for music, which by the way blends nicely with the game.\n\nCons:\n- "Early access" is the new excuse to avoid adding content to the game. It's been 11 months and they added a few maps, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons and some perks.\n- Removed the workshop to make a profit out of it. Did Tripwire actually thought that adding CS:GO's or DotA2's market system would work in a game that lived for so long thanks to its workshop?\n- Balance is crap. Some perks aren't even worth using them.\n- No skillcap whatsoever. If you want to play harder difficulties, you have to level up your perks, else, you're completely useless.\n- Just a few bunch of maps, not too many options for weapons (unlike vanilla KF1 and its mods).\n- A new, brainless feature that makes Scrakes and FPs run forever if the zed counter is low. In other words, death sentence if you didn't kill them before.\n- Optimized? This game? Hell no.\n\nAll in all, Tripwire ♥♥♥♥ed this game up for good, in fact, they ♥♥♥♥ed their reputation for good. It's going to be a year since they launched this game for 30/40$ (I don't want to remember honestly) and they added nothing but microtransactions.\nEven if they make this game better in a distant future, I'm not buying ♥♥♥♥ from Tripwire anymore, unless they admit that they've robbed us players. 4/10","March 3","false","13.1"," 292 of 456 people (64%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","64","292","456","12","18"

I got a few hundred hours out of it when it was fun trying to beat HoE with teamwork, and the balance of the perks was decent.\n\nBut I was expecting to get more than 1k hours out of this game, like I did from Killing Floor 1. Killing Floor 2 doesn't have any interesting combos to kill big zeds, and perks like firebug and berserker can get away with killing them without even aiming.\n\nThe developer has been gradually messing up the balance of the game and doesn't listen to feedback, which is the exact opposite of what they promised to do during Early Access.\n\nNow the pinnacle of Tripwire Interactive's middle finger to its playerbase is spending 4 months working on a PvP mode which very few people asked for, instead of working on the much awaited sharpshooter perk and balancing the existing perks. I personally have absolutely no interest in PvP in Killing Floor.\n\nI expected a challenging game to follow up KF1's greatness, with similar techniques to kill zeds with flinches, mini-flinches, and finely-timed combos; but KF2 is nothing of that. The skill ceiling is pretty low, and it will get boring fast.\n\nKilling Floor 2 is a dumbed down version of KF1 to appeal to the soon-to-come console playerbase, and keep the braindead item collectionists content through its Microtransactions platform.","April 8","false","494.8"," 295 of 461 people (64%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","64","295","461","16","33"

I decided to get this after watching gameplay videos, and watching the short film that got me in the mood.\n\nThe characters you can play have their own voices and can be customised more now. You can also chose one of four classes for added perks. This allows you to add your own influence on any game. These classes can be levelled up as you play each game.\n\nAfter several waves of enemy types, which are the same as in the original game, I think this was a case of if it ain't broke don't fix it. You get to fight the boss. This is the hardest part of the game and can also be the most frustrating, There is only one boss type at the moment, although I hope they will add more, with different tactics needed to beat them. The current one will spam various gas and explosives and will charge you to drain your life force. You will need to work as a team to defeat him.\n\nThere are currently three levels and they all look great and have unique designs. The weapons are varied enough, with the new Medic weapons adding some class.\n\nThe servers are quite active already so you won't have any trouble finding a game.\n\nIf you want a co-op game where you shoot stuff with new friends but don't want to be bothered with side missions and a story then this is the game for you.","May 1, 2015","true","33.1"," 55 of 71 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","55","71","3","0"

I had a previous written review from the patriarch release but since my complaints have been fixed recently i had removed it. However with that said i still cannot recommend Killing Floor 2 in it's early access state.\n\nAs of April 8th 2016 Tripwire has released a new "content pack" for Killing Floor 2 which adds two new weapons, a new map, a bunch of fixes and a controversial PVP mode into the game. As an early adopter of Killing Floor 2 in it's early access phase i can say that i am not longer interested in this game and the direction it is now heading. When i first purchased Killing Floor 2 i was expecting a more updated Killing Floor with some new additional features that would improve on the issues the original game had. While it has done this in some aspects it has failed in others.\n\nThe main controversy right now with this rrecent update is the inclusion of a "PVP" mode into the game. I can quickly say that this mode just is not fun to play at all. It's rather unbalanced, glitchy and seems to have been quickly put together at the last minute. I do not understand what tripwire has been doing in the past 4 months they have had for working on a new update but if it has taken them this long to release 2 weapons, one single map and a buggy PVP mode that has no thought of balance then i can safely say i have given up on tripwire. The funny thing about the inclussion of this mode is that nobody asked for PVP mode to be included in Killing Floor 2 nor was anyone exactly interested in it to begin with. A poll from the Killing Floor 2 forums below can clearly show this. Instead of working on this PVP mode tripwire could have instead placed more time into working or finishing the Sharpshooter perk which everyone has actually been asking for but they instead to release a broken PVP mode that is not even properly balanced or even fun to play....\n\nhttp://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/showthread.php?t=100553\n\nThis has been a rather disappointing update and if it has taken them 4 months to come out with just this then i can asume that Killing Floor 2 won't ever reach the end of early access until the late end of 2016. I would seriously recommend anyone who thinks about purchasing this game wait for the final release.","April 9","false","197.7"," 142 of 213 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","142","213","3","0"

Seems as though not only are the review bombers spamming bad reviews on this game, but they are also conspiring to thumb down reviews they disagree with. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=572810488 Keep this is mind readers when you are wondering the truth about this game, a group of 1000 protestors are manipulating the reviews to their agenda. *Note to steam moderators or tripwire, if this screenshot violates any rules then I can remove it on your call.\n\n\n*IMPORTANT UPDATE I got a free head band from these "HORRIBLE" micro trans. I honestly could not care less about anyone that hates this update. If I can get free hats idc, I am golden. There is now also a section talking about how mts work in this game.  Back when the review was first written they were not out yet, so now its there. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=570776497\n\nThis game is currently being review bombed due to the micro transaction "crisis".  I feel I must try to counter the complaining and point out a few things about the whole movement that I find stupid.  This is a very good game and to knock the whole game down over one trivial thing is stupid.  As someone with 100+ hours on this game and all Hell on earth achievements(at the time of this review) I would like to tell you why this game imo is very fun.  Without people to counter this non sense I feel the kf2 community will fall in numbers and that is something I will not sit by and watch.\n\nFirst off kf1 has micro transactions, so complaining that they are now a thing is very stupid.  Honestly kf1 had much worse microtransactions because they actually sold weapons rather then just skins, which is just straight up pay to win.  They also complain about how its bad because its in early access, but i say to that "since when'?  Honestly compared to every other early access game I have played this is by far the most polished and regularily updated of them all.  Take a look at the garbage dump early access games on steam (such as dayz) and tell me its fair to call this game early access.  There is zero game breaking bugs, its runs extremely smoothly(on my pc), and they JUST ♥♥♥♥ING UPDATED with new maps, a new boss, character, and a new class.\n\nThese review bombers like to point out how scummy it is that instead of updates they are putting in micro transactions, but that is simply not true.  Like I previously pointed out the game was just updated and there is will be even more getting added later.  The thing they are not getting is that the micro transactions need to be tested and fixed before full release just like every other aspect.  They would whine just as much if micro transactions got added after release filled with bugs.  As far as I can tell these bombers are just looking for excuses to complain and since their is no justification to their anger they make things up.  Trust me, someone who managed to put 150 hours into an "unfinished" game, that this is an extremely fun and addicting game.  Not only is it fun, but its probably one of the most challenging PVE type games out their.\n\nLet me explain how these micro transactions actually work, so you can get an idea of how they work from someone who doesn't hate them.  I am not really that big into micro transactions, but they aren't really a bad thing either.  Well anyways there is a store now on the game where you can buy keys to open crates filled with goodies.  If you are familiar with tf2 then you already know how it works.  Like in tf2 you get crate drops and item drops which you can then sell for real life money to people on the community market place.  Or instead of selling them you can equip them your self and open the crates with the keys to get even rarer items.  There is a quality system to the items and some items will be worth alot more if you want to sell them, so if your lucky the game can pay for itself.  Currently all the bonus micro transaction items are only cosmetic and offer no stat bonuses like in more scummy games.  The devs have stated that they plan on maybe putting new weapons in the crates, but you won't need to get the weapons in order to use them.  As long as anyone in your game has it then you can use it too, so its sounding like the devs are going to make this fair.  Back in kf1 the dlc weapons were not shared with people who didn't buy them, so its good that tripwire learned from their mistakes on that.\n\nEnough bombing the bombers though, let me give you a quick run down of why I think this game is worthy of your mighty dollar(hopefully I expunged all the ♥♥♥♥ slinging from your mind and you are ready for some positive reviewing).  Like I said before its basically not even an early access game, to me it feels more like a finished game with a steady stream of free dlc.  If you had ever played kf1 then you know that kf1 continued to add maps after its release and to me I think thats what kf2 feels like.  The game has a very smooth feel to, idk how else to say it.  Its just every thing you do from moving around, to shooting, and clubbing zeds everything just feels right.  Its the opposite of how dayz or Arma feels if you are familiar with those excremate piles. On top of the smooth feel to the game its also very fun and challenging.\n\nThe game takes place in a sort of post apocalyptic world where mad science experiments have taken over and its your job to kill em all. The game is a wave combat type game where their is 10 waves and a final wave with a boss to fight(like nazi zombies but astronomically better).  Each wave gets progressively harder as more difficult zeds start to spawn in and  pound your group to shreds.  I dont really want to spoil the surprise of seeing these meat monsters for yourself, but just know they are truly badass!  Then when you beat all the waves the boss shows up and hes meaner then all the previous baddies put together and even calls on them to assist him.  Right now we have two bosses and they may even add in more in future updates.\n\nAnother neat feature is the classes that you can choose from that all play and kill in their own unique way.  Right now we got a pyro, demoman, melee guy, assault rifleman, medic, shotgun support, and dual pistol classes.  There will in the future be a martial artist, a swat guy, and a sharpshooter.  Each class gets their own weapons to buy during the waves and as they level up you get skills to choose from like in a rpg.  My personnal favorite is the Berserker/melee guy because I like to charge in first and slam some skulls, but I think everyone has a class that fits their style of preffered combat.\n\nSo basically this is an amazing game and I fully reccommend you ignore the bad reviews because they are only bring one bad thing(in their mind) up out of 100s of good things.  If you are anything like me(a gamer) then you will love this game!  Hell you might even end up liking the micro transactions too, it sure works for csgo and tf2.  You play the market right and you may just end up paying for the game and more with the drops you sell on the market, so good luck!","November 25, 2015","true","176.0"," 1,024 of 1,663 people (62%) found this review helpful 122 people found this review funny","62","024","1","122","178"

I don't recommend this game because of the way it's being developed. though. Also, I can't seem to join a game 90% the time, It always happens in this and Insurgency, Payday 2 and Chivalry. They work when they ♥♥♥♥ing want. It keeps disconnecting me. )\n\nOkay, this one hurts a bit. I absolutely loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of the first Killing Floor game. It's still one of my favorite games on steam to this day. When this first got announced, I was completely hyped (Bad,  BAD idea nowadays when it comes to the gaming industry.)\n\nTripwire insisted that they were going to focus in this game completely, and that it was "Early Access done right." I mean, with Tripwire's record, I totally wanted to support them, so I got this the first day it came out. The game was lacking content, obviously, because it was still in Alpha. It was extremely fun, still. The graphics were gorgeous, the gameplay had changed a bit for the best, adding certain features that KF1 would benefit a lot from, like heat seeking healing darts, multiple spawns across the map, and parrying, and it was frantic fun. The soundtrack is still glorious, even if I'm not a fan of the bands that come in this game. I usually play with the vocals turned off.\n\nTripwire said that this game would come out of early access on December 2015. Sounds like a plan, right?\n\nWell, sadly, it didn't go as planned.\n\nFirst, we found ourselves dealing with a game that kept getting updated each 2 months or so. A single map, a new perk, and you gotta wait a couple of months again for new content. This made the game boring, because if you wanted to level up your perks, you had to do plenty of the same over and over and over. Well, we understand, right? I mean, developing a game like this takes time. You can't rush perfection.\n\nSadly, this is far from perfect. We got ♥♥♥♥♥lapped one day. After the whole Payday 2 skin fiasco and it wanting to be what CSGO, and later, TF2 became, Tripwire announced everybody's favorites. Cases. ♥♥♥♥ing, cases. Yes, the ones that you get as drops and you gotta pay to unlock. I mean, what the ♥♥♥♥? I hope you guys have a separate team for developing these cosmetic items, because if not, ♥♥♥♥ YOU. Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ off. You slow down your progress, on a game that was promised to come out of early access on ♥♥♥♥ing December, 2015, and you give us this? We don't really need economy on an unfinished product. Oh, but that's what every gamer wants, right? Skins?\n\nAs I said before, this hurts. I ♥♥♥♥ing love Killing Floor, and I wanted to love KF2. Yet, the way it is right now, with microtransactions, lacking updates, lacking content, and with the greedy attitude of the developers, I wouldn't recommend supporting them right now.

Both parts were made by Tripwire Interactive. Killing Floor is basicly a survival 6 man co-op shooter where the task is to survive waves of zeds ( zeds are the monsters). Killing Floor 2 comes with the same idea but much more faster and fresher. The zeds got smarter and they spawn from all directions and if you run away you can be surprised by some. Also the environment takes a big part in KF2. When you throw grenades for example in a room full of lights than  the lights will go off and the room will get completely dark.\n\nKF2 comes also with a really nice graphic. The game was developed with the unreal engine 3. The maps are full of blood and corpses and there are coming more as well during your game. Heads and arms are flying when you shoot them. Its much more brutal than Killing Floor 1.\n\nIn my opinion you cant do anything wrong with this part and you should buy it if you are a fan of co-op survival shooters.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nGameplay: 10/10\nTeamplay: 9/10\nMaps: 10/10\n\nThis game is just outstanding.\n\n9.5/10 For what are you waiting for ?

I was a huge fan of the original Killing Floor and I've always supported Tripwire in their endeavors in making KF2. However, I have to write this review with deep disapointment for Tripwire.\n\nTo start off, Killing Floor 2 at the core as a game works and is fun.  It's good traditional horde based combat with stellar animations, visuals, and gunplay. That fun is very limited though, as this game has been in EA for nearly a whole year and filled with nothing but broken promises.\n\nContent is still missing and there are numerous issues/bugs that have yet to be patched: the release of SWAT/Martial Artist or any information, Support Specialist is severly underpowered and is outclassed by Gunslinger, Demolition has been nerfed to the ground even though you had to get Level 25 to make him useful in the past, the skill trees lack any variety/depth and do not make you feel like you're customizing your class to play the way you want to play, maps are filled with exploits making them incredibly easy to beat even on the highest difficulty, functionality of the game has drastically dropped and now the game  is filled with hitches. With many more numerous issues that are too lengthy to add to this review.\n\nThey also introduced a cash shop in the game to a title which was already lacking so little content from the get go. Now while I do respect all the wonderful artist who sent their items in and have been approved, I cannot support them in this buisness practice as it detracts from the goal of the original games content and a finalized product. It's hard to support this game and its artist when updates only come around every 4-5 months which bring minor content that can be finished in no time. How can you expect one to buy skins/cosmetics to keep me entertained if I've completed nearly 90% of the content? There is hardly anything to go back to.\n\nThe addition of a VS mode has not helped in anyway in making this game fun for the community. It's a tacked on gamemode which very little balance surrounding it. Because of this, balance issues will be distributed towards fixing this game mode that lacks any signifigance outside of being just a tacked on cliche'. Ultimately it's a gamemode nobody asked for.\n\nLast but not least, broken promises. The devs, while friendly, have broken many promises that the community was told they would receieve. One of them in particular was making crawlers (a spider-like enemy) crawl on surfaces within the game. When asked when they would receive it, TW's response was "It's too hard, we cannot do it." .\n\nI defended this game for a long time; but today I've had enough. It pains me to say this but you should not purchase this game anytime soon until the full intial release from early access. It's a 30 dollar game with potential that is ultimately stopped by a development crew who doesn't care enough to release things in a timely or well designed/balanced manner. I wish all purchasers good luck as we wait for another 4-5 months for the next update and all potential purchasers to wait for a very big sale or a free weekend.","April 7","false","234.4"," 77 of 110 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","77","110","0","0"

For now this review will focus on what is in the game at this current time.\n\nA quick list of Pros and Cons: Pros:\nGood Graphics compared to the first game.\nGreat community of players.\nExtremely addictive!\nA decent amount of classes to choose from, each with different perks and 25 levels.\nVery well optimized.\nExtremely gory and fun with friends.\nSmart working AI\nDecent amount of weapons currently in the game.\nCurrently 4 highly detailed maps. (2 smaller maps and 2 larger maps.)\nIt's just a great game to throw time into.\n\nCons:\nSome community members can be uncooperative which can ruin the game.\nThe last boss can shoot and damage you through walls at times.\nThe Scrake AI can be tricked into spinning around and not attack you.\nTo be fair, there are not many cons to this game.. It's such a good laugh even when you are playing by yourself and all the cons that are there are to be expected for an early access game.\n\nThis brings me to the big question of if the game is worth the money Tripwire are charging for it?\n\nI believe that this game is worth every bit of what they are charging for it, you get a stable game with extremely addictive gameplay and a development team that you can rely on to update the game quickly. I would rate this game but it is in early access and giving it a numbered rating at this stage would be silly, just buy the game and play it already.","June 17, 2015","true","89.3"," 69 of 97 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","69","97","5","3"

Undoubtedly, it instantly blew me away and fulfilled all my expectations.\nI'm not a friend of Early Access Games or how the community likes to call them "E.A." titles.\n\nThis game is one of the few games I love to support even though it's only in Early Access. Once you are in the game, you will notice an inevitable few bugs and glitches, but despite this, overall the game is more bug and glitch free than other games which do not go into Early Access at all and get spammed with "Day-one-Patches",  so it is at least for some users playable.\n\nKilling Floor was amazing ever since it began as a Mod for Unreal Tournament 2004. Then, the first actual Killing Floor game came out and I was absolutely blown away by it. Most Devs can't keep up to their first game in a Series but Tripwire Interactive managed to do so. They even stepped up in Quality of this brilliant, new game.\n\nKF2 is amazing and worth every penny that I so gladly paid. I enjoyed every minute in this game and I am very excited looking forward to its full release with more Weapons, Characters, Perks, Maps and much more!\n\nI can recommend this game to everyone who loves to kill Zombies and play as a TEAM, and yes, I am writing the word 'team,' in uppercase letters, because in my opinion, without a good team, you won't enjoy it as much. You will wholeheartedly love this game if you follow the statements listed above.\n\nKilling Floor 2 is already pretty bug and glitch free (as mentioned above) and I love that the Devs stayed with Unreal Engine 3 they got used to this version and did the best they could. Even more so, they forced the last drop of Graphic quality out of it and the result is of course, purely stunning.\n\nAll in all, if any of the below things listed are for you all I can say is buy this amazing game!\nZombies\nTeamwork\nNice Graphics\nBig Guns\nBeautiful Designed Maps\nEnhanced Gore\nCharacter Selection and Customization\nEnhanced Perk System\nFast and easy to understand Gameplay","April 26, 2015","true","556.9"," 43 of 55 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","43","55","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wittyurl/recommended/232090/","wittyurl","UnluckyDuckie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wittyurl/","298 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nKilling Floor as a series sits on top of a very simple premise for a video game: There are a number of monsters, you kill them, you get better gear at a checkpoint, you fight a bigger number of monsters next round and you repeat this until you get to the biggest of them. The first title in this franchise executed its basic premise using an almost perfect formula, mixing player skill as well as knowledge to provide a thrilling experience on all levels of play for something that would otherwise become a monotonous and repetitive task.\n\nSadly, Killing Floor 2 distanced itself from that formula, applied most of its budget in the art department, kept bad things about the first game, worsened others, and, instead of listening to feedback from people who actually invested their time to analyze the title, developers began to build it around its errors that catered to new players, mostly to keep their own egos intact:\n\nAiming for a quicker and modernized experience, the game's pacing was increased; yet, somehow, the "killing" aspect was made slower:\nCharacters can now sprint and cover an entire map within a minute or so, but their ability to switch weapons and their reload speed were drastically reduced (or at least not kept up to par). Ironically, the overall size of the maps were also reduced due to (what I assume are) engine limitations, which would otherwise cause severe optimization issues, or, better yet, make some players frustrated because they weren't paying attention to their distance from the checkpoint as they were killing everything.\n\nSo, you move faster now, but the maps are smaller and the things you can do in them are more limited, which when put together, in my view, makes for the definition of counterproductiveness both from a gameplay and development standpoint.\n\nEnemy spawning and speed were tweaked to "reduce boredom":\nEnemies will spawn anywhere at anytime whenever a player is not looking. That corner right next to you that you just checked? Yeah, it's full of spiders now, that can move and surround you faster than you can say "arachnophobia". If you somehow manage to get away from that, worry not about feeling bored from being alone for more than 5 seconds... the game will teleport the spiders to the nearest obscured corner in your very path! Nevermind that door you just welded shut behind you, your casual real life logic does not apply here... well - except for that one part where the doors break down and don't come back magically - i mean.\n\nThis is very "exciting" on lower difficulties where you might as well play blind folded, on higher difficulties however it will just force you to sit against a wall in a corner of a map with natural chokepoints that have you simply sit and point n click until this torture modernized experience ends, taken that long gone are the times where you had to think a little and make a combination with weapons in order to defeat certain types of enemies or keep welded doors closed to control the flow of the, now spacetime continuum manipulating, horde.\n\nGrinding mania 2 electric boogaloo:\nHaving to spend 50 hours to get a character artificially buffed enough in order to tackle on harder difficulties in the first game by reaching Level 5 wasn't enough, now you can spend 50 hours+ getting a character artificially buffed enough in order to tackle on harder difficulties in the second game by reaching Level 25... that only gets any significant strengths every 5 levels, so Level 25/5, or just Level 5.\n\nNevermind how much padding this adds into such a simple minded game, the sheer amount of time necessary to get the full experience (current 7 out of 10 classes so 350 out of 500 hours of grind currently) turns an otherwise interesting pastime into a chore.\n\nClear difference between Strategies of Masochism x Optimization:\nCertain character classes (Shotgun Support class) take much more player effort as well as in-game credit investment to get on the same playing ground of other, simpler classes (Flamethrower Firebug class).\n\nThe Skill ceiling for the game has a clear cap that is not rewarding nor too interesting to explore if not for sheer masochism. Taken the game is now about running a lot and thinking little, Classes that can move the fastest have simply the easiest time in the game because they don't get hit as often (Morphine junkie Medic) and coincidentally also have some of the highest damage output weapons available (Melee tank Berserker, High caliber revolver wielding Gunslinger). Slower classes still have the "strongest" weapons in the game but the time necessary to output their potential stopping power outweighs the time they usually survive in order to even do it. With the teleportation and grinding, it might as well be a waste of time to not have the fastest (Berserker), dumbest (Firebug) and most boring (Medic) of classes to play as in high difficulties if you want to "beat" this bloody PvE game.\nEarly Access games are difficult to formulate a solid review for, taken that things are still being made and could go from poor to exceptional and vice-versa at any given time. But, after almost a year, I feel Killing Floor 2 took this development route not for receiving feedback and offering a more lax update schedule, but rather establish a fantastical advertisement campaign bloated with ambition.\n\nThe developer straight up ignores the portion with the most player feedback (Steam Forums) regarding both mechanic suggestions and bug reports, having game breaking issues reported early on remain unaccounted for as well as worsening (parry bug on KF-Outpost and now all over the new maps) among other things. They have one (1) moderator and a community manager who might as well not exist to supervise the whole thing with well over +1000 customers while their "pray-to-get-into" private forums where people are somewhat listened to effectively creates a catering to a certain minority who might as well not play the game (they added collectibles to their maps due to "demand". who even asked for this?)\n\nUpdates take roughly 3~4 months, and with the content and tweaks I've seen I conclude the guys making the road map are either schizophrenic, listening to nobody in particular and making changes that make little to no sense, or simply have no idea where the game is headed; however, they remain so sure of themselves that it will be just so great, they even decided to put up a ready-to-go cash shop and gamble crate system for a game that is barely halfway done.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n\nIf you're looking for a game to invest time into, this is currently not for you and will never be taken that it is not being developed with your type in mind. It's a simple, very flashy game to casually sit through and blast the crap out of ugly things away non-stop with little room for any sort of strategy beyond that. You get better artificially, and any difference between average and experient players either doesn't exist or will be patched out in the next update.","December 19, 2015","false","507.9"," 829 of 1,368 people (61%) found this review helpful 75 people found this review funny","61","829","1","75","137"

They are an important part of a team and they are there to get face to face with the big zombies to give them some @ss kicking. Berserkers are all about timing while the rest of the team clears out the rest of the zombies or go about there specialisation. There's a medic, support, commando, fire and demolition specialist.

There's plenty of issues that should be fixed or changed such as the fact that enemies at the end of the round are permanently enraged and the issue that enemies like to teleport around, especially in front of you in corridors so you get locked into a death trap. The amount of guns at the moment is just sad, with only one obvious upgrade to the gun you start with the variety in the game isn't good. Classes, or "perks" as they're called in Killing Floor, are unbalanced and having a "balanced" team can often be worse than spamming a single overpowered perk. Not to mention the game is downright repetitive as hell right now with the lack of content.\n\nWith so much work still left to do and almost a year into development I'm only left wondering how they have the nerve to  put in microtransactions. With a game as hyped as this the development won't go any faster with additional cosmetics nor won't you see any of that money back in upcoming updates.\n\nMy suggestion?

The PhysX variant (FleX, an extremely advanced PhysX extension) is brilliant when it works, but only makes the game even more crashy than it already was. (EDIT: It works much better after the last patches and such. Still needs some optimization.)\n\nProbably the biggest note I can make is the serious lack of content. This game is pretty barebones, and a lot of the perks lack the power and utility that the perks in the original had, giving every enemy an uncomfortably spongey feel even if you are landing the headshots... Even with the improved gunplay, this feels awful.\n\nThis game plays and feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ free to play game. IT EVEN HAS MICROTRANSACTIONS. IN EARLY ACCESS. THAT IS RIGHT, MICROTRANSACTIONS IN EARLY ACCESS. Not only do we basically have day 1 DLC, we have  MICROTRANSACTIONS. I could forgive the rest of this game's misses and issues were it not for the fact that this dev team has invested time in creating a system of microtransactions rather than creating content for their unfinished, poorly functioning game. This is disgusting, and completely disgraceful.\n\nFinally, a TL;DR list of things.\n-Unimpressive, bullet spongey zeds with no real clever ways to kill them outside of cheese glitches that are numerous. This does not mean they are hard, what it does mean is that they are just as boring as they were in the last game.\n-The game is crash-tastic. If you plan on taking advantage of Nvidia FleX, the physX extension they use, don't. It will make the crashes worse.\n-Some serious optimization issues, probably related to the crashing.\n-A lot of the classes just plain suck, even for their niches.\n-10/10 would uninstall again.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME. PLAIN AND SIMPLE. IT IS NOT READY FOR A PUBLIC AUDIENCE, AND AT THIS RATE, NEVER WILL BE.","February 5","false","8.0"," 54 of 75 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","54","75","3","7"

Better animation, graphics, and….er….. well....still the same monsters....pretty much same guns....maps look the same...pretty much…..well….pretty much the same game! In fact the new one even  looks out of date! Just not so much as KF1.\n\nIf you don't know KF then it's a simple plot. Well, actually, there is no plot. You have a gun, there are lots of bad things that need shooting. Everything you shoot you earn money to buy more ammo to shoot more things. It's as simple as that. Simple, but amazingly good fun. And you'd better like gory, ooky stuff becuase there is literally dumper truck loads of it in this game.\n\nSo we have an updated version of the original game, which is still very much the same game. It's a really promising start because they haven't completely messed it up, but at the moment there isn't really enough new stuff in there for me to fully recommend it. If I were you, I would wait a little while to see how the game develops. Provided they add lots of interesting stuff then it's going to be a classic, but if they are too afraid to introduce some nice new stuff then...well....it will all come to nothing.\n\nRecommended? I will say yes becuase it is a promising start, but you might like to hang on a bit longer to see how it goes.","April 22, 2015","true","113.5"," 51 of 70 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","51","70","5","4"

I wanted to see the first game to continue being worked upon and saw KF2 as an unnecessary sequel.\nThis is, what, almost a year later and we've yet to get a finished product from devs supposedly 'working hard' on this game? I actually am EAGER to see new free content for this game! I want to see it, Tripwire, I do, but you just won't give us any! First the microtransactions, and now I come back to the steam page looking for news about updates and I see 10 dollar dlc that includes one new character AND three cosmetic items? Their website even showed a lever action rifle almost complete back in February, and a map they already had screenshots of, yet I can't find any news of them adding either into the game.\nWhat are they doing, if they aren't working on this game that's been Early Access for over a year? Fallout 4, my favorite game of the Fallout series, released outside of Early Access, had patches released quickly to fix their game. Heck, KF2 doesn't NEED to be an Early Access title to release updates, I think they're just using it to gain 'cred' with people looking to buy a game, as a way to say "We're definitely working on this game" even if they aren't.\nI don't even dislike this game, I'm just bored with it because there's a lack of new content. Sure it's fun, but when you go MONTHS without anything new? With your preferred class almost completely leveled and no new classes to play? How am I supposed to keep playing this game with the same old content? Every game gets boring if the developers fail to keep the content interesting (or allow the players to keep content interesting by making their own, but I don't feel like I could trust the devs of KF2 to let that happen without making everyone pay for player-made mods, given they put microtransactions in an Early Access game).\nSo please, Tripwire Interactive, please work on this game. Make us the updates, give us the content you've promised, make me want to play your game again! It sits in my Steam library, collecting dust because you won't update it, and I don't want it to be there collecting dust! I want it to be a game I can enjoy for weeks without growing bored, like Fallout 4!","March 7","false","46.4"," 77 of 114 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","77","114","4","4"

Massively wrong!\n\nKilling Floor 2 is without a doubt a massive step up with huge potential to come.\n\nOkay, first lets do the basics!\n\nControls: They are easy to grasp and simple to use, but sometimes can be a little twitchy and weird to control but otherwise they are good for this game and play out nicely.  You practise and get the hang of it.\n\nGraphics: They are PRETTY damn sweet.  I mean they are really really nice! I cannot complain about them at all and it makes the game really really good to play with some nice visuals... The way the fire burns on enemies and the bullet time actually looks like bullet time, some good stuff.\n\nAudio: It is point and click right? No! In KF2 the game has the best sounds of reloadng, shooting, monsters exploding I ever heard.  Really, you are running, you reload and you hear each click of the gun, then slowmo "zoooom" sound kicks and you shoot... Beautiful stuff.\n*Then there are some freaky noises in the game that make you spin around looking to see WHERE THE HECK IT CAME FROM*\n\nPerk system and upgrades: This is a huge change ingame, the XP you get shows up and now you have a whole new system towards making your character better, there are certain perks, guns, upgrades and styles that will make your character a certain way when ingame which is great step up from KF1 where it was just rank up and auto unlocked. This is rank up, points to spend and work harder for the next.\n\nImproved features I noticed so far apart from the game itself: We noticed that the invisible women who run at you from KF one... THEY ARE INVISIBLE now for a reason and extremely hard to see until the last second, making you always on your toes.... The Siren who screams at you.... Screams a shield around to protect and propel and suck your life at the same time making her hard to kill.... The monsters in general will duck, swurve and dive to avoid some rounds while onslaught attacking you.... The shop is no more and the pod has arrived and in some ways I miss the shop but then I do not.... The monsters are a lot faster now, they are not so slow as before... The shooting now has proper spray and you need to aim down the sights to get a proper shot because ammo is gone so fast in this game... This is just a tiny pinch from the game.\n\nThe game itself and my experience.\n\nMy partner and I started our first game together... We run, jumped, crouched and hid from what we knew, we thought wow *bang bang* "over there" We screamed *bang bang* "we are are awesome at this game" I said, she goes "Yeah we are" so we fight the first few waves.  Third wave arrives after the blood and guts of a crazy bible preist massacre, we slayed everything down, and we feel proud! Then all off a sudden there is loud roar, rumble and scream, something never heard from a KF game before... The hairs on my arm stands on end, I turn to my partner with my eyes drawn wide and say "Did you hear that? It sounds big" She turns to me with a face of fear and says "I do not think I like it now" so I reassure her, we can do it. We are in this together, I got your back!!!!\nSo we battle on into the night like a bunch of crazed physco's with blood flying around and then the noise that shook us comes again, but only this time... He arrived!  We tremble and let every single round we had out at him! We run! We run some more, we look back and we notice we have a following of mad crazed monsters with the big massive monster who is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at us, we get scared, turn and fire... We barely make a dent in him before we again need a reload and run away screaming like little school children scared crying "mummmmmy" We get enough ammo, we battle through until the final boss where we fight and fight and fight and fight.... Then the boss says "How about my new chemical" all I see is a green gas on my screen which I thought was healing, but I was wrong.  It was some sort of fart gas that killed me instantly, then my partner who is still alive running away! She returns in force to only be grabbed and ALL the life sucked out of her! Day one complete!  *We left this day with terror, tears and sadness that we failed to kill them all, we where to scared to go on after the ordeal of madness*\n\nWe then return a few more times to play the game but that is another tale!\n\nThe only problem I had with this game is creating a match... There is no option to create a multiplayer game like the original KF. The only options are Create solo offline, matchmaking or server browser.  There is no I game create your own and that for me is annoying because that was what made the original amazing.  I hope this is only an early access thing, but I will update this review when the game is full release.\n\nAnyway I hope this review helps you all!\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes, it is worth the price they want and if anything some more too.  Really the game is REALLY REALLY good and a massive step up from KF1.","April 24, 2015","true","122.1"," 39 of 50 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","39","50","7","0"

I like it, but it gets boring quickly, and some of the classes are just dull.

This wasn't implemented when it first came out into EA, and then they suddenly included it. It kinda feels like they're spending more time trying to market the game than actually finish it.\n\nI never really played much of KF1, but I know that veteran fans have been let down so much. Steam discussions for KF2 are just people posting about how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off they are.\n\nThis game could have been - and might still be - something decent.

The gameplay is great, and it's very polished for an early-access game. But the sheer lack of content is killing... well, Killing Floor.\n\nYou'll wait a couple of months for an update, only find out that they fixed some minor bugs that you've never experienced, or made minor balance changes, it is beyond ridiculous. What makes the situation worse is that the implementation of microtransactions has not helped the situation, the cosmetic items available through the marketplace add nothing to the gamplay at all.\nWhen new content is actually added to the game, it's fantastic. But given that we get so little and over such ludicrous periods of time; I've found myself playing the updated content to death, getting bored of it(because there isn't a great deal) and then repeating with the next update.\n\nNow, to be perfectly clear and lacking of bias; this complaint is my only MAJOR reason to recommend against buying the game. Since I bought the game, some time last year, there have been three major content updates(using the word 'major' very loosely here).\n- the first added one new map\n- the second two maps, and two perks\n- the third, two maps, one perk and a new boss\n\nAs the game so stands, we have eight official maps, seven perks/classes, and two bosses - each with a 50% chance of spawning at the last wave. The problem is that once you've familiarised yourself with the core content in the game now, the developers at TWI simply cannot keep up with the demand, and as a result additional features are being burned out faster than they can be produced. Which all in all, leaves me pretty bummed out.\n\nI've played 70 hours, I'd say that its good for perhaps 20-40 in its current state. If you believe thats value for money, by all means purchase the game.","February 24","false","70.9"," 85 of 130 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","85","130","5","0"

Recent reviews have focused on the devs giving out warnings and banning people from the forums for exibiting angry behavior in response to the lack of promised content being released in any kind of a timely manner. This is a problem. Once devs go down that path of desperation it often means a game is going in the toilet. KF2 might be.\nI'd really like to recommend this game based on my experience playing it both solo and with friends. It runs really well, the graphics are great, the gunfire feels good and popping zeds doesn't really get old. Sadly, just like so many before me, I can't support Tripwire while they're acting this way. I hadn't intended to write a review until the game's full release, but I'm starting to realize they're milking this early access thing for everything they can possibly get out of it, and treating their playerbase in an unfair and condescending manner.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ForeverSquishy/recommended/232090/","ForeverSquishy","ForeverSquishy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ForeverSquishy/","361 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTo be honest, this game is really, really good. Really good. So I'm guessing you're wondering why I've given this a negative review. Well, let's start with what I like about this game.\n\nPros:\n- Gunplay feels really good and solid for the most part. It feels like the guns really do have recoil on them, and if you can't control that, you're in for a bad day.\n- Character lines are funny and entertaining, but not overused: they scream to move when something big comes, or you can taunt if you're feeling gutsy.\n- The few TWI maps that have been released are amazing. Manor and Paris are easily my favorites. They look good, weather effects look damn good, everything looks damn good.\n- The perks work well with on perk weapons and off perk weapons. That being said, it always helps to have on perk weapons. One of TWI's designs was to have more off perk weaponry used. But more on that later.\n- The enemies (or ZED's) are really well done, their models are damn good and the way they attack is superb. Going up in dificulty enables the ZED's to have different attacks than normal, some of which can be fatal very quickly.\n- The music is awesome (it's some nice heavy metal mixed in with some death metal; but more on music later).\n- The difficulties do make the game more difficult instead of making everything a bullet sponge like in the original game.\n\nNow that I've said what I like about this game... Sadly it's time to give the long list of things I don't like. And that's a long list indeed.\n\nCon's:\n- Once you get really good with a weapon it feels weak. Going up in levels in your perk tree makes the weapons more powerful damage wise, but it feels like I'm using a pea shooter instead of the Varmint Rifle. Very few guns retain their 'badassness' throughout the levels.\n- Support class is easily the most OP class in the game. The standard shotgun can be used until wave 3/4, where you can buy an AA12 and just wreck with that. That's what I do on HoE (Hell on Earth). Even a new guy can easily last an entire game with just the starting shotgun and then buying the AA12. It's lack of spread is rediculous, and it's fire rate is easily faster than any machinegun. It can take out a Fleshpound in roughly 11-12 rounds. No other perk can kill off a Fleshpound that quickly. Even the final boss is a wimp with 2-3 AA12's blasting into him.\n- The characters themselves feel a little clunky, and sprinting is almost like a waste of time (it does let you move a little faster though...) as bigger enemies, cloakers and crawlers can easily catch up to a sprinting player. Taunting does nothing to the ZED's and just makes you feel like an idiot when you do (I love taunting though, some funny lines right there) as it doesn't enrage ZED's nor does it make them target you. A potential use for taunting could be being used as a tank or for drawing cannon fodder.\n- TWI take their sweet, sweet time with updates. And to be honest I haven't played this game since the mannor update because there isn't enough content. It feels like TWI are relying on the modding community to create maps to pass the time whilst they create a single new one. It's been 3-4 months since the last update. As such, there is an extreme lack of content that many people will get bored of very quickly (3-4 weapons per class, 4 classes so far, 2 more to be added in soon and like 4 maps in total). The community made maps are really good, but it's also nice to see a map made by TWI. TWI, I feel, need to realise that for EA to work, they need to be constantly releasing smaller sized updates, perhaps an update every month, instead of 1 massive one whenever they feel like (as stated earlier, it's been many months since the last update). I also beleive they need to start letting the community know rough dates (month of August, for example) for when updates are coming out. We are kept in the dark about a lot of things and whilst the community smashes the forums with posts about updates, nothing is done about them and no word from the developers themselves. (I know that they are against setting dates but a rough estimate for an update isn't too hard).\n- Perk weapons are still used by their perks. If I'm support, I will rarely ever use a varmint rifle to pick off enemies at distance because it's easier and quicker to close the distance first. And besides, every perk can hit at distance if you're good enough. I would rather just sell off any found weapons that aren't used for my perk.\n- ZED's can currently teleport and this is my biggest issue. If you run away from a ZED, they will teleport to the nearest spawn point to you and randomly appear. This means that you can be on Burning Paris, right at the bottom bridge, run into the subway with 1 ZED left running behind you, turn a corner and it is now in your face. I find this to be appaling as it means I have to constantly dodge a single ZED at the end of a round to get ammo, or even worse when you are trying to run away from a scrake and it just appears behind you and saws into your body. At present, there is no desire from TWI to remove this feature (however they do want to fix it up a little). I think that is the most damaging part of this game because it has caused me to stop playing after a single match where I just die from a stray ZED.\n- All the music is Christan Metal (Demon Hunter mainly). And whils't that's all well and good, it all feels like it's missing something from the original game. You do have the option to put it to instrumental version only, which is what I have my music set to. It certainly feels closer to the original music style, but still not quite.\n- There is no tutorial as of yet for new players to get the hang of the game. It's all done via an online loby or playing solo (both of which can be hard to play in). I'm no fan of tutorials but it'd be nice to see TWI doing something to support the new players instead of just throwing them into the fray.\n- In regards to pick ups, if you have full ammo and run over an ammo box you pick it up anyway, making trolls online abundant as they stop everyone from grabbing ammo. Unlike in the original KF, if you ran over an ammo box it would simply tell you that you have max ammo.\n- Much of the gameplay feels like a direct copy and paste of the original game (not that that's always a bad thing), but it feels likethey have just simply modified the original game to look a little better and thrown some fancy new perk bonuses in. That may be due to how the weapons work or just overplaying of maps, I don't know.\n\nRight now it simply feels like a Killing Floor 1.5. There is a major lack of content (however it IS early access and people need to be more aware of that) and there are many issues I have with the game itself. Once a few of my cons have been fixed (namely the teleporting ZED issue and more frequent updates) I'll happily change my review to a positive one.\nBut right now it's a 4/10 for Killing Floor 2, but could easily be changed to a 7/10.","July 26, 2015","false","68.6"," 457 of 765 people (60%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","60","457","765","31","15"

Zeds got some new moves and animations, new perks system is quite interesting. They finally added sprint so you don't have to hold your knife to run faster anymore. Reloading, despite the fact that it's less realistic than in the first Killing Floor, is much better now. You don't have to deplete entire clip before reloading to save some rounds, now you can reload whenever you want or have to. Despite of over detalization levels looks and feels more complex (to be honest I played only Biotics Lab and Burning Paris) and I really like them, a huge improvement of environment over the first part of the game. In Killing Floor 2 the boss also got some new tricks to get rid of you which, to be honest, I found quite unefficient or maybe I'm just good at this game. You just can keep running from him and dodging his neurotoxins bombs or whatever they are. ZED time is so satifying, it doesn't just slow the time as it was in first Killing Floor, it also have som nice visuals. I really like the visual effects in this game, although I can't enjoy them at a proper level because of lack of a decent graphics card but even at lowest settings the game looks gorgeous. Almost forgot about soundtracks.. I f*cking love them!\nThere are a lot of differences and improvements over the original Killing Floor but I'm too lazy and tired to talk about all of them.

Gameplay is fun, but becomes very repetitive grinding levels for perks. Basically, you have a few maps to play and a limited number of guns that will work with the perks. There's not much variety in terms of gameplay.\n\nWith the prison, farmhouse, and black forest maps added, this game has a bit more variety. Being early access, this game has a lot to like, but is not complete yet. It looks like they are still adding at least one more class. I'd like to see weapons usable by other classes with some benefit or some sort of crossover style.

However, the problem that I have is the lack of active updating. Almost all the changes comes with major content packs that includes patches too.\n\nSo, I checked out the latest update by playing in the Prison and tested lever-action rifle (winchester) and the crossbow. Lever-action rifle seems like a first weapon for sharpshooter to have, so it's not good against bigger zeds but crossbow does a lot of damage and you can collect the arrows back so theres that. Otherwise I don't see why you would use these weapons since you won't get exp. I recommend to use crossbow against big zeds and boss and ALWAYS use the other weapons to ensure you'll get exp from kills.\n\nI won't be testing PvP most likely because I'm not really a fan of playing against others in a survival co-op game. Cool addition but unnecessary. It's just VS survival mode, like in Left 4 Dead games.\n\nOne last thing. Many have been saying this, but I will still say it. It's was a bit shady thing to add microtransactions to early access game. Game isn't even finished and they decided to do that. They did add a crafting system so you can craft 10 skins/items to get an item of next rarity. But since drops are rare (in my playthroughs) and mostly they are USB (crates) and to open them I have to pay 2,49€ as usual or they are just a freaking headbands. F2P systems have been forced to a chargable games only to squeeze more money and as usual, they are not customer friendly due to RNG crates......\n\nI might sound a bit a**hole-ish by saying these, but I'm dissapointed because I waited for sharpshooter for sometime and for some reason PvP is more important than actually finishing the base game mode after all the perks have been added.","March 9","false","111.8"," 309 of 515 people (60%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","60","309","515","35","30"

Tripwire's taken a beautifully simple horde shooter and turned it into an MMO.  Lots of unspoken resistances, weaknesses, nuances, effects, etc.  The best part about it?  They don't even give you the numbers on anything.  If you're going to create an MMO Killing Floor, at least have the etiquette of following MMO format, telling us how much damage we deal, what our percentages are, what the resistances and weaknesses are, etc.  MMO's give us numbers so we can work out what is the most effective way to use our abilities, without hundreds of hours of blind experimentation.\n\nThere's nothing less satisfying than laying a C4 trap somewhere, luring big guys into it, and blowing them to kingdom-come, and watching nothing happen.  Oh btw, there's a 50% cumulative damage reduction on each consecutive explosion (they don't tell you this anywhere).  Break the realism and add some crap mechanics.  Great design.  I'm doing a pretty smart tactical maneuver, but I'm 'too smart' for the game and they have to nerf it.  You've got a bad design, then!  Change it!  Tripwire has been talking about adding options and freedom to the way we play, and all they are doing is creating a meta; the exact opposite.\n\nIf you want to know what the real meta strategy is for killing a Fleshpound as a demolitionist (according to what I've read): it's to apparently lay a c4, then blow it up, then throw a stick of dynamite on their head to stun them (not sure if 100% chance), then use a rocket launcher on them until they die.  How am I supposed to know that's the magic strategy without reading someone's guide?  If I unload rockets at him, which I would think is the way to do things, since it's a rocket launcher, I just die.  It's not really intuitive or realistic.  Back in KF1, we had a six shooter grenade launcher, and the strategy was to throw down a grenade or two, and then unload the launcher into them.  It was intuitive and simple.\n\nMaybe if I had a lot of feedback and numbers I could piece strategies together.  But the game tells me nothing, it just kills me if I do it wrong, which is a really bad way to do things.  I didn't even know a stick of dynamite stuns a Fleshpound, because the game tells me nothing.  I'm pretty sure it magically starts happening at a certain level, after the point of experimentation.  I  concluded that dynamite does not stun a Fleshpound and was just a quick crowd control device, between reloads.  Then again, maybe I just never landed it on a fleshpound's head.  It has a strange trajectory, throwing like a big upside-down U.  I'm used to throwing grenades in a much straighter manner.\n\nEven Dark Souls has the decency to tell you everything that is going on, so if Tripwire is trying to create a new Dark Souls, they aren't doing it right.  You know exactly why you die, in that game, and that's why players don't mind.  We learn.  This game, there's nothing to learn, because I don't see the programming or numbers at work.  It's blind experimentation.  I only learn if I happen to get lucky and do something right.  I don't even know how much damage my weapons deal, because they just show us some arbitrary bars.  Every weapon is like this.\n\nAnyways, let's get back on track.  The game is becoming grossly convoluted, for a team horde shooter.  I don't like wasting time on super complex games, because they demand way too much of my life.  KF1 was simple, with a bit of complexity.  It was great.  The only weaknesses and resistances I knew of were the Fleshpound weakness to exposives, and the scrakes resistance to explosives.  If there were any more, I didn't need them or they were irrelevent, because I completed most of the game without them.  Most of the skill in that game revolved around headshotting things, and then having the class that countered the bigger guys, which takes a little bit of knowledge.  Sharpshooter was the notoriously broken class, as you had to learn where the broken hitboxes were, in order to headshot and stun things.  Still, it was intuitive, despite the broken hitboxes.\n\nLast point, going back to my theme:  KF1 was not a numbers game.  It was a skill game.  How fast were you at killing?  If you wanted to kill the fastest, you needed to headshot things.  The only numbers you learned as you played were that Fleshpounds were weak to explosives and Scrakes were strong against them.  Everything else was pretty much, shoot it in the head, and watch it die.  Kill fast enough that the horde doesn't reach you.  There wasn't any meta-game to learn.  It was beautifully simple, and the challenge was getting better accuracy, and knowing how to maneuver oneself so that you don't die, if the horde spills over a bit.\n\nKF2 is about damage types and armor types: microwaves, fire, bullets, slashing, bashing, explosive, poison, armor, immunities, resistances, cumulative damage reductions, buffs, blah blah blah.  They also tell you nothing, I've gained all this information from guides and research.\n\nI didn't buy Killing Floor 2 for this.  Not changing my review until Tripwire realizes they have strayed far from the original and made a very convoluted mess.  Then they have to fix it.","May 6","false","266.6"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","33","43","0","1"

For those who don't know, the last perk to be added was Gunslinger in December 2015. Almost 6 months without a new perk, and we're still waiting for the RELEASE DATE of it to be revealed. Unbelieveable. Oh but don't worry, since then Tripwire have spent resources developing and releasing an awful pvp game mode that only a small amount of people even wanted.

Do not support what Tripwire is pulling right now. This is NOT "early access done right". I could write an essay about how much of a disaster this entire ride has been, but it isn't even over yet.

We got microtransaction on such an early time, but honestly I could care less of it.\nThis game can actually be fun with friends, but it will get rather boring quickly which Killing Floor 2 as of right now has little replay value constantly.\nThe forums is just a trigger happy ban fest where everyone gets banned, but there's no exceptions to it. If you are having a civil conversation or not, banned.\n\nNow this game feels unbalanced for a number of reasons and I am sure some can agree on it. The updates feel like they come out when they want to do it, and it comes out in a long time. KF 2 has been in early access for a good year now which makes me sick, and it tells you what kind of shady things Tripwire is up to.\n\nPROS\nIt could actually be fun with friends\nSome sort of diversity in perks.\n\nCONS\nThis can get so boring and dull so easily\nNot enough content\nSHADY practice by Tripwire\nRiddled with some bugs.\nThe list goes on and on\n\nMy score for now is 2/10. This game was poorly handled and I am ashamed that what Tripwire has been doing do the community and the game. I fully reccomend to  IGNORE THIS GAME","May 16","false","27.4"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","31","40","0","2"

But again it is still in Early Access so maybe that will change!  And they have released the SDK so maybe a modder can change this unfortunate mishap.  Now let's get to the game in general.\n\nIs it like KF1?  Yes and No.  Same kind of gameplay, same people, same zeds, even some of the same maps....but that 2 makes a BIG difference as you will notice MORE blood, MORE skins and gear options, MORE amazing graphic, and lastly MORE ways to kill and dismember every single thing in your way!  And I'm not talking about just the zeds.  The lighting in the room changes as lights blow out.  Zeds can spawn out of manholes right under your feet or even fall into them LOL.  And with the added animations, you will need to actually 'know' or 'feel' the mechanics of the game to perform perfect headshots now.  Even though I still see noobs wasting like 3 pistol clips on a headless bloat o.O lol (wtf, right!?).  You will have to play the game for some time to get the new game mechanics down since they are similar to KF1 but still very different as well.  So far I've spent around 100 hrs to get to know the maps, spawns, reaction times, DIFFERENT ZED MOVEMENTS FROM NORMAL TO HOE, and even different camping places on some maps.  I now feel comfortable swaying away from the 'group' and killing about 100 zeds on Hard on any of the 4 perks to finish out the wave.  The end boss is MUCH more challenging than the Patriarch, but after knowing his 'system' then it get a little bit easier.  But soloing him is not an option unless you read a guide or just get lucky.  The different skins and voice overs are very enjoyable to me since they are all different voiced and say different things each.  I really look forward to all the goofy ones to come in the future :)  All in all, I think this game was worth the $40 pricemark even for an Early Access game.  I play it on a daily regular basis and it's probably only 20% done!!  The gameplay is fluid and alot less glitchy than other EA games I've played.  So I'm pretty sure it will be well worth the price upon final release.","May 13, 2015","true","447.1"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","36","49","6","0"

Tripwire has tasted the MTA(Micro transaction) drug and is not coming off of it anytime soon.\n\nSummary:\nEverything is lackluster, they removed tons of good things and did not say if they'll be added back in, the trailers are basically faking things that should be in the game but probably never will make it because Tripwire is spending all that time developing KF2 for Playstation and making skins that you can get if you buy keys.\n\nI really tried to like this game. I liked it a lot at first. But with the horribly quick decline in co-operation from Tripwire, that turned to very heartfelt disappointment.\n\nAnd the worst part? They tell people to "Get gud" at playing KF2 even though the perks are horribly imbalanced and they only ever stream (if they stream) on normal difficulty with level 1 perks. And here is the really horrible part: They refuse to communicate.\n\nDo Not Buy.\n\nWith the recent update that has added the versus mode, I tried a few matches again today and I will try some more with friends to see if it is more fun, maybe some co-ordination with friends will make it more interesting.\n\nWhat I can say so far is that, it quickly devolves in to campfests, the things that the developers said they would like to avoid. Looking at you Berserker wall.\n\nIt is not very thought through until the end and still needs an incredible amount of work before it can really shine. This is especially shown in how the game operates the versus mode.\n\nYou are spawned somewhere away from survivors and need to find your NPC zeds to try and blend in with the rest.\n\nThe game is not going to show you where you could possibly make an impact as a zed player. And most of the times your allies will just run in to a shotgun and die instantly.\n\nAgain, do not buy for now.","March 9","false","93.2"," 82 of 129 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","82","129","4","5"

Theres simpley just no way I can justify its slogging pace, questionable actions and business coices.\nI used to love holding down a fort in this game, but as of the release of its newest spawning system mobs just spawn in a painful unrealistic manner that punishes you for so much as turning your back for 3 seconds on what was once a clean hallway to realise a duo of fleshpound are halfway down the hall.

There’s a lot of hardcore gamers that want to be able to do combos and interesting kind of tactics. We’re trying to add that into it.”\n\nPlayers spent a lot of time to really really learn the game, and it turns out to be very disappointing for combos. In its current state KF2’s gameplay is a regression. The right mechanics are mostly there but balanced in a way that fails to give rise to the kind of emerging tactics that made KF1 unique and appealing to dedicated players. Instead it is merely a generic FPS in which you spam at Zeds with your weapon of choice until they die.\n\nKF2 may entertain new players enough to be worthwhile. The weapon animations are great and it has other such superficial qualities that stand out. However at its core it is a very casual shooter with little tactical depth. I do not recommend KF2 to players who expect more than a very casual experience.

Because honestly, this game is great.. It's just that in the last year, tripwire went from properly updating the game to just adding gimmicks that no one asked for. honestly, i can forgive the microtransactions (for now) for all they do is cosmetic purpouses. And i could probably forgive for how long for updates to come out, if they actually delievered.. Like for example, Return of the Patriarch was a great update. However, this recent update (Revenge of the Zeds) was pretty ♥♥♥♥, for all it added was a PvP mode that is barely replayable, an okay map, and 2 weapons. The thing that made this update ♥♥♥♥ is that they still have yet to release the sharpshooter perk.\nOverall, I intend to play this game more and i still have hope for this game, even if it's a year overdue of it's release.\nIf Payday 2 is seeing some form of improvement, then surely this game can pick up.\nalso, no matter how you put it, microtransactions on an Early Access game is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid.","May 2","false","269.8"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","1"

For instance, there are still classes missing (the sharpshooter, believe it or not, still isn't here), and the game is horribly imbalanced in comparison to the original (which while it has some balance issues of its own, was not a complete mess like this is).\n\nUpdates have ground to a halt, practically speaking, which makes no sense; even if it is a small team, the amount of things added or changed in the recent months is staggeringly low. Even more disturbing is that they've taken more time to add unneeded garbage to the game then actually make the game, like adding a pvp mode that is not only imbalanced in favor of the human team, but also is something that was NOT BEING ASKED FOR by the majority of the playerbase.\n\nI'm sure the other "feature" they shouldn't have added, the RNG crate system, has been talked about extensively elsewhere. Nonetheless, it is in my view a terrible step down from the former "buy what you want" model of transactions. Because knowing what you are going to get with your money is just awful huh? TF2 and CS:GO have it, and while it is annoying in those, at the least TF2 is Free to play, and counter strike is a finished game using it to justifymaking further content. This isn't finished; it shouldn't have a microtransaction model like this if it is an unfihished, purchasable/non-free to play game.\n\nThe reason I am making this review now is that I checked back recently to to see if anything changed from all of this, and not only has nothing changed, but they have recently started BANNING people on their forums for civil conduct. It reminds me of the travesty that was Starbound's forum when they banned a crapton of people off of their forums for no good reason. And ofcourse, those who are in support of the game, but are breaking the rules, are left nice and comfortable under the admin abuse. Disgusting.\nI wasn't one of the victims as I didn't partake; just watched it unfold, and found some more nice examples in other steam reviews.\n\nFor one last kicker, almost no one is playing it. There are sub 1000 people on this game as of this review.\n\nDon't buy this game. Tell others not to buy this game. Don't. Buy. It.\n\nPlease don't; I don't want to sit around knowing someone else is about to buy a mess of a product that will likely not be finished with the care and respect it should have been given by the developers, with a company that censors opposing critical thought, when there are clearly better games with better developers out there. Nor do I want to have to acknowledge people may be buying a game which almost no one is playing.\n\nJust get the new Doom, or Shadow warrior 2 later this year.

I perfectly know I'm going to be downvoted by a hord of fanboys, but whatever, I can't let customers be unaware of what's going on with this game. Here are the list of the pros and cons :\n\nPros :\n\n- Great music\n- Violence, gore, guts, and blood everywhere\n- The guns ''mostly'' feel good, with some exceptions I'll cover later\n- The game has a good base gameplay.\n- I like the new zeds compared to KF1.\n- New Zed Time features, with a nice use of colors and sounds, etc.\n- Great graphics, it's stunningly disgusting when you're done with 10 waves of flesh-eating clones, with the whole map stained with blood.\n\nCons :\n\n- Terrible balancing, some weapons are just not used at all, or plain useless (looking at AK12, or eviscerator). The Demolitionist perk is still useless after months, appart from the last level perk called Nuke which is filthy overpowered.\n- Slow updates, the game should've been released by now. Like making 4 ♥♥♥♥ing weapons take a month, and the perk takes 2. Balancing updates are scarce.\n- Too few weapons (4 per perk), with a linear progression in the guns, divided into 4 tiers of guns, the 4th tier being the most powerful most of the time.\n- Bullet spongy ennemies, and EXTREMELY fast ennemies on Hell on Earth, you simply die if you don't have a perk with bonus speed or a very solid team. About bullet-sponginess, Fleshpounds take ridiculous amounts of damages, deflect bullets when they charge, and are mostly not dodgeable.\n- Microtransactions in a non finished game, featuring VERY expensive skins which are half worn, just take a look at the market, this is a joke. Of course, it's RNG decided, with keys and cases à la CSGO.\n- Terrible community, particularly looking at the forums, both Steam ones and Tripwire's ones, fanboys are crawling from every corner, this is pathetic. No constructive criticism is tolerated, since you're going to be called a noob undependingly of your skill level. Criticism about microtransactions, on the other hand, will get you directly banned, sometimes permanently.\n- Unbalanced PVP.\n\nNot worth the 27€ if you ask me. Of course I had some nice fun, but the updates are slow, they implemented MTs in a really bad way, and not enough guns are there to offer different shooting experiences. The base gameplay is here, but it feels empty overall, after 50 hours, besides grinding to get your classes to level 25. Very disappointed of TWI, I actually doubt I'll buy something else from them, unless the reviews are extremely positive.","May 1","false","123.3"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","4"

I'm sad to say that this is not what I was expecting.\n\nThe absolute lack of content and dumb mechanics (trying to run away from a raged fleshpound? Let me just teleport it right behind the next corner) are one thing. Lowering the skill ceilling by a great margin is what I was upset about the most. You need to dispatch of that scrake/fleshpound quickly? Better pray the the whole team just unloads their AA12 at it! The speedkills in KF1 made the game for me. They took skill and practise to master, and were really rewarding. Uppercutting scrakes or making fleshpounds turn to red mist with a couple of nades, stunlocking scrakes and managing the fleshpound's rage mechanic. It didn't make the game too easy in my opinion as like I said, to succesfully pull them off you would need some skill and practise. Messing up one speedkill could mean a wipe of the whole team when the raged scrake/fleshpound just tears through you and your teammates. But this is absent in Killing Floor 2, the enemies are just bigger and bigger teleporting bullet sponges, which makes the game A LOT LESS FUN.\n\nThe game is in fact in Early Access, yet people paid money for it, expecting "early access done right", if this is early access at its finest then I am really dissappointed with Tripwire. I though early access would mean that we get to play our long awaited game a little bit sooner, with a little less in it but with new contend pouring in. Hey, its not like TW had to re-invent Killing Floor, the formula was already there, in Killing Floor 1! But instead we got yet another cash grab. Killing Floor 2 ladies and gentlemen, new maps? New perks? New zeds? Maybe, somtime, just wait a couple of months, mkay? But look at this fancy hat! It's GOLD! And you only need to spend more £££ to get it in a UNFINISHED game! Quick! Buy buy buy our keys!\n\nI understand that making games requires funds, but why start a project when you don't know if you can support it all the way through? Did Tripwire start working on KF2 and thought "Well, we don't have the money to complete the game, but lets hope people pay for early access, we can get more funds that way and maybe actually finish this game"? TW already got out money from the early access, and now they say that the microtransactions will help them with future "free DLC" as they call it. That would be alright, IF the game was out of early access. I find it insulting that the money the people paid for this game is used to implement MICROTRANSACTIONS instead of actually delivering a full release. Finish the darn game first, then implement ways to have the £££ flowing in.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed playing the game, granted, it's not as good as the first one, still it attracted me for a long time. But the direction it's heading in is just not right in my opinion and I will not be supporting this title anymore. I am afraid that KF2 will meet a smiliar fate as TF2, CS:GO or PD2, a microtransaction sh*tfest, where the game doesnt really matter anymore. Because, who cares about actuall gameplay as long as you can get a cool, ingame hat, right?\n\nTo add insult to injury, Tripwire is censoring the forums. Discussions where people do not agree with the dev's actions have been locked, and the people posting have been banned. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS SINKING SHIP!\n\nTo conclude, I would advise not to purchase this game, as it seems it is on a downward spiral, leading it into oblivion.

I will do my best to update this review as it gets launched or when it gets updated.\n\nRight, so where do I start? Initially, when I heard that this game got released in Steam as an Early Access game, immediately I decided not to touch it at all. The swarm of crappy, nonsensical tats that have been released in Early Access have embossed its first impressions in my mind as a section that no casual gamer would want to step foot in ever. As presented by many reviewers who have done their best to expose Early Access to their viewers like TotalBiscuit and Jim ♥♥♥♥ing Sterling Son (I had to say that), Early Access had been labeled to these reviewers as what they are. Games that are in an incomplete state and should only be bought by those who want to support the development as it goes on. Unless you are enthusiastic about the game, no casual buyer should purchase Early Access games.\n\nAnd then, Killing Floor 2 got released in Early Access. (And there was much relenting...)\n\nI saved my money to buy fault milestone emoticons but when reviews after interviews with my friends who purchased this game educated me about what this game is, I decided that the emoticons I want to buy can give itself a flying toss into Grand Canyon for all I care. And so I purchased Killing Floor 2, with full awareness that this game is in an incomplete state, which as far as I'm concern, I do not encourage myself to buy.\n\nAnd I enjoyed it to my heart's content.\n\nAlright, let's get this straight. This game is in fact incomplete. There are many things missing and features that aren't in the game yet. For one thing, from the date that this review is published, there are missing weapons, some minor bugs and just a handful of maps that you can only play over and over for so long before you drop onto your desk, with your saliva escaping your mouth like a stroke patient. But nevertheless, the game, in its current state, is enjoyable and almost feature-complete. You can even lie to yourself that this game is feature-complete and you will fall for it. (But, really, let's not do that)\n\nWe'll start off with the gameplay aspects. Right from the get-go, this game is somewhat different than its predecessor, Killing Floor. And yet, despite all that, it feels quite similar. There are weapons from Killing Floor that made it in here, like the Beretta M9, the L85A2, the SCAR-H, the Mossberg Pump Action, lots and lots of old weapons can be found in Killing Floor 2. And yes, the previous zeds you kept fragging in Killing Floor makes it here as well. The perks are also identical to the one in Killing Floor. However, one thing about the gameplay is that the zeds now have more animations and furthermore, their AI isn't donkey-♥♥♥♥ stupid compared to Killing Floor. Even in the easier difficulties, the zeds are more likely to swarm you in every direction and once you do, you only can pray that you have a double-barrelled shotgun stuck somewhere up your ♥♥♥♥ so you can mow them down and escape. And if you don't, well... see you in Hell. As if the zeds aren't hell enough. But if you do make it pass through all the waves, you are greeted with a sight of a new boss, to which surprise surprise, it's not the Patriarch. I did hope that the Patriarch makes a comeback to the sequel but instead, we have this new boss that is far more deadlier, with claws that could pass off as fingernails, weapons that involves a minigun and several explosives which will punish you if you don't evade them properly, as well as the ability to go to you and suck your health while leaving you incapacitated for a short while while he promptly regenerates his health back.\n\ntl;dbtr: It's like Killing Floor, but better.\n\nAs for the graphics, well it's no surprise that it's amped up quite nicely and let's face it. They jumped from the Unreal 2004 engine to the Unreal 3 engine. If there is no aesthetical changes to the graphics, the world would be very surprised. To allow you to witness the graphics in all of its glory, the menu shows you a bunch of zeds in close up, staring with their wide-opened eyes and demented look which sort of feels like they're staring at a painting published by Salvador Dali (I wouldn't blame them. I do that too when I look at his paintings). The Unreal 3 Engine that the game uses also allows the game to look more polished and shiny, allowing for a more graphical edge which was what Killing Floor needed and I'm quite glad that Killing Floor 2 got that right, along with the other things Killing Floor 2 got right so far. You now have a myriad of customizations in the graphical setting which Killing Floor doesn't offer and it allows to witness the awesomeness of the game while feeling like you're just playing Killing Floor with better graphics.\n\ntl;dbtr: It looks like Killing Floor, but better.\n\nI can hardly find any cons in this game due to how great the gameplay is. Well... maybe there are a few. The weapons are really lacking. You have an arsenal of weapons to choose from, but despite all that, there are a lot of weapons that didn't make it in there. The Barrett .50 Cal, the LAW and the all-time favorite chainsaw that was featured in Killing Floor didn't make it in Killing Floor 2 yet, which leaves my heart slightly broken. And furthermore, the lack of maps only makes this game as playable as Half-Life. It's a great game, but repeating it every so often only makes it bland as the time goes by.\n\nOverall, I think that this game warrants a purchase as far as I'm concerned. It's a great game at this point and it is enjoyable to play by yourself and it is even more enjoyable when you take it to multiplayer. Due to the missing features and content, you might be put off into buying Killing Floor 2, but compared to the other sad excuses of Early Access games, this Early Access game deserves your money than the rest.\n\nAlternatively, you can choose to play a more feature-complete game of the first Killing Floor. It's not going to be as pleasing as playing Killing Floor 2, but hey. At least it's a complete game. Meanwhile, I'll just sit here and kill some zeds with my dual-barrelled shotgun that reminds me of when I once fired a Blunderbuss against a watermelon, except this watermelon comes in packs and wants to maul me to death.","May 11, 2015","true","36.7"," 37 of 53 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","37","53","8","5"

I'm really thankful to Tripwire Team for giving me the chance to try out the game ealier. My emotions couldn't describe it what i felt on my first hours in Killing Floor 2.. But i think i can remember what it really was: The first hours made me deeply satisfied. if you watched the streams or videos, they won't tell you how the game really is, you have to feel it. I was really surprised, because theres huge diffrence between Killing Floor 1 and Killing Floor 2, I'm amazed how the job was well done. I mean, the gore system called M.E.A.T (Massive Evisceration and Trauma) is jackpot and people are going to love it as much as i do. The difficulty jumped a bit higher, it feels really hard if you don't cooperate with your teammates, you can't take by yourself everything, the biger ones like Scrakes & Fleshpounds require more firepower than Killing Floor 1's SC&FP, where you could use strategic tactics that are well known by most of the people. Now you have to work as a Team. Espesially when the Boss wave comes, theres no such a thing called "Rest" durning boss wave, "Hans Volter" as a New Killing Floor 2 Boss tries to kill you without running away to heal, he regains health by sucking it from you, runs with dual StG44 to shoot you from distance, throws Toxic, Explosive, Smoke granades and attacks with Claws.. That should make you worry about..\n\nInformations about the Game..\nThere are 4 Difficulty Levels which are:  Normal - Difficulty on which you should start playing - things are slower, specimens do less damage, Trade Time extended which lasts 1:30min ( 0 - 10Lv )\nHard - Slightly harder than Normal. ( 10 - 15 Lv )\nSuicidal - ( 15 - 20Lv )\nHell on Earth - Hardest difficulty for people who hit 25level or know what are they doing, most of the specimens sprint all the time or do a lot of damage.\nDiffuculty diffrence between Killing Floor 1 & Killing Floor 2:\nFor KF1 there was difficulty called "Beginner", which in KF2 is now known as "Normal".\nSpecimens in KF1 were easier to kill, dealing with the specimens in KF2 require more accurate and damage.\nKF1's Specimens HP&Speed&DMG changed with each difficulty, KF2's specimens Health doesn't change each Difficulty, they start using new abillities.\n\nSpecimens Incoming\nThere are new ones and old ones that are highly polished:  Cyst - Doesn't do much, you should watch when he grabs you.\nClot - pretty the same one, but can actually run and grab you\nSlasher - stronger than Clot, does more damage and can also grab you.\nGorefast - Run and Kill with Blade.\nBloat - Slow ♥♥♥, fat guy that pukes with toxic that can do nice damage, you should really worry when he runs at you.\nStalker - Invisible Woman, they are now less visible if i'm going to compare to KF1. "There's a kiss ♥♥♥♥♥"\nSiren - KF1 Kevin's Wife that screams a lot, shes dangerous on higher difficulties, other than that watch for lights.\nScrake - More dangerous than in KF1, Rages at 70% of his health and when spines around.\nFleshpond - Insanely dangerous, rages without reason, takes lots of shots to kill.\nHans Volter - Suicidal i should quote "No Rest for the Wicked" since thats truth, and you need more time and team to put him down, he has 3 Stages of Health - Green > Yellow/Orange > Red, whenever the colour changes he charges to nearest player to regain health.\n\n\nSomething New & Something Old:There will be 10 Perks with maximum 25 Level: Support Specialist - In Early Access (exists in KF1)\nCommando - In Early Access            (exists in KF1)\nMedic - In Early Access                     (exists in KF1)\nBerzerker - In Early Access               (exists in KF1)\n-----------------------------------\nFirebug - Later Release                     (exists in KF1)\nSharpshooter - Later Release           (exists in KF1)\nDemolition - Later Release               (exists in KF1)\nGunslinger - Later Release               (completly new)\nMartial Artist - Later Release           (completly new)\nSWAT - Later Release                      (completly new)\nWhat about the Weapons, you say?\nAs for the Early Access there are only 4 Perks, and for each perk you have 4 weapons only.\nEach Perk has diffrent granade and melee weapon + you get starting weapon.\nBerserker: Krövel - Part Crowbar/Part Shovel (Starting Weapon)\nPulverizer - Sledgehammer with Explosive Alternative attack\nVLAD-1000 Nailgun - Yes, the KF1's Support weapon is now Berserker ranged weapon.\nEviscerator - Simply, Chainsaw + Bow that shoots saws blades.\n\nEMP Granades that can stun Specimens & lawn-mower Blade\n\nCommando:\nAR-15 'Varmint Rifle'\nKalashnikov AK12\nSA80 L85A2 Bullpup\nSCAR-H Assault Rifle\n\nKF-BAR knife & Standard Granades\n\nMedic:\nHMTech-101 Pistol\nHMTech-201 SMG\nHMTech-301 Shotgun\nHMTech-401 Assault Rifle\n\nScalpel and Healing Granades\n\nSupport:\nSG 500 Pump-Action\nDouble-barrel Boomstick\nM4 Combat Shotgun\nAA-12 Auto Shotgun\n\nMachete and Frag Granades\n\nOh and i Forgot that are Few Weapons that are Currently Off-Perk:\nFlamethrower\nKatana\nCharacters..\nYeah sure, plus they have few diffrent skins:\nRob Briar - Police Guy known from KF1\nBill Masterson - Military guy known from KF1\nReverend Alberts - Priest known from KF1\nAna Larive - Death Metal Girl as New Char!\nDonovan Neal - Black American guy as New Char!\nHayato Tanaka - Japanese guy known from KF1 and Rising Storm, hes appearience highly changed\nMr Foster - Gas Mask guy known from KF1\n\nDJ Skully - Skully masked guy, known from KF1, optainable by buying Digital Deluxe of Killing Floor 2.\nI'm sure theres more to know about this game, but lets give Tripwire chance to release it first\nKilling Floor 2 Final Words: Soundtrack: 10/10 - zYnthetic is back.\nGraphic - 10/10 - Even when the Game is on Modifed Unreal Engine 3.7 it looks awesome on Ultra Graphic.\nGameplay 8/10:\n+ Advanced Gore System\n+ Cellings as spawn ideas.\n+ Challanging than KF1 and requires cooperative\n+ 25 Levels & 10 Perks\n+ Be accurative to kill\n\n- More repetative than KF1, maybe its because there are only 3 maps..\n- the Agro on specimens is aweful, every specimen focus only one player in group to kill, also if you leave your team, theres small chance they go after you, so if you split up, you won't have even specimens around.\n- 4 weapons for each perk, 4 perks, need more stuff.\n- No tactic, ammo spam.\n- Wierd game feezing after playing for long time.\n\nI'm definitely sure it will be better, I'm rating Killing Floor 2:\n8/10 for Now.","April 21, 2015","true","589.8"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","25","32","2","4"

Map content has become better, but perks (roles or classes in other games) are overtly missing (i.e. there are weapons for them that don't have a class to match), and the game is full of micro-transaction BS that doesn't belong in a full-price title, especially in early access. This is not remotely like a Free-to-play game.\n\nGraphics and soundtrack are good. The voiceover work is a bit stale. It is still fun to play, but it's questionable if the game will be finished in anything resembling a reasonable time frame.\n\nI'd say give this a pass and wait until it's out of EA.

The developers refuse to listen to feedback, and game balance patches just haven't happened. If they do, it's usually to nerf more player abilities. The game is now at the point where one of the bosses has an unavoidable insta-kill melee attack, classes carry little to no ammunition, and you're forced to take a berzerker in your group whether you like it or not otherwise as said insta-kill boss will destroy any group at Hard difficulty or above without one.\n\nAnyone who felt burned by the Tripwire's refusal to listen to any of the beta feedback on Red Orchestra 2 will be familiar with the problem, and I would advise to not buy this in Early Access.

This is not by any means a bad game. In fact, it has quite good entertainment value, especially with friends! However, in my mind, and the minds of many others, the devs have simply crossed the line.\n\nWhen this game us first unveiled to Early Access, I was so excited! KF1 seemed a bit dated, and had the classic 'bullet tanking' issue. This game does not suffer from that, and that along with quite good gameplay and stunning visuals, I had to buy this!\n\nSo buy it I did! I was confident in my purchase. Tripwire was responsible for the massive success of KF1, and one of my favourite FPS games of all time, Red Orchestra 2. This also didn't seem like it would be in Early Access for long at all! At the time of release, the devs stated in a gameplay session with TotalBiscut that the game should definetely be out of Early Access by September 2015, and they were confident with that fact. This is one of the reasons I bought the game.\n\nWell, the september promise turned out to be a big lie. September 2015 drew ever nearer, and the updates to the game were few and far between. I wasn't too alarmed, as I expected just one massive launch update. Well, I actually stopped playing the game, and forgot about it, waiting for it to be released. Then I heard of all the microtransaction controversy, and warning sirens went off in my head. I checked back on the store page for this game, and sure enough, game is still Early Access in December 2015! And here we are, middle of May 2016 and the game is STILL early access, over 7 months behind their promise! Not only that, but they actively censor community outcry!\n\nThis type of developer behaviour should not be tolerated, and thus I urge you not to buy this game. Not to mention that there is hardly a difference in content since the release of the game into Early Access and now. Same boss. Same 5-7 enemies. Same guns. Same four maps (how many have they added? four? two?)\n\nTL;DR ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developers. Microtransactions. Slow progress.

They also said a lot of other stuff about how they'd value community feedback and do everything to blah blah blah false promises, thisgamewillhavecontentsoon.jpg, etc etc, but I don't recall anyone ever asking for PVP, especially before all the perks and weapons were in.

Here we have an incomplete game that we paid real money for, fine that's cool happens all the time. Next the developers add some content (the firebug class for example) saying, "Oh yeah that was meant to be in the game from the start and you don't have to pay any more for that." Again this is fine because they're finishing their game. Now pay attention to this next bit because here's the important part.\nWhat's not okay about this is making content (while the game is still in Beta) and charging for it in any way shape or form. If the game is incomplete then EVERYTHING added before it is out of early access should be free, period. "But it's optional cosmetics" you argue? No, that doesn't matter because here's what should have been done with these "cosmetics";\n-EITHER-\n1. Don't charge for the content but do add it in, the game isn't done and anything you put into it should be included as 'base game' because we already paid.\n-OR-\n2. Save this content and DON'T release it until AFTER the game is finished. Then you can release it as DLC and charge money for it.\n-OR-\n3. Just don't make cosmetic stuff before your game is finished! Time you spend making that stuff could be time spent finishing the core of the game.\nDoes that spell it out? Do you all understand why the people saying this is fine and defending Tripwire are wrong?\nIt DOES NOT MATTER if they're only cosmetic and it doesn't matter that the game is in otherwise decent condition (besides missing classes and a few other things last I checked.)\n---That is NOT THE POINT! The point is; "Early access" means "the game is not done yet."---\nHow about you finish your game first, that sound good Tripwire?  DO NOT let ANY game developers get away with this now or in the future, MAKE AN EXAMPLE of Tripwire.\n\nPROTIP Tripwire Interactive, most of us would have had no problem with you selling us your skins or hats or whatever AFTER the game was completed with all the classes and maps in there. Have fun with your extra money from young gamers who don't know better and affluent shills who just don't care because a sizable chunk (but not enough) of the Killing Floor 1 veteran players that made you who you are have likely gone back to KF1 or just stopped playing after this little stunt.\nTl;dr  Microtransactions in EARLY ACCESS are not okay.\n\nSo Tripwire, baby, call me when you finish your game then my friends and I MIGHT come back to have a go at little old Killing Floor 2 despite her being used goods at this point.

The starter weapons are appropriately weaker: .22 AR, what looks like a 20 gauge shottie, for example for the support & commando class.

I loved how you can post up in one position and steadily take on higher levels of specimens.\n\nSince this game is still in early access mode, I recommend for the developers one thing for KF 2 - "make it more like KF 1". The specimens were much more fear invoking in KF 1 compared to KF 2.\n\nOne thing I liked about KF1 was that ammo was always an issue no matter what level you were playing. You feel like the specimens are coming toward to you like molasses while you empty your clips. This isnt the case in KF 2. It is easy to run away from the specimens compared to KF 1. You can more easily survive without your team in KF 2. Team work isn't as crucial in KF 2.\n\nAlso the scrakes used to invoke fear to every KF 1 player unless you were a sharper shooter, medic or beserker. This isn't the case for KF 2 - the scrakes are much easier for every class to take on which takes away the challenge and dependency on team work.\n\nLast the map positioning makes it almost impossible to not restock on weapons. In KF 1 the maps could be very large sometimes and unless you planned accordingly, you can miss out on restocking weapons which adds more challenge to the game. KF 2 maps are smaller or the running option makes it easier regarding the logistics of restocking weapons.\n\nAll in all, I still play KF 2 for the updated version but I am very much upset KF 2 isn't as good as KF 1.","May 15","false","80.0"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

Not really. Would I in a couple of months? Possibly. I expected a lot from this game, considering Killing Floor 1 was one of the best if not the best zombie survival game I've ever played; and I love COD Zombies. Anyways, this game is good for a couple hours, till you realize you get a couple (3-4) guns for each class, which all of them arn't even out yet but were suppose to be out "by the end of 2015" which they told us last year. There is good intentions for this game, because it's suppose to be Killing Floor 1, but with a lot more content, which could lead to hundreds to thousands of hours worth of content. I know its early access, and I know its only be a year since it was realeased, but come on, they barely worked on it for the whole time it was out and im certain they made enough money to fund it considering it was $30 dollars for early access. I love the games that Tripwiire make, but this was just bad taste for them to hype this game up and let the title early access consume it and make it take years to be finished like a lot of early access games now.

The game itself is pretty great altough grindy.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good but nothing to write home about. But this game is not supposed to be about that. Sound is also passable, the weapons give out a good oomph. If you like heavy metal music then you will probably like the soundtrack, I personally don't so not really a plus for me.\n\nThe levels are not that big and there is generally no strategy to where you are going to hole up. I would have liked to see some mroe variety in that and bigger levels where you move up little by little or at least have some incentive to change locale. I guess the trader acts kind a like it but it doesn't feel enough.\n\nNow, I give this game a thumbs down because of the total lack of development. I basically bought it right around when the demo and pyro were released and that was that. That was almost an year ago and there has been 1 perk released since then and a couple of maps. The game was supposed to be released by the end of 2015 and now it is almost 6 months later. And the player numbers have suffered, so basically even if they were to finish it tomorrow I doubt we will be seeing any regular updates after that to keep it fresh so basically it is dead.\n\nIf you are thinking of buying it I will tell you not to since it basically has about the same amount of players as Killing Floor 1 and it will just get worse, so I wouldn't if I was you.","May 20","false","79.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

KF2 should be great, but it isn't. I don't even want to think about how long this game will take to be complete. I'd talk about the Microtransactions, but you know the drill by now. The games UNFINISHED, don't try to ask us to give you more money before finishing the product. I'm aware KF1 was very light on content when it launched, but now Tripwire has something to bulid on. After nearly a year, the game's barely changed, in some ways for the worse(Permaraging zeds.) Everything would be fine if updates happened faster, and real content waas added piece by piece, not in these ♥♥♥♥ing "FREE CONTENT PACKS." I'd wait till the game's done. Because at this point, I'm burnt on what little content there is in KF2. I'd barely call it "Early Access" cause we only get to try new content when a large chunk is complete and bug free, thus the long ♥♥♥ waits in between updates. So what the ♥♥♥♥s the point of even putting it in EA?

And for an Early Access game, it’s surprisingly almost entirely bug-free. More content is coming in due time, and the devs have promised full mod tools during Early Access so the community can start churning out maps.\n\nSo whether or not you find Killing Floor 2 worth buying during Early Access, comes down to how much money you’re willing to spend on a game that you’ll likely only try out for a few hours and then put to the side for weeks or months to come. This isn’t a DayZ type affair, however. The developers estimate six months, possibly a few more, before the game is out. This isn’t some proof-of-concept or pre-alpha tech demo, after all. It has enough content to have fun with, and it won't frustrate you with game-breaking bugs.\n\nI love it already the way it is now. It doesn’t try to pretend something it’s not. What it does is wave-based shooting, and it does that already exceptionally well. I’ve rarely played an FPS that gives as much of a visceral feedback as this. It’s gun-porn, pure and simple.\n\nIf you're interested in reading a more in-depth full preview, head on over to our site:\nhttp://www.pixeljudge.com/en/previews/killing-floor-2/","April 21, 2015","true","16.2"," 40 of 59 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","40","59","4","0"

Having people jump off of one sinking ship and getting on another ship only for it to start leaking. The new ship is a bit watery but it's okay, the passengers believe the people who own and are cruising the ship will fix it. Meanwhile the old ship is trying their best to fix their ship while this new ship is beginning to leak.\n\nNow the new ship gets a bigger leak, a few other ones too. Then there's another problem. The ship owners now have installed a new part of the ship that nobody asked for, nobody wanted, and that everybody thought would be an idiotic thing to put in instead of, you know, fixing those leaks.\n\nSuddenly, people get smart. They get the life boats that they had and start using them and go off into sea. And what do they find? The old ship. And this old ship has even more people in it, but on top of that, the ship has been repaired a bit. Old problems like its obvious sinking habits are gone, it has a better engine and has better performance in any waters. On top of that, to say they are sorry, what was originally only buyable is now free for people if they play their cards right and they also get free stuff in the long run, and for people who owned a previous pass from a few years back at an old cruise, they got the ability to relive that feeling of that cruise for free in the current year.\n\nBack to the old ship, the old ship is STILL having loads of problems after over half a year being leaky, with it being 3/4 of the way in water. There are around 1000 people still in it, hoping for the day they fix the ship. The old ship doesn't look half bad and with those people adding more things to the ship along with constant repairs, giving closure on future plans for future cruises, and also giving more to and with their customers, people come back to the old ship. The new ship is now 4/5 in the water. They just announced they'll add a brand new part to the ship.\n\nAnd they still don't fix those leaks\n\nWhat did I just describe? I described people quitting Payday 2 and coming to Killing Floor 2. Then Killing Floor 2 does either nothing or worse than overkill did with content, and now people are back to Payday 2. As a person who owns almost all dlc (other than convention exclusive and humble bundle exclusive dlc mask packs) I can whole heartedly say, at least Overkill really cares about their game. They care about their IP. TWI? ♥♥♥♥ man, they don't know how to please. The first big content update, Incinerate and Detonate, came out in a closed beta. As in, a beta you had to sign up for, hope you got it, and if you did you had to put in a code. FOR AN EARLY ACCESS GAME.\n\nThis is not Early Access done right. You said "We will finish this before 2015." You said "Crawlers will climb walls." You said "we will work with the community to help make the game better and listen to feedback." You said this, and that, and those, and these. All you're doing to me and many other once fans of TWI and Killing Floor is spitting out air to make it sound like words. TWI has become worse than EA and Overkill and I still like Overkill. And I'm glad I got this game gifted to me, but even then, I still feel ripped off.","May 8","false","83.4"," 36 of 52 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","36","52","2","10"

You're all armed to the teeth, and suddenly a few zeds start to pop out, from the walls or from other parts of the cavern. You pop them off no problem. Suddenly, more start to arrive, and there's some variation in them too. Some of them are big and spit acid at you, some will scream at you, some are invisible, ect. You are your companions hold off in the center, and get into a good defensive position where if everybody does their job right, no zed should ever walk inside the square and flank anybody. Right?\n\nThere is heavy metal playing, and it really sets the tone for zed-killing. You're getting pumped, but start to wonder where the action is? As long as you hold formation and nobody leaves, none of you will ever get damaged. Suddenly, the music stops and you hear a roar from the distance. More zeds start pouring out, and they get a little bit closer but not close enough to hit you. A massive zed with yellow arms comes around the corner, and you start to take shots at him. He turns red, and charges right through your formation. He starts wailing on one of your companions, and brings her down to 1/4 hp before the medic arrives to save her. The big zed is then met by your berserker (melee class), and you see a tiny man with a katana dueling it out with a huge zombie the size of a truck.\n\nEverybody is surrounding the big zed, trying to bring him down. During all this commotion, you forgot about the little ones. They grab you and your friends from behind and crawlers start to pour out of the ceiling. Your fire bug (pyro class) tries to clear out the massive horde, but it's a desperate attempt at best. Some ♥♥♥♥♥ shoots out the lights, and now you're in a deep dark cavern, surrounded by zeds and no idea where your allies are at. You're shooting by the light of your friends flashlight, trying to hit whatever you can to stop the slaughter.\n\nThe big one goes down, and the berserker is left at 2hp but the medic is taking care of that. Less and less zeds start to pour through, and you know that you've won this round, but you still have 2 more to go...\n\nThis is a completely accurate description of most of my games. Killing Floor 2 is an intense zed shooting game where you earn money by killing zeds, which you then use to buy guns which you use to kill more zeds. You survive 4/7/10 rounds of zed killings, and you win. Simple. The controls are great, and there's enough content even in early access to keep me entertained. The soundtrack is amazing and really adds to the game. The only thing I would improve is the content of the game (more classes, more types of zeds, more maps) but I am more than positive there will be more by the time the full game is released. 10/10 game, I highly recommend it.","September 7, 2015","true","17.1"," 41 of 61 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","41","61","7","3"

Sure, the original killing floor has had years to build up stacks of custom maps, DLC and other neat additions to keep the game alive; but with that said, Killing Floor 2 put itself at a severe disadvantage by gimping the core of varied gameplay- A wide selection of classes. It could've panned out, with regular updates adding real, worthwhile content to the game. It has not panned out. What we get instead is a glacially slow, irregular move towards the finished product. The confusing choice to add skins (more than any other content, really) has not actually hurt the game, but it'll leave you feeling bitter and a bit messed around.\n\nEven with typically Early Access behaviour such as this I might still have given this game a tentative recommendation because for some people there will be enough here to enjoy right now. It's not hard to see why: with satisfying gunplay, gorgeous and visceral visuals and all around refinement of the central mechanics I'll guarantee you'll have fun with the game. The problem is whether the fun will last, or whether you'll burn out before development is completed, robbing yourself of truly enjoying the superior end product. After all, completion of development is a big question mark ever since the 2015 promise was thrown out.\n\nFinally, the truly depressing factor which tips me over the edge into not recommending the game is the surreptitious addition of microtransactions, during development and without warning.\n\nSo right now, I cannot pretend the game is not, at its heart, very good. What matters more is that by buying it now you're either robbing yourself of what is probably going to be a superior initial experience with the finished product or leaving yourself open to the developer adding other nasty surprises such as microtransactions (à la Payday 2, which this game styles itself a little too closely to already.)\n\nWith all this in mind, don't buy this, not for a while at least.\n\n","March 16","false","70.2"," 123 of 207 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","123","207","2","3"

Developer seems dedicated to finish everything, but it's just taking way too long. Content seems to be coming out more quickly these days, but considering they estimated the end of 2015 to be out of early access, and they still have 3 perks and many balance/bug fixes to go, I can't recommend this.\n\nUPDATE 08/12 - GUNSLINGER UPDATE: some good content here. New maps are fun and Gunslinger seems to be a good class to play. Still some balance issues with the other perks, plus we're almost up to the TWI's estimated date of full release and there are still three perks to release. Not a fan of how long this is taking.\n\nUPDATE 08/04 - REVENGE OF THE ZEDS UPDATE: more unnecessary content added. VS Survival was added, is horrendously imbalanced, and took development time away from the future perks. The game mode could be fun under the right circumstances, but I would rather them just focus on the perks for now.\n\nAnother silly addition to the game is Game Conductor, which acts a lot like the AI Director from Left 4 Dead (aka makes the game harder or easier depending on how well your team is doing).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/M4Mons/recommended/232090/","M4Mons","Mons","http://steamcommunity.com/id/M4Mons/","122 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGeneral verdict for me, if you played KF 1, keep playing it. If you haven't played KF before, buy and play 1. Ignore 2 completely. Don't know if it's just the early access phase, or if KF2 is really heading down a path to failure. Either way, just buy KF1, get a couple of friends to skype with and pop some zed heads on that instead. It's much more fun than anything KF2 has to offer.\n\nCouldn't bring myself to dump as many hours into this as I did with KF1. Probably because this game takes a little more effort to play, or maybe I'm not high enough in the perk levels, or maybe because the gameplay isn't as predictable as KF1 where zeds seem to appear from every crevice imaginable. I liked the ability to lock myself in a room and blow the doors as the zeds storm through; now the doors are permanently destroyable and the focus seems to be keeping the players moving. It was easier to just rock out to KF1 and be mindless whereas in 2... it's lost some of the charm for me.\n\nImproved graphics, game(gun)play and general game mechanics.\n\nFinicky trade menu, takes a little time to get used to.\n\nMusic choice is questionable. It doesn't sound as good as KF1 but each to their own. Too many vocals? I don't know, it just didn't do it for me.\n\nZeds. They are cool this time around, but some of their unpredictability, move speed (oh god the move speed) and certain traits (such as moving erratically, you invisible lady things) are more annoying than they are fun to play against. I get that it's easy to kite things in KF1, but that formula feels fun to play with. My biggest example / complaint would be the "last few zeds left" thing the game seems to do which is that it speeds up the zeds so they are harder.\n\nFleshpounds in KF1 were predictable and fun to fight against. You hear the music rumbling and you see it in the distance, feeling a sense of dread as it got closer; if someone accidentally shot it and it went nuts you had a rush of adrenaline. In KF2, fleshpounds that aren't even aggro'd are nuts to fight against, which isn't a good thing imo... If it's part of the last few zeds alive, it's perma-aggro'd which is pretty aids.\n\nThere's just something about the predictability of the mobs in KF1 that makes it so much more enjoyable. It's like playing pacman where you know how everything will act so how far you got depended on your skill level. But with KF2 the formula has been changed so much in my eyes that it's like you play pacman but everynow and again the ghosts will go through the walls, so whilst zeds are spawning out satans ♥♥♥ to keep you on your toes, you sort of lose the will to play the game. A lot of my friends used to love having a chat whilst playing KF1; but it seems nigh impossible in KF2.","May 4","false","12.3"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","0"

This game is not one of them.\n\nKF2 has been in early access for over a year and the updates are released at a snoozing pace. I have not even touched the game for a long time because of annoying things like teleporting enemies, which apparently are still in the game. Releasing PvP and microtransactions instead of working on things that are core to the game and actually trying to make a finished product is something I can't even understand. The maps are way too few and the perks are incomplete, yet they put efforts into a PvP mode in a game that has always been about co-op? Releasing an early access with only four perks out of ten in the game was a bad decision in the first place, because players are unable to test the core of the game which are the different perks and the ability to mix them in a team and try different strategies together. There's not much to be gained for Tripwire since the game will be changed so drastically in the future anyway.\n\nGrim Dawn did early access so well because they prioritized finishing the actual integral parts of the game and now after release they're working on additional content like survival mode, new dungeons and items, and even an expansion pack - all which take nothing away from the player experience, they just add to it. Tripwire should have done the same and released PvP after being done with the game, not when there's still a ton of other stuff to work on that are core to the game.","May 9","false","24.9"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","0"

If you do, you're supporting all of Tripwire's terrible desicions. I was hoping KF2 would restore my faith in early access games, as Dungeon of the Endless, Endless Legend, and Darkest Dungeon were all amazing games in their early access form, and were updated frequently and finshed as soon as possible. With KF2 this is not the case.\n\nAs it stands now, KF2 is not near as good as its original. None of the perks seem fun to play anymore due to being heavily dumbed down, and I have no incentive to play any of them. Why switch perks if all I'm getting is a small damage buff and maybe a useful perk skill? It's still going to cost an arm and a leg for any of the weapons. But honestly gameplay is the least of all the complaints I have with this game.\n\nAt the time of this review, KF2 is 11 days away from going one year in early access, despite saying that they wanted to finish by the end of 2015. Now, delays are expected and it's very difficult to hit deadlines like that, but after nearly a year in early access you would think that it's at least nearly done. Instead of focusing on gameplay balances and adding in new weapons, perks, and maps for everyone to enjoy, they decided the best course of action would be adding cosmetic items and a crate/key system before the game is actually finished. They then decided to add in a new gamemode that nobody had asked for. Tripwire's increasingly bad decisions have killed any desire for me and my friends to play this game.\n\nTL;DR\nGameplay feels watered down and not as enjoyable.\nKF2 has overstayed its welcome in early access.\nMicro transactions were a priority over new content.\nA PVP gamemode was a priority over new perks/weapons/maps/characters.Don't bother with KF2, you're supporting a business practice that needs to die out.

Keep in mind that Killing Floor 2 is in early access and has yet to receive a full release. Many players from the previous title may know that some of the new features of Killing Floor 2 included sprinting and crosshair, which may come as a disappointment. While I personally do not believe this should be an issue at all for both veteran and new players, it does remove the aspect of having your knife out to run quicker.\n\nAbout the graphics - there is no doubt that there is a huge improvement. The game has updated graphics and textures which look significantly better than they did before.\n\nThere are 10 waves and on the 11th wave you have to fight against a boss (either the Patriarch or Hans Volter for now). By the end of your tenth wave the map you’re surviving appears splattered in blood from each shot you make. It’s a very impressive feature and definitely adds atmosphere to the chaos.\n\nThe first Killing Floor provided a selection of 7 perks. Killing Floor 2’s Early Access contains 7 perks for now - Berserker, Commando, Support, Field Medic, Demolitionist, Firebug and the new perk - Gunslinger. However once the game reaches its full release it is rumoured that it will include a whopping 10 perks in total. Each perk has its own special skill which is unlocked at levels 5,10,15,20 and 25 and there are two options of which you can't choose your special skill.\nThere are a lot of people playing this game and the servers are always full.\n\nNevertheless there are some aspects of the game which I don't like.The specimens in Killing Floor 2 are a bit modified compared to Killing Floor 1. There are not many combos you can use for the insta - kill of the big zeds. I have seen one for the medic with his nades and I can't even call it a combo, more like a simple strategy and one for the firebug. So it is not very easy to kill Fleshpounds and Scrakes. The one thing I don't like is that if someone enrages the Scrake or the Fleshpound, they can attack anyone they want. So I find it really annoying to have them charging against me, without being prepared to kill them. Headshots here are essential, so try your best not to miss them.\n\nI have a mixed feeling when it comes to teamplay . When the waves get harder in some of the cases everybody just runs around trying to save theirselves and it would be pure luck if you end the wave with your teammates being around you, because in some situations it is impossible to stay together. So it is best to count on yourself to finish the wave, alive.\n\nThere are not many guns added to this game, but hopefully new ones will be released soon.\n\nMore maps, weapons, game modes, removing classes imbalance, fixing teleporting zeds and concentrating on the game's development rather than adding cosmetics will definitely make more Killing Floor 2 players happy.\n\nOverall I would not recommend  this game to other people for now, because Tripwire have turned it into  a casual game. You play 1-2 maps and everything is okay, but  after that it gets deadly boring ... If I have to compare it with KF1 - a BIG lack of content. Sure it is an early access, but there aren't any signs of progress.\n\nWith that being said Tripwire has a lot of work to do and I hope that they don't dissapoint us !","January 17","false","367.4"," 163 of 280 people (58%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","58","163","280","12","3"

I don't know why they're peddling this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of "a map taking like six to seven months to make", and then along the way think it is more important to FIRST implement microtransaction systems, a TF2 crafting and loot system... HATS. They still manage to fail on implementing proper Nvidia Flex support since release, still aren't even CLOSE to the amount of weapons in the original Killing Floor, perk updates take more than half a year... and the most INSULTING of them all is that every single time a meaningful content update does come out so we can (obviously) try to break the hell out of the update because it's EARLY ACCESS, we are told it is a "free dlc pack" or "free expansion" like we are privileged to have such a fun, new diversion. ♥♥♥♥ no. This is Early Access, we paid for an unfinished game and would offer criticism and support for it until it released (hopefully) in a finished, polished state. As far as I can tell, Killing Floor 2  was never meant to be a game to release in Early Access. It has too many finished parts while completely lacking on the promises in a REASONABLE TIMEFRAME from the developer.\n\nI mean, the game plays good and all (and balance and certain weapons are absolute ♥♥♥♥, though) but this game is moving at such a pace while prioritizing microtransactions that it won't be finished soon, at all.","April 3","false","55.0"," 38 of 57 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","38","57","2","0"

"aren't you dying to know what's in the crate? to find out, all we require is some more of your parents' money".\n\nbut their profiteering doesn't end there, after that second wave of profits they receive from selling you the random crate, they then profit a third time whenever you buy, sell or trade the useless crap that you don't want out of the crate with other players in their bs marketplace. you heard me right, when you send back the randomly generated stuff that you don't want and you take a monetary loss on it in the process, tripewire gets a percentage of the transaction you made, allegedly with another player. and you will ultimately sell back (at a loss) most of the crap you get out of the crates because you'll receive numerous duplicates in the process, because they don't allow you to simply pick which items you want to buy from them because they want you to use their marketplace "to trade", every time you launch their game, that you paid thirty bucks for already. so maybe you'll end up getting the item you wanted out of the random crate the first time around and only pay five bucks for it, just as you would if it was simply on the steam store front. or maybe you'll have to spin the wheel several times and make a few "trades" before you get the piece of useless cosmetic crap you wanted and likely end up paying enough money to have bought three or four more copies of the game before you get your favorite, shiny highly-coveted-rare-weapon-skin. perhaps you may have heard at some point in your young life that gambling is "a fool's game" and that "the house always wins" well maybe now you can begin to understand what these phrases really mean. tripewire has turned their game into an online casino where they control the algorithms by which the wheels in their slot-machine are programmed to turn. think about what you are doing with your money. do you believe they are going to allow you to win what you want on your first spin of the wheel? second spin? tenth? or the hundredth time you gamble your money? maybe.\n\nby buying into this form of "business model", essentially you become tripewire's slave, which amounts to nothing more than a legalized consumer scam.\n\nby now you're probably saying; "well that sure is crappy of them. tripewire's greed obviously knows no boundaries. but how do they get away with a thing like that?" well because it's perfectly legal to do this. "but why is a thing like this legal?" you may ask. well kids, again the answer is simple, they can do this because "it's only a game" and the gaming industry is not subject to any sort of government regulations as long as they pay their taxes, it is perfectly within their right to trick and manipulate their customers in any way they can manufacture in order to get you to give them more money for nothing and to charge you the most exorbitant prices that you could have ever possibly imagined seeing anywhere for content that should have been in the game when you paid the initial price and you assumed that you paid the full fare.\n\nwith that in mind, you have no recourse against scams like these EXCEPT TO NOT BECOME A WILLING PARTICIPANT.\n\nso how do you like them apples?\n(that is what is known as a rhetorical question. i am not interested in your thoughts on the matter. so you can keep your critiques of my review to yourselves. i'm talking to you, shills.)\n\nfrankly, at this point, i am surprised tripewire are not selling the bullets for the guns in this game, for real-life money. but it probably won't be long before they "implement that feature" too. and they will likely sell most of their customers on that idea too because they have a vast army of shills (and their mindless parrots a.k.a. fanbois) to get behind them on that, evidently.\n\n\nif i was you, i would not buy this game.\n\ni will not even go into the lack of content, the poor game mechanics and the broken promises because you can look at any number of other reviews to get information on those aspects of this scam of a game.\n\nif you think i'm just talking out of my behind for the fun of it, then look at my hours in the game and maybe you'll understand how serious i am.\n\nin case you don't know what i meant by R.I.P., 11-24-15 is when they added this money-milking update and that is the day i uninstalled this game and i will never look back. so that's one less low ping server running on tripwire's behalf for free.\n\n"early access done right"? as i see it, this is much more akin to anal-daterape. in fact, that's precisely what this "business model" is.","April 11","false","813.3"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","25","34","2","0"

It was that specific joy that I’d hoped KF2 would replicate, but to my dismay when I started playing this game there was no Sharpshooter perk. I decided to focus my efforts on the medic perk for what I thought would be the 'meantime' until Sharpshooter was added, but that meantime has lasted twelve months and there is no end in sight.\n\nThis game is fun, but it's at best the same amount of fun that it was a year ago, only now with a booming hat economy and a PvP mode that I still haven’t tried due to lack of interest.

Tripwire has actually provided some feedback[www.kotaku.co.uk] on their controversial decision where they confirmed that all future “free” content is going to be sponsored by revenues generated from microtx.\n\nThat means all promised perks, bossess and expected new maps are not going to be finished and released until enough money is sucked from community (above what has already been paid).\n\nThat means Tripwire lied when they said the game would be done in 2015. It’s not going to be done. By “done” they wanted to say that just enough features would be implemented to support “Trading Floor” [sic], not the core content that was expected.\n\nJohn Gibson also insisted on how good in-game economies are (!) and expressed his wishes about how community would create content for themselves (apparently the content that Tripwire was supposed to deliver) and then vote on what would appear in-game so that they can happily dump their money in it for so much “value and joy”.\n\nAt this point anyone who defends their act is simply autistic.\n\nAnd I don’t think this is going away: it isn’t. Just as there were enough hat-buyers, crate-openers and safe-drillers, so there would be enough addicts who would embrace new Killing Trading Floor, there would be pathetic idiots who would defend such schemes because they apparently are counting Tripwire’s money better than their own and know it first-hand, that poor developer is out of dosh and only another money-grabbing scheme is going to help it (and anyone who objects is a “crybaby”), etc, etc. That’s alright: it is something that is expected from infantile, autistic idiots. Well, you got what you wanted, I guess? See you in game (if I ever install it again), after you spend enough of your money in “zedconomy” and at least all perks and maps would be released (if). Because, wouldn’t it actually be fair? ;-)\n\nOriginal Post\nI purchased Killing Floor 2 just a few weeks ago because I believed it deserves to be in my Steam library. Atmospheric apocalypse with a promise of unholy amounts of content in the future.\n\nAnd this is what I get in return? Microtransactions? During Early Access?\n\nThe maps and perks aren’t even finished yet. Am I expected to browse some zedstore in-game instead of playing? And it’s not even a proper cosmetic store since the “loot” system is being built around gambling-style crate and key addiction disorder.\n\nI’m afraid this is not what Tripwire has originally promised.\n\nAnd above that, in the light of recent Payday 2 controversy, I believe this to be an extremely ugly move which seeks to demoralise the community and make everyone accept microtransactions as a permanent reality. As if every developer is now going to work hard on introducing this crap into their products and demonstratively not give a damn about all the negative feedback and frustration experienced by customers.\n\nConsequently, I now strongly regret my purchase.\n\nBelow is a list of anti-features I suggest Tripwire could implement by the time Killing Floor 2 is out of the early access:\n\nSkins. Hats. Masks.\nWell, heists then? Sometime in the future, when at least maps would be finished.\nUnusual hats and unusual masks. And unusual heists.\nEverything above in some expensive, operation “Free2Pay” cases and tickets (for heists).\nI don’t know, wings for characters? Could be so many styles... Like, butterfly or dragon, maybe.\nHow about crafting system?\nFascist competitive matchmaking system which bans player for a week if they accidentally lost their connection mid-game.\nDe-perk system. Didn’t play for a week? Missed the headshot during bullet-time? Sold your primary gun at merchant during last few seconds and couldn’t get an upgrade back in time? Back to three waves on normal, ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nCombine all of the above for a true Hell on Earth experience.\n\nThe first Killing Floor was a finished title which enjoyed both official DLCs (which were fairly made) and community-made mods (which alone amount to hundreds of hours of potential entertainment) as well as cross-platform releases (OS X, Linux support). It was hard to believe that Tripwire is not going to use the same successfull formula with the second installement.","November 23, 2015","false","8.4"," 60 of 97 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","60","97","0","0"

Spender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maleficent_Mk/","157 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a hard one for me. I hope to change it to positive in future, when I see what this game will turn out into, but at the moment, I just can't give it a positive review.\nLet's just clear few things from start. I do not care about microtransactions. I really do not. Should they have finished the game first - yes, they should have! Should they add more content more frequently, and update game more often - yes, yes they should, they're surely taking their sweet time with this one. Whose fault is it - ours. Cause we were not patient enough to wait for the full game and bought it the first day it came out in EA. My negative review is not based on these two facts.\n\nI am (as can be seen from my in-game hours) a big fan of Killing Floor 1, so cannot but compare these two games. Things that have been improved in second one are numerous. The game is more dynamic, zed animations are incredible, more gore (cause kids love gore), more variations and overall more thoughts dedicated in each detail. Medics finally have "guided" healing darts (damn zerkers, why you no stand in one place so I can heal you), introducing parrying, etc, so many incredible details! So why negative review?\n\nKF 1 was easy to learn, so darn fun to master. I remember first time discovering real power of katana and crossbow (and hating other players while I played as berzerker), finding out what I can really do with flare guns, learning the real value of good tank medic, and finding secret gems like "as a commando I can shoot scrake in back and he will never rage, just slowly die while walking on easy, normal and hard". Then we got guts to go on suicidal and HoE only to discover that most rules do not apply anymore and in laughing terror ran away from the same scrake we stunned with katana before and had new fun trying to "trick" the game which tried to trick us. And that good feeling when we succeded.\nKF2 for now does not allow us any of that stuff. Developers themself once said that they couldn't pass HoE, but if players started finishing it, they will make it more difficult. On second day of release we found out we can slowly run around scrake and Hans and kill them that way. So they changed that. Don't get me wrong, I don't want it to be easy. But, I really wanna learn "secret" tricks, not knowing Tripwire will change every single one of them we discover in order to "make it harder". Last I played when the update with demo and firebug came out, and by that time, I found most maps to be dark and narrow orriented, so I learned to HATE one of the update they're really proud of - teleporting zeds. No, no, no, no, and NO! You gotta give us few precious seconds to be able to recuperate, to heal and try to find that needed box of ammo, don't teleport all zeds I ran away from right in front of me. That feature of the game will literally drive me away from it forever!\nSo many other things to discuss, so many more pros and cons, but at the moment I am really dissapointed with a lot of things concerning this game, so, until further notice, this is my review.","December 16, 2015","false","146.7"," 163 of 282 people (58%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","58","163","282","8","6"

But hey, this was TWI. This was KF. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nPlenty, apparently.\n\nConsidering how slowly progress is being made on actually finishing the core "playable" content of the game, it is disheartening to find that the microtransaction model currently being rolled out is, in fact, a core component. I have absolutely no problems with cosmetic sidegrades, and I have no problems with people (including Tripwire) making money from them. It's quite a brilliant idea, actually. However, I will not support a game with a key/crate gambling system. That's where I draw the line. Had I known that such a system was planned, I never would have supported this title.\n\nI do not appreciate where TWI's priorites seem to lie right now, therefore I can not recommend this game in good conscience.

I'm well aware of what an early access title is and what that entails, however this game was sold on the notion of "early access done right." Despite that, updates have taken 4-5 months at a time for a very small amount of content, simple things like adjusting values etc take devs months to complete, and meanwhile they roll out features no-one asked for like trading floor and versus mode.\n\nThe zedconomy is a complete money grab. Paid DLC in KF1 for skins etc was very affordable, however in KF2 you might pay double the price of an entire KF1 DLC pack for just one crappy skin.\n\nEverything else about the game is enjoyable, the graphics are pretty up there even with flex not working, the gameplay style is fun and the balancing isn't the best but could be much much worse.

There's one new class, but the sharpshooter class (one of the most popular, if not THE most popular perk of the original game) is missing.

I would love to say that this is more of the same with most of the small problems fixed, better graphics and (later on after early access) more content.\n\nUnfortunately it is not. They pretty much butchered all of the fun by letting Zeds teleport to any location and spawn at any location at any time. The levels are completely interchangeable due to that, there is no exploring needed as there are no 'sweet spots' anymore like in KF 1, where you stop to fight the cheating AI doesn't matter at all. Checking your surroundings is completely pointless since Zeds will just spawn or teleport directly behind you if you are looking in the other direction for a second. You run away from the last 10 Zeds on the map and suddenly some of them magically appear around the next corner even though they were behind you a few seconds ago. Why can I even run away if it doesn't serve a purpose? It's silly.\n\nLike expected the game does have better graphics, animations etc. But the gameplay is simply far, far, far worse than Killing Floor 1 right now. It's yet another victim of the 'adjust to the (dumb) player' philosophy that many games have nowadays. Whether it's RPGs that scale enemies and loot to your level (so your character's level becomes just a meaningless number), racing games that make your opponents drive faster or slower depending on your own performance (so you can win a race even if you constantly crash during the first 4 of 5 rounds and lose a race even though you drove perfectly for the first 4 rounds, but made a small mistake in the last corner before the finish line) or this now. I have no idea how anyone could like this crap. But I guess the brainless idiots who love this don't even notice that enemies spawn right in front of their face. I really hope they don't have any success with this trash.","December 27, 2015","false","25.5"," 53 of 85 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","53","85","3","7"

Except terrible.\n\nObviously constantly picking up creeps and spawning them elsewhere (if you don't want people to notice, don't do it with slow stumbly guys like the clots... pretty obvious when they go from not even in sight to having crossed a huge chunk of open space in 1.5 seconds). Crashes far more often than it should. Load times are long enough to make a grilled cheese. Classes largely pigeon-hole the play style so there's no creativity. Some of them also not really viable at low levels, which means the only way to level them is to grind on Normal for ~20 Long (10 round) games. Other classes can easily be set up to be nearly unkillable. Glitches in several of the baddies, including scrakes, make them easy to solo even on the upper difficulties with the starting 9mm if you have the time - you can essentially keep them from ever hitting you, if you invest a few minutes of practice in solo mode.\n\nSo, basically... glitchy for sure, ranges from frustrating that they took so many shortcuts to boring that there's no real challenge or intensity there.","January 18","false","133.9"," 44 of 69 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","44","69","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MiseryPrincess/recommended/232090/","MiseryPrincess","Empress Misery","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MiseryPrincess/","391 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe game's development isn't exactly progressing in an encouraging direction. It's basically an Early access title with 1 proper content patch in 8 months. It's a game with a few small maps and a few inbalanced perks to grind right now.\n\nEven though there's been this huge void of content, the developer decided the next addon instead of finishing the game should be microtransactions and an ingame store. You know because finishing the game and completing it or giving people something for funding their development should be a secondary step over monetization schemes reselling content made by other people.\n\nSo you're left with a fairly expensive game for a few small maps and a few badly done perks and weapons. It works fine graphically, but there's a few issues with online lag and the beserker's parrying being a bit random. There's also a few silly balance issues with perkdecks and other such things as the developer seems like they don't know how to balance anything. Of course these issues will probably be ignored now that the developer wishes to focus on monetization over giving this enough content to be a full game.\n\nReally at the moment there's very little to do but play the same few maps over and over and grind perks. The rest is just hollow promises that haven't yet materialized. It seems they are relying on modders to provide the actual content, but this hasn't exactly happened. I'd probably have much more playtime if there was more "gameplay" to be had right now. Of course now they expect the new gameplay to be grinding the same tiny samey maps for "free" microtransaction junk. Exciting.\n\nIt looks fairly nice I suppose, but it's a bit clean. Not really gritty or dark rather than comic and a bit silly. Kind of like a childish gore sim than something gritty and "realistic".\n\nThe classes are a bit imbalanced, to put in nicely, with some just clearly better than the others and some perk deck skills just kind of useless. The bosses aren't very well thought out for all classes and really theres not much reason being anything but 1 or 2 when facing them.\n\nMaybe if the developers start being less lazy, produce more content and focus more on finishing the game than adding ways to make money while they sleep this review will improve. But really this game is really minimal and utterly lacking in content and substance compared to the first game.\n\nTo be honest, compared to the first game it's kind of a continuation from when they started adding golden weapon skins instead of content (other than a few maps from mods) not a direct improvement. If you care about graphics over gameplay then i'm sure this is a clear improvement, but really it's just empty right now.\n\nThem not really moving towards make a better game, just making money makes this unappealing to play currently. Maybe they will wake up, remove this gross junk and actually work towards making it a full and complete exprience. Maybe not, I guess we'll have to wait and see, but it's not something i'd recommend getting on right now.\n\nAlso developers, don't advertize "FREE CONTENT PACK" for an unfinished early access game. That's just stupid. Though it kind of draws attention to how actually releasing some content is a big event :p\n\nOh and adding in old junk with the same boring maps isn't really helping. This game is in no way worth it's buying price, especially when they add free to play microtransactions in.","November 30, 2015","false","18.6"," 44 of 69 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","44","69","2","3"

The ZEDs are much scarier then their KF1 counter parts (and the Clot now has a sick as ♥♥♥♥ swag walk), the guns feel powerful and do some real damage thanks to the new M.E.A.T. system which allows you dig into the brains of a Fleshpounds with an AK12 and the characters all have unique voices now which, personally from my perspective, is a great thing because it opens up much wider varieties of humour then just "WAAAANKARS!".\n\nHowever, development for the game is slow and while Tripwire are doing their best to make the perks feel strong and balanced while also preventing Fleshpounds from being nearly undestroyable there is one very obvious and glaring flaw for now.\n\nMicrotransactions in an unfinished game\n\nNow I dunno why this even got past the suggestion phase, the game isn't complete, there are unfinished balancing issues to be addressed, gunslinger is still to be added to the game and work on Sharpshooter (which I'm interested in due to the fast paced nature of Killing Floor 2) is almost non-existant. Not only are we missing one of our core vanilla perks from Killing Floor 1 but the game is nowhere near finished in terms of balancing and perk weapons.\n\nNow, this wouldn't be an issue if the game was finished and these items were offered in a DLC pack, these items are simply cosmetic and weapon skins that do not affect gameplay in any form but the reason this is such a bad thing is because it's preventing production and work on things that need to be addressed in the game right now!\n\nI listed this as negative purely because of how strong an impact microtransactions have on the gaming industry right now, microtransactions should NOT be a part of any game that you pay full price for, it's a gimmick for free-to-play games. Not paid products like Killing Floor 2 which is actually far from finished.\n\nI would love to make this a positive review and I had planned on writing a positive review for Killing Floor 2 but the fact they are also attempting to censor any form of backlash about their decision on the Tripwire Interactive forums has changed my mind.

They also mention adding gameplay-affecting weapons as DLC as a possibility in the future as well.\n\n>  In the future we may be adding weapons with new gameplay for sale\n\nAlso, further proof that it could just be a matter of time before they decide to bring the awful practice of skins with stats in crates to the game, shown below, copied directly from an official tweet.\n\n> @The_Raydio @TripwireInt ah I see.

This is not reasonable for the consumers for an unfinsished product. This has turned me away. Still can not see how this is justifiable for the consumers stand point.\n\nIm a great fan of the franchise and still play the original and find it alot more enjoyable, due to the fact the game has an equal balance between weapons and zombies compared to KF2. The original KF has a reasonable sense of team based tactics requirements when online and solo could be completed with reasonable difficulty but KF2 solo is difficult beyond the joke to play by yourself in solo.\nDevelopers please tell us all how you can justify this!!!!!\n\nThis is from http://steamcommunity.com/id/underhanddread/ and this quoted from his review and couldnt agree any more. No company should do a thing like this.\nMicrotransactions in EARLY ACCESS are not okay.\nI shouldn't have to explain why but I will for the kids and idiots out there who need it spoon fed to them. Here we have an incomplete game that we paid real money for, fine that's cool happens all the time. Next the developers add some content (the firebug class for example) saying, "Oh yeah that was meant to be in the game from the start and you don't have to pay any more for that." Again this is fine because they're finishing their game. Now pay attention to this next bit because here's the important part.\nWhat's not okay about this is making content (while the game is still in Beta) and charging for it in any way shape or form. If the game is incomplete then EVERYTHING added before it is out of early access should be free, period. "But it's optional cosmetics" you argue? No, that doesn't matter because here's what should have been done with these "cosmetics";\n-EITHER-\n1. Don't charge for the content but do add it in, the game isn't done and anything you put into it should be included as 'base game' because we already paid.\n-OR-\n2. Save this content and DON'T release it until AFTER the game is finished. Then you can release it as DLC and charge money for it.\n-OR-\n3. Just don't make cosmetic stuff before your game is finished! Time you spend making that stuff could be time spent finishing the core of the game.\nDoes that spell it out? Do you all understand why the people saying this is fine and defending Tripwire are wrong?\nIt DOES NOT MATTER if they're only cosmetic and it doesn't matter that the game is in otherwise decent condition (besides missing classes and a few other things last I checked.)\n---That is NOT THE POINT! The point is; "Early access" means "the game is not done yet."---\nHow about you finish your game first, that sound good Tripwire?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oliver49/recommended/232090/","oliver49","Meowcenary","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oliver49/","195 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI do wish there was a neutral option because this isn't a terrible game, It just doesnt appeal to me and my particular tastes as a gamer. If this review helps you make a decision, then great, if not, then move on.\n\nWith nearly 400 hours in the first game, maybe I've just had my fill of killing an X amount of ZEDs after Y waves in order to kill boss A or B, it's a very repetitive formula imo. A formula I was able to overlook in the first game because of it's unique charm that somehow kept me coming back for more. What really drew me to Killing Floor in general was the community, the immersion, and feeling of accomplishment after each game. There was a sense of commradery in having all hands on deck in order to survive the hordes of ZEDs fearlessly marching towards you. While that technically still exists in KF2, it doesn't quite measure up to what drew me to the first game.\n\nDownvote if you will but I'm also part of the bandwagon that complains about teleporting ZEDs. Teleporting would've been useful for making sure we don't have to run around like chicken's with our heads cut off, looking for that last ZED that wants to play hide and seek to make your life miserable. Instead they took the idea of teleporting, fed it a steady diet of crack and mushrooms, and finally injected it into the head developers veins before he produced the product we have now.\n\nSeriously though, I think it's a poorly executed idea that couldve been great in terms of shaking things up for the survivors but it ultimately ruined what little immersion I could muster. Before, it would probably be a good idea to have a support specialist weld that door shut to keep those carnivorous monsters at bay as you prepare to unload on them with all guns pointed at the ready, waiting in anticipation for that moment when that door is violently beaten down in a puff of smoke, watching as they desperately attempt to pour inside, only to get shredded by a torrent of bullets and grenades. Now, you're just asking for them to magically pop up behind you and get pinched from both sides. Needless to say...the immersion is....totally lost...I loved knowing exactly where the hell the ZEDs were so I could fight them accordingly, now I gotta spin my head in circles like the damn Exorcist girl the entire time to make sure I'm not about to get wrecked from behind.\n\nI'll readily admit I'm not the target audience for either game. When it comes to PvE(Player versus Environment) I like to pretend I'm in the shoes of the character accomplishing these incredible feats, which I assume was not at all what the devs had in mind in this seemingly generic zombie shooter(I know they are technically ZEDs, sue me). Despite this, in the first game, I could still manage to immerse myself in the idea that I was a survivor in an apocalyptic world as a result of fallout by an unethical company run by a mad scientist. After dispatching a small, docile, horde of Horizon abominations in wave 1, I would be introduced to a quirky trader. She was intriguing all by herself, still interested in making a profit of dosh despite the situation for God knows why, only to hide herself away until I've dealt with the horrors of the next wave. Each wave slowly introducing newer and more grotesque experiments for me and my team to handle. This would all build up to a final showdown with the mad scientist himself, a bloodied and horrifically mutated shadow of his former self, yet eerily recognizable compared to his portrait hanging on the wall of the Office map. He slowly begins stalking the team using a cloaking device until he finally reveals himself, yelling an iconic phrase I'll never forget, "One in the pipe!" before he launches a rocket in our direction. The entire game felt like a cheesy horror/comedy movie with memorable british banter thrown in. That's exactly what I liked about it, and that's exactly what I feel is missing in KF2 in my opinion. Little things like replacing the trader with a lifeless robot, or turning most of the characters into hardened vets that take themselves WAY too seriously (looking at you asian guy, saying stuff like "you talk.... ALOT"...pffft...give me a break...), or turning the bosses into total eye-sores as half man/half machine/half WHY THE HELL ARE THERE NAZI CYBORGS IN THIS GAME!! smh. All this adds up to an experience I can't seem to immerse myself in any longer, nor do I have the desire to. I'm hanging up my british ZED killing hat for now, maybe one day I'll return and those issues may be addressed, wishful thinking, I know.\n\nTL:DR This game is not that bad, just not great. Guaranteed bit of enjoyment while you explore the vanilla maps and try out each class. Can't say you'll be hooked much longer than that unless this is your first shooter or something. Lacks a great deal of personality and charm from the first Killing Floor. Lot of wasted potential in my book, graphics are great!","June 5","false","30.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Use credits earned to buy better weapons to kill things faster. Thats all there is to it. Since this is such a simple game, the skill cieling is extremely low. If you can reliably shoot things in the head (and those things move in very predictable paths) , then there is nothing more you can do to improve yourself as a player. Instead, you improve your performance in game by leveling up. The higher your level, the better your stats, and that is solely what allows you to move onto higher difficulties. This lack of development in player skill, combined with the grind each game to get the clear-cut best weapon for your class leads to stale gameplay.","January 20","false","25.5"," 42 of 66 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","42","66","3","4"

If you're worried, check again next year.\n\n\nTHE GOODThe core gameplay of shooting zeds in the face is inherently fun.\nThe classes ("perks") are not all clones of each other. Their weapons, priorities, and required skills can be very different.\nExtra effort went into weapon animations. Pressing reload on a full mag will perform inspection animations. Having a faster-reload skill uses a different set of animations. Some details like barrel flex are primarily noticeable in the game's bullet time mechanic. I love that ♥♥♥♥.\nVariety of enemies. Each of them have their own special way of screwing you over.\nEnemies react satisfyingly to violence. Certain attacks can make them flinch or stumble. Headshots will remove the head, sending blood spraying. Fire leaves behind charred skin. More powerful weapons will remove limbs, bisect bodies, or outright vaporize things.\nYou can disable all that if you want, but why?\nI ♥♥♥♥ing love shooting zeds.\nTHE BADSlow balancing. Some choices have been underpowered for a long time. Some choices are non-choices, like choosing between a limited-use novelty and passively negating your hard counter.\nSlow content release. This will probably never significantly improve, due to the realities of game development. It doesn't help that Tripwire made the mistake of giving a very optimistic (and incorrect) estimate[en.wikipedia.org] for completion.\nApparent development priority issues. Fans never asked for microtransactions or versus mode before getting the core content completed. Yes, I can think of excuses. No, that doesn't stop it from looking bad when fans are waiting for the promised core content.\nNo, really. Where does PvP fit into a series built on co-op? It's a dumb novelty.\nThey said "Early Access done right". This makes all of the above more infuriating, especially considering the fact we've been in Early Access for a year. It's not even Early Access, it's a beta launch.\nTHE OTHERWinning is not assured. If the later-wave hordes don't kill you, the boss will.\nLeveling system. Not literally vital, but useful, and not fast to progress.\nWeapons and zeds have inobvious nuances to them. You'll want to read up or learn from someone once you're bored with Normal difficulty.\nIt's not Killing Floor 1. Certain features and lines don't make a return. This may be upsetting if you like to Insult Players all the time.\nDeveloper communication is not perfect. They post WIP updates and frequently talk with (not just at) the community, and the latest patch (as of writing) comes with a number of highly requested changes. They also haven't talked about certain balance issues, so we don't know if they're just on the backburner or not.\nA FINAL WORDI won't blame you if you don't think the game is worth $30 (or $20 on sale) right now, but take any word-of-mouth you hear about promises with a grain of salt.\n\nAfter all, "done before 2016" was an estimate[en.wikipedia.org], not a promise.","April 9","true","406.2"," 80 of 135 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","80","135","3","0"

The guns feel great, the environments are pretty, and the challenge and progression is entertaining.\n\nHowever, the enjoyment will usually only last for maybe a week or so.  You'll play, maybe grind a little bit and get to a respectable level, and then you'll find you hit a figurative wall because there is a lack of content in the game.  And while the current content is enjoyable, the amount of things that exist compared to the promises of Tripwire make it all tend to expire very quickly.  If you're familiar with the previous game in its current status, that's not a problem, because it feels like a finished game with piles of content, Killing Floor 2 doesn't.\n\nKilling Floor 2 looks enticing, and it plays great, but once you are captivated with that image enough to buy the game, you'll find there is very little to actually keep you playing the game for very long.  So, I implore everybody who sees this game and considers buying it: Don't.\n\nDo. Not. Buy. This. Game.

The recent deal with microtransactions is yet another strike against Tripwire. The cosmetics themselves are perfectly fine since they do not alter gameplay in any way - but that is not the major issue here. We were promised frequent free content updates in the form of maps, weapons, characters, and perks; now Tripwire announces an entirely irrelevant marketplace for cosmetics instead of a sorely needed content patch. Just the presence of a cash shop in an unfinished version of the game is fairly suspect, but doing so in a desperately unfinished state is even worse. On top of this KF2 is a paid game, not free-to-play, most people agree microtransactions have no legitimate place in a paid game.","November 23, 2015","false","23.9"," 118 of 204 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","118","204","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ariadnenikolaidis/recommended/232090/","ariadnenikolaidis","Ariadne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ariadnenikolaidis/","151 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a review coming from an avid KF1 fan.  I loved KF1 so much that my friends and I bought KF2 the first chance we got.  The hype was real and we were so excited.  Unfortunately KF2 did NOT deliver.  Everything I loved from KF1 was missing in KF2.  Here I list my comparisons between two games:\n\nFirst, with KF1 you can reach max levels on all perks at around 400-600 hours mark.  With over 1800 hours gameplay on KF1, I continued to play KF1 simple for its replayability.  Having max levels doesn't necessarily ensure a win and strategy most often comes into play especially on higher difficulties.  Certain perks play certain roles and certain zeds need to be killed by certain perks for efficiency and minimal losses.  With KF2, I find that perk roles are more blurred and that almost any perk can kill any zed.  Any perk can also heal from a distance.  KF2 feels less strategical and more about luck - relying that you don't meet some unfortunate spawns in front of you as your run around the map.  The fact that doors don't respawn each wave almost entirely eliminates the ability to camp at the same spot (but the green welding effects look nice though).  Some people may disagree but that's fine.  This is my opinion.  I love that in KF1, you are able to hold camp spots till wave 10 and strategically eliminate threats like scrakes from wave 5+ and fleshpounds from wave 7+.  Whereas in KF2, I see most people running around - it feels like every map is KF-Farm.\n\nSecond, KF1 trader really gives the players the apocalyptic feel.  You see the trader is just like any other human trying to survive and make enough money to survive the apocalypse.  While on KF2, you are met by a computer trader in place of KF1's human trader.  If it was a digital trader, why would you still need to "find" the trader after each wave?  With technology, you should be able to access any digital interface anywhere - ANYTIME.  Why would you need to wait every end of the wave to access the digital trader?  I understand that the human trader needs to "close the shop and find a safe shelter" while the wave is ongoing but "shutting down" a digital trader will not save it from getting sawed off by a scrake.  Besides, many games have already implemented digital "shops" into their game.  Having a digital trader is another reason why KF2 is less special compared to KF1.\n\nThird, KF2 leveling feels so much faster than KF1.  Now this is purely subjective as some people hate the grind.  But watching someone go from level 0 to 25 in a few days wasn't something possible in KF1 unless you play on custom maps.  But personally I liked KF1 leveling much better as it really forces the players to learn to play the perk before being awarded max level.  By the time you are legitimately level 6, you would've experimented with all the guns and know which ones you prefer to use.  You can definitely tell which player speed leveled their perks by the way they play, use their guns/dosh and how they keep themselves alive.\n\nFourth, spawning with guns on low level perks is outrageous.  What made KF1 so satisfying is the reward that you get to spawn with a weapon or armor at level 5-6.  Spawning with weapons other than the default pistol and knife at low level perks is like starting a sandbox game or mmorpg and being given free midgame to endgame tier items.  The essence of being a newbie is gone.  The challenge and thrill of climbing your way up is gone.  You no longer start from scratch.  On top of this, when you die you don't restart with 100-200 dosh.  You respawn with 1000+ dosh, which typically is enough for you to buy 80% of your items back - or more if you happen to drop all your guns.  So in reality, you don't get punished as much for dying and players don't feel the importance of not dying as strongly as in KF1.  In KF1, once you die, you must face the consequence of losing a portion of your current dosh (and not spawn with more dosh) and lose your guns.  This is why teams in KF1 do their best to keep everyone alive.  This is one of the reasons why KF2 has turned into a boring FPS game IMO.  Oh yeah, did I forget to mention that weapons are scrambled into different perks?  Machete is a support weapon and vlad is a zerk's and katana isn't belonging to any perk. Hmm.\n\nFinally, the addition of a slasher is more frustrating THAN challenging.  If you are running away from a horde of zeds, you wouldn't want a zed to forcefully turn you around.  One slasher is not much of a nuisance but when there is a slasher in front of you and behind you, they just keep turning you around back and forth that you can't even shoot them without losing a good number of ammo.  This aspect of the game makes me so dizzy and makes me hate the way KF2 turned out to be.  Also the siren on KF1 is much better than the one on KF2.\n\nTLDR: Overall, KF2 had too much hype but it was a disappointing sequel to KF1 in my opinion.  The graphics upgrade is not exceptional - I personally don't mind if they kept KF1 graphics.  SC and FP on KF1 looked way better than the ones on KF2.  The characters also don't look impressive at all - so do other cosmetic items.  The impersonal trader is also not impressive.  There is no post-apocalyptic feel to any of these maps.  This game is just like L4D2, running around killing zombies yet never reaching safezone unless you kill them all.  You don't feel like a team on an extermination mission.  It is less strategic than KF1 and lots of running.  Very boring to play - I can't even get past 50 hours.  Quick to level, you get spoiled with guns right from when you start your KF2 career.  KF1 didn't need a sequel anyway.  It was still an amazing game even when KF2 came out.  After trying KF2, I found myself returning back to KF1.  If this was a YouTube channel, this is the point where I hit unsubscribe.\n\nFYI, some positive observations I've seen on KF2:\n-nice welding effects\n-more perks to choose from\n-addition of perk benefits tree is a brilliant idea\n-ability to choose levels of gore","April 6","false","28.6"," 61 of 101 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","61","101","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jr175/recommended/232090/","jr175","#SirJr175","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jr175/","61 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNothing like the first. (well in name and looks it's pretty similar but that's it) And so far not worth the 30 dollar premium for Early Access especially with microtransactions recently anounced.\n\nIf you liked the first you're SOL because it's nothing like the first game. This game is literally mooching off of the first game's success and image like an annoying parasite. What ever the - TWI wanted to do with the game had ruined a good better half or so of the game. There's no skill ceiling, silly animations/hitboxes, gaping balance issues that are an obvious fix away, and many other things that create superfluous artificial difficulty.\n\nIf you want a FORCED team based spam fest then this is it.\nThere is no soloing, depending on your own skill level and situation you either have someone or even everyone at once help you cover a side/kill a big one. Anything less and you're boned. (Why include the solo mode?) There is also an inherent need for certain perks on hard and above. You need a medic on almost every difficulty because the team lacks the effective means to operate without one whether it be lack of skill, squad cohesion, or actual recharge rate of the individual syringes. This lacked prevalence in the first game where one's own squad could keep everyone alive just by using the syringe. Yes, the useless tool that everyone uses on themselves in this game had another practical use in the previous game. This isn't to say the medic lacked actual use, but most would consider the need of one after a certain skill level obsolete.\n\nAnd let's not forget the returning cancerous part of the player base that thinks religously, perk level = skill. If you honestly think a player who has invested over tens of hundereds or thousands of hours into the first game isn't good enough or doesn't know what to do, then you might be right a small percentage of the time. The way the game is now, what seperates a good player from a bad player aside from skill is available perks within a perk tree. One Great example of this is Demo and Nuke. Don't have nuke? You're stuck with single shot weapons that do near to nothing or laughably meek against the perk's target Zed, the Fleshpound. Same with Firebad who usually relies on knockback and splash damage from his perk tree in order to effectively corral stray Zeds away from teammates and themselves. (No one can really make an effective argument for Demos used for crowd controlling Zeds, They're moving about too much and actually trying to kill the 4-5 clots doesn't justify the C4/RPG-7 ammo being used on them)\n\nFollowing up, the Perks, seemingly weaked by the dumbest tree system ever. Free choice? No. There never was a dichotomy in the first place. You're either being useful or useless when you pick a perk. One thing about a system like this is that perks are either Objectively equal in value or one is better than the other. There are a few that actually give free choice, but for the most part it's pretty much set in stone what a player runs with when they pick a perk. (That last part is false. Most people either ask the team or will be told what it is they will play as anyways. You can ignore these commands/etiquette but be prepared to get reprimanded from any entitled players on the server.)\n\nAlthough camping is near impossible/discouraged heavily with the current game/map design it is the most prevalent playstyle since the earliest iterations of either game. Ironically so, kiting is the most suicidal thing being encouraged currently, especially since it's been revealed that Zeds have the ability to teleport when stuck or far away and out of sight. (this has been toned down thanks to player feed back and you can no longer feel them being dumped right ontop of you, but it still happens every now and again.)\n\nThere are no combos or systems in place to encourage playing good or skillfully. (it doesn't make sense to buy things off perk anymore either) Anyone who played at the higher level in the first game practiced trigger control, exploited things like grenade stacking, and made use of flinches/mini-flinching that required actual practice for positioning, aiming, and timing. Any actions that were wasteful in the first are just as, if not more wastful and hurtful to the player, their ability to put zeds down, and his whole squad's survivability. (if you're messing around with a gun that you need to kill a certain zed with I can assure you that you will reliably run out more quickly)\n\nThe economy was exploitable in the first game sure, but it was merely because of simplistic design and patchable exploits that were never fixed. This game takes the delicate balance of the previous economy and tosses it in favor of a ridiculously more simple pricing system. Every perk has 4 guns in 4 tiers with arbitrarily fixed price points. Yes, off perk buys are more appealing since no one gets discounts and you always do about 80% of the maximum DPS of any weapon but it is such a system that renders certain weapons pointless and unviable.\nIf you play with proficiency or efficiency in mind when playing a certain role in your pseudo FORCED to play as a squad game, it renders certain loadouts or even whole tiers for several perks unecessary. It also leads to comparisons in tiers which outline what's good and what isn't. (If gun A in tier 2 is better than gun B in tier 2 gun B is obviously not worth the money. Worse is when a lower tier weapon preforms just as good or better than a higher tier weapon)\nAs a commando why buy the AK or the Scar when the SA80 provides more than enough rounds and damage to kill all the trash Zeds? Why buy either the nailgun or the silly eviscerator when you can get melee weapons that have infinite ammo and have more passive bonuses applied to them? As a support why bother with the Combat shotgun when the AA12 is only a couple of dosh away? The medic suffers the most as his 4th tier weapon out classes all of his other guns in both damage and healing potential. But wait! isn't that how it's supposed to be? Yes, and at the same time no. While it should be the best in it's category, one side effect is the mindless rush to procure one because anything less would lead to a lethal failure or be a complete waste.\n\nMake note that all of this was considering the higher difficulties. If you think normal is hard or should be remotely used as a point of reference for balance when the Zeds are being spoon fed to the players then this isn't really the kind of game you should play. No one plays any PvE game with progression just to play easy. (Think of what a joke beginner and normal were in the first game.) This also, is not a complete list of things wrong with the game. There is much more wrong in either design or the fact that the developers are pandering to the lowest common denominator when listening to feed back. A perk like zerk was fine, and now he is a broken mess.\n\nJust know that even as bad as TWI has made the first game over the years with cancerous content updates and DLC packs, it will still be better than this, "reimagining" of the first game's near perfect formula. Infact one of the reasons the first isn't as good as it could be is because of the number of bugs and exploits it was riddled with on the engine it was designed and made in. I get that this was supposed to be a good polish over a well aged game but this is ridiculous. If I were ever to recreate a game like the first in a series such as this one, it would never receive the proper name of a proper sequal being that it isn't the sequal that is being promised.","November 25, 2015","false","328.8"," 31 of 47 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","31","47","0","0"

Then, they're picked up by a developer for a commercial release. Putting Killing Floor on the map as a delightful, comedic, and fun as hell wave based survival game. Moving on they give plenty of free updates along side some paid updates to keep development afloat. Which was current with the trends of the industry.\n\nA couple years pass and they announce the second installment, promising a polished, and bloodier version of it's predecessor. Of course, only this time they've once again gone with industry trends, making an early access version.\n\nThey've delivered! -Mostly.\n\nLet's start off with the pros, shall we?\n\nExcellent, snappy, animations.\nModerate character customization.\nDisgusting gore system, painting the map red with viscera.\nExcellent visuals, using the Unreal 3 engine exceptionally.\nAnd possibly the most important, community mod support. Giving us essentially endless replayability.\nOf course it can't be all pure joy. There are plenty of complaints.\n\n4/10 classes at start of early access 6/10 current\nFew first party maps\nOne boring, inadequate boss, Hans Volter.\nOne handful of weapons to go along with the handful of perks.\nOriginally posted by Standard Internet Denizen:Why is he complaining? It's not finished.\nBecause, it's for sale, and first impressions for games like this really do count. Which is why I made emphasis on the lack of classes at the start. If I start up the successor of one of my favorite games I'm likely to start taking mental notes of the weight of the content. ESPECIALLY, when that game's improvements are so purposeless. If you honestly want what this game has to offer at it's meta, go play the first game. The first game is so incredibly similar to this game, the few differences are the speed at which the game plays, the graphical fidelity, and this new boss. Not to mention the first game is full of user-made content that will keep you busy for plenty of hours.\n\nOH, AND...\nMICROTRANSACTIONS?!\n\nYeah, go figure, they've announced microtransactions.\nHey, listen I'm all for supporting developers, but can we please not put microtransactions in a beta of a video game that you have to pay for? It's bad enough that they've gone after another pestilent industry trend of Paid Early Access.\nIt wouldn't be so bad had they come up with this at the end of the development cycle or a few months after release, but during pre-release stages it makes us look like mindless consumer zombies. Almost like they're the Patriarch and we're their mutant experiments.\n\nSo, in conclusion it is currently that I don't recommend this game. It's not worth your time or your money, especially if you have the first game. Just go play the first game and wait until this game sees its full release.\n\nIF and when it does impress me further, this review may change. However, this review deserves to be seen by potential customers, as I believe it is an accurate representation of the games content.","December 3, 2015","false","46.6"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","26","38","2","0"

Do not burn yourself out by playing too often, because you're going to be disappointed.

They feel great. They have excellent impact. Their models are spot-on. Their animations are very appealing. Their sounds are on point for the most part. Bullet velocity is unrealistically slow, but that's only apparent in ZED time.\n\n+ The game looks absolutely gorgeous. The lighting and fine detail on the maps are top-notch.\n\n+ Characters are not particularly memorable beyond the old favorites, but they all have many cosmetic options and excellently peformed voices. ZEDs as well are appropriately frightening and discusting with well-mixed grunts, screams, and voice lines.\n\n+ The gore system is excellent. Even hard-to-kill ZEDs give nice visual feedback. Guns rip appart enemies in responsive ways. Low-cal bullets chip away at a ZED's face to reveal its skull and brain as it's still walking. Bladed weapons split a ZED down the middle to reveal its full anatomy. Gorey soup goes flying when a ZED is hit by an explosive, etc.\n\n+ Soundtrack is not original, but well-compiled nonetheless. Hard and fast metal with a few electronic tracks that remain interesting for a while.\n\n+ Action is faster and more intense than Killing Floor 1. Camping one spot and one doorway has been replaced with faster humans, faster ZEDs, different spawn patterns, and areas that become less viable (lights/doorways get destroyed) to hold out in over time.\n\n+ Skills are much more well accounted for than in KF1. Progression takes a bit of investment but is not a never-ending grind like in the first game. Perk trees offer one of two interchangeable skills (that can be changed any round) for each 5 of the 25 levels in a tree. It's a simple-yet-complex system that gives most classes some good choice and variety, plus flat-out buffs each level increased.\n\n+ Steam Workshop support. A good distribution of maps, cosmetics ideas, weapon propositions, and other neat game tweaks. There are many servers that run custom maps that can keep the gameloop fresh.\n\n+ Well optimized. Lots of options to tweak for solid performance.\n\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n+- While maps are much more gorgeous and more detailed, they are also noticeably smaller than anything you'll find in KF1. While this serves to keep the team together, it's a shame there don't seem to be many vast landscapes to explore, and some maps get very samey.\n\n+- Microtransactions. I detest the principle of this move (I will explain that in the cons) more than the MTs themselves. It's very similar to the TF2 crate system with the Steam Market tie-in. The crates contain player cosmetics and weapon skins. While many of these skins are nothing short of cancerous, at least they are not game-affecting.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- "ZED Time", this game's "Bullet Time". I didn't like this system in KF1 either. Semi-randomly, a few times a round for a few seconds, time is slowed down and the world goes to shades of only black, white, and red. While visually neat, it's mostly an aggravation. Bullets move stupidly slow, making you have to do a lot of unnnecessary leading of targets. Many classes do not benefit from the extra percision. While an auto-rifle-wielding Commando or a percision-based Sharpshooter might enjoy ZED time, the AOE Firebug/Demo, close range shotgunning Support Specialist, non-percision-based Bezerker, or the reload-intensive Gunslinger benefit very little from this frequent occurrence.\n\n- The devs. "Early Access done right", they promised. The basic elements of the game have not arrived after over a year. Each class only has four weapons (1-3 of which you'll probably be using), there are only 7/10 classes in the game, and a small handful of maps. The devs claim they want player feedback, but instead of finishing the content the game was sold on, they allocate their resources towards a poorly balanced ZEDs vs Humans mode that no one asked for. Did I mention they're working on a PS3 version of an unfinished game?\nIn addition, microtransactions have been added midway through Early Access for a game that not only has a purchase price, but has future plans of paid DLC. Add the fact that they refer to updates as "free content packs", and you know Tripwire has been touched by the modern games industry in the wrong way.\nThis is not Overkill Studios level of abuse, so I will continue to the play the game, but very cautiously.\n\n- Versus Survival. The game was not originally designed around this the way Left 4 Dead was. As an afterthought, it is currently very imbalanced and unfun. Playing as ZEDs often results in instant slaughter. Their moves largely consist of mindlessly spamming mouse 1 to smack players with futility. Players are treated to new ZED attacks that consist of biological landmines and kamikaze attacks that make only the real challenge trying to wipe a bunch of annoying decals from your screen.\nThe mode is still in its infancy, but considering it's good enough for Tripwire to ship out, it's good enough to be critqued.\n\n- Class balance is quite out-of-whack. Classes like Demo have very few effective options low-to-mid level and can't hold their own too well. Classes like Medic seem blatantly overpowered in their seemingly infinite survivability and viability in all situations. One Medic seems good enough to wreck an entire game of Versus Survival for the ZEDs.\n\n\nOVERALL:\n\nI like the core gameplay loop. As many have said, it's like a KF1 2.0.

Brushed off the hate for the microtransactions. I guess I just really wanted to believe Trip Wire could deliver what we wanted, but they haven't. I haven't played the game in a few months because I was waiting for better content to be released, but they added a PvP mode similar to Left 4 Dead. ...WTF?\n\nTrip Wire, please get your priorities straight or give the license and IP to literally any triple A dev company because despite what nickel-and-dime strats they implement at least they'll finish the product. I know TWI is not a big company and it takes more time to flesh out more content as such, but you need to finish the core game before introducing new game modes or even microtransactions.

They feel great. They have excellent impact. Their models are spot-on. Their animations are very appealing. Their sounds are on point for the most part. Bullet velocity is unrealistically slow, but that's only apparent in ZED time.\n\n+ The game looks absolutely gorgeous. The lighting and fine detail on the maps are top-notch.\n\n+ Characters are not particularly memorable beyond the old favorites, but they all have many cosmetic options and excellently peformed voices. ZEDs as well are appropriately frightening and discusting with well-mixed grunts, screams, and voice lines.\n\n+ The gore system is excellent. Even hard-to-kill ZEDs give nice visual feedback. Guns rip appart enemies in responsive ways. Low-cal bullets chip away at a ZED's face to reveal its skull and brain as it's still walking. Bladed weapons split a ZED down the middle to reveal its full anatomy. Gorey soup goes flying when a ZED is hit by an explosive, etc.\n\n+ Soundtrack is not original, but well-compiled nonetheless. Hard and fast metal with a few electronic tracks that remain interesting for a while.\n\n+ Action is faster and more intense than Killing Floor 1. Camping one spot and one doorway has been replaced with faster humans, faster ZEDs, different spawn patterns, and areas that become less viable (lights/doorways get destroyed) to hold out in over time.\n\n+ Skills are much more well accounted for than in KF1. Progression takes a bit of investment but is not a never-ending grind like in the first game. Perk trees offer one of two interchangeable skills (that can be changed any round) for each 5 of the 25 levels in a tree. It's a simple-yet-complex system that gives most classes some good choice and variety, plus flat-out buffs each level increased.\n\n+ Steam Workshop support. A good distribution of maps, cosmetics ideas, weapon propositions, and other neat game tweaks. There are many servers that run custom maps that can keep the gameloop fresh.\n\n+ Well optimized. Lots of options to tweak for solid performance.\n\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n+- While maps are much more gorgeous and more detailed, they are also noticeably smaller than anything you'll find in KF1. While this serves to keep the team together, it's a shame there don't seem to be many vast landscapes to explore, and some maps get very samey.\n\n+- Microtransactions. I detest the principle of this move (I will explain that in the cons) more than the MTs themselves. It's very similar to the TF2 crate system with the Steam Market tie-in. The crates contain player cosmetics and weapon skins. While many of these skins are nothing short of cancerous, at least they are not game-affecting.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- "ZED Time", this game's "Bullet Time". I didn't like this system in KF1 either. Semi-randomly, a few times a round for a few seconds, time is slowed down and the world goes to shades of only black, white, and red. While visually neat, it's mostly an aggravation. Bullets move stupidly slow, making you have to do a lot of unnnecessary leading of targets. Many classes do not benefit from the extra percision. While an auto-rifle-wielding Commando or a percision-based Sharpshooter might enjoy ZED time, the AOE Firebug/Demo, close range shotgunning Support Specialist, non-percision-based Bezerker, or the reload-intensive Gunslinger benefit very little from this frequent occurrence.\n\n- The devs. "Early Access done right", they promised. The basic elements of the game have not arrived after over a year. Each class only has four weapons (1-3 of which you'll probably be using), there are only 7/10 classes in the game, and a small handful of maps. The devs claim they want player feedback, but instead of finishing the content the game was sold on, they allocate their resources towards a poorly balanced ZEDs vs Humans mode that no one asked for. Did I mention they're working on a PS3 version of an unfinished game?\nIn addition, microtransactions have been added midway through Early Access for a game that not only has a purchase price, but has future plans of paid DLC. Add the fact that they refer to updates as "free content packs", and you know Tripwire has been touched by the modern games industry in the wrong way.\nThis is not Overkill Studios level of abuse, so I will continue to the play the game, but very cautiously.\n\n- Versus Survival. The game was not originally designed around this the way Left 4 Dead was. As an afterthought, it is currently very imbalanced and unfun. Playing as ZEDs often results in instant slaughter. Their moves largely consist of mindlessly spamming mouse 1 to smack players with futility. Players are treated to new ZED attacks that consist of biological landmines and kamikaze attacks that make only the real challenge trying to wipe a bunch of annoying decals from your screen.\nThe mode is still in its infancy, but considering it's good enough for Tripwire to ship out, it's good enough to be critqued.\n\n- Class balance is quite out-of-whack. Classes like Demo have very few effective options low-to-mid level and can't hold their own too well. Classes like Medic seem blatantly overpowered in their seemingly infinite survivability and viability in all situations. One Medic seems good enough to wreck an entire game of Versus Survival for the ZEDs.\n\n\nOVERALL:\n\nI like the core gameplay loop. As many have said, it's like a KF1 2.0. I sometimes miss the larger maps and the ability to hold out without being quickly overwhelmed by the surrounding spawn system, but the new visuals, guns, and gore make me feel at home. HOWEVER, the uncertainty of what bullsugar the devs are gonna pull next combined with the fact that it feels rather light on content now means you should probably hold off until it's "done" done.\n\n","April 12","false","130.8"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","0"

There have barely been any patches other than that. Early access games are meant to be developed ALONGSIDE the playerbase, effectively using them as playtesters. Not only has tripwire neglected this, they've outright BETRAYED the community. Most of the content coming out for the game won't be availible until release, which completely defeats the purpose of Early Access at all. They effectively just wanted your money sooner, so they didn't have to wait until the actual release of the game to hoard all the dosh. Sometime in the next week or 2 (maybe) there is another content patch coming. This patch, along with the last one, should have been added in the first MONTH of early access, not 7-10 months down the road with no news or updates. There was an almost 5 month period of NOTHING. No content, no updates, nothing.\n\nNow, for the best part. Just today, Tripwire has announced microtransactions for Killing Floor 2. So, what we have now is a game that is BARELY 50% complete, and now, since the THIRTY-TWO CANADIAN DOLLAR entrance fee wasn't enough, they now want more of your precious dollarydoos for cosmetics. While many people will argue that since it is cosmetic, there is no reason to be upset, that it has no effect on your game whether you have them or not. Well, it DOES have an effect on the game. Effort is being taken away from ACTUALLY MAKING THE DAMN GAME to asking for you to fork out more hard earned cash to fill their already inflated pockets.\n\nPlease understand, I love Killing Floor, and I love what Tripwire has done in the past, but for now, I'm done with this game. This was one of the games I was hyped for more than other in 2014 and this past year, but now, I probably won't be touching it until it comes out. If it ever comes out.\n\nPlease, if you haven't bought it already, please refrain from doing so, at least until the proper release.

Personally I don't care too much about microtransactions (like KF1), but the thing which I hate is the "skin quality" system. It's such a dumb thing in the first place, if someone is going to pay/gamble their way into acquiring the skin, at least give them something which they know will look clean, not some bs battle-scarred rubbish. If people actually want that look, give them an option to buy it. (As seen in CS:GO this also leads to scamming trades with fake screenshots)\n\nThe reason why I'm writing this is in the hopes that the developer's reconsider what they're doing (like Skyrim & paid mods) and evaulate with the COMMUNITY on how to make the game better during its time in Early Access rather than how to get some easy cash.\n\nI also noticed in some of the other reviews that the developers weren't actually allowing us "Early Access" as they would delay the updates to allow time for reviews to be written. This actually makes a negative impact on the development of the game as the developers would have invested too much time and money into a concept, which backfires if it is not a good prospect, like the announcement of microtransactions.\n\nI doubt the developers thought that they would lose so many fans, but this is the harsh reality which occurs when people are met with drastic changes to something they are familiar with.\n\nAbout the game:\nIts great, but its not heading in a great direction with the current microtransaction updates.

It was supposed to be released till the end of the year - instead of that we had only one major update, which was cynically called "Free content DLC"  and the announcement of microtransactions. I do not care how optional they are - they are going to be included before the final content from what it seems. It is clear enough where the focus of the developers is.\n\nIn the meantime with the last updates (skin types make big Zeds almost invulnerble if you do not have the right classes to deal with them) the big Zeds are wrecking. No more fun in casual games with random people - better get your organised team, having Berserk to tank, healer to keep the team, comando to clear trash, demo to kill Flesh Pounds and whatever class is most effective vs Scrakes aside from zerk. It is a miracle to reach boss on Hard with random people these days.\n\nThe game in the start of the Early-Access was hard, but fun and rewarding. Now it feels like a pain to play on anything but normal, unless you have a team. I am sure hard-core Killing Floor fans would enjoy it - but this is no longer the causal fun for me. Things might change when the last 4 classes are released, but with the current speed that will take another 7 months - thanks, but no, thanks. More likely to have more gun and character skins.\n\nIf you are not hardcore Killing Floor fan, I would advice to wait until release and see in what state the game will be by then. And if you are, and you are not bothered by the latest updates and microtransactions announcement by the least - keep throwing money at the screen.\n\nEDIT: After last big update- I mean "FREE CONTENT DLC PACK! FOR FREE!!!" - medic useful traits nerfed to the ground instead of buffing the useless ones - good job. Talking about artificially bumping the difficulty, so people can say how hardcore you are, well done. And speaking of pointless nerfs - I am sadly looking at you, Berserker. Oh, how the mighty have fallen with all the talent + claymore nerfs. That +1 HP on kill from Vampiric though! A whooping +4 HP, from +3 previously - must pick now. Let`s also not forget the big Commando ammo price/kalashnikov mags capacity nerfs and the major price increase of the Support`s AA-12 from the previous major update.\n\nPredicition for next patch - even MORE hats, Firebug and Gunslinger nerfs. Zerk`s Vampiric talent increased from +4 to +4,5 HP per kill, because let`s face it - +5 is too much.\n\nI have been just slightly sarcastic. A little bit more of it would spoil the milk in the fridge two rooms from here.\n\nUPDATE: The bug in which the game randomly changes your perk after entering menus still hasn`t been fixed. This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t has been going on for months. If you play with gamepad and decide to change talent between waves, the game randomly changes your perk and you are stuck with it untill the end of the wave. This is simply ridiculous.","November 23, 2015","false","228.1"," 72 of 122 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","72","122","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/motherbeefish/recommended/232090/","motherbeefish","Mother Beef","http://steamcommunity.com/id/motherbeefish/","213 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nhere is my two-cents on the game/TWI in general. -\n\nFirst things first, i'd be lying if I said I do not enjoy the game, or that the game is a broken mess. In fact, i've put a decent 96hrs into the game - arguably i'd say ive got my "moneys worth" already. But with all the drama associated with this Early Access it's certainty come with a 'price' on how I feel towards both the game and TWI as a company. As a result, withstanding my enjoyment of the game, I probably will never back a Early Access title from Tripwire Interactive again.\n\nThese guys make some fantastic games, Red Orchaestra is brilliant, Killing Floor is a bunch of fun. But unfortunately the way they actually develop their games could do with some serious work. KF2 players have long complained about how long the games updates have been taking, the infrequency of any form of patch, big or small (Or 'Free Content Packs' as they arguably misleadingly call them), a massive lack of communication, and actually quite a few unprofessional, aggressive comments coming from the developers themselves. (One dev stated that legally they owe EA backers nothing, and that we bought the product as is, and that they could abandon it whenever they wanted despite the promises made. Whilst this is technically true it doesnt feel good as a customer to hear a developer say that to you.) Of course this is then coupled with some of the microtransaction controversy, which whilst cosmetic and expected (the U.I from day 1 suggested it) came out arguably at a poor time when the game is largely content starved, and select cross-promotional weapons being better than ones available to all players (which was fixed....4 or so months after players complained...). Personally I have no issue with the cosmetic transactions, I play CSGO/Dota2 and I see how well it can be implemented, I just think it was primarily done at a really, really poor time - which given how TWI have ran this Early Access, is incredibly fitting.\n\nNow there is nothing inherently wrong with a development team taking their time with a product, if any company knows that itd being TWI with the absoltuely terrible mess of a game that was Red Orchestra 2 on launch, BUT, so far it's been the matter in which TWI has stood themselves and how poor they have been at handling their audience and customers. People will rebut and say that "noone likes seeing how the sausage is made" in regards to Early Access fatigue, but it really isnt that. I get that games are hard to make, audiences are hard to talk to and that everything takes a long time. I just havent enjoyed the way that theyve acted, it doesnt seem professional, I get that they must deal with some real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on the forums etc... but god damn dont take it out on the community or be ignorant for the sake of it. I guess the only reality in that sausage analogy is that i've never had the 'joy' of interacting with developers so much, sure you see devs over at /r/rainbow6 or /r/GlobalOffensive but its different.\n\nI am super excited to see what they do with Rising Storm 2, but i'm not going to give TWI a single cent until at least a few weeks after that game launches completely 100% done. I will avoid their EA like a plague.\n\nI'll be happy to provide further examples/answer any questions needed, please refrain from just being outwardly aggressive, im fine with a discussion/civil argument/debate if you intend to defend TWI, but lets not make this childish.\n\n\nEdit - the whole 'we owe you nothing in EA' thing can be seen here - http://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/showthread.php?p=1429890#post1429890","November 23, 2015","false","96.1"," 50 of 82 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","50","82","0","0"

It's really telling of where their priorities lie.

But this simply isn't the time for them, this is the time to make the content for the game. It is a shameful thing to do and sends a message that Tripwire is more concerned about lining their pockets than delivering to their customers who already paid them; paid them in good will, as that is what EA is all about.

I personally was 90% of the time against "zed time" because it ♥♥♥♥ed up what i was trying to do and i guess i was trying to kill something and am very impatient haha. But they definitely made it smoother and even on crappier computers i didn't experience any lag because of it, unlike its predecessor.\n\nMelee is definitely better in my opinion. Especially for the class berserker. Even in the lower levels you can dish out some damamge with melee in that class. Personally id like to see maybe some dual wielding melee? People have asked me how that would work and my answer? "Crazy autistic spin attacks". And I'm sticking by that.\n\nBut yeah they should get to adding dual wielding weapons in general. I miss my dual magnums.\n\nAnother thing im missing is the crossbow. I also think i regular bow and arrow set up would be cool as ♥♥♥♥. *hint*\n\nRemember that katana from killing floor 1? Sorry berserkers they've given that to support class. Which is kinda a bummer.\n\nBut anyways. Leveling up doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing take forever now. That's right! and there is up to i believe 25 levels? We all got bored easy in the first one because of that level 6 gold sticker cap right? Well be frustrated no more!\n\nSpeaking of classes, there are only 4 currently, Berserker, Field Medic, Commando, and Support Class. But i hear they'll be adding more. including ones that weren't in the first game. I'm just waiting for sharp shooter to return to us.\n\nWe don't have the patriarch btw we have "Hans" , some snarky old german ♥♥♥ scientist that prob should be dead with all the chemicals pumping through him. I hear we will be getting more "final bosses" as well! exciting!\n\nThe cool part of leveling up/collecting XP that i forgot to mention is that you can earn XP for a class you aren't currently playing by simply using their class weapons. I love that SO MUCH.\n\nThey just added another map so now i think there are 5? Devs or Modders need to get on that, one of my only complaints. The maps we do have are amazingly detailed though. Very nice.\n\nWe also need more weapons. It seems there are two weapons per class that do the  most damage so most people after a certain wave will just use those two weapons for the rest of the game. It gets boring/repetitive after a while. I hear devs are working on that and besides the lack of maps this is my only other gripe. We REALLY NEED MORE WEAPONS.\n\nBut besides that this game does not nix the original. Probably because the original has so many classes, maps, and weapons. I'll hold my tongue til leader to see if i no longer have a use for kf 1. Until then i happily play both and i can rarely say that about most of these type of games personally.\n\nSo in total? 11/10 this game is amazeballs and well as the hilarious community.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SillyScream/recommended/232090/","SillyScream","Silly Scream","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SillyScream/","999 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMost probably the best co-op game i have ever played!\nKilling Floor 2 allows you to play as 1 out of 6 classes together with up to 5 friends (or strangers) on 4 different difficulties and 6 different maps.\nDoes not sound good enough for you? Let's go into detail.\n\nThere are currently 6 classes in KF2\n\n- Berserker, a meele class which is incredibly good at killing big Zeds and tanking them for hours\n- Commando, a ranged class with focus on Assault rifles which supports good aim, perfect to take out zeds on long range\n- Support, a shotgun using class which can give out ammo to other teammates and devastate hords of zombies with a few shots\n- Medic, well, the healing class. Using pistols, shotguns, SDW, and Assault rifles with a secondary heal mode\n- Demolition, the explosive specialist. He loves to blow up zed's like its 1944 all over again\n- Firebug, who quickly gets into heat and burns the zeds to dust. HIs favourite food? Kentucky Fried Zeds\n\nBefore you hop into the game you can customize your character. You can change the main appearance, a few  accessories like hats and glasses, and maybe the clothing. Owning other games like KF 1, RO2 and Chivalry grants you additional game content. (Greatsword, new characters)\n\nYou can use the official matchmaking or server browser to play with friends or other people. While doing that you can choose one of the 4 difficulties. Normal, Hard, Suicidal and Hell on Earth.\n\nNormal: pretty "normal", you can run around solo or stick to the group. A heal is recommended for the last boss.\nHard: You should now start to learn how to play as a group, a Medic should be with your team starting wave 3-4.\nSuicidal: Teamplay is crucial. Your Medic should know his job, otherwise you might get into trouble. Boss Zeds are a real pleasure to take care of now.\nHeall on Earth: Only try this if you have people who you can rely on (or you are a masochist). Teamplay ist absolutely crucial, your medic should be very good and knowledge about your class is a must.\n\nThe maps.\nBiotics Lab:  The classic. Its a Lab where zeds are getting researched.\nBurning Paris: Pretty self explaining. You fight in the streets and metro of Paris agains the horde of Zeds.\nCatacombs: An archaeological site which made a pretty frightning discovery...\nVolter Manor: A huge manor with underground research lab. Seems like a few test subjects flew.\nEvacuation Point: The Danish military tried to evacuate. Didnt turn out well, the ship got overrun.\nOutpost: An Outpost somewhere in one of the snowy regions. Beware, winter is coming...\n\nThe enemies are quite similar to Killing Floor 1.\nThere are the following ones coming at you during the normal waves:\nClot - basic zombie\nCyst - a zed without eyes, who will try and grab you\nSlasher - an advanced Zed with spikes who tries to grab and bite you\nCrawler - a crawling Zed who loves to jump into your face\nGorefast - a zed with swords instead of arms\nStalker - weak, but annoying. This one can make himself nearly invisible to flank and attack you\nBloat - a huge zombie who pukes at players to blind and damage them\nHusk - a Zed with a flamethrower/Heat gun on his right arm\nSiren - a zed who shouts at you, damaging you and destroying any kind of grenades\nScrake - a Boss zed with a Chainsaw, able to quickly devastate a player\nFleshpound - a Boss zed with 2 spiked Gauntlets. He loves to break through your defense and kill the group\nThe Boss - Not going to spoil this one\n\nPlaying Killing Floor 2 casually or professionally is both entertaining. You can burn, shoot, blow up and knife the zeds on normal, or you try to achieve something special and aim for hell on earth. Its up to you what to go for.\nDo not turn off sound, you will enjoy the music, which is a huge plus of the game.\n\n9/10. Missing a little bit variety once you beat the higher levels.\n\n18.12.2015 UPDATE:\n\nWith the update recently they added some more stuff.\n\nFirstly, a new class, the Gunslinger! A one/dual-wielding Pistol maniac who loves to snipe Zeds.\nThen, 2 new(old) maps! Farmhouse, a small map with just 2 buildings and some outside area, and Black Forest, a huge map with lots of free areas to roam around. A few buildings and some interesting extras complete this wonderfull map.\nThats not it yet - we even got a new (FREE) character, available when joining the official community-group (doable by clicking on "follow" on the store page).\n\nAnd, no surprise at all, they introduced the Patriarch. A redesign of the KF final boss who is back to kill us again! He adds variety to the fights and loves to annihilate the whole group with his rocket launchers!\n\nLast but not least: The Trading Floor.

Nearly every aspect of the game has been improved upon but not changed drastically enough to be unfamiliar. As of writing only 4 perks and a handful of maps are available, with more known to come, so I won't review based on the amount of content available but the quality. I'm not usually one to be impressed by visuals but KF2 is leaps and bounds above the original in this respect. Animations are much more natural and smooth, and enemies look much more threatening. The new gore system is pretty much as advertised, I don't think it's as big of a deal though. Characters can now be limitedly customized, and each character has its own voice acting which is very nice. Perks have been expanded a bit, with a sort of "skill tree" aspect alongside the normal passives, and xp gain is changed so that you don't have to grind stalkers forever or tape down lmb with the welder next to a sealed door to level up. Guns feel mostly the same, just a few touch-ups. Core gameplay is pretty much unchanged from KF1, but given that the core gameplay was the selling point of the original it's understandable that they wouldn't tamper with it. KF2 also strikes an interesting balance between seriousness and humor; on the one hand, the atmosphere of the game is much darker and the visuals/sound effects push the feel closer to the horror genre. On the other hand, money is literally referred to as "dosh" and some of the voice lines are ridiculous and hilarious. Overall KF2 is a more polished and expanded version of KF1, and what more would you want?\n\n(I also want to note that the game is very polished and stable for an Early Access title, it's not the sort of game where you'd be buying it now to support future development; it's more than playable in its current state)","April 23, 2015","true","26.6"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","9"

Updates take 5-7 months each and in between there are no smaller balance updates/bug fixes. Bugs present in April or added in August (the month the first major update was released) have not been fixed and likely won't be until the next big update, if they're fixed at all. The latest announcement of the addition of a crate/microtransaction-based cash-shop is disheartening considering the game is maybe half finished. I'm not sure why Tripwire chose to prioritize this over delivering on promised material that we've already paid for, or fixing the content they've already released.

The basic weapons and generally act of shooting enemies feels great. Poor balance and boring classes definitely hold the monster killing back from true greatness, but there's good enemy variety and the maps are good enough so it's fun enough with friends. It's a coop horde shooter. You know pretty much exactly what you're getting into. Killing Floor 2 is also probably the least glitchy early access game I've played, but there's also almost no longevity or replay value at the moment due to how unfinished the game is from a pure content standpoint. There are very few maps, only around half of the classes are in the game, and the weapon variety within any given class is fairly poor. If you like playing a specific class most of the time, which you'll need to do to actually level it up and make it useful, you'll get bored of using the same few weapons really fast. The cherry on top of the crap cake? There's a lot of shady stuff happening on Tripwire's end.\n\nFor starters, updates take forever to come out and when they do, they don't add anything that's going to actually make you play the game for more than an hour before shelving it again. Even worse, Tripwire felt it necessary to add microtransactions before the game was even remotely finished. This should annoy me less than the microtransaction debacle that was Payday 2, but again, this game isn't even done yet. There's still very little reason to play this based on how little there is to do, but hey, feel free to waste money on weapon skins.\n\nMy next and final complaints are going to sound really nitpicky, but I think they show just how little Tripwire understands Early Access. First is that they keep referring to the patches that add in new stuff as "free content packs" like they're doing the community some huge favor instead of literally just finishing a game we've already paid full price for. It's like they expect us to be incredibly impressed with them for doing their job. Second is that they give journalists access to those "free content packs" before the community. You know, the community that already bought the game in Early Access for the express purpose of, oh gosh, I dunno, having access to the game early? You know, before just about everyone else? But I guess hyping up those "free content packs" that are full of microtransactions and very few actual reasons to play the game is more important than supporting or engaging with the community that's funding your game.\n\nCongrats, Tripwire.

The player picks a character and skillset, and is tasked with killing multiple waves of enemies of increasing strength that culminate in a final wave with a boss battle. During the waves, players earn money to spend on weapons, armor, and ammuntion at vendors between waves. Players also earn experince for various actions that goes towards the skillset that the action compliments; healing another player increases medic experience, welding doors increases support experience, etc. As the player's experince in a skillset increases they are able to choose perks that apply to the skillset, as well as receive a passive stat boost.\n\nUnfortunately, this is where we run into the game's major problem: once you've played a handful of games, you've seen pretty much all that there is to see. The game is starved for content. There's only one game mode, there's only a handful of maps, and while there is a decent selection of weapons to choose from, most are quickly rendered ineffective in comparison to a small handful of high powered guns as the waves increase in strength. And the skillsets are also very unbalanced, with some being all but useless.\n\nNow those drawbacks are understandable, as the game is currently in early access and more features will supposedly be added or rebalanced as development continues. However, the developers recently announced that they are introducing marketable microtransactions and DLC in the game. Given that they have not finished developing the core game they should not be busy putting bilking more money from their customers over actually finishing the core game. Their claim is that the revenue generated from the microtransactions will be used to help development costs, but given that this is a game that players already paid to play, this argument doesn't float. This sort of thing is only acceptable in free to play games that do not have an initial point of sale to generate revenue.\n\nIn summary, I cannot possibly reccomend this game to anyone. It is too light on content for its asking price, and the developers have shown that they have more interest in generating addional revenue over finishing their product.\n\nIf you have bought this recently, I strongly advise that you request a refund.","November 23, 2015","false","14.7"," 89 of 154 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","89","154","3","0"

Everything that made the original game the memorable, but largely under-appreciated, piece of sadistic art it was, is back – only this time they cranked up the awesome-factor to 11. You will be tearing Zeds to literal pieces with a variety of very satisfying weapons, such as the Zed-shredding AA12 Shotgun, the head-popping SCAR-H Assault Rifle, and the bone-crushing Pulverizer. Even though the game may be lacking when it comes to weapon quantity, it certainly makes up for it in quality. Every weapon feels like it was carefully crafted, and they all act and feel unique – and with promises of even more killing machines luring right around the corner, we're surely in for a real treat.\n\nHowever, while quality over quantity may apply to the weapon department of the game, the same can't be said about maps. Compared to the original game that had dozens and dozens of maps, all with varying themes, layouts, and level of difficulty, the sequel does not. While the very few that are available hold a rather high standard, and I'd argue that they are all fun, there are simply too few of them to keep you engaged for longer periods of time. So even if you're the kind of person that doesn't need a lot of variation, once you've beaten/mastered the 6 maps available (as of November 2015), there's not a whole lot left for you to do. So while it is acceptable (and even understandable) for Tripwire to take their time with new weapons, new classes, perk changes, and other impactful ideas, pushing out maps faster – even in a rough, unfinished state – would surely both engage the community in the game's development, and add to the game's much needed longevity.\n\nIt is because of this that I cannot, at this time, recommend this game to anyone. The game shows a lot of promise, and it is possible that it will develop into a beautiful butterfly with time, but as of right now, the game is just a gross, slimy, caterpillar.

Good job, Tripwire.\nThe game has it's good points, the animations for the guns are amazing and the graphics in general are great too. Sadly, they made some bad decisions too, like the clot grab aim assist, the obviously console user friendly voice command menu and the teleporting zeds mechanic, as well as the snail pace updates.\nWhen i first bought this game i was promised a late 2015 release date, the way things are looking now (27/11/15) and judging by the rate the updates have been coming out, this promise is unlikely to be kept. It has been months since the last content update, which added the Demolitionist and Firebug perks, and they had the gall to call it a "free content pack", masking the fact that it was content us customers paid for. 4 months pass and they start teasing the next update which is going to add the new Gunslinger perk, after about a month of releasing a few videos and concept art they announce Microtransactions.\nIt has been 4 months since the last meaningful content update and they decide it's a good idea to throw in the terrible loot crate system from TF2? Seriously Tripwire? Microtransactions in an early access title? The point of EA is to support games in development, the 30 dollars that you charged me and countless others to beta test your game is enough to support you until the game is finished. Adding MTs at this point is purely because of greed. Hell, even adding them after you finished the game (Q4 2018 at this rate) would be unacceptable, seeing as this is a priced game and not some F2P MMO.\nZed-conomy they call it, i call it cancer.","November 23, 2015","false","83.1"," 68 of 116 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","68","116","2","0"

To be honest, one of the best I've played in quite a while. However, it sometimes spontaneously stops working. It will work one day and not the next, and that is absolutely infuriating. If tripwire would ever focus on these issues, I would give the game a very good review, but that is not the case. I bought it on the early access during the first day and it remains unreliable, and borderline unusable. PLEASE FIX.\n\nEDIT:\nSince the last time I reviewed, the problem I was having was fixed, and I was able to enjoy the game, which is really fun when it works. True, the content system with paid guns and merch is annoying and expensive, and should never have been added in early access, and the content is almost never updated, there aren't enough classes and after a while the maps get repetitive, but I can't help but still enjoy the gameplay. However, that doesn't mean that I can, with good conscience, recommend the game to someone who hasn't already got it, not in Early access, and with content updates being as slow as they are. When the updates (if ever) become more frequent, or they release the full version, I will change my review happily.","December 27, 2015","false","97.9"," 27 of 41 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","27","41","0","0"

I wanted to believe you were one of the few devs that could keep an Early Access project engaging and exciting...and for a good chunk of the year, you did. I've sunk a lot of hours into this game, very fondly. Leveled up almost all of the perks at least halfway. Maxed out one, close to maxing out another - but enough's enough. The game as is is just, insufficient. Woefully incomplete - the foundation is amazing but you can't just paint over that a million times and expect everyone to ♥♥♥♥ themselves excitedly and give you all of their money.\n\n♥♥♥♥, now you wanna include microtransactions? Can you at least wait until the game's finished? No I guess not - gotta make a bunch of money somehow. Lotta sperglords in the higher difficulty level lobbies that'll love that cosmetic ♥♥♥♥. I for one couldn't care less. You should have integrated full workshop support a long time ago, not just approving what MIGHT be available...and speaking of lobbies, no listen servers? No opportunities for friends to play on their own? That's not to disparage the community of this game, y'all are some funny, punctual sonsa♥♥♥♥♥es, with the exception of the aforementioned sperglords.\n\nSo, for anyone who's debating whether or not to pick this game up, take it from someone who supported this game from day one - someone who's friends told him he was throwing away his money but didn't listen because the shooting mechanics are outrageously fun, the gore and giblets are literally mind blowing, the graphics are phenomenal, the music is stellar, the flow and pacing trumps the first, the maps are awesome and Hans is a hell of a boss ~ it isn't worth it. Not so long as Tripwire refuses to finish their game. You wanna know exactly how much they don't care? They released a patch for Red Orchestra 2, a game which for all intents and purposes is dead unless you and a few friends hop into a bot lobby before releasing more content for this game.\n\nThe only reason I will continue to play is for my friends' sakes. We have fun, but we're not happy. Not in the slightest - and I don't think two more maps, one more perk and one more boss is going to change that. So, Tripwire, from the bottom of my heart please, get your ♥♥♥♥ together and finish this game. It can't be that ♥♥♥♥ing hard, stop sucking the SJW teet for two minutes and remember you guys make VIDYA GAEMS first and foremost, okay?

Microtransactions have absolutely no place in a paid game. I was slightly okay with the DLC added to KF1 because it was added after the game was considered finished and they also added in a lot of free content after the fact as well such as new maps and weapons. Right now, there are not nearly enough weapons, levels, or classes to consider this a finished game, of which even the developers admit because the game is still is in Early Access.

However, every update after v1008 has arguably been to the detriment of the game.\n\n7 months after the Early Access launch of the game and after >500K titles sold they decided to announce the addition of a cash key crate random qualified item microeconomy on TOP of an ingame store. The fact that this additional monetization plans were not disclosed previously effectively disallowed the possibility of refunds or an educated purchase on the matter for countless players.\n\nTWI further specified that the microtransactions would involve "cosmetics only at launch"; and promptly delineated preliminary plans to include additional weapons with new gameplay, characters, voicepacks and other items for sale. Additionally, they left the door open for future STAT/XP boosts depending on community feedback.\n\nThe slated initial goal for release was Q4 2015. Moreover, feature creep appears to be affecting development design and focus as PVP and Game Conductor (variable difficulty depending on player skill/level) have been rushed into the game. At this point in time, the game has nearly every monetization model that can be found in modern gaming with the exception of a subscription model, more than many F2P games in the market:\n\nMonetization models at play:\n\n1.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198019816127/recommended/232090/","76561198019816127","Vika Vintorez","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198019816127/","473 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nKilling Floor 2 is the sequel to the wonderous and DLC-loaded Killing Floor 1, which was a great game if what you wanted was a zed-shooting chav convention. Killing Floor was known for its frenetic and panic-ridden atmosphere, along with class-based teamwork orientated combat. Due to the funky mechanics of the game, certain classes were great, other classes were pointless in comparison, and some classes had situational use. The original had 7 classes, whereas Killing Floor 2 promises to deliver on up to 10 or more different classes. Killing Floor 2 does some things better that its predecessor does fairly poorly. I speak, of course, of grinding. The leveling requirements of certain classes meant that although players were encouraged to use mechanics based around the class they chose, it also pigeonholed them into using those features and the game quickly became difficult to endure as hours and hours of grinding were required to reach level 6, the maximum level of a class. Class levels also meant that newer players were outright 'worse' than veteran players, in addition to their lack of experience with the myriad of special enemies. This exacerbated the core issue where certain classes might have appeal to early players but were rapidly outclassed by other classes; this pool includes Commando, easily the weakest class in the game, and Firebug, a class that requires patience and know-how to play effectively, as well as being outclassed in terms of raw damage.\n\nKilling Floor 2 does address some of these issues, splitting the level gain and benefits across 25 levels instead of a mere 6, allowing players to enjoy certain class benefits earlier. However, the currently limited pool of 4 classes left out Sharpshooter, the most important special zed killer of the game, and Demolitionist (or 'demoman'), the go-to blob slaughterer capable of annihilating entire formations of weak zeds. This means that the only way to combat high-threat zeds such as Scrakes or Fleshpounds on equal footing involves going Berserker, a class that has seen better days.\n\nBerserker suffered some nerfs, namely the loss in improved movement speed(no longer true as of  4/23/15), and the loss of the most powerful well-rounded melee weapon, the katana; it is now counted as an offperk weapon avaliable to everyone, and is a bit weaker than its previous incarnation. Berserker's high-risk high-reward fighting style requires incredible amounts of practice to get just right, which is made worse by their weaker damage resistance. Berserkers must now use the new blocking system to be effective, allowing them to push zeds back as a temporary bulwark; notably, this method does not work well against the Fleshpound, which is tougher than any other zed except the bosses. Add to this fact that Fleshpounds now enrage far more readily and do so at any given opportunity, you will find using a Berserker to safely take one down is nothing more than a vain hope. The fact that Berserkers can now be grappled by clots(unless you take a level 10 skill) means you may end up wasting that power attack on a random clot instead of the Scrake you were stunlocking. As before, Berserkers without a medic constantly keeping an eye on them is a dead Berserker.\n\nSupport, however, retains much of their staying power with the AA12 and other shotguns; this allows them to maul anything, Scrakes included, into mulch most of the time. However, enemies have a disturbing tendency to 'teleport', sometimes right on top of you, and their shotguns have small magazine size(unchanged from the original) which makes this phenomenon worse. Interestingly enough, the AA12's recoil is far more controllable than the commando's AK-12, with less wavering to the left and right of the target and less muzzle lift during automatic fire.\n\nMedic remains the most important core class comparatively, due to their ability to save team members from certain death. Their medic grenades work just like in the original, putting down a healing field that hurts zeds and is arguably the most useful grenade in the game currently. Their medic weapons are slightly stronger than before, although like Support, Medic has not changed much. The homing healing dart is useful in certain circumstances but given that most enemies 'teleport' to around your general location this may not be as useful as you would hope, as the tracking dart only works if you aim down the sights(no longer) at a player and 'lock on'. As you will be hip-firing at the general location of a zed's head at any given time, you will find that healing darts are the same as before: they require lots of practice and teammates that you can actually count on to let a Medic do their job. Trying to heal a stranger is like trying to hit a target from 100m with a nail gun.\n\nCommando is again the weakest class in the game in terms of raw damage; their assault rifles have very hefty recoil and have a very very bad tendency to go to the left and right of the intended target instead of the target itself. Aiming down the sights makes their weapons a lot more effective; again, chances are you'll be running and aiming down the sights is basically a form of suicide. Due to their lack of firepower, Commandos are comparatively useless early-on until they start benefiting from mid to late-game features such as improved reloading speed. They are a class that requires heavy investment just to become usable, if not useful. If you play a Commando, remember to take a medic pistol and help the poor Medic out. You can spare a few shots of your own so that the Support or Berserker can keep going.\n\nThe most major problems with the beta are pathing and 'teleportation'. As someone who has watched more than one B-movie, the serial killer teleportation schtick seems to work somewhat. However, the fact that zeds can teleport INTO YOU, thus displacing your location by sheer happenstance, is incredibly annoying. I've had a bloat spawn right 'under' where I was standing, causing me to stand on top of the Bloat and a large blob of zeds; it then hit me with the bile a microsecond later. The fact that zeds can spawn near or right next to you can prove daunting and dangerous; this problem is made worse by the fact that all zeds benefit from this 'teleport nearer you' ability, preventing you from kiting by sheer dint of literally appearing where you are. On the off-chance a tough enemy or a deadly one such as a Siren, Scrake, or Fleshpound happens to do so, this may result in one or more players dying due to the spawning system.\n\nPathing in this game was pretty good, until it wasn't. Halfway through the game zeds started 'blinking' past objects by 'walking' on them, thus an inpediment such as a chest-high wall which easily prevents players from jumping over would pose no such challenge to even a Bloat. This is a relatively minor issue until you realize that you have been cornered on Laboratory due to the huge prevalance of chest-high obstructions. Add in the teleporting zeds, and it becomes incredibly easy to get trapped when you shouldn't be.\n\nAn issue that is somewhat seperate from the above two is hitboxes. Sometimes a shot that should hit 'flesh' would veer past off into the sunset because the hitbox is very specifically determined; you can test this best by attempting to shoot a Stalker when she does her flip jump. A blast from a shotgun completely missed, with every pellet flying past despite having to have cleanly struck the torso. It may be lag, but given that the next shot took off her head, I doubt it. This is still true as of 4/23/15, unlike the berserker movespeed.\n\nAs expected of a beta, the game has many issues, although it certainly brings back the zed-killing fun and does a great job with the level system. Get it now if you want to try out the wonky engine, or get it later when Sharpshooter gets added in. The new character-specific voices are a great addition, although the lack of the colliqual 'Dosh' is a bummer.","April 22, 2015","true","90.8"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","18","25","4","0"

Killing Floor 2 has all the makings of an even better sequel to KF1 and I really enjoyed what I played and I totally got my money's worth, but I still can't recommend it anymore. The game isn't even out yet and they threw in TF2/ CS:GO style microtransactions. They're all supposed to be cosmetic and to be honest if they did this like a year after the game came out or something I wouldn't have minded it, but the fact that the game isn't even finished yet and was promised to not be in EA for very long sets a really bad precedent. Like I totally understand that games costs money but if Tripwire needs these microtransactions to survive or something, I’d say that’s their own fault really for mismanaging things and lying to people by saying this would be more of a beta instead of a typical EA game that needs money in order to continue. I would be totally fine having the KF1 DLC system.\n\nHopefully they change course because I'd rather not have another fun PC shooter die, especially one that didn't even really get a chance to live. If not, I guess there's always KF1.","November 25, 2015","false","22.3"," 49 of 82 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","49","82","2","0"

Be ready to look out for each other when the waves of “Zeds” are coming at you from each side of the hexagon? Oh dear…. The first wave is coming at us… Get ready to Zumble!\n\nKilling Floor 2 is a co-op FPS game where you take control of one of six characters and try to eliminate wave after wave (between 7 to 10 waves, depending on which server you are playing) of Zeds until you face either the “Patriach” - this scary and rather large mutated zombie/robot/Hulk thingy who has a rather heavy arsenal and is very strong in melee combat , or “Hans Volter”- the Nazi evil doctor who is holding himself pretty well for his age (he is around 100 years old) and likes to throw Toxic and High Explosive grenades! But don’t give him a chance to cuddle you as he will squeeze the life out of you to regenerate his own!\n\nBut before you get to the bosses you will face eleven types of “Zeds”, some will be easy to eradicate and some will be rather tough. At the end of each wave, you will be directed to a specific pod (there are several pods per map) where you will be able to buy ammunition, weapons and armour. Every kill you get is more money to spend at the pod! You have 40 different weapons you can use in this game; each weapon will fall into one of 7 categories – Beserker – Commando – Support – Field Medic- Demolition – Gunslinger and Firebug weapons. Whatever you use, at the end of the game you will get points for it. For example, only use a hunting shotgun (I doubt you will do that) and you will level up your support category faster than the others.\n\n10 original maps to play in, from Burning Paris to the Catacombs passing by the Farmhouse; they are all very good and well designed. Some are bigger than others but equally as fun and challenging.\n\nFrom the difficulty point of view, it will depend on which server you will be playing but you will be able to choose between Normal, Hard and Suicidal.\n\nGraphically, this game is fabulously detailed and it runs very well. I enjoy the slow motion effect too, it’s just great! If you like heavy metal, the soundtrack is really good and fits the game perfectly. It’s hectic!\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great and fun co-op FPS game\n-	10 maps to play in\n-	40 weapons to use\n-	Great re-playability\n-	Great graphics & soundtrack\n-	Achievements & Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	A bit repetitive I must say\n\nKilling Floor 2 is fun, it’s fast and full of Zeds!!\n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

But now I'm holding off continuing this game because of how slow Tripwire has been updating it.

The game may be labeled as "Early-Access" but that's clearly not how Tripwire sees it. They treat it like it's fully released. Updates aren't called that, they're "free content packs." Balancing is all kinds of messed up, you go months without updates and the content gets stale fast. Adding microtransactions to the game sealed the deal that it's not early access to them, so if they're treating it like a fully released game, you should too.\n\nI owned the first game.

The boss, (Hans) and the scrake (one of the seminal monsters) are both very cartoonish and feel like they don't belong.\n\nMany of the guns feel the same when using, creating a distinct lack of variety to the game.

The only positive point this game has over KF1 is that it is beautiful graphically.\nIf you want to play this game anything other than casually or with friends, dont buy it now.  Also, there might be an account wipe when it comes out of early access, so thats a further deterrant.\nI wont be playing this game much anymore except for big updates or when they fix the gameplay, so that i wont get tired of it or burnt out for when the game gets better. Hopefully.\nDisappointing from Tripwire.\nIf you will just play with friends or for a few games here and there, then go ahead, its fun! But right now this game is just too frustrating to put any serious time into.\nPlus they added microtransactions via csgo skins ripoffs in an early access game. I actually like this but why the ♥♥♥♥ are there shiny GOLD items in this game? Also couldnt think of anything more original than ripoff weapon wear?\nThis is turning into a cashgrab and has already joined the list of games showing that you should NOT buy early access. To top it off tripwire give us no ideas as to what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on. I sincerely hope this changes.","January 11","false","23.5"," 39 of 64 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","39","64","0","0"

I wanted a game that would live up the first killing floor, but this game is just a shadow of its former glory. I wrote a very positive review when this first came out because I had very high hopes of the game in it's current state at the time. The animations are beautiful and it's visually stunning, but that seems to be all it has going for it because it's a completely different game now (and not in the best way either). I can understand the microtransactions from a financial standpoint to keep the devs fed and the game production going but updates are pretty much glacial. The devs haven't been kind to dissenting opinions on their own forums which seems completely counterproductive from a developer that expects feedback from an early access game.

With a selection of different perks/classes and weaponry, up to six players can engage in some zed killing fun, and lord knows I spent quite some time playing 1 before I moved on to 2. Killing Floor 2 had from early access promised to be more of that, however as it stands I can't recomend this game to anyone.\n\nStill in early access, unfinished as I write this review, the updates have been progressing at a rate akin to watching a glacier melt.  While that could be overlooked, theres no overlooking its attempt to impliment a microtransaction system to the game before its even finished. Some would argue that the items gained from said microtransaction system are purely cosmetic and thus could be ignored. This is true, however, this ignores the fact that this system works off once again a lotterly similair to TF2, CS: GO, and now Payday2: a microtransaction system that is less convienent for players wanting to get cosmetics and more for Tripwire's profits.\n\nFor those not familiar with this system: on occassion you will receive a "loot crate" (or "blueprint" in this case) that requires a "key".  The only means to get this key of course involves a fee using your real money.  Once said transaction takes place, key into crate, and *POOF* heres your reward: a completely random skin which can be one of three different qualities.  Don't like it? What a shame, but you do have some options which include selling the item or trading it with others for something you would better prefer. Of course, even in selling your items you can expect Tripwire to make a portion of the profit.  If it were simply an online store where individual items would be purchasable directly from Tripwire, without the potential for outragous inflation rates of a player-driven market or the sheer randomness of RNG loot, I doubt this would be much of an issue at all.\n\nThe timing for this microtransaction system couldn't be any worse, in the wake of Payday2's Black Market update, making this course of action all the more questionable aside from its implimentation in early access. While I can't say the game itself is dead, I won't recomend this game to anyone until Tripwire's priorities of game development and profit are more clear.\n\nEDIT 5/4/16: The addition of PvP before even finishing all the game's planed perks and proper balances only further shows how tragicly half-♥♥♥♥♥ Tripwire is treating this game. While KF2 still shows promise, we've seen more and more skins/cosmetic crates released than core content such as classes with fully functional weaponry. Stay clear for now until its fully released.","November 24, 2015","false","371.1"," 42 of 70 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","42","70","0","1"

I really did. Went out of my way to max out all the classes and obtain every achievement. Played it for days on end until I finally 100% completed it. Bought most the DLC packs. So you can understand my excitement when they announce Killing Floor 2 right? I bought it day one, played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it, and now have all 30 achievements and almost all perks maxed out again, only missing Demolitions. So why is my review negative, you ask? Well the entire time I was playing Killing Floor 2 I couldn't help but think to myself, what are they doing to this game series I love so much? They first take months on end to add 2 perks, 9 weapons, and 2 characters, then for the next update which takes almost as long if not longer they are as of now PLANNING on releasing ONE perk, Gunslinger, 4 weapons and their possible single version selves as gunslinger revolves around dual pistols, ONE character that no one has asked for/ really cares for, as we still havent seen the re-release of classic characters that fans have been clamoring for like Agent Wilkes and Police Sergeant Davin, and the classic Patriarch boss returns, except now he's a big brute instead of the sarcastic, slick, assholishly tough rocket launching freak we grew to love/hate in Killing Floor 1. Oh and microtransactions. In an early access game. With paid dlc on the way/ already in it. I simply cannot reccommend a game that has microtransacions, ESPECIALLY when it's 1. In EARLY ACCESS and 2. Has PAID dlc. I would be perfectly fine coming back and enjoying the game when it's finished and they scrap microtransactions for their old dlc system, where it was all cosmetic and quite cheap for a bundle of items. Like I said I bought most of it and will continue to do so only if they remove microtransactions.","November 29, 2015","false","244.3"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","29","46","0","0"

The very notion of putting in microtransactions in a game you pay for is problematic enough, doing so before the game is even finished and thus cutting content is to me unnacceptable.\n\nTripwire this is not how you create a community that will stick around enabling long term continued sales of the game, this is how you turn many of your biggest fans (ie: the people who have already paid upfront for a game that isn't finished as they wanted to support the game).\n","November 26, 2015","false","7.2"," 49 of 83 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","49","83","3","0"

Tripwire promised to add more content at a very high rate and getting the game finished by the end of 2015. The real rate at which they are adding content is well... lower, much lower. They were meant to add about 7 classes in about half a year. Added 3 so far. Not mentioning the fact they are giving us wrong classes rather than the ones we actually need gameplaywise but it's not the point right now. If they are going to continue adding content at this rate we're going to get the game finished by 2017. Game will be dead by then because they chose to focus on milking the stupid by adding crate system and cosmetics rather than focus on providing content they promised us. My only guess is they got too much money from the early access relase, got crazy, lost it and now try to get some money to either stay afloat or try to finish the game. Game itself is an awesome idea and style but the devs are choking it to death. Shame.\n\n\n@edit 2 Mar @ 3:38pm\n\nHey everyone, just wanna add a note - they didn't screw up with the money, they just chose to focus on developing a new game, rising storm.

At least not if you're like me who expected to play it for hundreds of hours like Killing Floor 1.\n\nWhile this game is pretty and some of the guns are well designed, the gameplay gets boring fast. There are no interesting combos to kill big zeds like there was in KF1. No nade chaining, no flinching, no siren cancelling, no precise and time-sensitive combos. Parrying seemed to have some promise at the beginning of EA (v1008), but it's useless now with the introduction of unparriable attacks. The meta is just shoot it til it dies.\n\nSupport was my favorite perk in KF1 and it is now sadly underpowered with little ammo, low-damage weapons and a VERY underwhelming double barrel shotgun. Demo is also garbage with the first 2 tier weapons, and the insane C4 stacked damage dropoff; plus instead of the amazing M32 we got an RPG. Firebug and zerk are OP and boring; they don't even require skill with their spam-M1-to-win weapons. Commando used to be very good and fun during v1008 but requires an ammo buff now. Medic and gunslinger are alright I guess.\n\n\nUpdates take months. They can't even bother to release frequent balance tweaks. You have to wait months for the big update to see if the sequel to your favorite game is interesting to play again (hint: I'm still waiting).\n\nNow this is just nothing compared to the insult of purchasing this game on Early Access under the premise that TWI was going to "do it right", when goes months without being updated, and they hardly ever listen to feedback (unless thousands of people are complaining). Instead, they release a full-fledged microtransactions feature (instead of focusing on finishing the perks and balancing). To me, it's infuriating and completely disrespectful to need to extract the last bit of cash from your playerbase while the game is still not finished. If they ran out of money, maybe they should learn to allocate resources properly. An argument to defend the money-grabbing strategy of microtransactions is that it will allow TWI to have resources to continue working on the game and add awesome content, which brings me to my next point.\n\nTWI spent four months working on a Player vs. Player game mode that nobody had showed much interest in. A PvP mode is the LAST thing I'm interest in Killing Floor. When I want PvP I play BF3. In KF I want to shoot cool guns and kill zeds, not run around slashing and swinging around in the air to be killed in seconds and wait to respawn. It's a pathetic waste of development resources which should have been allocated to the sharpshooter perk. Very few people asked for PvP; a lot of people have been asking for sharpshooter. One should be able to distinguish the priorities for development based on browsing forums, steam discussions or reddit, but I guess maybe the players know nothing about what's wrong with the game they spend hundreds of hours playing?","April 14","false","34.0"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","17","24","2","0"

The original survival mode gameplay is actually acceptable and enjoyable, and feels like a logical evolution of KF1.

There's always hope this could become a great game, but let's consider the reality of that from experience of what has been and recent news:\n\nAs of May 2016 , the game has been in development for quite some time already. It seems like every time they release a patch, new problems arise. The updates are few and far between as well. Most recently, the updates have come a bit faster. Should be mentioned though, that was after a really long period where nothing happened. In other words, a lot of hasty "catch up" work has been done. With mixed results. The game is still largely incomplete, that has to be said.\n\nIt just can't hold a candle to what KF1 was, so old fans look elsewhere. You will be disappointed. It may be visually appealing, but lacks the soul of the original. KF2 could still be reviewed as a stand alone, online shooter. Which is the stance I have taken for most of this review.\n\nWith 200+ hours of game time, unsure if I will keep playing this. Once you progress in level, the idea is to move up to a higher difficulty for more of a challenge. Usually people play on Normal until level 5 or so, then Hard for level 10 or thereabouts, Suicidal is for a class level of about 15 and finally Hell on Earth (HoE) is for levels 20-25. Some will complain if you join HoE with anything less than the maximum, level 25. Beware. The same goes for the other difficulties, above Normal. People have a difference in opinion of what the minimum level to play a difficulty setting is, just as people differ in how well they can play. Note: This all may change, if they alter the game mechanics or tweak the balance. Just know that when you reach HoE as it sits now, there really aren't that many players out there. Filling up a team can be difficult then, so this game sort of has an "expiration date" when you have progressed. Heck, sometimes even finding 1-2 others to play with can be nearly impossible. Kinda like a story driven, puzzle game gets "done" in the way there is a conclusion to be reached, this one just stops dead in it's tracks after a while. Only KF2 is not supposed to be that... It's supposed to be an endlessly replayable shooter. No matter if you maxed out on levels. Well, they failed big time in that regard. You can play solo, but the fun is playing with others. This was designed as a cooperative experience, like KF1 which they based it on. Not sure who asked for PVP, but they added that recently. They should have finished up the other parts instead.\n\nFact of the matter is, there are too many arguments that arise. Not just about levels, but on how the game is supposed to be played. Quite a few of my friends who played this from the start, have now quit KF2 and moved on to other, better and more complete games. I am considering the same. Tripwire said they would have a more strict anti-troll and anti-harassment policy for KF2. I have not seen much of that. You pretty much have the option here of finding good people trough a lot of testing times with ragers, haters and just plain immature people. Some sore loser dies, they call a vote kick on some random person to blame. This easily means you, and especially the medic class gets a lot of undeserved hate. Even if the survivors really did all they could to help, lots of haters just refuse to accept failure. Some kids swear and are offensive. You just ask them to stop, they gang up on you and call a votekick. Someone's friend wants to join, you were in the game from the start but you're not on the "list". Guess what, votekick to ditch you so that some late joiner can take your place. After a lot of that and more variations of the same category, if you are lucky, you find enough of the good kind to make up a team. If you are all online simultaneously, and all of you can actually sit through one of these matches. That takes a lot of planning, which gets ever increasingly more difficult to do, seeing as so many players stop gaming KF2. If you don't have a full team of 6 players you know and trust, best get ready for vote kick battles between cliques of friend groups who want control of the server.\n\nThere are less problems on the lower difficulty settings. So if you are looking for a game to play just for a bit, then go for it. Consider the price, if you think it's worth it for a 1-200 hours of gaming. That's where most of the positive reviews are coming from, those who have played it just a bit. So many happy reviewers who have 50 hours. When everything is new and exciting, it's easy to rave about something then. See this review as one for how KF2 held up to the test of time. Yes, it's still in early development. After 1+ year. Just saying these days new, big games are being developed and released frequently. That in itself, may be an omnious sign of where KF2 is headed.\n\nSo, there we have it. Hoping for an improvement, really. But where this game is at the moment, stay clear. If possible, I will update this review or write a new one should the situation improve. *Fingers crossed*","May 1","false","216.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Playing solo gets boring after awhile. One thing to keep in mind is that it is still considered an "early access" game. While there is content it can get old after awhile if you don't have any of your regular friends to play with. One thing that I have an issue with is the "Zweihander" sword which requires you or a friend in your lobby to own Chivalry Medieval Warfare. This wouldn't be an issue if the weapon was just a reskin of another one but that fact that it is exclusive with different stats is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ move for Tripwire to pull. Not too mention it is arguably the best Berserker class weapon because of it's stats. I'm ok with exclusive weapons if the content is reskins or has no advantage in gameplay so this was kind of a letdown to see.

Traditionally Killing Floor has always been about a solid class based co-op experience (PvE) and now there is a focus on PvP (humans versus Zed) which in my opinion is problematic - especially at this stage of development - because it has the potential to impact PvE in terms of class/perk abilities i.e. balance decisions as well as taking away developer time that could be used to complete the core game instead (updates are slow).\n\nIt seems like at some point during development a decision was made to try incorporate features from other titles such as CS:GO and Left 4 dead which again, in my opinion have no place in the KF2 arena. These features are key/crate purchase systems and the Player verus Player aspect of L4D with humans versus special infected. Instead of focusing on what made Killing Floor 1 at least somewhat unique with systems like the door welding and the gritty atmosphere, Killing Floor 2 is trying to be everything to everyone and that's simply not going to work.\n\nWhat they did try to take from Killing Floor 1 is currently broken. Door welding (a tactic to barricade yourself from the hordes for a while) is meaningless because of the Zed teleportation "feature" whereby Zeds too far from players will be teleported to a nearby location to the players where no-one is currently looking. Think that corner was safe a second ago? Well look away for a second and surprise - in your face pal - as a Zed suddenly occupies that space and wastes no time in hacking people - that thought they were safe -  to death. Not fun and so many people have complained about this it appears that Devs are not going to address it any time soon - if at all.\n\nWeapon choices are very limited. The perk/class abilities are not all that interesting and really could use a complete overhaul to allow for more combo-play to encourage team-work and up the skill ceiling a bit. It would be much more interesting for perks from one class to directly link-up with perks from another class to deal more damage to enemies or create some other useful defensive effects.\n\nAs a PC gamer I am also not pleased to see obvious consolization creep into this title. Chat wheels instead of the key-bound menu drill down from Killing Floor 1, welders only appearing when you are near a door, auto-aim medic healing darts etc. These all impact the PC experience negatively.\n\nSo, I rather like the music and graphics in this game - at least those are good in my opinion but not enough to save it.\n\nIt is my opinion that you'd be much better off buying Killing Floor 1 at this point even though it is quite a bit older now - the gameplay is so much better.","April 23","false","42.1"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","13","17","3","0"

Cinematic quality effects, a large choice of weapondry, vast amounts of enemies. Oh, and perhaps slo-mo kills while in multiplayer that fits well. Overall, I enjoy it, i've been able to play with each of the six classes so far in to get a feeling of them, and how they are independent and have their own important roles. I've only found one little issue with the game... Well, it's not so little, its game breaking, and I mean literally! The game has some serious compatibility issues, and usually take a few months to have ironed out. For example, right now it is saying  Steam is required to play this game,[puu.sh] but as soon as I press okay, it closes. I've looked for ways to solve this for hours, and the only one(which is not fully confirmed) is to reinstall steam itself, which has hundreds of gigabytes of information. I know you may think I am over reacting and such, but I've also had another time when I was unable to play for about relatively 3 months due to my little steam icon turning green and then blue again, without launching it. Once again, I also looked for hours for a solution, all of which that failed.\n\nBasicly, if you want to buy the game, it's a great game except for the more ingame purchases reflecting counter-strike and the fact that you may not be able to launch it, and the issue won't be patched for a few months.","March 14","false","41.6"," 63 of 110 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","63","110","0","3"

Well, probably something really close to KF2. If I didn't know better I would think that a different team altogether came to develop the sequel since so much of the formula that made the first game such an enjoyable experience is missing from here. It's like someone came out of nowhere, saw a couple of videos of gameplay on Youtube and decide to "improve"it for the sequel.\n\nAnd on paper the changes to seem to be for the better, but for a seasoned KF almost all of them made the experience worse. "Let's make the maps smaller, removing any chance of teammates losing each other and Zeds picking them one by one. Let's add a sprint buttont, removing any sense of danger since now you can basically outrun even the worst of enemies. Let's add more levels on the skill tree, even though you get a perk only every five levels. This way we give the impression of deeper rpg elements, even though nothing changed at all. Let's add perks like everyone else, and while we are at it, let's make most of them useless.\n\nThe worst part is that they changed the mechanics so much but they barely added anything new for old KF players. With a few exceptions, all classes have basically the same range of weapons as the first game. I played mainly as support for more than a hundred hours on the original so making the transition and seeing again the same weapons was really dissappointing for me. The monsters are basically the same. With more details on their design yes, but there aren't any new monsters.\n\nAt this point, the only reason of getting KF2 is for the visual upgrade. The game is pretty good looking and with all the options enabled, the on screen carnage is impressive, but still this is not enough.\n\nI know it seems that I'm bashing the game really hard, but it's not because it's a bad title. For the new players, it's still a fun little title that can provide countless hours of entertainment. But I doubt it will please most of the veterans of the original Killing Floor. Same/similar weapons, small maps that look more fitting on a CoD game, sprint button that removes almost all sense of danger, uninteresting level up system and perks...\n\nThe only hope I have is that the game is still in early access. Maybe the final product will have bigger maps, more weapons, and improved mechanics. But as it is now, I can't recommend it to old players. And seeing the servers quite empty I'm not the only one having the same opinions.","March 9","false","12.7"," 35 of 58 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","35","58","0","0"

So before the toxic community white knights start their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I'll start with the positives of Killing Floor 2:\n-The graphics looks somewhat better compared to the first game in some areas, for example, in Burning paris you actually see the buring Eiffel, and the map is destructible when it comes to lights.\n-The characters look better, but on the same note, I feel that their lore is rather lacking compared to the funny bios we got in the first game\n-Some of the zeds actually look better, and others, not so much.\nAnd now for the part nobody wants to read, the negatives:\n-Horribly balanced perks to the point that 2 of them are HOE meta since there's no need for the others. (Beserker, Medic)\n-A completely pointless welder since they decided to add in perma breaking doors, where as in the first game, the welder had a purpose\n-Maps are somewhat poorly designed in layout due to the fact that there's always one point to hole up in\n-The AI is god awful when it comes to the ability to zerk wall as it targets the players behind the beserkers rather than the beserkers themselves which sets up for the 2 perk meta I mentioned above\n-The gunplay in this game feels really weak, like super soaker weak when it comes to hitting the big guys\n-The teleportation is incredibly annoying and game breaking when you need to run away and heal and then the thing you were running away from appears in front of you effectively ruining the point of kiting/evasion recovery tactics\n-The scrake and fleshpound went from logical mechanics to bullet sponges, even with explosives\n-The game feels really arcadey and overly casual compared to it's prequel\n-The trader is now just a pod, rather than a person\n-Some of the VA is really awful, even by Killing Floor standards\n-The music isn't really fitting when it comes to song choice, it just feels cheesy\n-Aside from the zerk wall meta mentioned previously, there isn't really any teamplay aside from spraying the bullet sponges with super soakers\n-The MT system is pretty trash, where as the DLC system in the first game was perfect for what was delivered\n-The update times are incredibly long and quite laughable for what's delivered on an update day\n\nOverall I'd rate this a 4/10 for obvious reasons.","April 24","false","90.9"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","0"

I mean, it's a sequel, so there's got to be more content, right?\n\nI was so very wrong.  I bought this when it was in it's Alpha/Beta/Early Access, and expected a good developement path, right?  Well, initially the game didn't have much content, so it didn't have the draw to get me to play more than the hour I have on record---not like the original game.\n\nSo I thought... "Okay, well, given the history of those behind the game, I trust them to do well and load this with more stuff than the original!  Here's to hoping we get new enemies/maps!"\n\nWell, as of this review... that hasn't really happened.  Even worse?  This game is now "Full release" it seems.  Don't waste your money on this.  I'd say buy the old Killing Floor instead.  Or, save your money all together and don't enable a company/dev team that wants to milk your wallet for microtransactions when they haven't finished what they said they'd finish.\n\nIn other words, learn from my mistake here.  Don't buy this crap.  Don't buy promises.  Don't support even "proven" devs until you know -exactly- what product you are buying.  I bought an unfinished game, and that's what I'm left with.\n\nEDIT:  Also, I flubbed up.  It appears the game is still in early access and -not- full release.  My mistake---I thought it'd be foolish to have payed DLC and microtransactions on an early access game (Because it is pretty dumb to add more charges to a game that doesn't have the core content finished), so I assumed that as well as it didn't initially appear to be an Early Access review upon writing this.\n\nHowever, until more content is actually added... this game still gets a hefty downvote from me.

I really enjoyed Killing Floor 1 and thought it was great value for money. I think I paid $10 for it, and got 400 hours of play out of it, through interesting mods, piles of great custom maps, plenty of servers, and of course interesting player classes and a nicely balanced diffculty curve that my friends and I gladually climbed. Killing Floor 2 cuts right back on a lot of that.\n\nI bought KF2 in early access because I enjoyed KF1 so much and wanted to support the guys who made such a fun game. I've had it for what's got to be coming up on a year now, and they've done very little with the game in that time. There is a paltry selection of official maps, which is my cheif complaint. This kind of game lives or dies through the ability to freshen things up by playing regular new maps. They're decent, but there's nowhere near enough. On top of that, there are very few servers that run custom maps. It gets very bland, samey and tedious going over the same few maps on every server.\n\nNext there's the character classes. This is a minor complaint, but they've all been simplied and streamlined since KF1. The carrying capacity and small number of weapons for each class really limits players and doesn't allow any real space to customise your loadout to your particular play style. You pretty much just go for the top weapon and that's it. I feel like KF1 gave you a bit more freedom to match weapon loadout to your preferred play style for a particular character, and I expected KF2 to give more freedom there, as a sequel, not less.\n\nThen there's the difficulty curve, which is a big problem. It's just stupidly unbalanced. My friends and I have progressed through normal and hard, and both of those are too easy for us now, but the next rank: suicidal, is just silly. And that's not even the hardest difficulty. We're damn good players, but it's frustratingly hard, to the point of draining the fun from the game.  So we're stuck in this no-man's land where hard is too easy and suicidal is so difficult it's not worth it. The game needs major balancing, but the patches are few and far between. It's like trip wire have just given up and are content to make money off of DLC and microtransactions while leaving the game in early access forever. Levelling up your character to 25 doesn't help either, since the level 25 perks are universally almost useless for each character class, which is bizarre. You'd think that achieving top level with your character would warrant a big reward, but the focus on 'Zed-time' means you -might- get two seconds worth of use out of this perk every 30 seconds or so if you're lucky, and the bonuses are pretty poor. It adds almost nothing to the game.\n\nWith the current state of the game's balance, the lack of maps, and the VERY slow rate of patching and updates I honestly can't recommend this game unless it's on sale really cheaply... and even then I'm not sure tripwire deserve to be rewarded for leaving this game and its players in limbo.\n\n","May 17","false","143.9"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

Everything about it feels ♥♥♥♥♥ier than the original, the only improvement being the graphics.  I can't even say specifically what makes this one feel so much worse, but Berserker now feels clunky to me (my favorite perk in the original) and Sharpshooter doesn't even exist yet, so that's probably part of it.\n\nAll of the perks are just super boring.

In fact I'd only put it at around 70% done. And this is after like...2 years, when they originally planned to finish by the end of 2015.\n\nHere, have an example. The next perk to be released is supposed to be sharpsooter. A perk that was in the first game, so most of the conceptualizing groundwork was there. Not to mention the weapons were there as well, evidenced by the fact they released 2 of the perk weapons and they're carbon copies of the two fris ones from the first game. We were all waiting for the perk, thinking it shouldn't be too bad a wait for the above reasons.\n\nAnd it was months, like 5 I think, and what did they release? The above mentioned 2 weapons and a PvP mode ripped from Left4Dead that NO ONE knew about nor asked for. Apparently all that time developing "sharpshooter" was well spent...on some random whim they had rather than what the customers all wanted.\n\nBut don't worry...I'm sure sharpshooter would be soon after...granted that was like 4 months ago now...\n\nBut hey, looks like the devs are taking a cruise vacation? According to some guy I read? Makes sense, I mean santa also works one day a year and takes a 364 day vacation.\n\n\nThis is what happens when a game adds REAL MONEY transactions into a game when it's barely half done. All the kiddies spend hundreds for shiny gold skins and suddenly the game's made thousands in profit, why even work on it anymore...\n\nI shun all of you who defended MT's.

You've successfully avoided the Scrake and Fleshpound!\n\nIn all seriousness though:\n...the game's alright. The same good ol' shootbang Zed time's there and the experience system is waaay friendlier than the KF's old nitpicky level up; at the cost of almost becoming an MMO slog grind, but at least it's not an oasis-in-a-desert style grind.\n\nThough I can't help but feel that, currently, it pales a lot in comparison to the first Killing Floor. Needs a bit more polishing here, a lot of class rebalancing, more interesting weapon/perk progression (some level passives really feel like they should be an innate feature within the perk itself or part of a perk weapon's capabilities. Plus, the safety catch on Demo's perk weapons are outright  stupid; severely limiting any chance of surviving close quarter combat scenarios and essentially making his explosive resistance redundant - I'd rather go out bombs blasting with the possible chance of surviving instead of dying pathetically to a mob of teleporting Crawlers and Stalkers), less freakin' narrow maps (AND RESPAWNING/TANKIER DOORS - despite teleporting Zeds making the practice of welding more detrimental than it is helpful. It'd be pretty damn good if TWI ported the original maps in KF to KF2), a little Zed blood there, the old sly-passing shopkeeper, more voice commands (they didn't add "Thank you" amongst other classic/helpful responses to the current and only chat wheel? And it seems we're bound to the archaic days of typing 'sc' and 'fp' to inform our teammates of the threat that's currently wailing on you if they didn't hear the automated - but seldom triggered - Zed call the first time through) and a ton less of these teleporting Zeds, bullet steak Scrakes and Flesh-quarter pounders etc. that come from absolutely nowhere.\n\nCan you hear that revving chainsaw in the distance? That blood-curdling roar over yonder? Well, perish the thought of strategically relocating, because them three Scrakes and two Fleshpounds aren't taking their sweet time to bound towards you from a legitimate spawn point, they're already raged and right behind that corner that was clear just a second ago - Good luck, skip!\n\nWhile what I've listed could basically be just nitpicks (you can tell I despise the teleporting, it's probably the game breaker for me - I'm sure I'm not the only one) , the game's current build isn't quite the improvement from the first KF (except with the graphics department, the gibbing is glorious). I wish there was a "So-so" button instead of simply "Yes" and "No", because the game in its current state is simply just that.\n\nEDIT: "...but our goal is to have KF2 out before the end of 2015."\n\n...Welp.

Try to explain my concerns / points why I cannot recommend this game ***\n\nMicrotransactions\nFor actual reasons I just wanna to say those so-called microtransactions are not real ones. Neither you have a P2W model nor the gameplay is affected at all. It's rather the crate/key concept (already known from other games) with just cosmetical items and even random free drops. But I still do not support this in order to let the ppl not get used to an overated market and a gambling zone around honestly worthless key items (-)\n\nIntroduction\nKilling Floor 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to Killing Floor. I've played Killing Floor for almost 2k hours and it is still a great game with a huge fanbase. As you can imagine the devs tried basically to keep this successful concept but also to polishup their graphics, introduce new perks and mechanics, add new 3D models, bosses and maps at the same time. All things the devs said / promised you can easily checkup in the official trailers and making-of videos. The game is still EA. So that doesn't mean anything cannot be changed at all. Instead of complaining I backup that the game is permanently evolving after a very successful beta launch (+)\n\nGraphics / Sound\nThe devs said it's an Unreal 3.5 Engine means they pimpedup the Unreal3 Engine to max to visualize what they couldn't do in KF1. The graphics are just brilliant. If you have seen them once you don't wanna go back to KF1. It has a legacy to mess with actual titles like Evolve and is even superperformant on some older PCs since the first minute of playing. The new Zed-time, the 3D animations of Zeds and weapons, the maps and even the MP characters are state of the art and brilliant implemented. The Metal soundtrack by Zyntetic / Demon Hunter fits perfectly into a picture of a great game (++)\n\nGameplay\nUnfortunately the gameplay has changed entirely. Ofc you still have the waves and the "weapon-buy-earn-dosh-through-killing" concept. The devs said they wanted the game at least to become more kiteable. But in fact camping in "turtle strategy" brings mostly the success on higher difficulties. Partly it's a degrading of perk autonomy into a roleplaying game. Zerk always blocks in frontline. Other perks hideout behind him in a tight place. The good old times when a zerk was able to kite a sc/fp or an entire wave on his own are gone. Mostly annoying are the introduced QTEs when a clot suddenly grabs you first have to dash him away. Dumb if you are already chased by a raging fp and now it hammers you away (- -)\n\nZeds\nThe 3D models were all redesigned. Now they look more scary and dangerous except the new Clot (lol?). Basically they look wider and blocky. During Gameplay they can even block your way at all places, they spawn and shortcut around you and surround you instantly. The Zeds got new animations and mechanics. All Zeds have extended  fightmodes on sui/hoe and also a perma run/rage mode. Looks like a gorefast can strike you 4 times in a row if you don't parry his attacks. Also Zed bodies have become more bulletspongey. Because of more hitboxes you have to do several shots before they go down. That means you better have to concentrate on headshots all the time (-)\n\nBossfights\nBossfights are insanely hard and long. The bosses are very resistant. Each boss has 3 phases of surviving before you can knock him down. Mostly you loose your teammates before the last phasis is reached. Hans Volter has even an invulnerability in his intermediate lifesucking phasis. The Patriarch keeps on being invisible most of the time. Needs a certain strategy and almost more than a load of full magazines of each teammate to beat the boss in the end. Also nervewracking is a new running mode of your character (not only on bossfights). So you keep on running on bossfights for about a quarter til a half hour (-)\n\nPerks\nWhat is new that are levelperks. Each 5 level you will get an extra perk ability. 25 levels / perk, 7 perks atm (10 perks are planned). The devs said they wanted to reduce the uplevel perk grinding. They barely did it. It still take ages to uplevel. Even if there are no more cross-perk weapon use punishments. Actually you levelup your weapons for using them and gain also xp for total damage. They also added achievements for each levelperk which shows that fast perkleveling has become the new aim.\nOfc the weapons must fit into the new gameplay means "headshooter weapons" required for each perk. Unfortunately there's no Sharpshooter yet (which can takeout the big ones with a few headshots). The new gunslinger perk and his dual wielding akimbo style weapons is rather comparable with a demo in his effectiveness. He can blast through heads but has the slowest reload times. So Sc / Fp is still a problem for him (-)\n\nWeapons\nWeapons are the essential part of the game. The devs wanted them to be more realistic, great feeling and handling during gameplay and engaged even Pro RL shooters for fast magazine exchanges recorded by motion capturing. Though p.e. the Commando Bullhup got improved and feels way more decent, other weapons seem more unprecisely or bulletconsuming due to more detailed Zed-animation / dodging and own accurancy while running / turning around. Some weapons got even miniaturized / lowpowered like pipebombs and the flying sawblade which doesn't make it easier. Positive are all new medic weapons and also the firebug has a smashing microwave device. Demolition has only 1 shot magazine weapons. And the new Gunslinger shots through masses with his double magnums. The biggest issue is that reload takes insanely long. Over 3 secs in some cases. Even if the animation is nice, mostly it's your death. Also buggy: if you start a reload animation and dash in the meanwhile a Zed away you must start it all over again. It does not do anything in the background. Same with healing (+-)\n\nWeapon Combos\nIn KF2 I havent seen any of them. Except the fast run around a Sc glitch. Surely you are able with a zerk attack parry and some other weapons to bring the big ones shortly to stumble. But a secondary knockdown would be nice. In KF1 there was this uppercut combo as a Support. Like stun / flinch with katana + blast the head with the double barrel shootgun (-)\n\nConclusion (temporarly)\nYou can enjoy these brandnew exciting graphics and proceed on some maps. Lots of stuff is still coming in. But for the moment I feel a bit disappointed that I cannot play as used through the maps. Seems I need to learn a gameconcept that doesn't feel comfortable to me.","December 13, 2015","false","125.2"," 75 of 133 people (56%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","56","75","133","8","20"

So when KF2 became available last April 2015 in the Early Access format, of course I bought it.\n\nIn the beginning it was really funny especially with friends. Now it's getting very boring because of the lack of content and the huge wait between updates. A few days ago they also announced (without surprise) their "CS-GO system" to buy body/weapon skins... at least it's only cosmetic... I hope it will stay like that.\n\nWhy am I giving KF2 (E.A.) a thumb down? Let's start with the good side before talking about other things.\n\nGOOD ASPECTS\nVery nice visuals\nGorgeous gore system\nYou feel the hard work in the level design\nAnimations of the weapons are neat, really neat\nNice zeds (monsters) design\nChallenging gameplay, strategy needed in the hardest difficulties\nSoundtrack fits well\nYou can try the game and give your feedback (that's what E.A. is for indeed)\nNOT-SO-GOOD ASPECTS\nThe... Early... Access... updates... come... much... too... slowly...\n... resulting in not enough content to keep you in the game...\n... but TWI found time to work on their own "CS-GO store" (skins). A real plague those days. At least they are announced to be cosmetic only - for now... they said there "may be" community weapons too in the future which is a yes for me, no more double talk\nCurrently the localizations (minus English) are just made in Google Translate, they will be updated soon.\nSome weapons need to be rebalanced, some perks as well (i.e. demo & firebug)\nThe rest of the perks and weapons are to be added, we wait!\nThe soundtrack may be a little short, I wish there were more tracks like in KF1\nRight now I cannot find the "fun" sensations I had in KF1, I feel frustrated while I play. I had good vibes in the beginning but they are gone for months. Now I'm just waiting for the game to be completed before investing me back in.\nNo Linux servers "yet", other server administrators will understand what I mean.\nKF2 has a lot of potencial but time between E.A. updates is very long so don't expect too much of it... otherwise game is polished - but there is only a small portion of the final content.\n\nI don't like the turn of TWI with their adaptation of the "CS-GO store". I hope it won't ruin the game and its community...\n\nMy advice is that unless you are a real hardcore fan and/or you want to give feedback to the devs, you should wait until the game is finished and avoid it for now.\n\nWait and think twice before you buy it during E.A.","November 25, 2015","false","153.0"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","2"

By the time of release the finished product would even be better.\n\nPerks have now some customisation (you can choose between few skills every 5 lvls) , lvling is much faster. Every class now starts with primary weapon for that class. Major change in gameplay - you can now sprint (like in modern military shooter) and avoid certain dangers.\n\nFloors are now actually covered with high texture blood like in true "killing floor". Gore is much more spectacular. Also the soundtrack is awesome, nice selection of tracks by Tripwire. Characters that you play will often comment on stuff and even somewhat respond to each other. Sound overall is improved.\n\n\nNow however in my opinion, game severely lacks content (with the new Steam refund system you can see it yourself) and instead adding more and more content they announce TF2 style microtransactions.\n\nEven though it's not as bad as Payday2, but still you can see where are their actual priorities and i don't support that, it might be even worse when the game is finished.\n\nSo it would be wise to wait more and see what comes out of it.

Now microtransactions/gambling in Killing Floor 2 before being even finished? Sigh. Next thing will probably be more weapon dlc which will more or less upgrades of other less used weapons.\n\nKilling Floor 2 is quite good, though it doesn't have the "soul" of KF1. The leveling system feels way more like a grind than in Killing Floor. Only real source of exp is kills while you get next to nothing for your perk's role. "Stupid" is the word I would use to describe it.\nAlso have to edit a .ini file to remove mouse accelleration/smoothing, otherwise I would call it almost unplayable.\n\nWaiting for more content before playing again.

Also buy it at a discount.\n\nTook Tripwire a year+ to bring Red Orchestra 2 to the stability of its' beta version before release (and patches took forever).

Game was half ready, had some flaws(bugs and perk ballancing) but was still loads of fun. 4 months later we got another "big update" that can't be considered anything else than kick in community's face. This game has gone from "Good with potential for Greatness" to "Bad and getting worse" really quickly. I just hope that devs will notice that before the point of no return. RO2 was really bad game when it finally came out, but TWI made it a great game, lets hope KF2 will be fixed that way.\nI will not make a review of the game as it is, I will point a direction of the changes made to KF over the past.\n\nBad tendencies:Game is more perk-level based than skill-based (contrary to KF1)\nThis leads to more and more ppl getting frustrated cuz they cant do a jack ♥♥♥♥ with low lvl. Game is too boring on lower difficulties. Using perk levelling maps is common now ppl grind XP not learning how to play properly. Altough this game is perk-lvl based, some skills are required to play on higher difficulties. Not many ppl know that.\nMaking each class less playable\nAlmost every change to perk system/weapons involves nerfing. While I dont like my game being too easy, devs mistake "Easy to win" with "Enjoyable to play". Examples? I enjoyed playing comando, now its insanely accurate. Demo was pathetic from the beginning, he got nerfed to the point of uselessness. A good Zerk/Med combo was able to withstand much punishment, so.......they both got nerfed. Latest hotfix introduced us to "fixed a bug making some weapons dealing too high dmg" issue. Thank heavens they fixed that.\nNot fixing bugs...\nThere is a lot of map exploits involving shotgun jump that are not fixed since the first release. Perks sometimes switch by themsevles. No perk-change confirmation button. Zeds corpses getting stuck out of map.\n...but adding new ones\nNew perk tree is bugged as hell. Game started to crash frequently. Runs less smooth since last update(meaning "I had to lower graphic settings to get similar FPS")\ngenaral dev lazyness\nIncinerate'n detonate update took about 4 months to complete(too long IMHO), but added 2 new perks(fairly well made) 2 new maps(big, well polished), 8 new weapons(not counting 9mm and knife), 2 new characters, almost complete perk-system overhaul, dual pistol mechanic and a lot of bug fixes. On the latest update wich took also 4 months to cook we got: 1 new perk(bugged), 2 new maps(1 looks like a mix of maps from KF1 but waaaaay smaller, made in a hurry perhaps?)4 new weapons(that dont even have different animations, 9mm, Colt1911 and DE share exactly the same ones, Revolvers share most), 1 new character(looks ok, but voicepack....), new boss(IDK why he is called patriarch, i know he has glasses and similar chaingun, but seriously what the ♥♥♥♥ is that?), last but not least.....\n...adding additional paid content BEFORE FINISHING THAT DAMN GAME\nInstead of making the game better devs focused on making it more profitable. In KF1 I bought every skin DLC at full price as a manifestation of my support for the devs, for keeping that awesome alive for so long. Now I feel someone tries to rip me off more money before aquire sth I already paid for.\nGood tendencies: (suprised?)\nMicrotransaction system (even more supprised?)\nI'm not really into MT, more of a KF1 DLC guy, but cant deny it has some good sides. MT system adds more variety to game and provides devs with more cash than DLC. My only concern is "Will new skins and cosmetics fit the game?". I dont want my game suddenly turning into some hentai.

Putting over 500+hrs of gameplay on my previous steam account, my opinion on KF2 is this.\n\nPROS:\n-You actually have to stick as a team! (The more people that join, the harder it is to take on FlashPounds and Scrakes.)\n-The music is alot more enjoyable than KF1 and you have the option to add vocals to it.\n-People are alot easier to talk to in KF2 also, which is easier to make friends.\n-Characters are more appealing and do plenty of commentary.\n-Character Customization is added so everyone doesn't look the same.\n-Has Workshop!\n-The higher the difficulty the better the zeds are at pursuing you and using different techniques to kill you. (For example, the husk will unleash a large flamethrowing attack in sucidal+. And the clots will really chase the hell outta you as you turn up the diff making this game alot more thrilling)\n-Great graphics and animations that make this game really awesome!

The gore system is all there. As a GTX 980 owner, Nvidia really did well with the FleX system. Everything is very beautiful to shoot. Popping a Zed's head is always a treat. The Zed Time contrast effect is very pretty and gives you much needed seconds to line up a trio of shots on a Siren before she can open her creepy scream-hole.\n\nThe sound design is excellent as well! Shotguns sound like god slamming his car door. The healing grenades are MUCH more pronounced, a definite improvement over KF1. The music choice is somewhat...meh. I've never been too much of a metal head, but I muted them rather quickly. The same riff sawing away in your ears gets old relatively fast and the tracks all sound far too much alike. The character vocalization is fun. Each character sounds excellent and has their own sense of personality. I usually take Anna Larive because, well, a crazy who likes explosions is always grand. Though I will admit the Reverend is really irritating with his hurt sounds. A "Gah!" would suffice rather than a two-second clip of "Huunnrr gghhhrr neearrr" repeated every time a Crawler gnaws on him.\n\nI even went so far to buy this for my friends. Leveled up Support, Medic, and Commando to 25 all vanilla. Played the maps on every difficulty and beat them all.\n\nThat said, do I reccommend it?\n\nNo.\n\nThe game's development cycle is unearthly slow. I know it is not "fair" to compare TWI's relatively small staff of 50 people with something like Digital Extremes 150 and say that KF2 and Warframe are equals. But there have been a myriad of issues with this developer. Balance problems crop up and TWI is glacial in its response time to fix them.\n\nAnd to be honest, at this point, it is fair. TWI added microtransactions. Which might be fine later in the game's life...except it hasn't started yet. TWI promised to have this ready and out the door around the end of 2015. Seemed simple. Just cut-paste the seven previous classes and add the new ones. Except AI glitches abounded for a long period of time. And with the advent of these new microtransactions, one should really start to scrutinze, especially after what Overkill did. DE does it, yes. But their game is free-to-play and updated near weekly. I understand, again, a difference in manpower. But now TWI is trying to get to equal financial footing and so should start to be evaluated by higher standards.\n\nPlus, I just geniunely don't agree with this practice. In an F2P game, it's fine. It keeps it alive. Heck, even in a few P2P games, it lets the developer work. But in a game that's not even out of Early Access? That's fishy. Had the game gotten finished and we recieved a Zedconomy update, I probably would've ignored it at worst. Or, hey, maybe bought a reskin for whatever the Sharpshooter had. But in the early stages when the game isn't even finished? Heck, isn't even halfway done? That smacks of something darker.\n\nThe game is pretty, but I wouldn't buy it. There aren't enough classes to keep things fresh and the dedicated mapping community is really the only thing that was keeping this alive for me. The excess achievements (complete every map on every difficulty as every class) are just lazy and are based more in your own patience than any skill. After Overkill poisoned the water, I'm extremely wary of this type of behavior from developers. I understand developing a game is an outlay of labor and cash, but this is not how you get your community to support you. Electronic Arts can redeem themselves and Valve can become the evil empire of video games, things change. Not to mention TWI's little side comment of "adding things later" in their interview. I really don't enjoy P2W games. I don't like playing those because I play one 24/7. It's called real life. The graphics are amazing and the controls are phenomenal, but the gameplay is lacking and I can't find a story.\n\ntl;dr Pretty game. Appeal is short-lived. Developer updates are faster only than Valve. Microtransactions worry me down the line. Not enough classes to keep it going and gets repetative quick.","November 27, 2015","false","177.2"," 26 of 42 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","26","42","0","0"

Amazing game in terms of an FPS experience, just the right amount of urgency, raw firepower and skill are needed to wrangle with this wild horse. A polished, simple and enjoyable skill intensive shooter. Although it is supposed to be aimed somewhat at horror, it falls short. The melee class has been hurt severely from the original game, more so that what I would call balancing, not to mention a crappy final weapon. The AI for the mobs could use a little more work on pathfinding and player target promotion. It however more than delivers on a 'bloody' good time when gore settings are at maximum. The handling is amazing, as is expected of the Unreal engine, smooth and precise. The game has become so beautiful that it's scare factor is all but gone, perhaps more creative future maps and game play modes will address this as the genre intended.

Whne I saw it was for early access, I had to check it out and not wait for full release. WOW! A total revamp from the 1st one. Graphics, gameplay, and the fact that you can actually SPRINT is why this is the game that I would pay $40 for the full version. For those who are wanting to get in the franchise, definitely get the Deluxe Edition, as it includes the first one.\n\nThe upgrade system with your class is something new that has been added to KF2, which gives you incentive to play the crap out of it. Early Access, I observed, only offers 3 guns as the Commando class (which is how I roll) but with the term "Early Access" hopefully more will be added. The Zed's and Patriarch are a little smarter and harder to kill on this one, and makes it to where if your team DOES NOT work together, you will fail.\n\nThis game will offer the player hundred's of future hours to the player, and a way to build great memories with his/her friends. $30 for this Early Access Feature is a drop in the bucket compared to the time you will spend on this game. 10/10\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce8Mto_4Qrg\n","April 23, 2015","true","4.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

We have massive amounts of missing content that was promised. Instead of focusing on actual gameplay and content, Tripwire has focused now on milking the series and its players for all its worth. That's fine by me. I just won't make another purchase that has this company's label.\n\nYou should do yourselves a favor and stop encouraging studios/developers from unethical practices. Ethics is subjective, sure, but you'd have to be pretty sadistic to continue supporting this company after they fu​ck you in the as​s.\n\n\nTo summarize:\nAvoid. Avoid.

I'll go into detail about what this means:\n\nFirst off, small patches to well-known bugs never happen unless they are completely game-breaking. If you find a bug in the game that's annoying and recurs in every other game - too bad! You have to wait months for the content update to get that small fix. Expect to play with that and many other bugs for months.\n\nBy extension, this also applies to balance in the game itself. Is a weapon, a perk, or a skill, too underpowered or too overpowered? Suck it up for the next few months. Tripwire makes absolutely no attempts at rebalancing their game at all either for the time between two content updates, so you are stuck with a metagame that may make the game either too easy or too hard and there's no changing that for a long time (and this already happened: the current state of Hell on Earth, the highest difficulty in the game, is pretty much a joke because of the amount of broken weapons and skills you have access to that make it a ton easier than it's supposed to be. This has been the case for 3 months now).\n\nNow, when it comes to my two former points, understand that this is not complaining about the game having bugs or having balance issues in itself. These things are to be expected, especially in an Early Access game. The problem, as I already mentioned, is that these things are woefully ignored, or at least it seems that way. It doesn't matter that the majority of the community reports a problem or asks for a change to something - it is simply not happening until Tripwire feels like finally letting it out. This leads to stagnation of the game, and in turn, to it feeling boring sooner or later, especially given how the game is still lacking a good amount of content which just makes the problem worse.\n\nBut don't let me finish this without stating the most controversial topic that has recently surfaced about this game: microtransactions being added to a game that's not even close to finished yet. Of course, as of now, these microtransactions only provide you with cosmetic items which don't affect gameplay at all, which is obviously a good thing. However, it's still really questionable that a game that isn't even finished yet attempts to milk you for more money. On top of that, they have explicitly said they were considering adding gameplay-changing DLC in the future (which is just adding insult to injury). And of course, all of this is given out with the excuse that they want community feedback, yet, like I stated earlier, feedback on bugs or balance in the game (arguably, aspects that are much more important to the game) appears to fall into deaf ears.\n\nFinally, when you are already starving for content for the game, you find out that the update they were working on has already been given to journalists so they can play it first before you, the paying customer of Early Access. And what's the release date on this update that journalists already played? Don't know. Some ambiguous date that still doesn't let you know when to expect it.\n\nSo what point am I trying to make with all this? That if you are buying Early Access to contribute to the game's development, know that your input is likely to not make a difference. If you are buying it because you want to experience each change in the game as it comes out, know that you are going to be waiting a really long time between these changes, and the more-or-less $30 that you put down for it is still not gonna be as worth it to the devs as that guy who writes articles to review games, who is going to get it first and eat the cake in front of you while you stare, drooling and not being able to do anything about it. Because you, the customer, are not that important. And, if you are buying it just because you wanna play a fun game, know that you are likely to run into a lot of bugs and balance problems that will sour the game while seemingly nothing is done about it.\n\nI will change my review of this game when and if steps are taken by the developers to change the way things are now.

Sure, the graphics are swell - but theres hardly any strategy beyond 'stick together' and 'get better weapons'. There was slightly less tedium early on - when you could go Rambo - but thats gone now because the updates all but wiped out crates and guns (aka incentives) to run around the map solo.\n\nThe lack of strategy though is the real killer. Its just a dumb, by the numbers game - with over the top graphics. Add to this, what seems to be to my perception, the increased teleportation of Zeds after the update, removes even the slim vestiges of strategy that were left.\n\nJust checked that corner?

The game follows its predecessor close, with the only major difference being an upgraded engine that makes it look like a gorgeous reason to upgrade your computer. Its a gory game and that's one of the reasons why you play, for the sheer beauty of how gruesome it is. There is no subtlety to the game, you are getting rushed by monsters in waves and its action and combat heavy. Even in early access, the game feels polished, refined and finished even with six maps. The menus and shop interface that make it so much better. It makes all the difference and makes the game more approachable than the previous one.\n\nWhen you step in, its almost like a haunted house, you get in, you have your fun, then you go on your merry way. You can just turn off your brain and enemies will come to you. There's no puzzles to solve or any single player campaign, just action wave after wave. To the game's credit, its easy to select a match from a server and when one game ends, you all vote on the next map to play.\n\nThe game controls nice on a mouse and keyboard or a 360 controller. It controls like a lot of similar first person shooters. You have iron sights, a throw button for money or weapons, holding one button lets you select from your inventory of things, there's a quick heal, jump, run, alt-fire, reload and a crouch that almost feels useless. Commandos also have night vision or and everyone else has a flashlight depending on the weapon. The night vision only lasts for a limited duration, but it does the trick, until you can find your way to a bright area.\n\nIn terms of equipment, you have primary weapons, secondary pistols, melee weapons, a med kit to get you quick healed and a welder. While I know the welder is used to seal doors shut, I never see many people using it. Perhaps some would rather have mobility to escape a room that's full of monsters rather than creating bottlenecks so there are less entries. Each weapon has its own stats for damage, range, firing rate, bashing, reloading speed and ammo capacity,\n\nThe stats between tiers of guns seem minimum at best for the cost. Its still good to buy extra guns due to your maximum ammo capacity. The more waves you face, the more bullets you'll need for your foes. There are still glowing green ammo boxes here and there.\n\nBetween each wave of enemies, a store will open up and a path will show you the way to ensure that you find it after a jog. The store is only open around a minute, but it feels like enough time. I have a feeling that the real reason for shops opening up in different locations is to encourage you play different parts of the map. I've seen a lot of games where players just hustle back to the biggest area to fight enemies.\n\nAt the store you can spend credits to refill your ammunition and body armor. You can also purchase new weapons that stay with you until you die or the match ends. If someone else on your team is dead, they will drop a weapon for the next person to pick up. There is still a way to throw a weapon on the ground as well as money for anyone that needs it.\n\nBetween games and even waves, you can select your perk from one of six. They include a berserker that's geared more toward melee weapons, the commando who prefers assault rifles and grenades. The support class starts you with a shotgun and a frag. The field medic begins with a restoration gun and medical grenades to heal allies. The demolition perk has a stick of dynamite and a grenade pistol from the start. Last up is the firebug that can only use spears and torches. No, the perk uses fire and Molotov cocktails.\n\nThese perks start you off with select weapons, but you can still use a weapon from any class. Any perk class can use any weapon and you can level up with any weapon. Every five levels, a new ability gets unlocked, but for the most part perks include passive benefits. Some grant you more health or damage, others have quicker welding speed. To get more experience to level up, you need to kill enemies with weapons from the class. There are other ways to increase experience, but that's the bluntest way.\n\nWhile the game is designed for online multiplayer, there is a single player option for offline practice or if you just like the challenge of being the lone survivor. When a game starts, you chose your difficulty, map, amount of waves and perks. There are only a few maps, but in a game whose predecessor had ludicrous levels of downloadable content, I expect the same here. You can still have a lot of fun on the game's six or so maps.\n\nEach map is laden with details and offers a few arenas with multiple entryways. Even with a team of six, there's still a lot of potential for something to sneak up behind you. Its okay though, because having five teammates ensures that someone is always watching your back by sheer coincidence.\n\nEach monster is a gruesome piece of art. Hairless naked zombies, obese men with two butcher knives with brown stained bottoms and green boils that vomit green chunks to cover the screen and blind you. Darkened black mutants with spider legs extending out of their back who crawl on the floor below your sight lines or  on a ceiling above you. There's a siren that walks slow and does radius damage with her shriek. Men with one arm, no flesh who have a sword instead of a hand that scrapes long the floor.\n\nWave after wave, the enemies keep getting larger and tougher. Giant mutants with a chainsaw arm start appearing. They dance and whirl as they chase after you trying to smash their saw in your back. There are giant bruisers with huge metal hands that use them to block your gunfire as they chase after you. It all crescendos with the final wave and a boss fight. One last tank that just sponges bullets and challenges the entire team.\n\nThe game makes excellent use of its gore. Limbs fly off with explosions and a headshot will explode a head, but a headless body can still shamble around, but usually a bullet to the head will drop an enemy. Intestines will explode out of the big guys. Sometimes everything will slow down so you can take in the atmosphere as its painted. The slow motion also helps with aim.\n\nWhen you die, you're out for the wave. If your team survives, you're back in the game. its a system that prevents exploiting if you lose, you drop out and reenter. The game lets you spectate who is still playing to still keep you interested.\n\nFor those that like customization, you can customize a lot of things on your character when it comes to the look. You pick a person, select from a brief list of faces and clothing textures then select what's on their face. Its deep enough to be enjoyable, but shallow enough without getting lost in the details. The real reason to change characters is for when you get bored of their voice overs. There are no skills that differ between them, because that's reserved for the perk system.\n\nThe soundtrack has a mix of big metal songs and tense tracks that would get found in a modern horror movie. It has almost as much thrash metal than Brutal Legend. The voice acting is high quality, but you'll hear the same French woman who runs the store telling you her pod is open or when it can open. There might be a lot of one liners, but you'll hear them all quick enough before you change characters. The enemies make believable noises while you're looking at them, but even foes that make loud growls can still go silent enough to surprise you.\n\nKilling Floor 2 excels in the gore and the easy to drop in or drop out aspect. its fun to play, but without a set goal of a campaign it might turn people off. Its easy to find a match and keep playing without breaking the flow. While the game supports six players at once, it still feels like you can still do your own thing on lesser difficulties. You can still make it through on your own, until a huge mob of later wave enemies sneaks up from behind pins you to the wall.","September 5, 2015","true","18.5"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","27","44","0","2"

(At least they didn't do what the payday 2 devs did, and make the drops have stat boosts.)\n\nWhat is really killing this game is the severe lack of content. 3-5 months for what amounts to a map, and maybe a class or a few weapons if we're lucky.

Sadly, however, while I understand the game is still unfinished, it just really pales in comparison to its predecessor in many ways.\n\nNow, even though this is a negative review, let me state that Killing Floor 2 is not a bad game in its own right; it's just a bad sequel. If you've never played the first Killing Floor and jump into this game, you'll probably have a great time. On its own, Killing Floor 2 is a fast-paced, hoard mode style shooter with great graphics, beautiful guns and satisfying gore. Compared to the first game, however, its core gameplay loop is very rough and unpolished, with fights quickly devolving into wars of attrition where you hope your team's lead output is great enough to stem the tide. It feels way too chaotic and makes strategy and tactics feel worthless. With time, this roughness may be ironed out, but I feel like it shouldn't have been that way to begin with.\n\nAnother big problem with the game is the slow pace of updates. This wasn't an issue back in the KF1 days since the game was already super fun, but this game desperately needs more polish and more content injections; an update every 3 months isn't going to hold people's interest for long when the core gameplay just isn't all that great. It's looking less and less likely that this game will be ready for its intended launch date. The game is also starting to show symptoms of feature creep, with new guns and perks being set aside for things like Vs. survival. Why not get all the promised content in the game before adding new game modes that will require tons of tweaking before they get to a point where people actually want to play them?\n\nOverall, as much as it pains me to say, I just can't recommend Killing Floor 2 in its current state. Perhaps in a year or two it will be in a much better place, but I'm worried that by then there won't be many people left playing. I would highly suggest checking out the first game instead; it may have a small community now, but it's frankly a much better experience right now.","May 10","false","97.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

The time spent on this mode could have been spent on adding the remaining perks (one being sharpshooter, and a couple of unknown ones). If these updates actually had more to them to justify the time spent on them then this game probably would have been finished months ago.","April 9","false","50.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

Unless you really really loved the KF1,  but wanted a bit more, and you can live without the campiness. (Although they have classic skins with the two original male voices).\n\nI love both games and I'll still be playing after this review, however it's just sad how even on the Early Access part that Tripwire said they'll be doing it right. Yes you can ignore microtransactions, but what people seem to not understand is how bad of taste microtransactions left in gamers mouths. I'm all for supporting devs, but the best support they can get is new players purchasing their game. That's pretty much how KF1 got so popular (Also getting a PC powerful enough to run that wouldn't be that expensive, oh and can't forget steam sales).\n\nVersus is all right, if you've played L4D well with great teamwork then you should have no trouble with this. However I'd like the rest of the perks in. There is the workshop so maps aren't going to be too much of an issue, unless modders add perks themselves.\n\nSo overall the game is great, however it definitely feels like Tripwire is giving it a second thought, although they are still holding mapping contests it seems. Enemies are fun to fight, guns are fun to use, current perks as well. But it just needs those final perks and maps. Honestly less skins and cosmetics would be nice until this gets out of EA.\n\nTL;DR I love the game but can't recommend it like I could do for Killing Floor 1.

The biggest problem I have wit hthis game that I think makes kf1 a better game in my opinion besides the balancing is something that others might consider minor, the guns, in kf1 each gun feels unique and when you fire it it feels satisfying to use. In this game each gun just feels like the same gun with some minor damage and rate of fire differences, this in my opinion ruins one of my favorite parts of kf1 which was the weapon diversity and how cool and interesting each gun was.","April 9","false","2.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

Welcome ladies and gentlemen to Killing Floor 2!\n\nI myself LOVED the first Killing Floor and it seems i'm going to love the second even more. One of my friends had graciously given me a copy of KF2 digital deluxe edition and after kissing his feet and worshipping him as a god I proceeded to install and play KF2... And boy was I scared. I thought it best to try and go solo my first game to get a feel for the new mechanics. Now I like playing berserker so I knew this would be a bit easier on my behind with the extra vaseline already in place to negate some of the damage and pain away.\n\nI readied up after choosing our main man DJ scully and proceeded to quickly crap my pants as zeds began to drop from the ceiling and from around the corner with me not remembering which button was to change between melee weapons. After clearing the first wave a familiar trail led me to our lord and savior the trader, or in this case the trader pod, where I proceeded to simply buy armor and get a fresh pair of pants. then came the second wave, I was ready... or so I thought. Armed with the "instantly turn towards the zed that is grabbing you feature", the zeds constantly grabed me and gave me slight jumpscares as I attempted to RUN, which is now a new feature as well, and swing my way to the next wave.\n\na couple waves later of crapping pants and getting new pants I was finally on the boss wave, armed with body armor,  extra vaseline, and my new waifu the Pulveriser, I awaited the arrival of the most feared enemy known to man... The patriarch. Except It wasn't the patriarch that spawned in. it was a being just as terrifying and his name was... Hans Volter! armed with nerve gas, grenades, machine guns and the ability to grab me and suck my life away I despreatly attempted to run, heal, and pulverise him to pieces as he chased me through the labs.\n\nFinally It came to a showdown, he was red all over, near death, and I had 30% health with no armor and a few spare shells left in my waifu. We both charged at each other, I swung and he lunged... my hammer had reached first, blowing his head off and an achivement popping at the top of my screen. I threw my hands in the air and cheered as I had conquered the first of many levels and still had some vaseline left on. which brings us here, as I tell you that my experience with the game was amazing and that it's still the same killing floor we all know and love just with much needed new features.\n\nPersonal Rating: 10/10\n\nDefinetly try to pick this game up if you are a fan of the original. If you're not then I would say an 8.5 or a 7 out of 10 is a more fair score as some people may not like simply surviving waves of Zeds.\n\nBut you can't deny the unique weapons these guys come up with. Although I'm pretty sure i've seen the shotgun sledgehammer from somewhere else...\n\nhttp://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130906224751/rwby/images/4/46/NoraHammer2.jpg\n","April 25, 2015","true","20.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","12","16","4","0"

At this rate it would already take another year of early access before the game released the remaining perks and maps but instead of focusing on that they've seemed to prioritize cosmetic microtransactions.

And this after promising they wouldn't pull stuff like this.\n\nIt took them two months to fix a simple map-breaking pathfinding issue caused by two bushes everyone who played more than one match on said map recognized and could have easily been fixed by throwing a box on the spots or just removing them.

Killing Floor 2 has potential even though since it's inception, has deviated from the path of Killing Floor 1. I had my suspicions of bad things to come since the 2nd Dev Diary, and those suspicions ended up being true.\n\nTripwire Interactive never stated that the use of Microtransactions would be part of the core mechanic of the game, and had never pitchd the idea to the community. I would rather have DLC skin packs after the full release of the game. The use of the 'CS:GO' strategy is unfavorable, regardless of whether or not the items affect the gameplay. It's nothing more than an attempt to create an in-game economy that encourages heavy spending on the 'Possibility' of getting an item you want.\n\nI am excited about all the other content, I've been looking forwards to it for a long while now. I'm likely to be playing after the patch in order to gauge a proper opinion on the new perks and weapons. Although I'll be playing to form an opinion, I will not change my mind over the Microtransaction implimentation.\n\n(This review is likely to change depending on the state of the game per meaningful update or upon full release.

Unfortunately the developers are insisting on a RNG stlye DLC moving forwards regardless of the fact that the core is still incomplete, claiming that it's the best thing in order to support the players with free content as opposed to the true reason of stuffing their pockets.\n\nAs much as I would like to reccomend this game, I simply can't. Sure it's fun for a while, but until the game is near completion (i.e. when all perks are in game, and only balancing remains) I would not reccomend it, as we cannot sure how much content the developers will be willing to push into the RNG DLC.\n\nPerhaps look back at this game in a few months time to see if anything has changed. Updates are released approximately once every 3 months, so all of the perks may have made it into the game within the next year or so.\n\nTo clear things up, I am not opposed to DLC.

The only reason I decided to buy into the "early access" is because I had a lot of fun with the first KF. Even though the first KF was nothing but a mod for UT2K4 and not made by Tripwire (they bought it off of some guy), I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt to see if they could deliver a good KF game on their own. Well, so far they haven't. I don't like how it feels, something is just off with the gameplay. The FOV feels strange, everything in the world feels like it doesn't belong, the mouse movement is clunky, they still haven't implemented the CO-OP functionality that the first game had (in order to get it running you have to do an involved workaround). The Steam page says CO-OP but that is not true at this time.\n\nBesides all of this they are now fartin' around with micro transactions in a game that is supposedly in "early access". They say it will only be cosmetic stuff that is for sale, but we all know they are adding this "Trading Floor" in order to make money. Hmm, where is this going to end up in about a year?

Furthermore there may be gameplay-changing microtransactions in the future, as you can read here.[killingfloor2.com]\nI suggest to go play the first Killing Floor instead.\n\n\n\nEdit:\nI still have a few other points about the game to add.\nThere are already weapons you can only unlock by owning another game (Claymore for example). This may give a gameplay advantage to players who are not owning it.\nMedic darts have become too easy, no need to try to aim anymore.\nThe new Patriarch design which got released recently is.. very curious and surely not what you would expect to be the Patriarch.\nOh and lastly, if by their definition you show abusive behaviour, they can simply revoke your CD key, according to the EULA.

It is really good!\nThree maps sounds a little, but the random factor makes that three maps enough. If you're boring the game, you can change the difficult for more action.\nBecause of the great point in this game that it's always replayable!\n\nAnd for the 'Killing Floor 1' fans:\nI'm a 'Killing Floor' fan so, I had to buy it.\n\nThe first experience was good. I have a four-years-old PC and fortunately it can run the 'Killing Floor 2'. Although, I had to taken-down most of the graphics options, but now, it's run quite well.\n\nThe second experience was better then first one. It is still playable game. There have been a few innovation on the keybinds. But those are useful.\n\nThe third experience was a little bit bad. The trader's voice and sentences. I have no problem the voice, but unfortunately, I don't like those sentences, what she says. In the 'Killing Floor 1' that black trader girl was likeable. She says good ambiguous sentences.\nLike this: 'I like the big ones, don't you?'\nSo, that French woman is too informative, she doesn't say any funny or likeable things.\nLike these:\nBuy armor, oh mon Dieu. / Look at you, go find a medic! / You've earned some money, spend it.\n\nI know the rookies need some help, but... oh, mon Dieu, just make a turorial texts like in 'Killing Floor 1'!\n\nSo, let's see the summary.\n\nGood thing:\n-I have a four-years-old PC, and it runs well by almost minimal video options.\n-The control is useable.\n-The 'Killing Floor' atmosphere is still have.\n\nBad things:\n-I don't like the new trader's sentences. That's too informative.\n-It's need a sort of strong hardware.\n-It is 'Early Access' game, so there are a few crash both of client and server.\n\nI recommend this game those who have played the 'Killign Floor 1' and like it, and those who likes the co-op first-person-shooter games.\n","May 2, 2015","true","862.4"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","22","35","2","15"

To add insult to injury, they have been steadily pumping out updates for said microeconomy without any other content updates.

This installment does everything the first one did but just better: enhanced graphics, reviewed gameplay mechanics, even sexier dosh piles! It is very common for people hesitating to buy this game to wonder about its current early access state, and here is how I would ease you into buying it: The game doesn't really feel like it's in a beta, there are close to no bugs, the current content, judged at the moment minimal, will still take you on a 300h cruise and regular fixes plus dev posts makes you know this is going somewhere good.\n\nThe game makes you choose between 6 classes (at this time of writing, as there will be 10 in final release):\n-Field Medic\n-Berzerker\n-Commando\n-Support\n-Firebug\n-Demolitionist\n\nEach of those have their know-hows and will require you to adapt to specific ways of playing the game, which diversifies it quite a lot. There are currently 6 very well-made official maps taking place in different post-apocaliptic settings, and 4 difficulties ranging from Normal to Hell On earth with a well-through design (the higher the difficulty, the quicker mobs get to you, rather than being even bigger HP sacks).

As far as I know, the content of the game being sold right now is the same as it was in beta. The game shows real promise, even with its current dearth of content. It's very unambitious and can be accurately described as "KF1 with better tech", but I suspect that's what hardcore KF1 fans wanted anyways. Client-side hit detection makes playing with high pings significantly more viable this time around. Look at any gameplay video and you'll see the same wave-based horde shooter it always was, but more chaotic and fast-paced due to smaller maps (the three currently available maps are unarguably cramped ones, at the time of this writing). All perks from KF1 seem like they will be returning, with some new additions that will mostly be "forks" of the old ones (e.g. Sharpshooter and Gunslinger as distinct perks, instead of a Sharpshooter that does both extra damage with long guns and handguns), for a total of ten. Currently, only four perks are in the game: Commando, Support, Berserker and Medic. Most fan-favorite weapons seem like they will be making a return, along with several new ones. KF2 is looking to be a safe bet for co-op on PC from 2015 onwards, just like the original was and still is.\n","April 21, 2015","true","450.3"," 27 of 45 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","27","45","2","0"

But slow development, unnecessary CS:GO & TF2 style microtransactions. Buy original KF or get KF2 on sale.\n\nAs someone who has clocked just under 200 hours on the original Killing Floor, I had high hopes for this game. However, I have a rather mixed view on Killing Floor 2.\n\nBefore I delve into the details of KF2; those new to the Killing Floor series, it is a co-op first person shooter where teams of up to six players combat against waves of 'ZEDs' with the goal of surviving all the waves and defeating a final boss. By killing ZEDs, healing players and surviving waves, the player is rewarded with money which is used inbetween waves to buy weapons, armour and ammo. To add to this, there are several perk classes which provides unique (and passive) abilities to players, these include commando, firebug, berserker, support specialist, etc. By using these perks and completing certain criteria, players level up in these perk classes and the benefits are increased. This could include more damage with perk class weapons, increased health and so forth. These can also be changed inbetween waves to allow players to adapt to various situations and playstyles, especially when playing as a team.\n\nNow to the nitty gritty of KF2; the gameplay is a fun, fast-paced, gorefest with some some interesting new ZED types, a new final boss during the final wave and also with some brilliant visuals and sound design. KF2 also introduced several new features including sprint and weapon bash functions and the introduction of confiquring abilities for each perk class - which allows players to further tailor a class for their needs; i.e. abilities that benefit the player vs. benefits the team. These abilities include but are not limited to; supplying ammo to other players vs. increased ammo capacity and starting ammo for the player. It goes without saying that these new abilities do play a huge part in success on higher difficulties. This makes it an incredibly fun and exciting experience when you're running low on ammo and getting stormed by two Fleshpound's, a Siren and a small horde of lesser ZED types, and must solely rely on your team mates and quick thinking to survive.\n\nHowever it feels lacking in contrast to it's predecessor - the charm of the British humor and voice acting which proved a humorous but distinctive feel to the original Killing Floor is lost on KF2. This may just be a personal view but I also feel the weapon and map variety is quite limited at this moment in time, however this could be changed upon full release, which brings me onto my next point.\n\nTripwire stressed it's point of doing 'Early access right', which I feel has been a monumental lie to it's fanbase. Since it's early access release in April 2015, it is still nowhere near it's full completion - instead of fixing bug issues, adding the remaining three classes (to a total of 10 perk classes), new maps and weapons, it has instead intergrated a 'ZED-Conomy' and microtransaction features - similar to those seen in CS:GO and Team Fortress 2. Considering a reward is often given it players upon completing a full match, in the form of a 'Crate' or 'USB' - to then make them pay for a 'Key' to unlock said items is an insult to players. However, on a positive note, these items are purely cosmetic and do not have an affect on the game.\n\nAnother feature added was a L4D inspired versus PvP mode, which in my own experience is a broken and unnecessary gamemode that doesn't fit in KF. Where teams of max leveled players will simply camp in one area and makes it virtually impossible to win when playing as ZED forces. This really killed my interest immediately. Finally, there is a myriad of other issues ranging from broken implentations of weapons and classes and nerfing of abilities as can be seen in full detail by other Steam reviews, to slow and infrequent updates and new content.\n\nTo summarize Killing Floor 2, it is not 'bad' game. However it is most certainly a fraction of what we have been told it is going to be. It is fun, gory and a great co-op experience, whilst the slow updates, bug issues and microtransactions do not break the game, when coupled with the asking price; it may be enough to turn you away. I would recommend purchasing the original Killing Floor, which not only is much cheaper and frequently on sale, but also still has a strong and active player and modding community, However, if you can stomach the flaws you may consider purchasing this when on sale in the future; however do check video reviews and the likes before purchasing to ensure this is a game for you.","April 13","false","53.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

Why?\n\nFor me was KF never a PvP-Game, it was always about gathering with friend or random people and you have to work together beating waves after wave of monsters the game is throwing at you and then an awesome boss that needs teamwork and is just ultra hard to beat on yourself (on high difficulty nearly impossible)\n\nNow Tripwire going the PvP way and not even given one single of the new player classes is just a cheap ripoff for the players that bought the game for PvE.\n\nSorry TripWire, i love your other games but KF2 for me is dying even it's still early access with the way you now going.","April 22","false","4.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"
