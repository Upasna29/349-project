"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/recommended/307690/","dfactor","Dfactor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/","1000 products in account","After the 100% completion I can say that:\nWhen it comes to visual differences the Definitive Edition features better lighting, character models and textures, some improved world textures, more depth of field, smoke, smoother reflections and visual effects. In short, the game feels more organic.\n\nNow you have more people and cars on the screen. I've noticed new faces, different outfits and generally better looks.\n\nThe keyboard keys were remapped to more standard layout. Notable changes:\n-RMB to E (entering cars, countering).\n-Space to L.Shift (sprint and parkour).\n-RMB now is used for lock-on.\n\nThe game mechanics are mostly the same. HUD has been slightly revamped, making elements sharper, smaller. Phone's front and UI has been changed completely. Most of the icons have been changed. Main menu has activity feed now and you can switch between social hub entries without the need to wait until they load.\n\nThe car traffic AI is okay-ish, heavy trucks still scratch the walls on turns, but I've noticed that the AI sometimes keeps crashing into my parked cars. Car physics are semi-buggy. There have been cases of weird spawns and semi floating vehicles.\n\nPedestrian AI needs a bit of polishing. I've experienced bunch of harmless / hilarious bugs and glitches:\n-Some individuals keep walking into other people as if they were walking into a wall.\n-Friendly AI had problems entering my car / locating door when needed.\n-Some thugs were levitating for a brief moment.\n-Panicking thugs tried to escape, got in a car and kept driving into a wall (they try to back off, but still hit the exact same spot).\n-Enemy reinforcements sometimes get stuck between cars or they keep looking at you from afar.\n-Random guy upstairs in Club Bam Bam went through the floor and landed on the ground floor like it was nothing.\n-Some pedestrian animations keep overwriting themselves (loop too early) and end up looking like they're having a stroke.\n-Sometimes people get spawned above the water.\n-Some people get stuck in walls.\n\nI've also noticed some audio issues. Sometimes some sound effects aren't played or they randomly appear / disappear. Seems like some audio bits also get either delayed or overlap (especially noticeable if happens during dialogues). Even had 2 radio tracks playing at the same time.\nI'd like to point out that camera needs tweaking too. Sometimes it doesn't center well, stucks in things or points at wrong angles, has weird sensivity. Especially noticable in action hijacks.\nI didn't experience these issues in original patched SD.\n\nThe DLC content is nicely implemented into the main game. You do not get instant access to the items (which would ruin the experience and challenge like in the original SD), instead you can access them in shops (the clothes guy says wacky lines about individual sets), so in-game currency has extra use now. The NANP and YOS side stories are available directly at the main menu, no need to switch between them. The red envelopes are now scattered all around the map and can be found in semi-hidden places. Notable difference: most of the DLC related side missions can only be played once, not including Zodiac island.\n\nSWAT Pack DLC's unlimited side missions were turned into "Cop Job". No need to travel in a HKPD vehicles, the missions are marked separately on your map and unlock based on your progression. Possible scenarios (possible spoilers):\n-You raid, beat up and arrest street gangs while having a bunch of officers as a backup.\n-You're given a vehicle and have to ram the escaping suspect's car, then arrest him.\n-You respond to store shootouts and neutralize thugs.\n-Sharpshooting / one shot kill the thug without harming the hostage.\n\nThere are also some modified individual side missions (possible spoilers):\n-"High Speed". Imagine Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit. You've given a police car and your goal is to shutdown a race by slamming into racer cars.\n-Modified "Death by a Thousand Cuts". Arena fighting with a golden meat cleaver. Enemies have poisoned weapons and your goal is to survive and kill 30 enemies.  it's quite hardcore, especially if you haven't upgraded anything.\n-Modified "Shaolin Showdown". Defeat 40 monks. Up to 30 on screen.\n\nThe optimization is even better than in the original. Playable on higher resolutions with less performance hits.\nNotable difference: you can Alt+Tab freely. The game doesn't go into windowed mode anymore and stays in full screen, there's no need to change options back every time (which was extremely annoying).\n\nFinal verdict:\nWorth if you've never (for some reason) played the game before.\nOtherwise for fans that enjoyed the game.\nPS. Needs a lot of patching. The bugs add up even if they're semi harmless.\n\nI may update this review if we discover some new "facts".","October 8, 2014","true","38.2"," 1,053 of 1,114 people (95%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","95","053","1","19","57"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/307690/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","What is it?A story-driven action adventure set in a gorgeously recreated Hong Kong setting (a mix of various Hong Kong sectors fairly accurately recreated).  The game is based on real events (though names have been changed).  You are Wei Shen, and you lead a double life as a Triad gang member and an undercover cop - so you will be playing both sides of the story.  It is Wei's job to bring down the Sun On Yee gang (a tweaked name of the real-life 'Sun Yee On') from the inside, and so he must find a way in, and get people to trust him.  Soon, Wei starts to feel divided loyalties as he gets in deeper and deeper.  The main storyline is linear but the plot is fast-paced and entertaining.  There are masses of side missions that fit in with the plot very well and you can choose when and if to play these.\n\nSleeping Dogs contains all the usual open-world elements we love: a gorgeously atmospheric and thriving city densely populated with people and traffic, great ambience (especially the night market), vehicles to unlock and drive (or simply steal), USEFUL collectibles that either upgrade your health and strength, or your bank balance!\n\nIs it easy to play?Very.  The driving and parkour elements are simple and responsive and the martial arts moves are only taught gradually and are not overly complex, though you might find yourself scribbling down a few moves as there are ultimately 12 to remember!  The game's tuition system spreads your learnt moves gradually through the game using a novel system of returning to Wei's former Kung Fu school.  For exchange of each school's missing trophies, you will be taught a new move and given some non-aggressive adversaries to practise it on.  It works very well.  As for weapons combat, I personally found it easier to switch to mouse for aiming, but the game switches seamlessly between controllers while playing.  The only negative aspect is the sometimes-uncontrollable camera angles after reversing a vehicle.  The camera is too slow to face forward, meaning you often start driving blindly.  Other than this, everything is great.\n\nRequirementsRegarding game requirements, you really will need to pay attention to those because this is a heavy game graphically.  There is some stutter in the cut-scenes regardless of GPU but the cut-scenes are only occasional.  You will benefit greatly from a gamepad.  This is not the sort of game for people who have a 'delicate' audience in the room as there is a lot of 'colourful' language and such.    If you're a female gamer, you'll probably cringe at some of the lines spoken by some women (some are really bad!) - but not enough to kill enjoyment of the game.\n\nIs it worth upgrading from the original?If you enjoyed the game enough that you'd likely play it through again, then I'd say yes.  It looked great before but there are a plethora of improvements: denser NPCs and traffic, heaps more variety in shop signs, lots more lit signs, beautiful environment effects, super-realistic road and building textures and improved controls.  A few bugs in the original game have been fixed, and all the cars, outfits, apartments and cash DLC is no longer automatically awarded to you at the beginning of the game (a problem with the original version, leaving players with nothing further to play for).  The only caution is that, if your PC struggled a bit with the original, it will struggle more with this version given that it is a much heavier game for your GPU.","November 30, 2014","true","36.8"," 313 of 340 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","313","340","9","8"

The original (non-definitive) version is one of the few games I have 100% completion on in my steam library.\n\nSince you can read up on pretty much any review for the actual game, I thought I'd focus on what's new for this re-release.\n\nThe biggest improvement probably went into how the dlc was handled. Every single dlc (with the exception of the top dog booster packs) is now included, and rather than just dumping them all on you at once, they were all was integrated into the game a little better, unlocking a few pieces from each as you progress through the story. While some of the changes are minor, like a new vendor in the night market who sells some of the dlc costumes, they actually went back and tweaked a few of them to flow better. For example, the "Shaolin Showdown" side mission is no longer an endless arena where you fight until you die, but now has you running to several locations fighting smaller groups of enemies, eventually climaxing into one of the largest melee fights in the entire game. The Swat dlc missions were also changed into individual "Cop missions" that feel like they have a little more variety now and unlock over time instead of all at once. In fact, almost every mission got some sort of small tweak to it. However, Nightmare in North Point and Year of the Snake are still separate standalone stories that don't take your progress in the main story into account (though they both still unlock a few bonus items for the story when completed).\n\nThe graphics also got a bit of an upgrade, though it's not immediately obvious because the original PC game was already a big improvement over the 360/ps3 versions. Mostly, everything now has even higher-resolution textures, and there are some new effects like fog in the streets, remodeled skin and hair for most characters that looks great in cutscenes, more dense vehicle and pedestrian traffic, and some new outdoor effects. In particular, the new rain effect (and the puddles it leaves on the street) looks fantastic.\n\nIf you never played Sleeping Dogs, you really owe it to yourself to pick up this re-release, as it fixes some of the flaws of the original and includes all the dlc. However, if you already played the original and most of its dlc, you should probably skip this. Improvements and dlc aside, there is no new content (mission or story-wise) whatsoever.","December 14, 2014","true","9.1"," 192 of 205 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","192","205","3","2"

If you don't own this game, buy it, it's amazing.\n\nWonderful game. Looks like GTA and Yakuza had a child and it’s turned out to be awesome.\nSleeping dogs owns GTA4 in every way. I was forcing myself to finish GTA4 and enjoyed Sleeping dogs twice (on PS3 and after couple of years on Steam) and even collected all the achievements.\nFirstly the graphics are much better, GTA4 looks like crap and sleeping dogs looks great and when it’s start to rain it looks amazing. Sleeping dogs runs much MUCH better too while GTA4 is barely playable and bad looking even on high end machines.\nThe gameplay is much more fun than broken GTA4, where controls are pathetic, shooting is frustrating, cars are bouncing, etc. This is not existent in Sleeping dogs. Controls are really good except for some rare camera issues. Driving is fun, especially shooting while driving and hijacking. And shooting mechanics is great, it’s easy to target the enemy, shoot him in the head, hide behind cover or disarm the enemy.\nThe fighting system, is something like Yakuza. There are some combos which you learn by levelling up, you can use environment and knives, cleavers or even umbrellas, purses and my favourite – a fish to kill people.\nSide missions are not boring unlike in some other games, most of them are different every time. Catching the thieves, throwing out the drunks from the shop, collecting debts, stealing cars or find the lady in a car’s trunk and free her only to find out that it’s some sexual game and she was waiting for her husband to find her, not you.\nThe story is good too. As undercover cop you must infiltrate the triad and bring them down. So you play as a cop and as a gangster depending on the mission. Sometimes it’s just driving, sometimes fighting or some bloody shootout.\nOh and the game have radio with a different genre of music. My favourite is roadrunner records station. It has such bands like Machine head, Dream theatre, Soulfly and Trivium. It’s really fun to kick some teeth while Fear factory’s edgecrusher is playing :)\nThe only downside of this game for me is that it lacks activities. After playing Yakuza games which has a bunch of activities I want more of them in other games too. The only activities are ♥♥♥♥ fights, races and mah-jong. Because of this I’m giving this game 9/10 :)","April 16, 2015","true","33.8"," 375 of 436 people (86%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","86","375","436","56","22"

The city in this game is Hong Kong only in name. The city itself does not look like Hong Kong at all (I travel to HK a lot so I would know), so this might as well be Shanghai.\nThe attention to detail in this game is mind blowing. I mean, sure the game elements (story, gameplay, fighting, racing, etc) are fine and entertaining, but what I really like the most about this game are the people. The main characters and especially the people on the street are so authentic and believable! I just love it!\nFrom obvious chanting of the street vendors to the not so obvious nose drilling sound before spitting, loud chewing with open mouth or the way people talk (even if translated into English). This is just my personal opinion of the game. If you are Chinese or if you have visited Hong Kong/Shanghai, get this game and have a good time! But since there's a better choice (GTAV), get this game when it's on sale. By now the full price is not worth it.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=469659132 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=474848855","July 5, 2015","true","13.8"," 146 of 161 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","146","161","10","8"

Now back to Watch Dogs. Now back to this game. Sadly Watch Dogs aren't nearly as well-optimized, while offering marginally (very marginally) better graphical fidelity. Also Watch Dogs doesn't have an amazingly authentic city of Hong Kong with TONS of cultural education content. Neither does it have an interesting unique combat system, phenomenal voice acting, great satisfying driving with action hijacking, actually meaningful and clever hacking minigame (ironic, right?), a lot of variety in mission types and gameplay and a good storyline with actual emotions and some seriously shocking scenes.\n\nSleeping Dogs Definitive edition is definitely a definitive Open World Action game in a well-defined location, with a defiant for the genre, yet great combat system and the very definition of what a GTA-style game should be. Definitely. Incredible game, as is usually the case with Square Enix-published games. EFG have delivered in full.

That you have become one of them."\n\nAs the store page for the vanilla game is only available for the DLCs it's best to summarise what Sleeping Dogs is for the newcomers. In case you only wish to know what the Definitive Edition can offer please scroll down further where I detail its characteristics.\n\nSleeping Dogs, in essence, is GTA in Hong Kong. You have a living, breathing city with hundreds of pedestrians, drivers and bad guys. Into this world comes Wei Shen, an undercover cop so that he can infiltrate the triads and end their reign once and for all.\n\nYou are free to go wherever you wish in the city. Once you approach shining beacons at certain spots a mission is initiated which is introduced by a cutscene. This is the linear, the story part of the game and once a mission is complete you are back in Hong Kong where you can participate in racing events, do favors for citizens, bet in a cockfight, hack cameras, complete missions for the police, purchase clothing and vehicles.\n\nThe activities are numerous not to mention the many collectibles scattered throughout the city: you can pay your respects at health shrines, collect lockboxes and red envelopes full of cash and you can look for jade statues to learn new moves from your old kung fu master. Oh, and you can date girls and participate in karaoke sessions, as well!\n\nThe story of Wei Shen is excellent and full of intrigue, treachery and some surprises. Voice acting is excellent but why would anyone think differently: as soon as you hear the voice of Tom Wilkinson or James Hong you know the game will deliver! As opposed to GTA, in Sleeping Dogs emphasis is on the melee combat (attacks, heavy attacks and counters - rinse and repeat) but from time to time you can get hold of several firearms, too. I like how you can utilise the environment to ease a battle: enemies can be thrown into dumpsters or into a whirling fan where they are met with gruesome death. Both combat and car handling are smooth and fast!\n\nThe 2 DLC stories that can be accessed from the main menu do not offer anything interesting, however, putting these aside in-game content requires you to devote at least 30-40 hours if you wish to reach 100% completion.\n\nThe Definitive Edition:\n\n-- This edition gives you the full package with all DLCs included. Red envelopes are put elsewhere and some missions have been changed. In fact, the DLC clothing are now sold by a special vendor near the market area. Perhaps the most notable of this inclusion are the unique cop missions where you always assist your fellow officers (you need to hit and ram enemy vehicles or gun down bad guys or save a hostage).\n-- The game has better effects and higher resolution textures. Or so they say. The former are noticeable and for a city known for its "light pollution" it is a must, to be honest. In fact, there are more pedestrians on the streets so you can really feel being in Hong Kong.\n-- With all the graphics enhancements the game is still not demanding much: 60 FPS result is common, in fact, the game runs better on my rig than the original version did.\n-- With new features come new bugs: audio issues (overlapping) here and there and due to the more NPCs on the streets you notice more of them get stuck at certain places for no apparent reason. Still, these are all minor nuances.\n-- The game now has better keybindings. I know these can be changed in the controls menu but I always appreciate if the developers pick the applicable buttons per default. This layout now makes more sense.\n\nTo use a pun I am happy to say this edition is a definitive must! As I had already had the vanilla game in my library I got a 50% special promotion for this super package - I believe this is nice so for me this edition was an immediate purchase.","October 25, 2014","true","29.5"," 85 of 90 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","85","90","4","6"

That story, those graphics, such a huge amount of things to do... it was also the first big game I completed 100%, because it was just that easy (and satisfying) to keep playing and playing and playing.\nSInce then, I went to a quest to find another open-and-full-of-collectibles-world game capable of giving me the same vibes, the same emotions, the same satisfation Sleeping Dogs did. Saints Row: The Third came pretty close, but no cigar. Only this Definitive Edition did the trick; and if this sounds a little bit ridicolous ("Why didn't you just play Sleeping Dogs again?", I hear them say) well I don't care. The story is still fantastic, same for the graphics (even slightly enhanced) and the immersion makes no difference.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/307690/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Forward note! For my opinion on the Sleeping Dogs in general, I assure you I'm a fan. I've bought the game triple times now, and my disregard about "definitive edition" concerning only how little I got, paying for the game third time. You can see my review on the Sleeping dogs there: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/202170/\n\nIn short, if you have the Sleeping dogs game already, you don't need to buy that "Definitive edition".  But if you've missed it earlier - don't wait until it's become completely obsolete, give it a shot!\n\nWhat is new in "Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition"? Well, there are many small things redistributed here and there, mostly to the better. Example: there was a bind to the right mouse button, so if you click it while driving, Wei Shen jumps off the venicle with the gun ready, in slow-mo, of course. Cool feature, very cinematographic, but almost never used. I remember more than dozen times in the original Sleeping dogs when I occasionally clicking that button in the middle of the chase... and had to restart all sequence. Because of the one stupid button binding. Good news: they fixed it in "Definitive edition"! Sweet? Yeah, for sure!\nBut hey, key binding is a very small thing, do we really need to buy all the game once more to have normal controls?\n\nSorry, if I'm talking too long, but I'm gonna give you a full comparison of the two products now, so if you're not ready to read it all, goto 10, or skip to the bottom.\n\nLike I said earlier, developers of Sleeping dogs redistributed all the secondary stuff in the game. That means that original game, all its mechanics, practically all its glitches - remained the same. Remember dying in the "Election" mission in jumping sequence? It's remained the same. Stupid taxi mappings? There. And so on. Yep, if we take a general look, they refurbished some textures. But that was made with great price of tossing away all 32-bit systems. "VIP only" now! But if you ask me, if the game looking better now, I'll answer "No, it remained almost where it was. You'll not see the difference even if you try to".\n\nAll about secondary stuff, that's it. Notorious DLC. Now, in the Definitive edition, they seems much more logically connected with the main story. Side missions appears connected with the main quest progress, experience they giving now is not enough to quick levelling. All is much more fair now. And dull. And dumb. See, from the first place, the main story itself is not logical and well-implemented with the real (or cinematographic) Hong Kong. It is not a comic book, thank God, but very close to it - naive, sketchy and simplesized. Was made that way to fit "normal" user, of course.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say there is that all that developers gain in logic and balance, they lose in general fun out of the game. Take a Retro-Triad suit for example. In general sense, Wei Shen cannot wear a suit like that no matter what. It is not fit into story. Yet, it is fun to wear. So it exist. But there's a difference. In the "old edition" you can wear some (any) parts of that suit separately. I, for example, liked gloves. Someone liked the haircut (yeah, it's part of the suit). So everyone could pick it's own look. Sorry, but no more. If you want Retro-Triad suit, it's there, but only as whole. Makes even less sense than it was before.\n\nLet me put it once again:\n+ Added some high-res textures for graphics freaks. Still not comparable with the Rockstar product, though.\n+ All DLC, all the seconadary stuff now structurized and appears with the progress of the main quest.\n+ Some new missions were added! They are quite short and linear, but new is a new!\n+ Some small glitches and questionable game features was fixed\n\n- Owners of 32-bit windows systems now aren't supported. What is more, new graphics features requires a tricky manual tuning to work properly (at least, for PC with two graphics systems, like the most of gaming notebooks)\n- Implementation of the DLC made some of them very limited. You cannot divide costumes, you cannot beat monks in the temple multiple times, "death by a thousand cuts" mission now limited to 30 enemies and one go through (and what a good skirmish it was before! sob)\n- Some major game glithes and disadvantages remains (like the falling from the ramp in "the Election" mission or people stucking in walls)\n\nI'd praised all the fixes were they a simple update to the existing game. But paying once again for the very same story with the very same experience and bugs? That's rip-off!","February 28, 2015","false","115.3"," 312 of 510 people (61%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","61","312","510","17","14"

It updates the parkour and combat system with slightly new controls and in my opinion more response from the original. The driving has been improved by alot the only thing they didnt spiff up a bit was the camera controls while driving which can still be a pain in some situations. As for the textures and update models I will say the graphics haven't been updated that much but the increased models makes the enviroment feel a little bit more immersive. Now for the DLC which I feel is done the right way in this game as opposed to the original where it was all handed to you the second you step into your apartment and you become the endgame badass on mission 2. All the clothing has been added to a Legendary Vendor, police vehicles and equipment is achieved by finishing cop jobs, cars and other clothing is all unlocked via finishing missions/side content and the zodiac tournament. If you haven't yet played this game this is definetly a great buy having the whole game and DLC's in one with update mechanics and improved code for a much more stable playing experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/recommended/307690/","Somnambuls","D.Cosmos [lv]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/","233 products in account","Sleeping Dog's is a GTA style action and adventure game set in open-world Hong-Kong, where you take the role of Wei Shen, an undercover cop that infiltrates one of the HK triads Sun On Yee. As game progresses, you gain both Police and Triad XP that provides different perks for each next level. Additionally, you gain face XP that provides additional bonuses and certain collectibles (jade statues) allow you to unlock melee combos in the local martial arts club. The game offers a wide range of various side missions (chase sequences, beat-em up missions, drug busts, dating missions, shooting missions, races) and mini games (♥♥♥♥ (rooster) fights, tournaments, karaoke). In overall, there's a heavy focus on driving and puzzle solving, as well, as hand-to-hand combat. Although, hand-to-hand combat is enjoyable, the driving and puzzle solving starts to get annoying and/or repetitive after a while. It seems, that the game was artificially made longer through driving, lock picking, camera hacking and collectible searching. However, the story is really strong and interesting and you grow attached to the main character and some of the NPCs. The graphics and voice acting are of high level and overall Sleeping Dogs is a fun, action-pumped open-world experience with a nice dose of Hong-Kong action flick influence. But, unfortunately, there are quite a few little faults that pull the game down and, as a result, it offers only a slightly above-the-average experience. Definitely enjoyable, but with more polish it could've been excellent.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Interesting main story missions\n- A vast variety of side missions\n- A skill tree\n- A vast variety of character skins and wide range of vehicle choices\n- Great combat mechanics\n- Good graphics (although the Definitive Edition is actually not that much of an improvement compared to the Standard Edition)\n- Open-world environment that is a simplified and not a very accurate replica of Hong Kong (who cares though?)\n- Emma Stone and Lucy Liu as voice actors ;)\n\nCONS:\n\n- Lack of convenient fast-travel options (only taxis that cost money and are not available everywhere and the car valet)\n- Dependence on foods and drinks that need constant replenishing for stat boosts\n- Annoying driving experience from time to time (narrow streets, intense traffic, AIs suddenly stopping in the middle of the road or changing lanes, camera spins on reverse, exaggerated momentum)\n- Sometimes it's hard to find the objective in the street mazes of Hong Kong\n- Inaccurate ranged weapons and barely noticeable cross-hairs\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n- Romance is very superficial, it should have had more substance\n- Both the Definitive and Standard Edition didn't recognize my Nvidia videocard on Windows 8 and 8.1 and they crashed or freezed on the first loading screen. The forum solutions didn't work. I was able to play Sleeping Dogs only after the upgrade to Windows 10.\n\nMy overall rating: 7.5/10\n\nDLCs:\n\n- Nightmare in North Point: imo, the best DLC of them all. A fun combat experience with elements of Chinese folklore. Adds some additional combat mechanics that allows you to fight demons and the blood-craving ghosts.\n- The Zodiac Tournament - also a fun story around a fighting tournament in the style of Enter the Dragon\n- Year of the Snake - a heavy focus on driving, repetitive side missions. The story is about Wei Shen investigating a terrorist cult. Quite boring.","October 3, 2015","true","55.5"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","23","27","3","0"

The game looks good but it's far from being a "next gen" experience, imo). This will demand a bit more from your rig. I can NOT run this edition as high as I did the standard edition. So, if you were barely able to play the previous iteration just be aware that you may not have such luck with the definitive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/knubbler/recommended/307690/","knubbler","ChinsForDays","http://steamcommunity.com/id/knubbler/","100 products in account",""You are a cop, I'm an undercover cop. The rules are different"\n\nI think this famous line from the sleeping dogs marketing campaign sums it up well. The games protagonist Wei Shen is as he says in the quote. An undercover cop, infiltrating the notorious (fictional) Hong Kong Triad the "Sun On Yee." You get to play Wei as he goes deeper and deeper into the Triad lifestyle and organization too try and shut it down from the inside, while trying to keep his loyalties to the police in this sandbox game from Square Enix. The game isn’t perfect but it accomplishes what it wanted to do and is a welcome change of pace in the sandbox genre.\n\nThe story begins with Wei Shen working for the police department when he is recruited by the police superintendent to go deep undercover into the Sun On Yee Triad due to his extensive skills and childhood relationships with current members. Wei takes the job on and then the real journey begins. Wei goes through a lot to prove his loyalties to Triad lieutenant Winston along with his childhood friend Jackie. Wei finds that a rival lieutenant is at odds with Winston and it quickly leads to a gang war. Wei has to take extreme actions to prove he is loyal to his Triad which starts to put him at odds with the police. The hole gets deeper and deeper for Wei in a compelling story that’s well written and well-acted.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty standard sandbox fair. It plays pretty much exactly like GTA which it takes obvious inspiration from in almost all aspects of the game. The key difference between the two is the emphasis on melee combat; guns are much more rare in Hong Kong than they are in American based sandbox games. So naturally the melee combat is much more refined than it is in other sandbox games. The melee combat plays almost identical to the "Batman Arkham" series, though not quite as smoothly but it works fine. Beating down gangsters in Bruce Lee style martial arts fighting never gets old thankfully and is lots of fun. It is however, naturally much more grounded than Batman, so don’t expect to go all flying fists everywhere during a fight. It actually works very well having the game's combat so focused on melee. It changes things up and provides greater difficulty than having all the games fights be settled with guns. Now that doesn’t mean that there aren't gun fights in this game because there sure are, lots of them and they have a John Woo film/Max Payne bullet time feature which is tons of fun. Particularly in the games third act. The guns fights really aren’t very hard, about as difficult as a GTA game and play identically to GTA IV and V. Driving naturally is also something that you will do A LOT. It's just the part of the nature of sandbox games as GTA and Saints Row players will know and expect. The game has plenty of cars and motorcycles and other types of vehicles to get around in. Another welcome addition that sleeping dogs brings to the table is an easy, functional and basic parkour system. The games parkour is mostly just for making moving around the city easy, fast and fun. You won’t be climbing buildings "Assassins Creed" style but it works well and makes movement lots of fun. Car combat is prevalent as well. The game allows you to shoot while driving with 360 degree aiming in a well-designed easy to use system. It makes crazy hi-octane car battles some of the highlights of Sleeping Dogs.\n\nThe game's story mission and side mission structure works identically to GTA. There’s the main story missions marked with green icons on your map. Side missions are marked with variously coloured icons for different things such as: police missions, favours for citizens of Hong Kong etc. Story missions feature a clever mechanic where you are graded on your performance as a Triad gangster and a cop based on your actions during a mission. Killing your enemies in effective and brutal ways will get you more points with your Triad score while minimizing damage to the public will get you points for your cop score. It really makes missions more interesting and gives good incentive to be precise and careful during missions. There are quite a lot of side missions to do as well but unfortunately this is where one of the games main flaws resides. Many of the less significant side missions are recycled and repetitive which can be boring and even some what frustrating. It terms of the main story it’s also on the shorter side at thirty missions. It is an exciting, intense and well done story however so it's easy to forgive its shorter length. The best side missions are for sure the police cases. These have you looking into serious crimes for the police while working outside the system. You investigate kidnapping of illegal immigrants, serial killers, organ harvesters, the black market and hard core drug dealing. These all tell small stories on the side that are satisfying to play and solve. Street racing with various "classes" of vehicles ranging from class A-C is common and lots of fun, especially with the class A vehicles. It helps that the driving is pretty well done in the game.\n\nNow aside from the main story and side missions there are other things you can do with your time as well. Karaoke is very popular in Hong Kong and when you go to clubs there are rooms where you can take part in a guitar hero style mini game of karaoke played with your keyboard or your controller. There aren't many songs to play but they are fun. You can also go hunting the collectables, which thankfully are all helpful and actually do something. There are three kinds of collectables in the game: health shrines, jade statues and lockboxes. There are fifty health shrines in total and like the name suggests finding them will increase your max health. There are like one hundred lockboxes that are full of money and unlock more clothing options. The best collectables though are for sure the twelve jade statues, finding them allow you to unlock new moves to use in melee combat. These moves are taught to you by Wei's wise childhood sensei; every time you bring him one he has a heart to heart with Wei about his life choices and his past. They also discuss his life as a Triad but he cannot reveal his true nature as an undercover cop and it’s surprisingly insightful.\n\nThe characters are very important of course, Sleeping Dogs has a big cast of characters who are all well written and very well acted. Besides Wei there's his best friend and Triad member Jackie, his Triad boss Winston, Police Superintendent Pendrew and many others. One thing that Sleeping Dogs brings back from GTA San Andreas is Wei having relationships with various women over the course of the story. However this is a big screw up in how Sleeping Dogs executes these relationships. Basically it works like this. You meet a woman and help her out, and then she gives Wei her number. You go on one date with her and then at the end of the date you have sex which you see or hear none of (this sex comes way too easy by the way) and then you unlock some bonus after. The bonuses are actually really helpful so even though these relationships are so poorly done they are still totally worth doing. Another issue with the game is the celebrity voices. No the celebrities don’t do bad jobs in their roles, in fact they do well. However they are super underutilized, Tom Wilkinson plays the police superintendent and even though it sounds super important he isn’t in the game nearly as much as you would expect. Lucy Lui and Emma Stone are barley even in the game at all. A total waste of money and talent.\n\nAll in all Sleeping Dogs is a fun sandbox game. It has some notable flaws that hold it back from being in the same league as its competition and inspiration. It brings some welcome things to the sandbox game table with its parkour and emphasis on melee combat as well its clever cop/criminal dynamic with the protagonist. I can easily recommend this game when it’s on sale.  8/10","December 4, 2014","true","39.4"," 39 of 56 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","39","56","0","0"

Gotta say I was pretty impressed with some parts in the game they really took extra care of. One thing I really like instead of boxes and crates just flying around all over now they will actually move and break apart. Your car driving stages are MUCH smoother this time around compared to before. (I sometimes hated the driving and shooting stages.) They fixed alot of other bugs including one that was very annoying. When walking up to certain food stations or NPC's sometimes Wei will walk in place and take like 2 or 3 minutes to finally get in the right position to finally speak to them That thankfully also has been fixed. If you were on the fence about getting Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition before try it out now. Lots of improvements plus if you originally had the game you can upgrade and pay $15 for the newer version. Overall?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/recommended/307690/","bloodravensid","Blood Ravens - AWAY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/","926 products in account","A review for Sleeping Dogs : Definitive Edition\n\nIn this review, most of the review will review the gameplay of the game, as I seen that the meat of the game should also be in its gameplay. While some game will require great interfaces, games that are focused on open-world fighting/shooting should be focused on its gameplay.\n\nThe first thing about this game, is that it has excellent gameplay, and quite varied with the well-established free-roaming games such as Grand Theft Auto series, Saints Row series, or Just Cause series. While four of them are great, the thing that makes Sleeping Dogs great is it have small amount of guns. It means that guns are hard to come by, most enemies don't have guns, and for the most part of the game you won't be using a gun.\n\nYou won't be using your gun, but you are using your fist and your martial skill, this is what makes the game interesting. As with other fighting games, you can chain combo, do heavy strikes, block and counter, and other typical fighting moves. As you collect collectibles in the game, you will gain more advanced martial arts strikes, thus making you are more potent combatant. For most of the game you will face off with your enemy with Triad enemies with your fist, so fighting in the game have more color than its FPS aspect. In the fighting, you and your enemies will use believable melee weapons such as knife, tire iron, batons, meat cleaver, and not using melee weapons that are scarcely available in modern settings such as spears, katanas, or swords. This makes the fighting more realistic.\n\nThe great aspect in the fighting is the environmental kills. These type of kills are brutal, that's for sure. You could stick someone's head in rotating fans, throw somebody to a flaming furnace, electrocute them with high voltage, throw them to the garbage bin, puncture their lungs using "sharp objects", drown them in water, and many more.\n\nIn the shooting aspect, this game is also good. Not great, but good. The type of weapon did not vary very much, because then, as the story will tells you : "Guns are rare in Hong Kong." The game features a "shoot from cover" system and "blind fire" system, closely looks like GTA IV system, but there are some perks in shooting aspect, like you can enter slow mo mode if you leap from one place to other place. There is nothing new in shooting aspect, but it's good enough, in my opinion it's better than GTA IV system.\n\nIn the gameplay, it's interesting also to note that your character is not Thor or something. The character will die quickly if shot at, making we more careful if we exchange fire with firearm-wielding enemies. While the character could take more damage in melee fighting, it's interesting to see that our character could not take much hit from firearms. It's quite real obviously, you could take three to four punches without dying, but two shots could kill you. This, and coupled with lack of firearms (and its ammunition) makes the police/law in the game very strong, because you could not bring your fist to a firefight.\n\nThe ambience of Hong Kong is very greatly potrayed. I have been to Hong Kong for numerous times, and I would like to say that the spirit of Hong Kong is captured well. The signboards really reflects Hong Kong, as does how Hong Kong shop owners shout to the customers to ask them to purchase some DVDs, or how great their pork bun is. The street is also filled with Hong Kong cars, most notably the red taxi, the green small bus, the blue truck/construction worker transport, and many others. The street signs also are done in Chinese, so that the environment is greatly looking as the real Hong Kong. The only thing that I complains is there are lack of Chinese language use, because though Hong Kong people do understand English, in most times they are using Chinese, not English. While some "curses" in the game are obviously Chinese, I would like if the game respect Chinese language more.\n\nThe activity of this game is somewhat bland. You have the regular racing (while you have to be #1, which is another thing I complain). You have fight clubs, where you will fight people. The only activity that interests me is the "drug raid" system, which are akin to GTA San Andreas hood takeover system. You fight some people, and you call something on TV, jobs done. There are lockboxes, shrines, and others as collectibles, but I don't see collecting collectibles as activities. For instance, there are no restaurants, no strip clubs, no bars, that you could interact.\n\nStory wise, this game have excellent story. I would not spoil it, but somewhat the ending is "expected". The twist of the game is "expected" too. If you have watched the movie about undercover agents you would know who will betray you. But, all in all, an excellent story.\n\nThe "other" games that are provided in the Definitive Edition (the zombie, the police pack, etc.) are not going to be reviewed much, because they are not the meat of the game. While they are interesting, I would say that the DLCs are pretty bland.\n\nPurchase this game, and purchase that pork bun, because a man without a pork bun in their hand is not a real man.","January 22, 2015","true","36.2"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","20","24","5","5"

There are many side tasks and side missions for you to run; races, fight clubs, gambling, police missions, and much more.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: You play as Wei Shen, an undercover cop attempting to infiltrate a Hong Kong criminal organization known as the "Sun On Yee". Will Wei Shen keep his loyalties to the cops? will he become unstable from the stress? Will he be swayed to only work for the Sun On Yee and forsake his allegiances? You'll need to play to find out. (I'll tell you this much: I had no idea which direction we were going in this game.)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=649166942\n\nGameplay: (There's a lot to say about the Gameplay in Sleeping dogs, so I'm going to add more sub-topics. Hopefully that makes the information easier to read.)\n\n-Combat\nMartial Arts\nThere are two types of combat in Sleeping Dogs; Martial Arts and eventually (when you get a gun) the shooting combat is played in third person. The Martial Arts section has different combinations of attacks; for example, click click click-and-hold, click click click click click-and-hold. However for most of the combo's you'll need to unlock by returning statues (hold that thought, we'll come back to that later).\nSo you've got your clicky basic attacks, but wait! There's more! There is also grappling. By grappling you grab a hold of your enemy for a short time, you can proceed to beat your enemy like a drum with standard clicks... or you can embrace your inner monster and smash your new dance partner into an environmental object. You can do a special environmental kills with various objects which are outlined in red while grappling. (remember to make your choice fast, or else your dance partner will escape!)\nArguably the most important features of the hand-to-hand combat is counter attacking, before most attacks the attacking NPC will suddenly have a red outline, at this time if you press the counter button ("E" on the default keyboard controls) Wei will execute various counter attacks, counters are extremely important, many tough enemies are nearly impossible to defeat without them.\n\nI would quickly like to make a few aesthetic mentions: the Martial Arts moves are spot on. I've been practicing TaeKwonDo for a few years, and watching those backspin kicks... oh! it's beautiful! Additionally the animation styles are very varied; so you don't keep seeing the same slow motion kills again and again, even after 30 hours spent in the game it's extremely satisfying to punch out someone, or if I get tired of that I could just put 'em in a dumpster.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=676291887\n\nThird Person Shooter\nEventually Wei gets his hands on some weapons; there are plenty of them. The first few weapons will just be melee weapons, but eventually fire arms are introduced. At this point the game turns into a Third-Person Shooter. the significant feature of Sleeping Dogs where guns are concerned, is triggering slow motion after vaulting over objects while aiming.\nI have borderline-exploited this feature, I will spoiler tag my trick in case you want to figure it out on your own. While in slow motion I would score head shots on anyone in cross hairs distance. After slow motion stops I would just vault over another object to enter slow motion mode again.\n\n-Driving\nThere's a lot of different types of vehicles you can drive; there are boats, motorcycles, cars, buses, motorized bikes, and many more. You can shoot while in most vehicle if you have a gun while driving. You can jump out of your vehicle and hijack other vehicles. You can smash into other vehicles by using a bashing or side swipe ability ("L-Shift" on the default keyboard controls)\n\n-Leveling/progression\nThere's a lot to appreciate about the sense of progression in Sleeping Dogs! There are 3 different experience and levels: Police experience, Triad Experience, and Face Experience. Each level rewards a different skill or perk. Additionally there are many collectibles, the most important collectibles are various statues which can be returned to the Dojo in exchange for new combination hand-to-hand-techniques.\n\n-DLC\nUnfortunately (or maybe 'fortunately', depends on if you like my reviews. haha) I cannot write reviews for the individual DLC. But to quickly cover the DLC: It's good.\nThere's a lot of DLC included with the Definite Edition, I think I've only gotten through a fourth of the DLC content. It's also worth noting that the Definitive edition was advertised as adding graphical improvements to the game. (It ran very well on my Windows 10 machine at 1080p, just a side note)\n\nAchievements: Oh boy... an analytical break down for the steam achievements would take far too long. At the time that I'm writing this review, I've successfully completed the story and maxed triad, police, and face experience (30 hours, many of those hours being distracted by civilian tag with cars).\nA good chunk of the achievements are allocated like most other games: story, extra's, missions, 100%, find all the things. I can't speak from first hand experience (yet), but a friend of mine has already earned 100% completion on the game.\n\nPrice: Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is priced at $29.99 I just relaxed and enjoyed taking my time on beating the main story and I've already racked up 30 hours. with only 50% of the achievements it's safe to say I've got plenty of game time that'll increase after this review has been posted.\nFor those of you unfamiliar with my value system: I like to get a hour out of a game for every dollar spent. So I'm saying this game was a great value, and will increase in value as I play it.\n\nConclusion: All in all, if you like Martial Arts, Third Person shooters, Action, Open World action genre games, Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is for you. I was probably the target audience for this game, because I get really pumped while I play, in a way it helps inspire me for my next TaeKwonDo practice sessions.\n\nSpecial thanks to Angfucious for gifting me this game. You were 100% correct that I would love this game.\n\nP.S. The Umbrella Gang has it's eye on you. Umbrella gang!

Sleeping Dogs is a really immersive game, not in terms of graphics but in terms of gameplay. We follow our main protagonist who is a cop, back in his hometown of Hong Kong where he grew up. Only this time, he's going undercover to stop big crime organisations such as the Sun On Yee (Sun Yee On in real life, yes they were real gangs). The game itself had some of the most fun gameplay features I've ever seen. The gameplay felt like I was really a part of Hong Kong.\n\nPros\nThe best feature about this game is the combat. The combat gameplay in this game is really mind-blowing because of how balanced it is. At times, it doesn't feel too easy but it isn't too hard either. I really liked how you can unlock new moves, and how the game focused more on brawling than gun gameplay.\nThe graphics in this game are really good, especially on the interior houses that you own. The character models could be improved a bit, so can the whole depth of field and atmosphere, but the world detail was really outstanding and I really liked it.\nThe character development in this game was really done well. You built relationships with the people around you, both cop and gang sides.\nThe sound is the game is really good too. It builds you into the environment like as if you are really there.\nPerformance wasn't an issue, the game ran really smooth on high.\nCons\nthe worst thing about sleeping dogs in my opinion was the driving. The driving felt really stiff and at times, racing was a lot harder because of this. Yes there was handbrakes and braking, but the driving just didn't really make me like how it was controlled.\nLack of vehicle catergories. There was hardly any wide ranges of cars/bikes, and besides that, there is only on land and on sea vehicles. That showed the game with less variety.\nThe map is really short and inconvinient. Sometimes, the map felt really short and didn't make Hong Kong seem big at all. It would have been better if the map was a lot bigger.\nI hope you have enjoyed my review of Sleeping Dogs. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a Fast and Furious like game, (or even a Kung Fu movie).\n\nStory        Graphics        Performance        Soundtrack        Enjoyment        Overall                8        7        8        7        8        7.6","March 14","true","12.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Not much, it's just patched original Sleeping Dogs with full DLC and some improvements to the graphic that are either insignificant or unimportant.\nI can play the original version at max setting with solid fps, but I have to play this one on medium because the fps are too unstable (FYI, my spec is more or less the same as recommended), I also have a problem with ingame screen resolution, it causes me to have some kind of slightly visible letterbox appears at times, which is annoying because original version didn't have it.\nBut as I said, the changes to graphic are insignificant. World density is the only improvement that worth mentioning, which makes the world more living by adding more cars, people on streets, NPC variations (less clones),... but this change can be achieved by a free patch, not a patch being sold. Also, still no Steam Cloud, wtf dev? Seriously?\n\nIn short, Sleeping Dogs is an amazing game, but this Definitive Edition is a quick cash grab, patched games being sold at high price. Don't buy it if you already owned the original version, it's not worth it.\n\nFor people with spec below recommended: Don't buy it because the spec given by the dev is inaccurate, you can play it on low smoothly, but it will look worse and less stable than the original version on medium. It seems the game doesn't use up all the CPU power, but depends mostly on GPU power, which means you need a strong GPU to play this game on high smoothly.","April 21, 2015","false","1.0"," 70 of 117 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","70","117","5","1"

This version is no different, however, it has improvements that make me recommend it over the original. The performance is solid, the controls are more natural for PC players, and really looks better in general. There's things like HDAO that make cutscenes look great, improved models, city density, better lighting and reflections, and of course, everyone's favorite, lens flare. I'd say it's a great game to get into if you haven't played it before. If you have, it's definately worth playing through again with all the pretty graphics and blinky lights. All the DLC is included as well so there is a lot available from the get-go. Visit the trading forum to get this game really cheap!\n\nI don't support this type of behavior from developers, but I liked the original and got it for free with my graphics card. I've always wanted to play the DLC missions as well, so this was an instant buy for me. Adding the solid 60fps that I didn't get from the original, I'd have to recommend it.\n\nAlso, having FRAPS open disables the overlay.\n\nI'd give this a 9/10.","October 9, 2014","true","8.8"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","24","34","0","1"

The sidemissions in the game are generally fun, although the drug busts can get repetitive. Decent character customization, but some bad animation besides in the cutscenes (which were done with motion capture I imagine) and the martial arts combat, which felt very fluid.\n\nGunplay was alright, it wasn't the highlight of the game but it was still very fun, and the slow-motion while vaulting and shooting was very satisfying. The graphics are good, the model detail was good for the most part, although the detail on the civilians was pretty bad for the most part, as to be expected with an open world game.\n\nOverall, this game is a fun open-world interpretation of Hong-Kong. In my opinion it's worth more than the 30$ it's selling at right now.\nIf I was to rate it, I'd give it an 8/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/derpybirds/recommended/307690/","derpybirds","DerpyBirds","http://steamcommunity.com/id/derpybirds/","641 products in account","Well... after finishing the story mode of the game in 2 days I can honestly say, this was an amazing journey.\n\nIntroduction to the game\nYou start the game as Wei Shen, a former police officer in San Francisco who's been transfered to a fictional hong kong which is split into four districts. Wei Shen has been assigned to destroy a Triad organization by the name of Sun On Yee.\nFrom there on out the game splits you into two characters - Wei Shen, police officer and Wei Shen, a member of the triad organization.\n\nGameplay\n→ The Combat\nThe combat system in this game is quite simple and easy to use, you fight with the click of your left mouse button and dodge incomming hits by pressing E at the right time. I really relish the fighting moments in the game where the character is faced off against 8 or more enemies at the same time, prooves quite a challenge at first but gets easier the more you do it. Another big thing in a lot of games are guns, not in this game though. You don't get a gun in your hand in the first 2 hours atleast into the game, you actually feel how powerful guns are in the game once you get them. You'll be spending most of the game fighting enemies with your fists or some other melee weapon rather then a pistol or an automatic.\n\n→ The Vehicles\nSimilarly to other games you can steal vehicles from a parking lot or the road by brutally janking the driver out, taking his place. Of course you don't have to steal vehicles, there is another to get a vehicle.\nThere's a large variety of vehicles in the game for you to choose from. Once you obtain these vehicles in your garage you can choose 3-5 colors of your car and where you wish to recieve it from, there are multiple spots on the map from which you may take an infinite amount of these vehicles from. Some vehicles handle very nicely, others not so much. Occasionally you will run into a police situation from which you must escape and in this game it is quite easy, you just drive out of their detection zone and any ammount of police attention you had is just suddenly gone. Unfortunately there's no way of getting any air vehicles - Helicopters, planes etc. The sea vehicles are a bit of frustrating to control as they turn very slowly.\n\n→The Minigames\nSometimes you just want to take a break from the story mode but what do you do then? Do you go shoot people? Do you go explode cars? The answer is no. You go and sing karaoke ↓\nMe trying Karaoke\nIf karaoke isn't your thing you can also enjoy an exciting adrenaline rushing race in the streets of hong kong, or perhaps you feel like busting some crimes, you can!\n\n→ The collectibles\nThroughout the map are placed many collectable items like statues, which you can give your old sensei in return for a new fighting technique. Then there are healing statue things which collecting will give you permanently more health, money can also be found in briefcases with sometimes a piece of clothing.\n\n→The Extras\nYou can also purchase with ingame money clothing for Wei Shen which he will wear in any cutscene in the game, I think that's a very neat feature to the game aswell.\n\nThe Story\nThis game's story was really quite the journey, you can really feel the emotions of the characters in the game. Excitement, anger, grief, relief - all emotions that I've felt while playing this amazing masterpiece of a game, and if you really listen to the dialogue you will feel too. This is one of those games where once you start playing, you can't stop untill it's done.\n\nFinal Vertdict\nThis game has been a wonderful expirience for me and I suggest everyone to play it and enjoy it too. If you don't think you can run the definitve edition you should atleast buy the orginal. I'd rate this game a 10/10 for the pure depth of the game and story of it.","July 28, 2015","true","99.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

There's blood and scenarios are merciless.\n\nThe game is mainly fought with fists, but guns are available on select missions. Some situations are crazy, specially the bike races - NPCs will ram the flag girl at the start. The rest of the way, they will go crazy on you.\n\nCar physics are not easy to control. Ramming (button) can also be used while going sideways, which could be exploited when racing or driving fast in general. If you think races are difficult, just race later after you have the prototype car - then races can get funny.\n\nMovement is also awkward (I am using a mouse and keyboard setup). Camera angles in any mode (car / bike / foot) is hard to control, and you can't look too far up (which I find weird and sometimes irritating). On foot, turning is not as precise or quick as in other games (or even compared to real life). This can be frustrating in fighting... until you realize that you can use a car or bike to win them. The game is probably programmed more towards using a gamepad.\n\nSoundtrack is good. I only started to get tired of them after more than 30 hours of playing.\n\nGraphics are good, but sometimes can't keep up when driving fast. It only required 50% at 750MHz from my GTX 770, so I think many gamers can play this game.\n\nSound effects are amazing. It has perfect use of audio positioning and environmental sounds are there. Though, at times, motor boat and water splashing sounds were skipping (not produced) for a few seconds in intervals.\n\nThe story is alright, and the story telling is fine. Events can sometimes get weird. You can't grab who you're chasing (even when you're already touching them) until you've reached the end where you'll fight a group or they simply give up; but at the same time, as part of the game rule, you can't be too far away from them (again, in a chase scenario).\n\nThis game scored a 5/10 for me, but I'm labeling it as a Recommend for the story telling and overall good fun. The controls is the biggest let-down as I was forced to play with a hard to control character until I finish it. The game has a serious note, but remember that this is a game and better just take full advantage of what you can do to avoid character control, camera and other possible frustrations it could give you.","October 31, 2014","true","39.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

The developers implemented the game's open-world replica of Hong Kong painstakingly with striking visuals and smartly interconnected layouts, which help the player see this beautifully-realized city from all angles. The characters' presentations are also done in an effective manner. The effort put into the story of the main character especially pays off, as gamers can easily identify with the upbringing and struggles that drive development of protagonist Wei Shen as he searches to define himself between connections with the Hong Kong Police and the gang Sun On Yee. Wei is joined by a cast of secondary characters that would generally fall into the category of "stereotypical", but fortunately most have some extraordinary developments or twists that keep them from becoming stale or predictable.\n\nComparisons between Sleeping Dogs and the Grand Theft Auto series are commonplace. However, such claims made in an attempt to denigrate Sleeping Dogs is, at best, ignorant. Martial arts motifs play a significant role in the design of the gameplay here, composing the greatest difference between this and GTA. The player lacks the GTA-standard arsenal of weapons to carry around as combat is largely focused on hand-to-hand combat. Though some later levels heavily feature guns, players will largely find themseleves using combos and counters to dispatch foes. Other mechanics, ranging from a unique on-the-road hijack system to genre-standard slow-motion sequences further reinforce the kung-fu movie feel that the game is going for.\n\nSleeping Dogs suffers from an array of technical malfunctions and limitations. The game in general works appropriately (no issues with rendering or framerate), though on rare occasion it crashed with no warning. Because the game generates cutscenes and scripted actions in the real game environment (i.e. instead of cutscenes being full video, the background of the scene is a continuation of what is going on with NPCs in the open world), unintended consequences often result. These consequences range from the hilarious (two characters showing indifference after being run over during a cutscene) to the catastrophic (being stuck behind an invisible wall after a scripted event, requiring reset). Getting stuck is moreso an issue with platforming in this game, as it attempts to emulate Assassin's Creed's parkour system, only to provide an unrefined version, leaving many instances of floating above objets or glitching around walls where one shouldn't be. Finally, the overreliance on the counter mechanism during combat makes it difficult to fight off groups of enemies as the game cannot handle many targets to counter at once. This proves especially troublesome during the beginning of the game, when Wei is too weak to take most attacks and must abuse the counter, leading to some unfair situations. This becomes less of an issue as he grows stronger in the game.\n\nIn spite of this variety of issues the game faces, it was never enough to outweigh the positive experience that playing this game provided. It offers a lengthy primary campaign, bolstered by sidequests, completion goals and simple-yet-fun minigames. The Definitive Edition provides a significant amount of bonus missions and accessories to effectively bolster the length of the game after beating the main game. Additionally, it provides two scenarios seperate from the main game to play, which are both worthwhile in their own right. Though the final result of the game faced faulty implementation due to what the game was trying to accomplish, it still succeeds in providing a more visually-enthralling, narrative driven experience than is normal for action sandbox titles, and is a worthy game in any collection.

One Kung-Fu at a time.\n\nStory\nPlaying the story of Sleeping Dogs [SD] reminds me of the old action Kung-Fu movie where the story moves at breakneck speed and emotional rollercoaster happens all the time.

It delivers them in spades and is not afraid to hold back from doing all sorts of nasties that the player will no doubt witness and feel.\n\nGraphic\nUsually I do not like to talk much about graphics because what the heck am I suppose to write?! Exception of course are made. Sleeping Dogs treats the world of Hong Kong is pretty bland with repetitive civilian, normal texture etc etc but it really comes alive during the night and rain! Especially night and rain together in tandem!\n\nSkins exude a sheen, cars has powerful reflection upon them and everything is generally 10x better than it is during daytime. Not to say the standard graphics are bad but upping it up and witnessing the full glory of the engine in rain and night is a breathtaking experience.\n\nSound\nUnited Front Games pulled no punches in making sure we get the most authenthic experience for our stay in Hong Kong. Random quips in Cantonese can be heard as you walk the streets, Character that do not speak english instead does full Cantonese dialogue. The crisp clear audio makes subtitle a secondary thing as oppose to be a mandatory on for most games and every effect down to the last mission complete evoke a strangely nostalgic chinese feel.\n\nGameplay\nAh Sleeping Dogs, I turn you on, kick a few citizen stuff them into the boot of their car then kill them right in front of the hospital with my KUNG-FU. What better way to start a monday.\n\nIn an otherwise typical fare of open world game Sleeping Dog does the competition shame by focusing on one aspect many game have neglected: The melee system. While initially the melee system seems easy with 1 hko object scattered all over the enviroment and enemies come in weak and puny form they soon ramp it up especially towards midgame where you will be punching, kicking and hurling foes off rail while covered in blood. Essentially press counter when enemy glow red, punch them up till they die and then when the meter is full use face mode to recover health and make your enemy fear you.\n\nAlong the way explore the world! Beat up people in side activities to uncover drug raids, beat people up again to obtain chests of money and clothing. Turn Wei into the most fashion savvy freak with the game large customization option. Engage in daring fights as you beat up people to get money and more face value!\n\nOr perhaps you're a picky one eh? Want a bit of dialogue and action in your beat em up? Look no further. Turn into a cop hunt down people as you become the scourge of the underworld, help your eccentric group of buddies as they get into random hijinks that often ends with beating people up. Or you know, just help around the citizen of Hong Kong, they could use a help from a friendly people-beating gangster.\n\nBut alas the gunplay fall shorts, since most resources went into fighting people up the gun lacks recoil, feels plasticky and holds no weight. Cleverly the game wave them away from most mission by stating "HONG KONG DON'T ALLOW GUNS!" it works for me it should works for you.\n\nThe car good to say however is awesome and a joy to ride, and since you can simply steal a car it doesnt matter if you're walking on foot, simply steal a car and be on your way. Or you can use the car valet. Eh. Fun feature includes the ability to steal cars within a car without going out. Amazing when you think about it since you don't have to dismount but can happily continue your ride in a shiny new car as the wreck of your old ones burns behind you.\n\nCompleting mission earns you triad points by being brutal and police point for being civilised lawful cop. Leveling up gives you a choice of perk within the skill tree.\n\nAn oddly choice of collectible, side missions and all that jazz ensures you won't be bored of the game anytime soon.\n\nConclusion\nHow I wish i could experience it all over again, the powerful gunfight, desperate Kung-Fu action and emotional story. Why does more game can be this way? Alas a few minor issues does bog it down though. But does this makes it a bad game? It is an excellent game released suddenly to our world. Buy it already I am tired of typing this all out. Basically this game is awesome.\n\nScoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: A++ Rank\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

The structure of the game is no surprise for any GTA player, or if you have played the previous True Crime games, with the only major difference here is that the game's combat is based on a Batman-style melee approach, which is suitably fun once you get the hang of it and identify the various moves. It does get a bit repetative towards the end of the main mission set, but that's common with most open world games; there's also a good deal of completionist gathering one can go after. However, elements like the story itself are somewhat lackluster - you can get an idea where the story is heading early on, and there's not much redeeming or vile about any of the characters.\n\nThe Definition Edition includes two packs of DLC, both adding another 2-3 hr each of gameplay. The second one, Year of the Snake, feels like a good single movie in terms of plot (attempting to stop a cult bombing the city), while the first one has fun elements of movies like Big Trouble in Little China in it.\n\nThe only issue that I have against the game is a lack of technical updates from the publisher, which many have commented on the forums. In my case, I had started the game, and during that time had to update a completely separate hardware driver for a camera device, among other things. This caused the game to be inoperable. Only until I was at a point that I had replaced the camera with a different one, did the game then work fine. As one of the few troubleshooting tips they have given has been to disconnect all USB devices which have worked for some but not all, this might create a technical problem for you.","January 5, 2015","true","25.7"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","2"

Game's like GTA and Saints Row, which do a good job on their own, don't come even close to what Sleeping Dogs offers me when it comes down to gameplay, handling, atmosphere, voice overs and hints of reality.\nThe city of (virtual) Honk Kong is beautifully dirty and down to earth. The people all look very realistic and not like some comic book character. The cars look the way they should look: normal.\nThere're many mini games throughout the main game and they all blend in perfectly and make sens in one way or another. It's nothing stupid, but fitting.\nAnother good thing is that random violence is not rewarded, but rather punished. Especially when doing a mission.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that's very similar to GTA or Saints Row, but want a somewhat more realistic setting, then get Sleeping Dogs. It provides action, drama, fun and visuals for content tourists; all on a very, very high level.\n\nThe two DLC's that come with the definitive edition provide each 2-3 hours of extra gameplay and I've got to be honest that the "year of the Snake" DLC suprised me in a very positive way. That's because you're actually playing as a police officer. (Wearing the uniform and all) As which your main goal is to cover up some cultist scheme and to arrest people.

Environmental attacks and upgradeable special moves round out the variety.\n\nThe real selling point is the map design - Hong Kong is lovingly rendered with beautiful levels of detail, from crowded market streets to curved highways overlooking endless rows of shipping docks. It's a delight to simply drive along the coastal highways and listen to the rippling shoreline or zip around the market districts. It's downright breathtaking, and stands head and shoulders above GTA's cities in terms of sheer visual interest.\n\nThe story is solid, albeit a bit standard. Gunplay, driving, and some side activities like gambling or drug busts provide a solid variety of activities for the entire map. Music, sound and voice acting are top-notch.\n\nThis is a a polished and cinematic take on the GTA sandbox formula, I thoroughly recommend it.","May 19","true","34.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Probably contains spoilers so consider yourself warned.\n\n\\ Story:\nThe story is an amazingly tangled mess of triad fighting and personal choices. It is going to break you down inside and i was left a crying mess throughout the game. It should be said that i am very easily attached to, and affected by things. The wedding, where the oh so sad love song always plays before ♥♥♥♥ is going down, Uncle Po, and not to forget the most horrible death of them all (to me at least), Jackie.. The last had me bawling my eyes out because the story and character had sucked me in (and i kinda had a minor crush on Edison Chen). Anyhow, the story is solid, A+.\n\n\\ Gameplay and graphics:\nThe improved graphics are stunning, and almost killed my computer because i was overly confident while choosing the ultra high settings. It was definitely worth the upgrade and it was even more immersive this time around than the first. I sat for eight hours the first day and ten hours the second to finish the game and i've never gotten so sucked into anything before. The vibrant colors and the city itself feels even more realistic now. I love the random encounters with people selling art and birds and whatnot too. And the food looks so amazingly good i just keep drooling every time i look at it.\n\nThe only thing that annoyed me was towards the end of the game when the car valet kept saying he was busy and couldnt deliver to you, but apart from that i have nothing negative to say.\n\nEasily one of my favorite games and one of the best i've played so far.","October 27, 2014","true","26.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Yup... and you can be sure that my psycho-side was in full force when I played this. I just couldn't help myself. XD\n\nIt's basically a sandbox crime game, but with the added twist of you sometimes doing sandbox stuff where you punch crime instead. Or taze it. Or shoot it. Or arrest it. Or... yeah not continuing this. Anyway, there's lots of side missions, collectibles, places to explore, minigames, and citizens to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of when they make rude remarks about your clothes, hit you with their car, or just simply exist. Honestly, I didn't need reasons to act like a total sociopath (even moreso than I do in the Saints Row games, which is really saying something), so I had a tendency to act like one...\n\n...except during alot of missions when it actually has negative effects. Basically you have three leveling systems: Police (which you get xp for by obeying the law and punching criminals on police missions), Triad (for punching people or slamming their head into... woah that was uncalled for), and Face (for helping people, which I find funny since pride pretty much never involves being a benefactor). It's pretty obvious which of these three leveling systems I didn't get much XP for. The minigames were kinda silly, particularly that karaoke stuff and the whole collecting girl phone numbers thing (which I never called because I never got that bored). At least the combat is pretty good.\n\nThere is a story, and it's actually pretty good. At times predictable, and I often felt as if my main character was being way too antagonistic towards his police handler. But it's good. Also its crazy-violent, because gangsters who talk about codes and honor are the last people to actually respect such things. And while I was not torn at all about whose side I was on (because Triad people are scum), I did cheer a few times when they did stuff I wanted them to do, such as when the character I hated the most (because he pulled a Walder Frey, which made me think about the "RW" and all that comes with that) ended up being killed by a crazed lady feeding him one of his henchmen and chopping him with a meat cleaver. And while that was certainly satisfying, it wasn't one of the many ideas I had between the "Hong Kong RW" and that scene about what way I would have ended that guy (or Walder Frey). I had an alarming tendency to ponder what outrageous act of violence I wanted to see end the lives of certain characters, most of which were more brutal than what actually happened. I really must be a psycho. >_<\n\nAnyway... sandbox crime, violence, betrayal... all that horse-♥♥♥♥. There isn't really anything new here, and while I certainly prefer other games (like the Saints Row series) for this type of fun, this is alright. So I guess that's a "yes" from me.\n\nYey.","May 26, 2015","true","13.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","10","13","4","0"

It's not merely a re-release - it's a reworking of the graphics and a slight improvement on the already fluid and fun combat system, and it contains additions to the campaign (extended narrative, extra cop side missions) that are worthy of the repurchase cost for fans who already have the original (specifically those who liked it and want to play it again). Because I had already finished the campaign as well as played through the DLC episodes, I was hesitant to buy the same game twice, but when it went on sale for $7.50, I struck and was very happy I did. This is not only an extended and much more immersive experience; it works better on newer software and hardware architecture. It manages to pack Hong Kong more densely with NPCs and greatly improve environmental textures and weather while demanding much less of my GPU than the original release. They both hit some of the same framerates, but with settings cranked, my video card chugs along very loudly to the original release while it's capable of rendering more with less power in the definitive edition. Truly an optimal redesign for the PC.\n\nFor the many who've already played Sleeping Dogs and loved it, I 100% recommend picking up the definitive edition IF you want to play through the campaign again or if you haven't played the DLC episodes (and I'd wait for a sale). You may find the experience enjoyable as I did or you may feel like you're wading through the same water (albeit much more detailed and highly rendered water). If you've never played the game, this is the edition to get - it's a very fun open world game in the vein of Grand Theft Auto with tons of collectibles, a martial arts beat 'em up combat system, great driving mechanics, fun missions and side-objectives, and, most importantly of all, a good story fronted by a compelling protagonist who leads a double life as both an undercover cop & triad member and a Chinese-American immigrant & Chinese national. As another Asian-American who's faced confusion stemming from a bi-cultural background, I find Wei Shen to be a well written, sympathetic and multi-faceted hero/anti-hero. In addition, the ties the campaign and DLC episodes share with HK Crime and Kung Fu films (references, atmosphere, setting, style) alone are enough to draw me in to its highly detailed vision of modern Hong Kong and keep me playing in it time and time again.","May 17","true","15.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

The environments are nice and the combat is fun. However there is one thing that I cannot shake when I play this and it is very irritating. It feels like a poor man's GTA. Driving vehicles is no fun either, mostly because when using a mouse and keyboard, the camera is awkward. Reversing on a bike will spin the camera, but if you manually move the mouse to get a better look as you set off forward, it will still rotate the camera and as such go beyond the forward view - as if it has to complete the entire motion. Why they couldn't of made it so moving the camera view yourself resets the camera spin, I just don't know.\n\nThere are are a few other minor annoyances. Sometimes AI will walk into things, which isn't that bad really and many games are guilty of that (ahem Payday 2), but one of my biggest gripes when playing on foot is that there is no toggle for walk and run. Instead, if you want to walk you must rely on holding the free aim button (which is right click by default). However using free aim to walk is evidently not the proper way of doing it because whenever you get near an interactable object that you wish to talk past, your guy will just... sort of strafe past it while trying to get it in focus. Bit daft really that they couldn't simply add a walk toggle button.\n\nAnother annoyance? The weird buttons. The game plays brilliantly with mouse and keyboard, but I have no idea why some menus rely solely on pressing Left-CTRL and Right-CTRL and Backspace and Enter. Why couldn't a cursor be implemented? Seems a bit lazy if you ask me.\n\nOverall, of what I've played (among some other very minor bugs which I've decided not to mention here), the game is excellent and well worth the money if you haven't already got the base game. For those who have the original Sleeping Dogs, I wouldn't necessarily say the increase in graphical fidelity and draw distance was worth it... although that is ultimately your decision.\n\n","December 1, 2014","true","3.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Gorgeous 3rd person shooter! Includes a ton on DLC's, properly integrated into the main story - unlike the Standard Edition of Sleeping Dogs, which had some dlc's that for e.g. would give you an unfair advantage, right from the beginning of the game. Also, some DLC's are unlocked as you progress through the main story and there are two more DLCs, that can be accessed from the Main Menu, which are separated from the main game. This game is much more optimized (a very good port) than GTA IV & GTA EFLC (see the notes below). I was able to play maxed out this game with a MSI GeForce GTX 970 GAMING 4G (I OC'd it a little though :D). The only thing I haven't cranked on maximum was the AA (which I left it on High, NOT Extreme, 'cause it affected the FPS too damn much).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blindrun/recommended/307690/","blindrun","blindrun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blindrun/","365 products in account","Sleeping Dogs was originally released on August 13, 2012 for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. It was recently released on Xbox One and PS4 as well. It was developed by United Front Games and published by Square Enix. It received a 9 out of 10 on Steam, 4 out of 5 on Metacritic and an 8.5 out of 10 on IGN.\n\nWhile most people consider Sleeping Dogs a GTA knock off set in Hong Kong, I would argue that perception is false. While the initial concept is the same, an open world crime game, the basic mechanics of Sleeping Dogs sets it apart. These mechanics include cop/triad alliances, a focus on melee combat, and a Max Payne esque bullet time when sliding over objects during gun play.\n\nBecause of the great implementation of the aforementioned mechanics, the smaller size of the open world compared to similar releases such as GTA and Watch_Dogs, still provides a fantastic experience.\n\nThe story in follows an ex San Francisco cop that has been thrown back into the world of the Triads in modern day Hong Kong. While the story may seem cliche at first, if you give it some time you will find a rewarding plot line to follow.\n\nThe Definitive Edition includes six downloadable content packages for your consumption, and with the current holiday sale on Steam, is well worth the additional cost.","December 31, 2014","true","14.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game is a sandbox crime sim and is closer to Grand Theft Auto then to Saints Row in terms of gameplay, but is generally more enjoyable to play then the former. It does however lack any kind of multiplayer, which I am sure would be very offputting for some. While it places a much lower emphasis on shooting then most games in the genre, it flavors its gunfights with bullet time- but most of the time, Wei engages his foes with a brutal combination of strikes, counters and throws, coupled with some very painful-looking environmental finishers (table saws, spikes, furnaces, fan blades- the list goes on) You unlock additional melee techniques along the way and while the fights may eventually get stale and lack the tactical depth of say, the Batman: Arkham games, they remain a cut above the drunken flailing that passes for melee in GTA V. Unlike the purely aesthetic clothing options in GTA V, clothing in Sleeping Dogs can provide bonuses when worn as a set.  Driving is manageable, though most the cars do not handle very well and you will find yourself grinding a lot of hard surfaces at speed. However, you have the ability to jolt your car left, right or forwards to ram other cars, which is both useful and entertaining. Bullet time also kicks in when aiming a gun from a car, making engaging pursuers infinitely easier. As per standard for the genre, there are a multitude of collectables scattered about the map. While the lockboxes reward only some money and occasionally clothes and the security camera hacks offer no reward at all, the shrines confer a maximum health upgrade for every five shrines found and are absolutely vital, as finding them all doubles Wei's starting health. Luckily, you unlock the ability to see the shrines on your map early on, and like GTA V, the entire city is available to explore at the start, barring only a few story mission-only areas.  This "definitive" edition of the game includes almost all of the DLCs- fair enough, considering the vanilla edition is no longer available (Wow Squarenix, really?) These include a number of extra outfits, vehicles and missions that if used/done during the course of a playthrough will make the core content much easier, especially the police tactical gear that cuts all damage you take in half. There are a pair of mini-story addons, one dealing with a prototype, gatling-equipped supercar and the other a martial arts tournament ripped straight out of Enter the Dragon, which offers up some of the most difficult melee fights in the game. Money is also no object beyond the first few hours of the story, beginning with the fact that you can run over parking meters to get it! There are also a pair of full story addons: Nightmare on North Point is your standard horror-flavored DLC that has you fighting Jiang Shi vampires, Yaoguai demons and the ghosts of enemies fought in the main campaign. The second, Year of the Snake, sees Wei back on the force and combating a bomb-crazy doomsday cult on Chinese New Year's. While Nightmare has new enemies and Snake has some good gunfights, both DLCs are somewhat repetitive and are not up to the same quality as the core campaign. They are, however, short enough that they do not overstay their welcome. Though I played these addons after completing the story, you may wish to complete Year of the Snake earlier on as it adds a tear-gas grenade launcher to your main playthrough. Overall, I enjoyed Sleeping Dogs and found it more then worth its lowered price. If you enjoy sandbox crime games, Sleeping Dogs is certainly worth your time.","August 8, 2015","true","40.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I find the story line extremely enjoyable. Being an undercover cop gives you a chance to cause mayhem while not feeling like a total dirtbag. The interactions between the player & NPCs are fun, and the voice acting is good. The setting and story really make you pull for a lot of different sides and think about life and family. The atmosphere is excellent. Hong Kong feels very vibrant and alive. The fighting system is one of my favorites. There are few guns available in this game; instead, the game mostly relies on martial arts. There's a gym where you can practice your moves before you take on street thugs and rival triads.\n\nThe bad: The driving is kind of awful. I've tried it with a controller and liked it slightly better, but it still wasn't great. However, once you get used to it, it's playable, if a little frustrating. I thought the main campaign was rather short. It's an open world game with lots of side quests, but the way each of the main quests comes up sort of gives you an urgency that can push you through the game at a faster pace. I raced through a lot of the main quest and suddenly went, oh, that's the end?\n\nDefinitive Edition comments: Almost all of the DLCs from the original edition were bundled into the Definitive Edition. They removed the (what I considered to be) game-breaking DLCs that gave you tons of money and XP right at the beginning, so the game progresses in a much more natural fashion now. All the outfits previously added by the DLCs are available for purchase at the Night Market; Wheels of Fury missions are now spread out so that you don't gain a super OP car immediately. The textures, graphics, and higher population density of the Definitive Edition may cause performance issues on some systems. I have an Nvidia graphics card and had to play with my settings to get the game to run on that card rather than my integrated graphics.\n\nGeneral info: The open world provides ample opportunity for exploration and side quests. The story is great and the world is very atmospheric (Hong Kong makes a nice change from the generic cities a lot of games are set in). The art style is fairly good (better with the HD textures).\n\nOverall: I would definitely recommend this game! If you haven't played it yet, you need to!\n\nSystem Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7","August 9, 2015","true","72.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There's a few times where you can fail a mission randomly due to bad AI (ie: if you have an ally driving for you and they flip the car) or just some inexplicable auto-fails.  Nonetheless, the concept of the game is very appealing and is mostly well done.  It doesn't have the same polish as GTA in some ways but the martial arts combat system and parkour is way more advanced than what GTA has.  One terrible thing in this game is that you can't seem to hail a cab without car jacking half the time.  Nobody thought of using  another button for the car jacking?  Bugs and minor headaches aside, it's definitely a buy if you haven't played the original version and love games like GTA and Saints Row.","October 20, 2014","true","22.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

What makes it interesting is that it incorporates an Arkham-style martial arts fight system with the guns and cars.\n\nNote that this "definitive" edition comes with all of the DLC they ever produced, and a lot of it is way off tone from the base game. The costume/moveset addons let you conduct undercover police operations dressed as Wukong the monkey king, or cosplaying as Jensen from Deus Ex. There's a series of optional missions in which you build a ridiculous Bond car with an EMP generator and dual minigun turrets. The story DLCs are also pretty zany. There's an optional mission where you get sucked into a '70s kung fu grindhouse movie, and an expansion that's a horror comedy about an invasion of hopping vampires. So if you're big on immersion and just want to stick to the Infernal Affairs-style cop movie storyline you'll probably want to avoid doing any of the DLC.\n\nIf you're looking for an open world game without any of GTA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, this is definitely worth buying during a sale.","June 16, 2015","true","34.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

I played this game for the first time last year and promised myself that I would eventually buy all of the DLC and replay the game eventually.  When the Definitive edition came out, I knew I had to get it immediately.  The DE sprinkles the newly unlocked DLC throughout the story so you are not immediately over powered at the start with crazy guns/cars/money.  That was a very good thing and added much to the overall gameplay.  The graphic upgrade was a nice touch as well.  In all, if you are thinking about buying Sleeping Dogs the DE is definitely the one to get.\n\n2015 Edit: After playing GTA 5, I can safely say that I enjoyed my time with this game more than Grand Theft Auto.

Since I don't play GTA, this review will try to cover and talk about aspects that maybe GTA has too. Therefore, sorry if some of the points may look, from your point of view, like something to be expected from a 2014 game and shouldn't be seen as selling points.\n\nThe plot is truly interesting, and although is widely known that you take the role of an undercover cop, things are not as plain as it may seem. You're not an average undercover cop, you're a person suited to fill that role, with a particular psychological profile. You'll infiltrate in a main branch of the Triad, in Hong Kong, and things won't go as smooth as you'd like. That profile won't help and you'll get caught in something a bit more deep, a bit more scary, a bit more of your own.\nIt won't be about choosing sides, it will be more about merging in both, without leaving any trace, nor any part of you.\nIt will be more about swimming inside a stream, while trying not to follow its flow.\n\n\n\nGameplay-wise, I didn't feel disappointed at all. The environment is gorgeus, accurate, colourful yet gray. Turns, hills, alleys, signs.\nDriving is fun but steering is a must, and makes things more exciting. Shame there aren't many car models.\nYou can't steal a car and make it yours by driving it into your parking lot, but you'll own many cars, obtained by buying them or by doing main missions and / or side missions. Same applies for motorcycles.\nWhile cars can't be customized, noone says that you can't steal them and drive them through all Hong Kong, shooting at other cars' tires or directly at their front window. Aim well for a clean headshot, will you? Or if you feel like you need a new car, keep putting the pedal to the metal, jump from your seat to the roof of your new love interest or hit them until they'll stop driving.\nAnd there will be lot of pursuits. Relentless pursuits. Be it in North Point or in the highway, drive wherever you want, just get rid of the pursuers. This is one of the things I liked most from the game, as it's one of the few cases where you'll hold a firearm and you'll see cars exploding.\nBecause what has been seen by many as a flaw, my eyes and my racing heart tells me otherwise.\nFirearms are rare, very rare so that you won't feel overpowered and start a killing spree. You'll treasure them and hide them. You won't waste bullets and you'll scavenge a lot. And you'll enjoy the moment when you'll use your gun to set a car on fire, or while taking cover behind a counter, against a volley of bullets.\nGunfires will make you remind that you're made of flesh, so don't try to run against your enemies. Take cover and plan the right time to shoot.\nThis scarce source of guns makes hand-to-hand combat the way to clean the path ahead of you. Keep countering, break their arms, thair legs, their teeth. Use everything at your disposal: a fan, a swordfish, a boiler, a railing, or take them hostages and use their bodies as shields, or put them inside the boot; they may change their minds.\nThere's still more, but I don't think I should spoil everything.\n\nSecondary missions are interesting, they add layers to an already thick background, encouraging you to live this game more deeply, on both sides of the same coin.\nThey will encourage you to explore to the fullest the map, uncovering favors, races, secrets and so on.\n\nBuy it, because I didn't tell you everything, and because it deserves more sunlight than shades.","April 13","true","53.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

At the time of reviewing this, I have put in 90 or so minutes into the game so you could consider this a first impressions review.\n\nOverview\nSleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is a revamp of Sleeping Dogs with improved graphics. Wei Shen finds himself at ends when he gets in too deep with the gangs of Hong Kong as you work undercover for the police to infiltrate the Sun On Yee gang.\n\n\nRating/Topic\n\n+ Graphics\nLet's start at the graphics, which is a selling point for the definitive edition. The game looks amazing and the city of Hong Kong has a feeling of immersion like nothing I have played before. The graphics are great and they do live up to the marketing of the definitive edition. Overall, this department is solid.\n\n- Controls\nMy second topic is the controls for keyboard and mouse. I really am not a fan of them, but I don't like KB&M for most third person games either. I guess they are okay if you are good with a keyboard and mouse in third person games, but I found it to be a much better experience on the Xbox One controller. The game recognized the controller immediately and I was very satisfied without needing to change any of the default controls. The KB&M controls aren't as stellar as the graphics, but they are decent. I recommend a controller to get the best experience for this game.\n\n+ Storyline\nThe storyline is a modern masterpiece. I have played only 90 minutes, yet I can say that the story has excellent pacing and makes you think about your actions. I went in playing the game like GTA, but every car you steal and every rival thug you beat up alters your opinion and immerses you into the game like nothing I have experienced. I can't emphasize how enjoyable it is to play this game. After a session of gaming, I sit back as if I am Wei Sheng and contemplate my actions like the game is real life. Overall, the story is amazing and is a huge selling point of this game.\n\n+ Combat\nThe combat is simple enough for me as someone who does not play fighting games, I found the combat sequences to be at a good middle ground for difficulty. The camera shakes as you slam someone against the wall and you can feel each hit you put on your opponent. The AI is great and thugs will be less likely to attack you when you push one of their face's into a fan or smash someone against a telephone booth. This game is great at immersing you into every aspect of the game. In all, the combat is just as solid as the graphics and storyline.\n\nOther Notes\n+ The soundtrack fits the theme very well\n\n+ Traffic and NPC's are very realistic, a must for a game set in one of the biggest cities in the world\n\n- Driving feels a bit clunky\n\n+/- Little to no gun combat, which could be a plus or minus depending on how you feel\n\n+ Definitive Edition includes all DLC's\n\n+/- Okay optimization, got a stable 60 FPS on high @ 1920x1080 on an OEM GTX 760, which gets 4-5 frames per second lower than a normal 760. Quick pro tip here, running this game on the Extreme preset enabled will turn on high SSAA & FXAA, which will eat up your FPS without providing much visual difference. Best to use a custom preset and switch to high FXAA and medium SSAA.\n\n\n\nSummary\nSleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition lives up to it's claim of improved graphics and delivers a very enjoyable gaming experience, but the keyboard and mouse experience is not the best. I recommend a controller, and be weary that the Extreme graphic preset enables high super sampling anti-aliasing which will eat up FPS, I recommend using a custom setup and use medium SSAA and high FXAA if you have a mid-tier graphics card such as the 270X or 760.\n\nI would happily recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed games such as GTA, Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs or any of the Batman games. It isn't the most recent title, but the definitive edition includes all the DLC's and the updated graphics are on par with 2014 releases. My overall rating for this game is a very sold 9/10.","December 27, 2014","true","5.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

So much so that I figured it would be a crime if I did not buy the new Definitive Edition. After play for an hour, I have to say that I am impressed by the Definitive Edition. Right off the bat, the menu is ultra-sharp, even in 1920x1080p. Even the menu sounds and menu music quality have been improved! The introduction is better than ever; I had an absolute BLAST with the new destruction mechanics in the beginning chase and fights. I threw an enemy at a cabinet and the drawers of the cabinet actually came out and papers flew out. Then, I slammed a metal gate in the market on top of an enemy and it actually bent in the middle. This kind of stuff never happened before... I love it! The electronic street signs have been improved (all the textures too) to make Hong Kong look better than ever. The rain effects look phenomenal, and I have realized that the map, loading dragon, in-game floating HUD icons, etc. are almost 4k sharp. I am sure many other elements of the game have been improved as well, but I have not played much so far.\nIf you already have Sleeping Dogs and love it to death (and have extra money), get it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/307690/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","It seems like every other game these days is an open-world affair, and if you’re looking to explore an urban environment – cars, guns, and crime included – you might first think of such titles as Grand Theft Auto V or Watch Dogs. For the more adventurous, however, comes the rerelease of a 2012 hit; Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition sees the game with a whole host of tweaks and updates, plus the inclusion of DLC content. It’s a worthy contender in a strong genre, but unfortunately remains a long way from being graphically spectacular or particularly innovative.\n\nSleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition will see you stepping into the shoes of Wei Shen, a police officer going undercover in the Sun On Yee triad. The story is an engrossing affair, a tale of loyalty, betrayal and duty set against the vibrant background of Hong Kong. Shen’s emotional turmoil is the real driving force behind the game, as he is promoted within the triad from foot soldier to “Red Pole”, or lieutenant, and struggles to walk the narrow line between crime and the law, committing terrible acts in order to maintain his cover, and all in the name of the greater good. It’s a story full of emotional highs and lows, with twists and turns aplenty to keep you interested. Perhaps the biggest character in the piece is not Shen, however, but Hong Kong itself. The city is visually fascinating, a warren of shady alleyways and broad highways, of clubs and skyscrapers and cluttered neon signs all battling for your attention. It’s a welcome change from the usual American cities where open-world games are set, and by game’s end you’ll be sad to be leaving it behind.\n\nThere are plenty of vehicles you can use to traverse Hong Kong, including cars, motorbikes, vans and boats; you can even catch a taxi if you’re feeling particularly lazy. The missions are varied and largely good fun, and put Shen’s various abilities to good use. There’s a good amount of free-running and martial arts to be done, along with car chases, street racing and a fair bit of gunplay. Some missions are slower paced and show a playful side to the game; taking girls on dates, for example, can involve such silliness as taking photos at the park, singing karaoke, or even just driving a fast car really, really fast. A nice touch is how the gameplay mirrors the story. As the stakes become bigger, so too do the missions. The first few hours are largely given over to hand-to-hand combat and simple challenges, and it’s several hours in before Shen even picks up a gun. The bigger set pieces – gun battles in the streets, car chases which see Shen leaping from vehicle to vehicle – are saved for the important moments. This means the game never stays static, always building and growing and offering something new with each hour that goes by.\n\nThe gameplay itself is remarkably intuitive. Inevitable comparisons to the Batman: Arkham games must be made when it comes to the combat, which is simple but has a great deal of depth. There’s a button for attacking, a button for grappling, and a button for countering enemy strikes; using the three in combination showcases Shen’s martial arts skills with some serious aplomb. You can also perform environmental attacks, such as slamming people into phone booths or impaling them (yes, this one’s true) on a pile of swordfish heads. It’s a system which works well but never becomes so convoluted that you’ll press the wrong button at a crucial moment. The rest of the gameplay follows suit. Free-running involves simply holding the run button down and then tapping it when you come to an obstacle. Using guns is much the same as any third-person shooter, with a simple cover system and an array of weapons including machine guns and grenade launchers. Driving vehicles is well balanced; each one has a distinct feel, but they are largely easy to control and you won’t find yourself careering off course for no apparent reason.\n\nYou can also develop Shen’s abilities over time. You earn two types of experience for each mission based on your performance; one is “Cop” experience and the other is “Triad”. These can be put towards unlocking new skills in their respective trees, and you can also add new moves to Shen’s repertoire at a martial arts school if you find the requisite items. There is also something called “Face” experience, which is gained by helping people around the city and lets you obtain new clothes and cars. Some of the missions to improve this can seem trivial – delivering someone’s lunch, for example, seems a strange task for a triad lieutenant – but do help to add yet more variety to the game.\n\nLargely speaking, Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is an excellent effort. It weaves a fascinating narrative and it’s fun to play, with a good amount of content to sink your teeth into. The main story takes a good fifteen to twenty hours to complete, and there are side missions galore on top of it. What problems there are tend to be exceedingly minor. Some of the character animations are stiff and unrealistic, but with a voice cast including talents such as Tom Wilkinson, Emma Stone and Lucy Liu, you won’t much notice. Occasionally a car will appear from nowhere, necessitating evasive action (or else a spectacular high-speed crash) but this only happened once or twice while I was playing.\n\nThe biggest problem with Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is that it simply doesn’t feel like a game for the new generation of consoles. Despite all its many tweaks and improvements over the original, it doesn’t feel like they’ve made a great deal of difference. When The Last of Us was ported to PlayStation 4 it looked like it belonged there, but Sleeping Dogs doesn’t achieve the same feat. Graphically, it looks like a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 game. The gameplay may be better balanced but unless you’ve played the original this simply won’t make an impact on you. Furthermore, for those who did play the original there doesn’t seem much point in upgrading. The major DLCs which come packaged with the Definitive Edition aren’t particularly long and aren’t as engrossing as the main game. The best is probably Nightmare at North Point, which breaks canon to pit Shen against ghostly gangster Smiley Cat and his army of the undead. Hong Kong takes on a dark, supernatural feel and the plot displays a wicked sense of humour, but there isn’t a great deal of variety to it and it only takes a couple of hours to complete. The other major DLC, Year of the Snake, is similar in length but extremely short on story; it offers only a threadbare reason to carry out a few new missions and extend your time in Hong Kong. Much of the other DLC is additional content – extra outfits, weapons and vehicles – which you won’t even notice in the main game.\n\nIf you missed it the first time around, Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is well worth picking up. It plays beautifully, has a great story, and will introduce you to a world you never knew you wanted to explore. There’s also no doubting that it’s better than the original release. It has been improved in many ways; the graphics, presentation and gameplay have been tweaked and there is some additional content, even if not a great deal. It’s a superb game, but not one worth upgrading your hardware for.\n\n\nHighly Recommended\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","March 19, 2015","true","7.7"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","20","35","0","0"

It really is WEI better than I thought it would be, me thinking delusionally that it would just be another GTA ripoff, but it's not at all.  It's really special in it's own WEI.  In my opinion, I found it to be WEI more fun than GTA 4 and overall have a better main story as well.  The open world is cool, especially since it's in Hong Kong and the WEI's to get to places can be different every time.  The combat system overall is WEI better than GTA (They really are WEI different games, but they do have to be compared to each other due to their similarities) in terms of hand to hand, which was a cool mix of comboed fighter game style and the more modern Arkham series.  As the story goes, it does something that I find to be WEI cooler than expected, which is taking older "cliches" I guess you could call them (or things that have been done before) and really revolutionizing them, making a compelling and fun story.\n\nThis review is really WEI all over the place, but in conclusion, it really was WEI better than I thought it would be, and definitely a solid buy.  I'd probably give it an 8.5/10, which for some reason is WEI higher than a lot of people gave it.  It's WEI underappreciated and definitely underhyped.","July 4, 2015","true","9.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","11","18","8","0"

But I bought it anyway just to see what the differences were (which seem to be that you get all the DLC integrated and there's some cosmetic improvements).\n\nNevertheless, I ended up playing through the whole thing again. It really is one of the best open world games released in the last while, so if you DON'T have it and you like this sort of thing, umm, why don't you have it yet?\n\nTo recap, the characterisation is superb, the gameplay is very good - the melee combat is particularly satisfying, as you would want a game with an particular emphasis on the martial arts to be. No doubt there is the usual disjoint between the plot and the open-world stuff in that you play an undercover cop who does a very convincing job of not giving two hoots about the law. The tone varies accordingly so it gets quite dark, with the odd lighter moment, but is never goofy.\n\nAlso, swordfish.","October 18, 2014","true","22.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Sleeping Dogs is the epitome of take two steps forward and three steps backwards, hopefully SE will decide on making a sequel and address many of the issues that keep Sleeping Dogs from being a masterpiece.\n\n+Great Graphics\n+Great setting and story\n+Good fighting mechanics\n+Plenty of action sequences\n+Lots of side missions\n+Good voice actors\n\n-Poor racing missions, especially bike races\n-Questionable vehicle handling\n-Many bugs and occasional crashes\n-Poor gunplay\n-Frustrating missions\n-Useless weapons especially guns\n\nThere are many questionable design flaws in Sleeping Dogs which really don't help the game, such as several highly useless abilities like access police weapons from the trunks of police cars, alls this does is immediately start a police chase, not that the guns will help you since they'll disappear if you interact with the world - yes, you heard that currently since SE constantly defend the fact that this is a melee based game, they state that guns are a 'power-up' but that doesn't explain why if I use a health shrine or open a box, or do anything other than shoot the gun will mysteriously disappear - this renders all the DLC that have bonus weapons completely useless.\n\nHong Kong looks great - plenty of eye candy all around but even so, SE fails to go beyond that - the character customization is limited, clothing is limited with few giving XP or special boosts.   Car customization is non-existant which is a shame and doesn't really make that much sense since a large portion of content revolves around illegal street racing, which brings up another major issue - the racing is exceptionally poor, the car races are 100% based on picking the correct car for the race, its as simple as that - whilst the bike racing is mind blowing bad, your rival racers seem to ride ungodly powerful bikes that go significantly faster, have insanely perfect handling around tight spaces and have godly acceleration, the only chances the player has to win the bike races is to have the best bikes and to drive the race with perfection, no crashes, no drift errors - as your rivals will slow down at certain parts allowing you to get in front, and then catch just as quickly.\n\nIn closing,  whilst I'm giving this a recommedation, this game does have its issues so I would rather give it a mixed review rather than a purely postive one.   I would say this game is worth a purchase if on sale or cheap but be aware of potential issues.","February 10, 2015","true","33.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

The original Sleeping Dogs is a great game, well worth playing, I enjoyed the gameplay, the story and the soundtrack immensely. If you already own Sleeping Dogs, the Definitive Edition is probably only worth getting if you don't already own all the DLCs. I also encountered several problems with this game, at least one of which was present in the original game.\n\nKeyboard/mouse controls are plagued by the same old beeping issue. Spamming buttons during combat or otherwise can cause several seconds of input lag and an annoying beeping sound. I have never encountered this in any other game. This makes the game unplayable with mouse/keyboard. I played through the Definitive Edition with a controller, which worked flawlessly.\nPlaying with a controller did not deactivate the screensaver, This resulted in the screen going black every 15 or so minutes, requiring mouse/keyboard input to wake it up.\nI maxed Police XP about 60-70% in the game, because nearly every event gives Police XP. I never managed to max out Triad XP, even after completing the game and completing every event. This meant that I couldn't unlock and use the last Triad melee ability during or after the game.","December 9, 2014","true","51.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What usually happens is that I spend the first hour trying to adapt to the funky console-ported controls and views, then get sidetracked on several repetitive missions, before finally getting stuck on an crucial plot-related mission and quitting in frustration.\n\nBut this game is just GOOD!  First, the Sleeping Dogs world is immersive and believable.  You are constantly reminded that the story takes place in Hong Kong, beginning with the left-hand driving, to the street signs, language immersion (Cantonese), and the cultural cues (like Asian Pop).   The music is great and the action is fun.  Unlike the US, guns are illegal in Hong Kong and gun-violence is rare.  Most, but not all, of the action involves martial arts (generally button combos) and vehicle chases.\n\nGive this game a try!","January 1, 2015","true","21.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is the same game with slightly updated graphics and all of the DLC included.  Is it worth it?  That depends on you.\n\nThe graphics are indeed improved from the original, but really, it isn't much of a difference.  Sleeping Dogs on max settings was already a very good looking game.  Definitive Edition improves the graphics slightly, but certainly not enough to justify a re-purchase, or even a significantly higher price than you might spend on the original game.  If Definitive Edition goes to the same price as Sleeping Dogs + the three story DLCs, then I would probably recommend this version.\n\nHowever, this version isn't just improvements.  The control scheme on Mouse/Keyboard was changed somewhat from the original game, and I would argue that it is for the worse.  Many of the button placements are more difficult to press than the keys in the original.  Some of these can be rebound easily, so this might not be that big of a deal.  Another thing to note is that the problems with the keyboard controls from the original game are still there.  There are still many things that are controlled using the arrow keys, the enter key, and backspace.\n\nThe gamepad controls are unchanged as far as I can tell, so if you have a gamepad, such as an XBOX 360 controller, I would recommend using that.  If you don't have a gamepad, then I'm not sure that I would recommend Definitive Edition due to the akward control scheme.","October 11, 2014","true","26.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First, the graphics are, indeed, much improved in terms of the overall atmosphere.  You can drop them down to the same level they were at in the original version, or pump them up to the max, and see a much prettier, more colorful city (obviously, at the cost of some framerate loss, depending on your machine).  I have a 2010 era machine, so it strains a bit with the newer graphics, but it's still manageable.  If you have a more modern rig, you should run it fine.\n\nGameplay-wise, the interface itself is identical.  Combat is the same, driving is the same.  The storyline plays out the same.  The major difference in gameplay is in the availability of side missions and other bonuses.  In the original game, if you bought all the DLC, there were certain side missions that you could farm endlessly to rank up and unlock abilities.  Likewise, there were "red envelopes" left around town at various parking garages, right out front.  You'd just run up, grab it, and suddenly have an extra $50K-100K to spend.  Both aspects have been changed.  The red envelopes still exist, but they're hidden away in places that can be a challenge to reach.  You have to do some puzzle solving to get to some of them, and they're far, far less obvious.  Of course, you can still make money through things like truck hijacking (once you unlock it), but that raises the second big change.\n\nMost of the side missions now unlock at different points in the game, after certain story events have happened.  This means that the actual progression through the game is a bit more challenging, and a bit more reasonably paced.   If memory serves, the original game allowed you to play the Martial Arts competitions only after you moved to the new neighborhood.  Now that's applied to basically all of the side missions.  So, the old Triad Highway mission isn't a repeatable thing that you can farm for Triad points.  It's a side mission that shows up occasionally at different points in the story.  In my opinion, that's neither better nor worse than before.  It's just different.  The game is still fun to play without being over-leveled.  On the other hand, you may prefer the freedom to upgrade with ease and buy whatever you want whenever (once you collect your red envelopes).  If that's the case, then you may prefer the original game and not care as much about the enhanced graphics.","July 29, 2015","true","43.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's basically GTA and Batman squooshed together, with a sprinkling of Assassin's Creed thrown in for good measure. One of the best games I've ever played and the first I've 100%'ed on the pc since switching from console peasant.\n\n\n\n05.08.15. I'm sorry, I have to add to this. I was in a bit of a rush when I wrote the original review and didn't do this title justice at all. So, in order to try to redress the balance:\n\nI had this game for absolutely ages on the xbox360 and never got around to playing it, it came up for sale on steam and I thought 'Why not?'. I started playing this after finishing the game I was into at the time and O. M. G. - the first mission was kind of yeah, yeah, been here, seen it, done it on countless other games, with the only difference being the setting, but then - wham! the game just sort of opened up (as they do, I hear you say) but it sort of blew my mind.\n\nIn essence, as I said at the start, it's pretty much GTA:Hong Kong in style, what with all the different things you can do outside of story missions, with parkour thrown in for free. BUT and it is a big but! - Sleeping Dogs is more like Red Dead Redemption in the way that it takes a well known tried and tested formula and puts it in a setting that makes it seem VERY different and the impact that this has on you, the player. Little touches in the game, (random overheard conversations, or people's doorsteps for example) made it seem so much like the real Hong Kong (although slightly squashed and far less crowded) that anyone could go to HK and not feel completey alienated. (The only things that's missing is the smell!). This game really made me feel like I was living the lifestyle of a chinese gangster (not so much the undercover cop, but I did have pangs of guilt whenever pedestrians got hurt and felt obliged to rescue handbags when the occasion presented itself!).\n\nPros: beautifully recreated in superb graphics (very pretty game), grittyand slightly more realistic feelings for the character than most games of this ilk, cool parkour activity, captures the essence of a chinese/british culture almost perfectly, good variety of missions which meant you hardly ever had to do the same thing twice in a row, excellent balance of fighting and gunplay.\n\nCons: Occasionally getting 'stuck' on something - usually around knee height - that you can't climb/jump over. Not anywhere near as crowded as the real place and one or two things misplaced or missing completely - such as Happy Valley and Kowloon (but I understand that certain things had to be sacrificed and United Front/Square Enix Eu did an excellent job in regards to this).\n\nAs you can see, I'm kind of nit-picking on the cons. I just struggled to think of any negatives, such was the enjoyment I had with this game. This is the ONLY game where I fully enjoyed just rolling around and doing whatever took my fancy at the time. Yes, I did this in several gta's, but not to the extent I did it to in Sleeping Dogs and with nowhere near as much fun.\n\nI stand by my original statement - one of the best games I have ever played. On any platform. I think I'll give it a while and then play the (normal) version on my hexbox.","July 29, 2015","true","124.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am looking at a loss of up to 30 fps doing these, even when it's just like walking through a park or something simple. The game has crashed twice during missions when the objectives change. As of right now, the mission where you take the city van to the racing guy and bug his vehice will permanently lock my game. I have not been able to find a fix. Could you please patch this?\n\nEdit:\nI have decided to lock the framerate to 30. I know it has to be my graphics card causing some of the fps dropping. I was able to circumvent the repeating lockup on that mission by entering the city van from the driver side door instead of the passenger side. I still experience random crashes but not enough to upset me.

Especially when you are not used to have cars go on the left but on the right in real life. How many times have I crossed the road to be plowed from behind? A mystery because I lost count after 100+.\n\nI understand there are so many insurance frauds in the real world, but driving on the road and the car in front slams the brakes a great majority of the time for no reason gets frustrating.\n\nThe driving game camera could be better controlled especially when you need to reverse fast and move forward. The camera view becomes a real pain when it whips around when you get stuck with the car.\n\nShould have a setting to select the radio station you wished to be default for your game or another option is to be able to add your own music folder as a radio station like GTA would be awesome.\n\nA fast way to make a lot of money in the game, is to use "Tran" car mini-quests from the cellphone. Can make a great deal of money in a short time, of course depended on the cars you obtain until completed all the requests.\n\nA few other odd little annoyances like in all other games and that is it, it’s just a game but great game.\nA trick for achieving the Social Hub “Gambler”:\nIf you go into “Statistics”, then “Completion”, it will show you the “Overall net gambling performance”. The stat tracker in the Social Hub will only take into account the highest of your overall performance has ever been and not what it is currently. The one in Social Hub will never go lower if you go on a losing streak, so you have to look into the “Statistics”, then “Completion”, will show you the “Overall net gambling performance” to find out.\n\nThis is why it isn't increasing in the Social Hub section. In “Statistics”, I was at -$24 500 for my Overall net performance, even though in Social Hub was stating that I had maximum of $215 000.\n\nFollow the tips found online on so many sites in regards of achieving this by saving the game on wins and reload when you lose. Took about 30 minutes to accomplish this by reloading when was at North Point, walk until can grab a taxi to the vehicle store at the dock in Kennedy; steal the car behind when out of the taxi to drive the remaining section to the Kennedy ^Rooster fight. Still a great game to play and challenging to try to obtain all the achievements!\n\nP.S. the *Rooster was supposed to be written KCOC <- written backwards, but it gets censored!","March 24","true","98.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But the control is not as good as the original Sleeping Dogs I played 1 year ago.\nFirst is the control, its  not as responsive as before, plus the camera is a bit frustrating, its hard to adjust the camera when I am driving. And button mapping is different than the original Sleepiong Dogs, I like the original button mapping, E for hijack/talk/interact, right click for counter, and space for running/ramming vehicle/climbing. In this definitive edition, counter/hijack/ interact is the same buttong. Running and climbing using left shift, took a while to adjust the control. Not serious problem, but it could be better. I like the fighting mechanism in this game, tho the unresponsive control sometimes makes me go into rage, I can still manage my mental state good enough\n\nThe game's content is great, worth the price, but why does it have to be vampires? And Wei only has his fist to fight the vampires and sword (sometimes) only to kill demon, this is Wei too much man. 5 vampires jumped at me, I counter, the result of unresponsive control, got bitten a lot, and when u are faced with 5 vampires and the jiang shi, a little bit chaos.\n\nLast is the clothing, why does 1 outfit has to be worn as 1, I can wear them separately. Dont like it. And the super fast police car is tied to the side mission only. Cmon, it would be fun to be able to ride this epic fast car in a free roam and mess with the police when I'm in it. And when it comes to driving in a race with super fast car, get ready to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Remember the camera? Yeah, the camera is the main enemy here. I am going to buy a controller for this game, I hope it would improve my in game experience.\n\nConclusion, recommended, but only if you didnt buy the original one.\n","July 3, 2015","true","51.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Had to gimp SEVERAL settings using an I5-4690k and GTX 970 just to get a more steady 60fps and I still had some frame drops in certain areas. You can turn down "Enable Quality Anti-Aliasing" down from Extreme to High and it will shoot up like 100fps but it makes the game look pretty awful in my opinion. So I just toned down all the shadow settings to normal and such.\n- Most of the DLC is either pointless or just bad.\n- Cop missions are REALLY boring. Luckily after a couple of them they're optional.\n\nOverall this game was worth every penny. Grabbed it on sale for 7.50, went into it blindly, and it exceeded my expectations by a long shot.

Take the mechanics that made the GTA games fun and combine it with an edgy and interesting storyline set in modern day Hong Kong.\n\nWei Shen is a Chinese-American returning home after many years with a chip on his shoulder regarding the corrupt and powerful triad that messed with his family long ago. The Sun On Yee, the game begins as Wei, now an officer of the law infiltrates the Sun On Yee through an old friend Jackie and the story just continues to build from there.\n\nYou are given the ability to roam free in the large city of Hong Kong with side quests litered everywhere. From progresing the Police quest line, to the (main) Triad story there are quests to increase your face (reputation), unlock new cars through street races, street brawls, and many variets there of.\n\nTo add additional flavour you can unlock additional skills and attributes depending on how many side quests you have done which can turn you into a martial arts, asskicking, gun welding unstopable machine.\n\nHighly recommend, I played it in small-chunks after work and it kept me thoroughly entertained.","October 31, 2014","true","30.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've only spent a small amount of time with it, but I've completed the story. It's the only game that makes me compare other games to it and feel disatisifed with the other games.\n\nSTORY\n\nThe game's story puts you as Wei, a cop. I found the story quite fun, as it makes you laugh and cheer on some of the characters at certain points (looking at you, grandma!) and some people might not like it due to it's cliche nature. However, don't go thinking about the story too critically; you will be slightly dissapointed. The story makes you feel for the characters, and wanting to go against the characters in the story; which, I believe, is the purpose. It isn't the best story ever, but I love it due to it's nature. Highly subjective!\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nAh, the most important part to lots of people. The gameplay is incredibly fun! Lots of high action, slow mo moves to make you really feel like Wei, and not some generic character. The system reminds me of the Arkham series, but I prefer this system by miles. The gunplay is alright, not great, but I love how the pistols feel. I think this matters because it is reminiscent of gang violence, which is what the game is based around. The general style of the combat made me play Sleeping Dog's MMO, which is called Triad Wars, but don't try it. Seriously. Waste. Of. Time.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe graphics are fine, not too good, not too bad. The only annoyance is the low view distance, which is covered by a Depth-of-Field like fog. I wish you could turn it off. Other than that, the graphics are fine and make you feel immersed.\nNice viarety of graphics options, lacking an FoV slider but that isn't too necessary.\n\nREPLAYABILITY\n\nNow, this is where my hours come into account. Notice the low amount; I believe that it has little to no replayability, and that is why I wanted the MMO to succeed. Sure, if you like collecting things, you'll have a great time completing this one, but if you're like me, and just 'play' games, you won't particularly like this one.\n\nOVERALL\n\nGreat game, nice graphics, amazing combat, fantastic story, but no replayability.\n\nBUT, I won't let this one itch stop me. I love this game, and it's easily one of the best games I've ever played. It's a 10/10.\n\nHave fun!","September 25, 2015","true","15.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

But, what i saw here, like seeing totally new game, is much better than GTA IV. Can't compare to GTA V cause I haven't got (and don't like) console and haven't played it yet.\nI always thought that GTA is unique and I love this whole series from the time when it was 2d, you know. And now.. Sleeping Dogs.. Wow..\nIts really well done - fighting system is fascinating! I really like how its is animated, how it is feels and the difficulty is perfect tuned for me. Every fight you can win without spending 999 tries like in Dark Souls, but if you relax a bit and go casual style - you lose - its just perfect!\nSecond - I like the car physics - its way better than in GTA IV. Also a small detail - traffic goes left handed in HongKong - it is a trifle, but I don't know why it fascinates me. Feels so fresh :)\nAlso I really like China spirit and have not much respect for American one. Yes - they all gangsters in both games, but Americans feels so empty and dumb, and Chinesse.. they have history much bigger than ours and it matters.\nWhat more to say..

There are way more and varied people around in the game world and I love how they have integrated the DLC into the main game. You no longer just get a bunch of free stuff in your wardrobe and garage, you either have to buy the stuff from a special vendor or earn some of them from missions in the game. Even the Red Envelopes are now hidden packages instead of just right next to the garages like before. To me it really balances out the game much better then before. The only DLC it doesn't seem to include is the Top Dog Gold and Silver packs that let you level up, it would have been nice to have the option to use them in this version but overall I am kind of glad they are not there as that did make the old version very easy and less fun to me.\n\nThe improvements are very good in this version and don't believe the people saying this game looks worse then the HD pack from the old version because that is total BS. Whatever their reason or agenda is I'm not sure, but look for yourself at real images from an impartial sight and not some jokers personal images that could be from the lowest settings or even the original game.\n\nhttp://tech4gamers.com/sleeping-dogs-sd-vs-sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-graphics-comparison-and-benchmarks/","October 10, 2014","true","42.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There isn't much that can get in this games way... until they added weapons, of course thugs will use them but what sucks is u can dodge/counter effectively. I don't mean that the weapons do a lot of damage or anything, but the dodging mechanic itself is bugged for the weapons, if a thug has a weapon he's going to smack your face even if u hit dodge waaaaay faster than the game can read it apparently, and then adding a weapons only minigame... self torture can be your thing creators not mine, avoid all minigames that even close to suggest a blade. 3/5","January 2, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's because the game was first called True Crime: Hongkong, which gives much more of a hint on what the game actually is all about.  For several reasons, Activision abandoned the development of True Crime: Hongkong in 2011, when the game was almost completely finished. Square Enix acquired the publishing rights to the game, but not the True Crime intellectual property, so they had to rename it: Sleeping Dogs was born and released in 2012 for PC and the potatoes. In 2014 the PC and next gen consoles version got a graphical overhaul which was released as the Definitive Edition.\nStory/setting: The game is a GTA-like open-world adventure set in Hong Kong where as an undercover cop you try to work up in the ranks of a Hong Kong street gang to infiltrate the powerful Triads, the Chinese mafia. I guess it’s a somewhat typical story of trust, job ethics and betrayal mixed with a good portion of Hollywood action of magically surviving even the worst of tortures and the like. It’s surprisingly brutal and serious though, which I like a lot. What makes it a very good story however is the perfect blend with traditional Chinese culture and values (importance of family, personal faith). Beside the persisting violence there are these moments of calm and meditation that make you think and appreciate the effort the devs put into making some witty and authentic dialogue. The voice-acting and dialogue in general are exceptional, there is really nothing to complain there. The characters are fleshed-out enough for you to remember them and their voices for quite a while…  and get emotionally involved when they get horribly murdered in great numbers .\nGraphics/sound design: The buffed looks of the Definitive Edition are definitely an eye-catcher; especially the cut-scenes look really impressive with good character models and animation even in close-up shots. Animations are smooth in general, which is important due to the prevalence of combo-based melee combat and the cover-shooter mechanics. Texture quality is good I guess, nothing exceptional here, but it’s an open-world game so I wouldn’t expect them to put HD textures on everything. The weather effects are kinda nice; driving around in grey, rainy Hong Kong is pretty dank I gotta say. Sound effects are nothing special, the fact that you have a pretty large array of radio tunes on a number of different channels when driving is a neat idea though, there’s some great songs there that would instantly remind me of the streets of Hong Kong every time I hear them again.\nMechanics: There’s a lot of different stuff to do in Sleeping Dogs, really a lot, there’s just not a huge amount of depth to it. The plethora of fighting techniques and minigames was just wide and deep enough to not have me bored by the time I had finished the game though. So I guess it’s not a negative point, but also not a huge plus. You can hack cameras, pick locks, take photos of your one-night-stands, beat up bad guys with a myriad of combos, shoot at the tires of your chasers while driving, hijack cars at full speed on the highway (this is very cool believe me), win street races, play with your smartphone, trace phone call signals, crack open locked boxes, buy smart-looking clothes (you can even buy a fedora, I had a very euphoric moment there), speed around the sea in muthafugging boats, BOAT RACES, sing karaoke (and purposefully mess up to complete a sidequest), perform environmental kills (who doesn’t want to put their opponent’s head in a running circular saw?), get chased by the police, and probably a lot more I can’t remember at this point; so yeah, pretty damn diverse. The combat may seem very difficult at the beginning (it did to me because I am a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and never play combo-based fighting games), but it gets incredibly easy once you get the hang of it. Character customization is alright, there’s two “progression trees” you can develop: Cops and Triads, that award you with points depending on how well you did in every mission (you get less cops points if you kill innocent civilians for example), the fighting combos are gained by returning statues to your melee trainer found throughout the main game.\n\nPerformance: Ferry goot in all regards. I think I had the occasional crash but it wasn’t too bothersome, Steam overlay also didn’t work first for some reason. Other than that mostly 60fps on max settings on a 7950/7970 CFX and a 4770k, nothing to complain there.\n\nShould you play this game? Yes, the story is thrilling and thought-out enough for you to make it a worthwhile experience. The Chinese setting is a big plus for everyone into a completely different cultural context. Sleeping Dog’s Hong Kong has a unique feel and character to it, that’s for sure. There’s plenty enough variety in mechanics for you not to get bored in these ~25 hours of gameplay the game has to offer. It’s also pretty to look at. It’s a well-executed triple-A title overall, buy it discounted like I did and you won’t regret your purchase.\n","April 5, 2015","true","26.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's guns too, but in (Sleeping Dogs') Hong Kong you won't come across any unless you mess with really bad people (or cops).\nThis feels very realistic and good, melee combat gives you a heavy sense of impact and by unlocking certain skills and using certain moves you can make every melee encounter feel just as cool as the first.\n(E.g grabbing, rushing, countering, throwing, using environment etc according to who you're facing).\nWith that being said, having a gun gives you a feeling of power.\nYou really do feel like you should be careful with it because if you start slinging it around the local PD will do everything to hand your ♥♥♥ to you personally. It feels as if you'd have a gun on you in a real streetfight, for a backup measure if ♥♥♥♥ really hits the fan.\n\nThe graphics are great (even to this date stuff looks really nice), framerate is smooth and the environment looks really cool with alleys and stuff to rush through or fight in. (I normally don't like asian settings in games for some reason).\n\nThe driving works really well, there's a lot of grip if you pick the right speed and if you do it right, you can rush through a densely populated Hong Kong at will. You can drift (not for long distances though, mainly for cornering), ram (seems unrealistic but it's fun) and even jump from your vehicle to another. Heck, just sitting on a bike and holding your handbrake while pinning the throttle to do a quick U turn whilst standing still feels and looks amazing thanks to the cool camera angle.\nThe camera angles are generally good throughout the game (good meaning they're not annoying or bad in any way), but you'll occasionally have them act up in tight spaces, although this isn't common.\n\nOverall the game is amazing, a really underrated gem.","April 23, 2015","true","25.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

All of the environments in Definitive Edition look beautiful especially when running on higher settings. The gun combat isn't bad but it's not really anything special, where Sleeping Dogs really shines is with the hand to hand combat. The fighting mechanics feel great and throughout the game you learn new fighting techniques to add to your arsenal. There are also several different environment takedowns you can preform that are brutal as they are awesome. Sleeping Dogs also allows you to free run and preform stunts all over Hong Kong. Where Sleeping Dogs took me by surprise the most is its story. In Sleeping Dogs you play as Wei Shen, a undercover cop tasked to infiltrate the Triads. The story is well written and all of the characters are intriguing. The story takes lots of twists and turns, is mostly action packed, and makes it harder for Wei to decide if he is more of a cop or more of a Triad as it progresses. Wei Shen is a fantastic protagonist, he is just a truely bad ♥♥♥ character, one of my favorite video game protagonists of all time for sure. While I'm at it I might as well say that all of the other main characters are great and well voiced too. There is always something to do in Sleeping Dogs; you can go do a mission for the Triads, do a police mission, help a stranger in need, participate in a race, participate in a fighting tournament, bet on a ♥♥♥♥ fight, go on a date, take out rival gangs, learn new fighting moves from the dojo, explore the world to find lock boxes, plus lots more and everything else you could expect from a open world sandbox action game. So in closing, Sleeping Dogs is a amazing game filled with action, narrative, and variety that I highly recommend to anyone who is even just a little interested in the game, it should pleasantly surprise you as it did to me. Sleeping Dogs is a hidden gem among open world games and one of the best open world games I have ever played.","January 9, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can play virtual tourist as you kick, punch, and race your way through China.\n\nIt differs from GTA in that it takes awhile to earn firearms. The martial arts system in place is superb and allows for more challenging unarmed combat.\n\nThe plot is decent as well. Definitely worthy of a playthrough.","January 27, 2015","true","21.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I mean, who could resist an open world game that Square Enix put their name on (as publisher, but still). Especially if it's the edition that contains all the dlc. I bought it and was not disappointed, it had a great story that also managed to not get in the way of the free-roam that made up probably over half my playtime so far.\n\nI couldn't say anything bad about it except that if you have a weaker computer like me, the game can act sluggish.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/patteymac/recommended/307690/","patteymac","AK-FORTY KEVIN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/patteymac/","140 products in account","One day this game went on to Xbox Live for a free game with gold so I decided to get it. It was the original version and this one hadn't come out yet. I loved the game so much, and it was my favorite game. Sadly, my Xbox broke for unknown reasons and I was unable to play the game for a while. Then one day i see that this new and improved version of Sleeping Dogs has been released, and by then I had purchased a gaming PC so I was very exited when I found out I would be able to play Sleeping Dogs once again.\nI bought this, downloaded it, and played it. I spent 15 hours playing it on my first day of owning it.\n\nNow, the Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition goes through various improvements from the previous version. I will now go step by step describing them.\n\nGraphical Stuff: 9/10\nThe trailer boasts about graphical and texture improvements, and they weren't lying. There aren't much improvements to the graphics as there are to the textures. Lighting is very clearly improved and clothing and hair are no longer static. There is a few minor glitches to this kind of things but nothing too noticeable.\n\nAudio: 5/10\nI personally cant see much difference.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nSleeping Dogs: DE has a few changes to the gameplay. For example, the city of Hong Kong feels much more immersive, there is more pedestrians and traffic making Hong Kong feel more like Hong Kong. The driving mechanics feel much smoother and better. But now for cons. some of the walking controls feel very wonky and sometimes it is more difficult to actually do the parkour in the game. The game is also no longer able to generate everything in your general area, so sometimes you'll take a few step and all of a sudden the game will span a group of civilians right next to Wei. and sometimes people spawn in the sky and fall to Earth. but overall, really good gameplay.\n\nSPOILERS FROM HERE ON!\n\nI love this game so much, the story is amazing and there is so much attachment to characters. I felt bad for Mrs. Chu when Winston died at his wedding, and cried when Wei found Jackie Ma's dead body. When you find that Pendrew was a bad guy I was shocked. So much happens within this game and I hope to never stop playing it\n\nThat's why my final rating for this game is 9/10.\n───────────────────████\n───────────────────█████\n───────────────────██████\n───────────────────███████\n──────────────────████████\n──────────────────████████\n─────────────────█████████\n────────────────█████████\n───────────────█████████\n──────────────█████████\n──────────────██████████████████\n────────────█████████████████████\n───────────███████████████████████\n████████─██████████████████████████\n████████─███████████████████████████\n████████─█████Recommended█████████████\n████████─████████████████████████████\n████████─████████████████████████████\n████████─████████████████████████████\n████████─███████████████████████████\n████████─██████████████████████████\n████████─█████████████████████████\n████████─████████████████████████\n████████─███████████████████████","May 26, 2015","true","52.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You're an undercover cop working with a street gang who are pulled into a war. Hardships with corrupt gangmates, vengeance for family and friends, and a mission wrapped in deep blankets with a secret agency. As a native who has returned from America, you help the Triads regain their name and territory while keeping the streets clean for the agency. Progress in each mission and power-leveling are made depending on how varied your combat skills are as a Triad, and how well you perform as a cop with as little error to the city and yourself as possible.\n\nIf you relish in the amount of DLC it has, you can really grind on power and vary on how you fight enemies, both hand-to-hand and guns.\n\nSleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is the same experience you can get with the original, but with better graphics and all the DLC included in one package. The catch is that the DLC features are unlocked as you progress through the main story and boost on experience points.","December 4, 2015","true","57.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I would recommend this game to anyone who likes action/open world games.\nFirst off, I would recommend playing with a controller for this game. The keyboard controls aren't TERRIBLE, but you will be finding yourself fustrated in some fighting/driving sections in the game. Nevertheless, Sleeping Dogs has a fun combat system, similar to the Batman Arkham games. It is smooth and you will be finding yourself just going around Hong Kong beating up baddies.\nHong Kong is spectacular to look at (especially at night). Overall, it is a good looking game. Character models look good and all characters in the game are well voice acted. The characters in Sleeping Dogs are detailed and Wei Shen is a likeable main character along with the other supporting characters in the game.\nHong Kong feels alive, wherever you go it will feel like you are in an actual city that you will be able to explore. Sleeping Dogs also has quite a few side activities including: races, fight clubs, karaoke (yes, karaoke), side challenges, betting on chicken fights and more.\nThere are quite a few things to collect around Hong Kong. There is actual importance in these collectibles, like to learn to fighting moves or increase your maximum health.\nSleeping Dogs has some issues that shine a little too many times throughout this game. The game is sometimes too easy. In shooter sections, it is just too easy, the AI just isn't smart enough to make you get a game over screen in these sections. And although there is quite a bit of side mission in this game, they kinda get repettitive. Some quests often have you do very similar activities here and there. And this game can be fustratingly buggy. Just be prepared when the game just decides to do a total U-turn on you in some sections like action hijacking a big vehicle for example.\nWith all of that said, Sleeping Dogs is a decently solid game. I was actually amazed by how much fun I was having when I first played this game. But I recommend Sleeping Dogs to anyone that is looking for an action/ open world game.","March 6","true","55.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you somehow missed the game back in 2012 then you owe to yourself to buy this one.Igf you already own the base game, well, I'd be worthwhile to get this one if you havn't experienced the story DLCs since they'll add about 2 hours each.\n\nI got this on sale for around 8$ and got 30ish hours out of it, that's a great bang for your buck: if you also consider the game's quality, they make Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition a game I fully recommend, previous consideration notwithstanding.","October 4, 2015","true","29.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/n_gamer/recommended/307690/","n_gamer","daxy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/n_gamer/","570 products in account","Bought Sleepy Dogs a second time as this Defitive Edition and played through it again. Know what? Still really, really damn good. I generally get bored with GTA and games such as those rather quickly, which I think is because they generally have boring combat and not that engaging stories. Slippy Dogs hits the nail on the head when it comes to these. Its storyline is super fun. It can be a goofy action movie one mission and get pretty dark in another, while generally mixing up the mission structure in fun ways.\n\nYou're not really shooting dudes all the time like in GTA. Guns are actually quite a rare find and you'll typically only find and use them in certain missions. This is good! GTA's combat gets kinda boring. You know, how you just lock on to some fella and hold R or whatever. That's not fun. In Slurpee Dogs, you're constantly jumping off tabes, out of cover, off of rails and getting good air-time in general, because whenever you do you'll get into a bullet-time mode and shoot fools all John Woo style. It's super satisfying. Wei Shen really loves jumping on, off or over stuff and it makes travelsal, especially in action packed sequences, actually fun. And by not having to do all this every damn mission, you actually enjoy it each time gun-sections come around and really savor them.\n\nHand to hand is the core of the combat and it is solid. Nothing groundbreaking but it's good, which is a rarity in itself. It's an action, counter and grab type of system with a bunch of really cool modifiers to the regular attacks, some of which quite gruesome, that make each fight sequence a real treat, visually, aurally and in terms of gameplay. You can string together a bunch of stuff, grab melee weapons, throw dudes into environmental hazards, throw some more dudes into more gnarly hazards and really take in the wrath Wei Shen just brought down on those guys by the amount of blood he's covered in. It's cheesy, but effective.\n\nBut driving around its sandbox world would still be boring like most of the other games in this genre, you say. AHA! It's not. Well, it depends on you of course. It's got all sorts of interesting challenges like driving safely as long as possible, hitting max speed as long as possible, doing wheelies of bikes. It tracks all of this stuff and pits you against your friends in leaderboards in all sorts of categories (not exclusive to driving), kind of like an Autolog/Battlelog sort of thing. It's a nice way of spicing a gameplay segment up that can generally develolve into tedium after several hours.\n\nApart from that, there's a healthy amount of stuff to do and see around the map. From wacky side-missions to dudes to fight some more, collectibles, and, most importantly, that damn karaoke minigame. It's fun, have a go at it, and only then judge me.\n\nAlright. Seriously, if you haven't yet, give Slip in Dungs a shot. It's an all-around entertaining game with a lot of heart that, unless you really don't like action movies or fun in general, I don't see how anyone wouldn't be able to enjoy.","August 27, 2015","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was the original version and this one hadn't come out yet. I loved the game so much, and it was my favorite game. Sadly, my Xbox broke for unknown reasons and I was unable to play the game for a while. Then one day i see that this new and improved version of Sleeping Dogs has been released, and by then I had purchased a gaming PC so I was very exited when I found out I would be able to play Sleeping Dogs once again.\nI bought this, downloaded it, and played it. I spent 15 hours playing it on my first day of owning it.\n\nNow, the Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition goes through various improvements from the previous version. I will now go step by step describing them.\n\nGraphical Stuff: 9/10\nThe trailer boasts about graphical and texture improvements, and they weren't lying. There aren't much improvements to the graphics as there are to the textures. Lighting is very clearly improved and clothing and hair are no longer static. There is a few minor glitches to this kind of things but nothing too noticeable.\n\nAudio: 5/10\nI personally cant see much difference.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nSleeping Dogs: DE has a few changes to the gameplay. For example, the city of Hong Kong feels much more immersive, there is more pedestrians and traffic making Hong Kong feel more like Hong Kong. The driving mechanics feel much smoother and better. But now for cons. some of the walking controls feel very wonky and sometimes it is more difficult to actually do the parkour in the game. The game is also no longer able to generate everything in your general area, so sometimes you'll take a few step and all of a sudden the game will span a group of civilians right next to Wei. and sometimes people spawn in the sky and fall to Earth. but overall, really good gameplay.\n\nSPOILERS FROM HERE ON!\n\nI love this game so much, the story is amazing and there is so much attachment to characters. I felt bad for Mrs. Chu when Winston died at his wedding, and cried when Wei found Jackie Ma's dead body. When you find that Pendrew was a bad guy I was shocked. So much happens within this game and I hope to never stop playing it\n\nThat's why my final rating for this game is 9/10.\n───────────────────████\n───────────────────█████\n───────────────────██████\n───────────────────███████\n──────────────────████████\n──────────────────████████\n─────────────────█████████\n────────────────█████████\n───────────────█████████\n──────────────█████████\n──────────────██████████████████\n────────────█████████████████████\n───────────███████████████████████\n████████─██████████████████████████\n████████─███████████████████████████\n████████─█████Recommended█████████████\n████████─████████████████████████████\n████████─████████████████████████████\n████████─████████████████████████████\n████████─███████████████████████████\n████████─██████████████████████████\n████████─█████████████████████████\n████████─████████████████████████\n████████─███████████████████████","May 26, 2015","true","52.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I was drawn in immediately by the aesthetic, which is done very well, and kept playing because of the simple, yet very satisfying, brutal combat system. With strings of combos, you can break enemies' legs, arms, faces, and smash them into fans and refridgeraters.\n\nThe story is good - it feels a little more fresh to be part of the police, working undercover. It doesn't go quite as deep as I had hoped it would, but the game does openly explore some moral boundaries related to killing which adds depth.\n\nWhile the driving is a bit wonky, and at times frustrating, the burnout-style "ramming" is really fun and arcadey.\n\nOverall, this is a great action game, and one I would even recommend over grand theft auto.","June 28, 2015","true","40.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have also noticed a performance difference in benchmarking, this may be due to the new textures, but if it's worth it will be up to you. I would look at some game play of both to make your decision on visual improvement VS performance hit. I will be continuing to play through this, only because I enjoyed it the first time.

If you somehow missed the game back in 2012 then you owe to yourself to buy this one.Igf you already own the base game, well, I'd be worthwhile to get this one if you havn't experienced the story DLCs since they'll add about 2 hours each.\n\nI got this on sale for around 8$ and got 30ish hours out of it, that's a great bang for your buck: if you also consider the game's quality, they make Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition a game I fully recommend, previous consideration notwithstanding.","October 4, 2015","true","29.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Competing with the ever popular Grand Theft Auto franchise, Square Enix has delivered a masterpiece of dramatic, story-telling adventure. And the story is where Sleeping Dogs surpasses the competition.\nSD strikes a neat balance between action and cutscenes -- which are beautifully directed. I never found myself waiting for the scene to end, perhaps due to their brevity, but definitely because they're fun to watch! The plot is gripping, the characters are authentic, and their journeys are moving.\nThere are a couple of parts where the plot progression seems rushed, but character development still feels genuine. About half-way through the game, I started to feel like Jackie was my best friend too! And did I mention how great the animation in the cutscenes looks?\nAt least as important as the story telling is the gameplay. Like other games in it's genre, it has a tendency to throw control mechanics at you that are overly simple, yet obnoxiously difficult to execute. Combat and driving controls come with a steep learning curve, but are manageable... but only just. Despite the difficulty, fist fighting a bunch of thugs, or shooting it out while slow mo flying over obstacles is a blast! This all does get easier as you level up with the build ssytem learning new kung fu techniques and street criminal tactics, Add in parkour and some fun mini games to break up the monotony and it's a really fun experience. This game isn't as bad as others in terms of doing several missions that feel exactly the same. You'll still end up chasing down a lot of people, but it's... better some how.\nThere are some kinks to work out, like running the game in compatability mode was the only way to keep it from looping on the loading screen between missions. The skinny: like every other game in this genre, Sleeping Dogs is plagued with some issues, but for me, it pulls ahead of the pack and is a great game. If you like GTA-type games, you're going to love Sleeping Dogs.","February 22","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a GTA-like game with a nice open world of Hong Kong. The main charcter Wei Shen is very likeable hero. The story itself is cool your typical Police story/Movie. The characters are also likeable they all have somekind of personality. The main mechanic of the is fighting, and they have done it nicely very similar of the Batman Series games. I like there are no cons to it. Driving which unfortunatly is a bit on a bad side, you will get use to it but it's not the best. And at the shooting, and it's...meh. It is your typical TPS just the crosshair sucks. There is a lot of missions and side activites.  But they all fall in the category of "Shoot/Fight,Get in the car,Lose the cops" which for some might not be a problem.the main story will take you about 15-20 hours but there is a lot of things to collect and mission to do after the credit's roll. When you get a bit bored by the main story you also have three Dlc to play through. The Zodiac tournament that will take you about 30 minutes to complete, a bit on a short side but very engaging. Then is the NIghtmare in the Northpoint, this the Dlc is the best actually, wei Shen is fighting against demons and other chiniese folk monsters. Again on a very short side only an hour, with all the side activites done. And the last is The Year of the Snake Dlc, which is the worst. Focus mainly about driving, and shooting, annoying side missions and main missions, and it is VERY buggy. (Disclaimer: I suggest that you play the Main Story first and then Dlc's) In the end Sleeping Dogs is game that was amazing to play throught and I realy recommend it ot everybody.","January 28","true","29.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would recommend this game to anyone who likes action/open world games.\nFirst off, I would recommend playing with a controller for this game. The keyboard controls aren't TERRIBLE, but you will be finding yourself fustrated in some fighting/driving sections in the game. Nevertheless, Sleeping Dogs has a fun combat system, similar to the Batman Arkham games. It is smooth and you will be finding yourself just going around Hong Kong beating up baddies.\nHong Kong is spectacular to look at (especially at night). Overall, it is a good looking game. Character models look good and all characters in the game are well voice acted. The characters in Sleeping Dogs are detailed and Wei Shen is a likeable main character along with the other supporting characters in the game.\nHong Kong feels alive, wherever you go it will feel like you are in an actual city that you will be able to explore. Sleeping Dogs also has quite a few side activities including: races, fight clubs, karaoke (yes, karaoke), side challenges, betting on chicken fights and more.\nThere are quite a few things to collect around Hong Kong. There is actual importance in these collectibles, like to learn to fighting moves or increase your maximum health.\nSleeping Dogs has some issues that shine a little too many times throughout this game. The game is sometimes too easy. In shooter sections, it is just too easy, the AI just isn't smart enough to make you get a game over screen in these sections. And although there is quite a bit of side mission in this game, they kinda get repettitive. Some quests often have you do very similar activities here and there. And this game can be fustratingly buggy. Just be prepared when the game just decides to do a total U-turn on you in some sections like action hijacking a big vehicle for example.\nWith all of that said, Sleeping Dogs is a decently solid game. I was actually amazed by how much fun I was having when I first played this game. But I recommend Sleeping Dogs to anyone that is looking for an action/ open world game.","March 6","true","55.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It would have been nice to include the previous version of the game, which runs a bit better, but the Definitive Edition at least includes all DLC (minus the stupid free-money ones) and rebalances them to make them more fair.\n\nIt also has Emma Stone, for about two missions before she mysteriously disappears in a strange occurrence known as "budget-tosis."","March 7","true","46.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All the DLC for the original edition is *not* included in this, I would honestly pick up the original over this. I have also noticed a performance difference in benchmarking, this may be due to the new textures, but if it's worth it will be up to you. I would look at some game play of both to make your decision on visual improvement VS performance hit. I will be continuing to play through this, only because I enjoyed it the first time.

It was the original version and this one hadn't come out yet. I loved the game so much, and it was my favorite game. Sadly, my Xbox broke for unknown reasons and I was unable to play the game for a while. Then one day i see that this new and improved version of Sleeping Dogs has been released, and by then I had purchased a gaming PC so I was very exited when I found out I would be able to play Sleeping Dogs once again.\nI bought this, downloaded it, and played it. I spent 15 hours playing it on my first day of owning it.\n\nNow, the Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition goes through various improvements from the previous version. I will now go step by step describing them.\n\nGraphical Stuff: 9/10\nThe trailer boasts about graphical and texture improvements, and they weren't lying. There aren't much improvements to the graphics as there are to the textures. Lighting is very clearly improved and clothing and hair are no longer static. There is a few minor glitches to this kind of things but nothing too noticeable.\n\nAudio: 5/10\nI personally cant see much difference.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nSleeping Dogs: DE has a few changes to the gameplay. For example, the city of Hong Kong feels much more immersive, there is more pedestrians and traffic making Hong Kong feel more like Hong Kong. The driving mechanics feel much smoother and better. But now for cons. some of the walking controls feel very wonky and sometimes it is more difficult to actually do the parkour in the game. The game is also no longer able to generate everything in your general area, so sometimes you'll take a few step and all of a sudden the game will span a group of civilians right next to Wei. and sometimes people spawn in the sky and fall to Earth. but overall, really good gameplay.\n\nSPOILERS FROM HERE ON!\n\nI love this game so much, the story is amazing and there is so much attachment to characters. I felt bad for Mrs. Chu when Winston died at his wedding, and cried when Wei found Jackie Ma's dead body. When you find that Pendrew was a bad guy I was shocked. So much happens within this game and I hope to never stop playing it\n\nThat's why my final rating for this game is 9/10.\n───────────────────████\n───────────────────█████\n───────────────────██████\n───────────────────███████\n──────────────────████████\n──────────────────████████\n─────────────────█████████\n────────────────█████████\n───────────────█████████\n──────────────█████████\n──────────────██████████████████\n────────────█████████████████████\n───────────███████████████████████\n████████─██████████████████████████\n████████─███████████████████████████\n████████─█████Recommended█████████████\n████████─████████████████████████████\n████████─████████████████████████████\n████████─████████████████████████████\n████████─███████████████████████████\n████████─██████████████████████████\n████████─█████████████████████████\n████████─████████████████████████\n████████─███████████████████████","May 26, 2015","true","52.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I have done so many drug busts from the comfort of my home in this game that it felt like checking the mail.\n-The models of NPCs don't vary much, especially the street gang members. It really took away from the big city feel beating up the same guys wearing the same clothes everywhere.\n-Though it took me 40 hours to go through this game at a leisurely gaming pace (doing side missions as I pleased, not investing too much into beating the game), I felt like the middle lacked depth.

One minor downside was the dating side missions. At first I thought they would be a bit deeper, but most of them are just 1 or 2 missions and then nothing ever again. I also found it hilarious that one of the missions was to find out if one of the girls you end up dating was cheating on you, even though you're pretty much dating 3 women at the same time by this point.\n\nAfter the mess that was Final Fantasy 13, I was ready to basically give up on Square Enix, but this game most definitely boosted my confidence in their abilities.","June 3, 2015","true","29.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its pretty well written, and do contain some surprises, and you can really feel the tension between Wei and his police handlers. Its a shame how you do not get a choice of how the story goes, but the ending is pretty dark, and does show the emotional deaths, betrayal and decisions wei makes in the end.\n\nAnother problem with the game, the developers used too many stereotypes. For example, some of the npcs in the game have such a heavy chinese accent (true, some do, but not all) and some of events in the game feels like its taken from a typical hong kong film (though the game is supposed to have the hong kong martial arts movie feel). The map is big, but of course there are still areas that are inaccessible, and i hope they do create a sequel with a larger, more lifelike hong kong.\n\nThe fighting and environmental kills do offer a unique taste to the game, and the bullet time when shooting and driving is well done. But some of the controls feel sluggish sometimes, and this game is not without some bugs and glitches which either cause your game to crash or force you to restart the mission.\n\nI would give this game an 8/10. a severely underrated game. oh have i mentioned that this game has better hacking than watch_dogs (better, but watchdogs have alot more). Its a bargain to buy this game, especially during steam sales. With its success in its formula, i have a feeling the developers could not be working on an actual sequal (or maybe with a new character), since they game up on triad wars.","April 1","true","22.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But BEWARE for you who love gunfights, you are not able to buy any gun freely. Guns in this game are only available through several special missions and legendary costume shops (when you bought some costumes like agent 47 costume, you will automatically equipped with a gun).\n- The parkour run in this game is just perfect. It makes the game more charming and gives you more variations to run away from cops or hostiles.\n- There are many cool vehicles and costumes to collect. I usually wear that Rico Rodriguez costume to spam those grenade launchers.\n- Badass main character, good voice actings, many memorable scenes & great story.\n- There are a lot of missions to complete and each mission is different from the others. The missions are not repetitive and makes me want to try them all (which I did).\n- Destructable environment, normal for an open world like this.\n- You can develop your character by learning and upgrading his skills (cop skills, triad skills, melee fighting skills) and even his health bar.\n- Talking about skill, there's this skill that allows you to enter a slow motion mode similar to Max Payne 3.\n- Sometimes, we are a bit annoyed bt the fact that there's no vehicle nearby when we need it the most. Don't worry, there's a VALET PARK feature, but there's a special requirement for that. You can call your driver anytime (except during quest), anywhere (except if you are standing in places that unaccessable by cars or motorcycles) to deliver your vehicles to your exact location.\n\nCons :\n- I'm not sure whether this is a cons or not. The amount of weapons in this game is a bit lacking, especially for guns. That's probably because this game's charm is the fistfights, not gunfights. The other explanation is there will be stated in the story that guns are rare in Hongkong. If we can access guns easily like in GTA or Saints Row, those martial art fighting skills will be useless.\n- If you equip a gun, you cannot interact with some NPCs like food selling NPCs or Parking NPCs because they are afraid of you. This is supported by the "guns in Hongkong are rare" logic. Oh, one more thing, if you equipped yourself with a weapon, and then you enter a mission, hoping that you can use that weapon in the mission, no you cannot. Your weapons will be disarmed automatically, so there's no point on keeping that weapon so long.\n- Melee weapons like knives, etc can broke in battle. You simply can't keep them for long in this game. Your fist is your loyal weapon.\n- Camera is a bit troublesome when driving, sometimes.\n\nOverall, this game gave me great experience and immersion.

I mean everything. you play as a cop who gets to bust drug deals, you get to race cars, you get to do gears of war shooting mechanics, you get platformer style fighting in a 3rd person enviorment. you get gta style open world car driving.\n\nit has alot of potential (note: Im saying this in late 2015) the concept was great I wish they could do a re make or a sequal to fix all the problems. because its too liear, they didn't focus enough on cars, they didn't make a proper shooting aspect that was noteable, they didnt't make the plot memorable.

The story is great, with fantastic mission variety and stellar voice acting by a cast of well known Hollywood actors. Characters are developed pretty well, and you can really feel ther emotions. However, due to the nature of the story, it could have benefited more from a sort of "trust" system like Splinter Cell Double Agent had. Here, you are awarded Cop and Triad XP for different things you do during missions, and each unlock different upgrades for Wei. Also, the ending is kind of abrupt and comes out of nowhere, which was a bit disappointing, seeing as everything before that was great.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty standard for a sandbox game, except there is far more emphasis on hand to hand combat and parcour. Fighting is simillar to Batman Arkham combat, with gadgets being replaced by a wide variety of combos, and brutal environmental finisher attacks. Also, there are sequences where you chase a target simillar to Assassin's Creed, with your character having similar parcour moves like wall climbing and such.\nDriving is also pretty standard, with the awesome addition of action hijacks, where you are capable of hijacking a vehicle from another vehicle, while driving. It always look awesome seeing Wei jump out of a moving car, onto another moving car, and jump in through the windows.\n\nGraphics are excellent, although the highest AA settings can be pretty demanding on the system. Even without them, the game still looks spectacular, escpecially at night when Hong Kong lights up. The town is beautifully rendered, and looks quite close to the real thing.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is fantastic. The entire game feels like a AAA chinese cop action drama movie, and it is awesome. There is even a mission based on "In Dragon's Lair", which is played with an old movie filter over all the graphics, and Wei can even wear the famous Bruce Lee yellow jumpsuit.\nThe music is also great, with a wide variety of stations available, from ones that play chinese music, to the ones with more traditional westerns songs.\n\nThere are plenty of side missions and races, and there are lot of different types of those you can run into, meaning you can rarely get bored doing the same thing over and over again. The game also has lots of collectables and a relatively easy way to get them to show on the map, but revealing that would be a shame, since it is such a cool surprise.\n\nOverall, it is a fantastic game. Despite not having any replayability, the story itself and many different side missions mean you can spend quite a lot of time with the game and enjoy it. Definitely worth your time, I highly recommend it.","October 13, 2015","true","23.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game starts off with an awesome scene where you run away from the cops, you are captured and you are in jail with Jackie he then takes you to a fight area where you learn combat moves and more. The combat system is really similar to Rocksteady's Batman Arkham franchise in many ways. There are awesome car chases with guns, like when you capture Naz. The game features more things than Grand Theft Auto EX: Shooting while driving, Karaoke, Face Level, Cop Missions, Triad Missions, Door slam, and more! I really like the Defenitive Edition, I had the original one on Xbox 360 and I played it for hours and hours on end. I played this for days and days.

There also appears to be an issue with vsync, as screen tearing is still very apparent even with vsync on.\n\nThe driving is fun, but sometimes the game makes you take some ridiculously long routes to missions.\n\nOther than these things, it's still a really fun game, very good looking, and overall an experience that I enjoyed.\n\nI didn't toucht the DLCs too much, they seemed kinda silly which isn't something I like with this kind of game.\n\n","December 4, 2015","true","14.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It excels in taking its setting to heart, with lots of gorgeous city lights and aiming for mainly hand-to-hand combat as its core gameplay mechanic (as guns are hard to find in Hong Kong, obviously). That being said, the amount of gunplay that there is in the game is rather terrible. It seems since that isn't the core mechanic, they didn't feel it necessary to put much effort into making it feel good. Nevertheless, that hindrance is limited, and the majority of the game is a joy to play.","February 5","true","21.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But BEWARE for you who love gunfights, you are not able to buy any gun freely. Guns in this game are only available through several special missions and legendary costume shops (when you bought some costumes like agent 47 costume, you will automatically equipped with a gun).\n- The parkour run in this game is just perfect. It makes the game more charming and gives you more variations to run away from cops or hostiles.\n- There are many cool vehicles and costumes to collect. I usually wear that Rico Rodriguez costume to spam those grenade launchers.\n- Badass main character, good voice actings, many memorable scenes & great story.\n- There are a lot of missions to complete and each mission is different from the others. The missions are not repetitive and makes me want to try them all (which I did).\n- Destructable environment, normal for an open world like this.\n- You can develop your character by learning and upgrading his skills (cop skills, triad skills, melee fighting skills) and even his health bar.\n- Talking about skill, there's this skill that allows you to enter a slow motion mode similar to Max Payne 3.\n- Sometimes, we are a bit annoyed bt the fact that there's no vehicle nearby when we need it the most. Don't worry, there's a VALET PARK feature, but there's a special requirement for that. You can call your driver anytime (except during quest), anywhere (except if you are standing in places that unaccessable by cars or motorcycles) to deliver your vehicles to your exact location.\n\nCons :\n- I'm not sure whether this is a cons or not. The amount of weapons in this game is a bit lacking, especially for guns. That's probably because this game's charm is the fistfights, not gunfights. The other explanation is there will be stated in the story that guns are rare in Hongkong. If we can access guns easily like in GTA or Saints Row, those martial art fighting skills will be useless.\n- If you equip a gun, you cannot interact with some NPCs like food selling NPCs or Parking NPCs because they are afraid of you. This is supported by the "guns in Hongkong are rare" logic. Oh, one more thing, if you equipped yourself with a weapon, and then you enter a mission, hoping that you can use that weapon in the mission, no you cannot. Your weapons will be disarmed automatically, so there's no point on keeping that weapon so long.\n- Melee weapons like knives, etc can broke in battle. You simply can't keep them for long in this game. Your fist is your loyal weapon.\n- Camera is a bit troublesome when driving, sometimes.\n\nOverall, this game gave me great experience and immersion. I feel like a total badass in this game.\n9/10. Worth the price, worth your time.\n","July 29, 2015","true","24.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You are an undercover HKPD agent who is tasked with infiltrating the ranks of the Triad Gangs, in order to exact some justice. Along the way, you make choices; you face tough decisions and you become immersed in a alternate reality form of Hong Kong. The city is riddled with violent gangs (unlike the real Hong Kong) and as a HKPD officer, you have to weigh in decisions of going dirty or doing it by the law. The graphics are more PC-worthy, with my only complaint being, that the SSAO is actually not that appealing. What makes this different from GTA and GTA clones, is that it emphasizes the use of martial arts in combat, instead of melee weapons and guns. You do have access to melee weapons and guns, but they are not the do-all be-all of the game. I do praise the adoption of native cantonese language which bears similarity to what you hear in Hong Kong; there are of course, optional english subtitles for those who need them.\n\nThere is some touches of humor, but the story and dialogue is more on a serious level. There are minigames such as karaoke (reminds me of a form of guitar hero or audiosurf), you can do police missions or triad missions, you can buy cheap and really nice cars and keep them in a garage; you can call a valet or taxi driver. Also, thanks to the definitive edition: You can max out the crowd density, which depicts a more accurate Hong Kong instead of the older console version which was optimized for old consoles. You will pick up the fact that the map of Hong Kong in this game isn't a 100% accurate match of the real Hong Kong, the roads are different and the island is the primary location. There are some places which bear resemblance to Hong Kong, (like victoria peak); but other than that the designers did some embellishing to fit the story, which is fine in my opinion.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game for those who like open-city martial arts GTA style games. The story is good and the gameplay is entertaining, with a certain amount of replay value.\n\nNow, instead of giving pros and cons; I will give the recipe to pork buns. Why?

The fighting mechanic works well and provides plenty of opportunity for brutal action. Very well animated all around, with a cool story to keep things moving along. I don't like dressing up in the dorky cop uniform, but those missions do provide a nice change of pace. It's natural to compare this to GTA games. The crisp controls of Sleeping Dogs makes GTA feel sluggish in comparison. It's this natural feel of the game that had me spending a lot of time enjoying this open world. I do miss the guns, explosions, and silly ♥♥♥♥ in GTA.

I owned the original and I have a special relationship with this game. It was the first game that I bought, installed, and played after building my first rig. But that aside...\n\nThe controls are better and it seems that you have access to police vehicles earlier. Those may have originally been part of DLC's from the original but Im not sure. (Specifically I am talking about the HKPD SUV). The non-police vehicle that I just got very early on was something that I dont remember at all, the custom van with the air-brushed dragons on it. Im not complaining. Actually it makes getting around easier.\n\nThe textures on Wei look better. However, the actual world itself doesnt seem to be any different than the original with the HD Texture pack isntalled. The devs say its actually better but I cant really see a difference.\n\nBut if you have never played this game then you have to get it. You wont regret it. This is everything that Grand Theft Auto wishes it could be and never was.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theamazingdegenerate/recommended/307690/","theamazingdegenerate","Gay Cat Incest","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theamazingdegenerate/","158 products in account","The game is my guilty pleasure. TL;DR is on the bottom\nIt's way too underrated and imo it's better than some of the games that the AAA publishers release now like a diarrhea on our plates when we were expecting something delicious (I'm looking at you, watch_dogs).\nYou are basically a guy from Hong Kong that visited America and now came back. You are recruited as an undercover cop and have to work with a triad along with your friend and other people. There comes the plot, which is very well written and kept me interested when I wasn't putting people's heads into saw tables.\nThe fighting is very fun and satisfying. There is also cover-based shooting, which is not necessary a bad thing - mostly because it doesn't overuse it. The game has great amount of detail and AMAZING atmosphere.\nIt also has hacking minigames, which most ironically are better than hacking in watch_dogs, which is a game focused on hacking. There aren't much collectibles, sadly - a thing I enjoy in sandboxes a lot.\nThe game does Ride to hell: Retribution kind of thing where you go on a date and you bang her.\nHowever, people at United Front Games aren't 12 year old immature idiots, so it's off camera.\nSpeaking of cameras, there is a side-mission where you beat up some thugs, hack the camera in the same area and go back to your house. When you do that, you access the camera view and choose which guy is a drug dealer, thus he has to go with the nice men with guns to a building where people come in a lot but don't seem to come out so much.\nRemember when I said about putting people's heads into saw tables? There is a lot of environment kills which are nicely varied and fun. Some of them are brutal, like cutting someone's head in half in an air vent, and some of them are silly, like drowning someone in his own p1ss. These are just two, but there are quite a lot. You can get melee weapons in cars and next to your enemy's dead body if he had one, but they break after few hits.\nBut of course, what would be a good third-person sandbox without drivingcough cough Batman: Arkham City cough cough? There is one guy with a magical ability to teleport between the points you can get your own cars. You get new cars by side-missions, races and buying them if you're the rich kid. You can also ''borrow'' cars from the citizens, just like a thief ''borrows'' your money and a serial killer ''borrows'' your life. People who were once behind Need For Speed (if I'm not mistaken) were programming the car controls and they make me moist. The driving is fun and with an ability to ram into people's stuff the developers threw reality out of the window and nicely welcomed fun into their house - something that the AAA publishers treat like the ultimate sin. However, with a button to open your car's door and jump out of onto another person's car they asked fun to help them hang reality and hit it with a baseball bat like a pinata. As I mentioned earlier there are races which are fun and rewarding. You get money and Face Experience points for winning a race, but some of them give you outfits or new cars. Oh, I think I forgot to mention the leveling system.\nYou basically got three experience bars: Triad XP, Cop XP and Face XP. Both of Triad and Cop XP have 2 upgrade paths.\nYou can only get Triad XP in main missions. The more gruesome you are, the more you get. Cop XP can be received in main-missions as well, but also side-missions. If you don't kill anyone innocent and do no property damage in a main-mission or side-mission, you get more XP. The Face XP allows you to get more things that you can wear to have small yet balanced bonuses and give various upgrades as well. Another upgrade tree is the combos you can do. In one of the missions you go with a girl to a kung-fu school that you were once a student of. Your teacher teaches you one combo for free and then asks you to get his lost statues back. For each one of them, you get a new combo of your choice and if you get all of them, you get an advanced counter move. The basic counter is OP by itself, so now you're basically the Thor of Hong Kong. If you like references, then you will enjoy that aspect as well. For example, there is a yellow jumpsuit referencing a movie starring Bruce Lee. Almost every enemy is dressed in a suit or in something that a young teen would consider ''cool'', so killing them in a bright yellow jumpsuit that can probably kill them just because of how intense the color is can never not be fun. I know I said the word ''fun'' a lot in this review of mine, so if you ever want to read this whole wall of text remember to take a shot every time I mention the word ''fun''. Warning: I don't take the responsibility of you dropping dead.\nTL;DRGet the game and don't ask questions - especially when it's on sale.","May 28, 2015","true","86.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

I only played definitive so i am not sure what they added the game but i can say it's pretty solid game. Unlike other series this game is heavily on hand to hand combat rather then guns or tools. Driving gets a little time to adapt. Combat is amazing. Missions and side missions are fun to play. Integrated dlc missions is also fun to play. For the story at first i didn't like the idea of being a undercover cop (thought they will restirct my actions) it didn't matter and the story development was pretty good. But i think they could give a better feeling about Wei's pressure about being undercover or never mention it.

If you want an actually biting and well-engineered game with the message that crime doesn't pay, play this game. It demonstrates exactly why the criminal lifestyle is bad without forcing it down your throat or completely jerking your chain like GTA4 does. You lose friends - emotionally and literally - you make enemies, you suffer, you bleed, you break, you hurt, and some things you just have to let go in order to live. Hong Kong is a beautiful and mean place, and you get to find out first-hand just how terrible it can be to be a gangster.\n\nVisually and audibly this game is absolutely beautiful even despite the dicky optimization on PC, and its gameplay is so satisfying and free-feeling even when you're just blitzing main quests like I did my first time around. The first time you roll around the neon-lit Hong Kong at night while listening to chilled out electronic tracks on Ninja Tune will take your breath away, I guarantee it.\n\nStory-wise, the story can be a BIT spotty, but it's hardly gaping with holes and it's easy to suspend your disbelief to understand them. The developers seemed to actually care about the fact that you might want to cut loose and plough through a shopping district sometimes after a hard mission, so you only get punished for murder through police attention and, if you're on a mission, reduced Cop XP rather than revoking money or XP retroactively.\n\nThe characters are also REALLY likeable and surprisingly memorable even with such a wide cast. You will learn to love Jackie Ma, you will learn to loathe Dogeyes, and you will learn to breathe like Wei Shen.\n\nHong Kong is a cruel place, but it's also a beautiful place.\nThis game makes me want to visit it for real.\nDo not pass up your chance to play this, if you ever get it.","June 21, 2015","true","22.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

And after having played both of them I can say that the Definitive Edition was completely unnecessary. Here's why I didn't like it...\n\n-Character controls feel even sloppier now.\n\n-Very little noticeable changes in the graphics and textures, almost everything seem the same as they were in the original Sleeping Dogs. I don't see the point in spending money for the little graphical improvements.\n\n-It's so freakin' bright, especially indoors during the daytime, so much that I feel like it's going to give me a migraine attack.\n\n-The vehicles controls in races are more terrible in the definitve edition. Bike races are the worst, this time the opponents will try to push you off the track everytime you try cut them off.\n\n-It would be a lie to say that the game doesn't have any bugs.\n\n-You don't get the all black attire you got in the last mission of the original game that was later part of the High Roller DLC pack so that players can have access to it from the beginning of the story. It's not there anymore, instead you get a gray one now. Seriously, what asian gangster doesn't own a black suit, it's almost their trademark, don't you think?\n\n\nI don't know why players should buy this one instead of the original Sleeping Dogs. I know you can't get it on steam anymore, but steam isn't the only place you could get the standard edition from.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/307690/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","OLD DOG, NO NEW TRICKS\n\n→ OCTOBER 8, 2014 Many open-world, non-linear drive-and-gun games -- with some notable exclusions -- tend to tack on a story merely to loosely justify whatever it is you're doing. But the main thing I made clear in my original review of Sleeping Dogs on Xbox 360 and PS3 back in 2012 is that while it's a blast to play, its story is actually the star of the show. The Definitive Edition for new-gen consoles carries over both of those great traits and adds a decent facelift, and it's just as fun and just as memorable as it was the first time around. An engaging plot littered with memorable characters and a ton of slowly building tension is artfully coupled with solid melee action, gunplay, and driving to create a multi-faceted game that satisfies on all fronts.\n\nAs far as the aesthetic is concerned, Sleeping Dogs was never an exceptionally pretty game, but The Definitive Edition resolves some of its biggest visual faults and brings it more\nSleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition\n\nInspired by classic Hollywood and Asian cinema style action thrillers, Sleeping Dogs follows the story of detective Wei Shen as he infiltrates one of Hong Kong's notorious Triad crime syndicates.\n\n→ MUCH MORE\nin line with the PC version. On the Xbox One version I played, draw distances are vastly extended, textures are much sharper, and the overall gloss of the entire convincing recreation of Hong Kong is improved. It doesn't look like a native new-gen game by any stretch of the imagination, however - and it’s disappointing that the framerate stutters a bit when you're on foot running around and exploring, and the camera is still a bit messy in certain circumstances.\nAgain, though, I have to sing the praises of the story. Sleeping Dogs revolves around an undercover Hong Kong detective named Wei Shen. Shen – who's voiced wonderfully by Will Yun Lee in both English and Cantonese, is an interesting protagonist, one with true depth. Shen’s embedded himself with the Hong Kong underworld in order to unravel it from within, and watching him get sucked further and further into peril is fascinating. He's not a nameless hero or a loosely constructed anyman. He seems as real as a character in a movie.\nOf course, Sleeping Dogs has plenty for you if story isn't your thing. Its driving mechanics are on-point, with lots of different vehicles toting unique feels, from run-down motorcycles and hulking industrial trucks to supped-up sedans and expensive sports cars, and everything in between. Developer United Front Games has crafted a believable and incredibly busy version of Hong Kong that's simply a blast to drive around, explore, and uncover. Likewise, fighting -- whether with your fists, a melee weapon, or a firearm -- is also a lot of fun. There's a ton of collectibles to discover in addition to its meaty campaign, with tons of offshoot side quests to complete. In short, Sleeping Dogs is bound to keep you very busy not only when keeping up with its story, but in simply doing everything within it there is to do.\n\nContent-wise, the only notable difference between the old-gen version of Sleeping Dogs and the Definitive Edition is the inclusion of DLC. Both the supernatural-themed Nightmare in North Point and the cop-centric Year of the Snake are included, though I wasn't blown away by either. These separate packs -- which feel disjointed and aren't a part of the campaign -- don't stack up with the likes of GTA IV’s The Lost and the Damned or The Ballad of Gay Tony in terms of the amount of content, the quality of the new characters, or even new objectives. But, it's pretty cool that they're here in case you want to mess with them.\nTesting out Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition reminded me of a facet I hadn't thought much about since I last played it in 2012: its multi-tiered leveling system. This experience rubric provides Shen with rewards in three different categories: as a cop, as a member of the criminal Triad, and as a citizen of Hong Kong. Earning experience points in these three categories often conflicts with one another, and each category has unique skills associated with it. Delving into this system is a ton of fun, and it's really cool watching Shen get stronger based on how I chose to behave. Displaying disregard for the citizens of Hong Kong won't net you much love in your Face meter, for instance, but upholding the law will surely bring you plenty of cop experience points.\nAmazon	$24.99\nTrending Videos\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nBack in 2012, I called Sleeping Dogs one of the biggest -- and most pleasant -- surprises of the year. Two years later, the surprise has obviously dissipated, but that doesn't take away from what United Front Games achieved here. Playing the Definitive Edition reminded me how much I enjoyed its excellent story and characters, combat, and city, but also made me pine for a true new-gen sequel. The differences here might not be worth paying for a second time, but if you missed out on this great open-world action game the first time, you shouldn’t repeat that mistake.\n\nSleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition PC\n8.5\nGREAT\n\n+Same great game\n+Wonderful story\n+Fun driving\n+Good gunplay, melee\n– Wonky camera\n","May 22, 2015","true","4.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Follow the storyline, engage in side activities and explore the city of Hong Kong in all of its beauty with the updated graphics from the Definitive Edition equaling ensured entertainment.\n\n\nReview score: Essential Purchase\n\n\n⇓ Personal Review ⇓\n\n\nPro Beautiful world design & atmosphere\nGood story\nUpdated graphics\n(Limited) character customization\nPlenty of side objectives/activities\nIncludes DLC\nCon Vehicle handling\nWeapon combat\nSmall visual bugs from time to time\nSome DLC parts might not have received the full graphical update\nStorySet in the beautiful city of Hong Kong officer Wei Shen is tasked to bring down the local Triad gang Sun On Yee as an uncercover cop. He gets introduced into the mafia by his old friend Jackie Ma from where he starts working his way up to the top of the criminal circuit. Wei Shen is a loyal person, that loyalty brings him into trouble in both sides of the law because trying to do good takes it toll and possibly his sanity.\n\nThe story is well written and ensures that the protagonist doesn't climb up in the ranks too fast in an unrealistic manner. Obviously you shouldn't expect the drama, character relations and humor known from the GTA franchises in this game. Simply because this game depicts how it feels like to survive in a triad gang, not how to save your marriage or how to setup your own drug empire in the middle of a desert.\n\n\nGraphicsWith the Definitive Edition this game received a graphical update and boy does it show. If you ever want to visit Hong Kong, play this game first. Not that it will be a perfect tour guide, but it really captivates the atmosphere of this asian city with its many districts. Clean and modern looking in 'downtown' area, flashy neon signs and dense ugly looking high-rises in the poorer parts of the city and the many houseboats docked at the docking area. While playing this game I often felt like I was playing in a living, breathing world. That's something I didn't always have while playing a GTA game. Sure I've never been in Hong Kong or any asian city, but after playing this game it kinda feels like I did.\n\nThe graphical update also shows during cutscenes where it looks like this game is actually just two years old instead of the original four. There can be some graphical glitches here and there, i.e. npc's popping in/out of screen in front of your face and certain visual effects not always appearing while driving vehicles. But nothing too troublesome.\n\n\nGameplayI only played this game with a controller so I can't give any input on how it feels with mouse and keyboard. In general I'm very positive about it although there are some points which did annoy me. First off the driving mechanics could be better, even while playing with a controller I have to tab my stick constantly while making larger turns instead of one fluid movement. Bikes have a larger turning radius than cars and driving a car backwards is like driving on ice. But you'll get used to it eventually and thus won't be as big of a problem than in the beginning.\n\nThe combat in this game is clearly pointed towards melee combat. Reason being that in the triad culture most fights are fought with bare hands and less with fire arms like we're used to in the west. There are a lot of fighting moves to learn and they all transition perfectly with each other when fighting. The downside to this is that the weapon combat not as refined as in other games.","May 22","true","25.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NuclearByte/recommended/307690/","NuclearByte","NuclearByte","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NuclearByte/","104 products in account","Sleeping Dogs might just be a better GTA-style game than the GTA series itself. Now maybe it's just the location, but my oh my, Hong Kong is a lively and beautiful setting contrary to Los Santos in GTA V. Lights, cars, people... everywhere. However, what this game lacks is traffic. That might sounds stupid, but traffic, in my eyes, helps to convey the atmosphere of a busy city, as a New Yorker myself. Mind you this is only a personal request and the lack of which does not take away much. Traffic or no traffic, Hong Kong is still amazing.\n\nSpeaking of beauty, the textures, for the most part, are very detailed. I say for the most part because often you will find a stray texture that looks horrid in comparison to the ones around it, such as the door to Wei's apartment, as an example. The models for the main characters look great, especially when you can appreciate them up-close in real-time cutscenes. The voice-acting is great too, but the facial animations are pretty mediocre. Lips are synchronized and that's great and all, but the rest of the facial muscles aren't very expressive. Lighting effects convey a vibrant and realistic setting and the reflections are accurate and organic. And the rain.. (OH THE BEAUTIFUL RAIN)... I cannot get enough of the rain, let's just say that. Colors, wetness, all around me... I like it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).\n\nAnd while we're still talking about beauty let me just point out that Sleeping Dogs looks better and runs wayyy better than Watch Dogs. Sleeping Dogs gets an average of 40 fps on my GT 755M and that's on pretty high settings. This is a perfectly playable framerate and serves as a happy medium between 30 and 60 fps. There a few bugs like sometimes not being able to attach to cover for a few seconds in certain spots or a civilian getting stuck in geometry, but these don't really affect your gameplay experience.\n\nHong Kong offers a lot to do: you can buy pork buns, other food, get a massage, and do side quests like stealing a car for someone, distracting the cops, or other various activities. Cars offer great arcade-like style, but sometimes it could feel like you're driving on ice which sometimes gets annoying. But there's a mechanic I've never seen in another game: action hijack. This feature, which lets you hijack another vehicle while driving, emphasizes the Asian-action movie vibe this game successfully accomplishes.\n\nWhile on the topic of action movie, by every mechanic you can see that this is the style the developers were going for. The combat system is wonderfully satisfying and complex in that you can upgrade it to earn new moves and skills such as a leg break or a roundhouse kick. Another mechanic which emphasizes the action-movie vibe is bullet-time. Just like in Max Payne, you can enter slow-motion to do some next-level-human stuff to ultimately wreck your enemies. In Sleeping Dogs this can be triggered by vaulting over cover and aiming or by aiming at enemies while driving. In one side mission, more than 100 motorcyclists were shooting at me consecutively while I was riding shotgun in a car, delivering dope, as gangsters do.\n\nIn open world games, the story might be a trivial path for some players for its usual mediocrity. However, in Sleeping Dogs, this is not the case. The plot is surprisingly well-written and interesting. It involves Wei Shen, an undercover cop who is becoming too attached to his gangster role. The story, while not as amazing as, let's say: The Last of Us, is still much better than average and is certainly worth playing through.\n\nOverall, Sleeping Dogs is an open-world game done right. With an interesting story, great use of freedom, challenging yet satisfying combat system, bullet time, and decent driving, you can't go wrong. Sleeping Dogs is a standout in the genre and a game that melds many features in a manner which works.\n\n9.4/10","February 15, 2015","true","19.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RookLock/recommended/307690/","RookLock","d0c","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RookLock/","240 products in account","Sleeping Dogs fills an interesting niche in the sandbox "crime" genre of video games that seems so popular these days. The game mixes elements of a lot of different open world games together, largely successfully, but not without its flaws.\n\nPROS:\n-Engaging, deep storyline that lasts quite a while\n-Solid gameplay, melee combat is actually pretty fun until the end of the game\n-Game length is acceptable, can be longer if you play the DLC and side missions\n-Soundtrack is wonderful; sometimes you just want to sit inside of your car for a little while to let a song end before advancing in the game.\n-Outfits in game are pretty darn cool, especially with all the DLC included.\n-Just generally fun - I had a hard time putting this game down after getting into the main plot.\n-Memorable characters\n-Atmospheric environment - even if largely inaccurate.\n-It feels like a proper "RPG" in that you actually get into the role of the main character\n\nThere are also a lot of smaller issues that really detract from the overall experience. None of these are gamebreaking, but in hindsight they were pretty annoying.\n\nCONS:\n-Upgrade system makes no sense. You hoard melee move upgrades until the end of the game, only to unlock a powerful god move that makes melee combat irrelevant.\n-The concept of "Sandbox" seems lost on the developers; there's nothing to do aside from story missions except run away from the police who are incredibly easy to lose.\n-Side missions + DLC are lackluster at best. Especially the "Year of the Snake" DLC. I'd reccomend staying far away from that one if you want to preserve any good memories about the main plot.\n-You never need to upgrade your "Face" meter past rank 4 to get the valet; all other elements of that progression tree aren't particularily useful.\n-Game ends abruptly. I won't spoil it, but the last mission just sort of ends very suddenly.\n-The frequency at which guns become available after the half-way point is immersion breaking.\n-*SHOOTS TIRE* *GAME GOES SLOW MOTION* *SHOOTS OTHER TIRE* *GAME GOES IN SLOW MOTION* ad infintum\n-AI is easy. Really easy. You pretty much can't die if you're an average skilled player.\n-Graphics options are too limiting, especially for a "definitive" edition\n-Lots and lots of plot holes\n-No real villain except "Generic Hong Kong Triad Boss #40"\n-Your best friend dies ;-; RIP\n\nDespite all this, I still have to reccomend the game. Comparing all its flaws and its benefits, Sleeping Dogs is truly a fun game deserving of praise. There are issues, but they are acceptable - no game is free of flaws. I wish I had bought the base game when it was out, as a lot of the DLC made the game a heck of a lot less fun with the ease at which you obtain things. I did a single run through playing only small amounts of the side content, and it took me around 20 hours.\n\nI paid 10$USD for this game during the 2014 Steam Winter Sale.","January 30, 2015","true","22.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

There's just a couple glaring defects that makes this game unplayable for me.\n\nFirst, its openworld like a GTA, but the camera angles are atroshish!!! So trying to look at any one object in the game is frustrating. Which makes me not want to explore the world too much.\n\nSecond, the game clearly puts a premium on careful driving and rewards you for being careful every chance it gets. Once you understand this your fine. But the driving isnt all that fluid, its second rate to a GTA or even a Saints Row 3 or 4.\n\nThird, the combat, admittedly there is a lot to like here with all the combos. Think recent batman games, except the controls aren't as tight, so if you're in the middle of one move and someone tries to hit you they WILL hit you bc you can't couter in the middle of a move. But the big thing with the combat is YOU WILL DIE. Like recent Final Fantasy games where 1 out of every 10 fights or so you would run into something you'd never seen before and get killed by it. The same thing happens here to.\n\nGraphics are great.\nStory I hear is good to.\nBut as much as I want to, I just can't look past the gameplay.","November 13, 2015","false","9.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/recommended/307690/","codamadius","Frillin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/","139 products in account","Sleeping Dogs was, is and always will be one of my favorite games. Before I review, note that the description is lying. It doesn't include all availaible DLC's. But it does include two major ones.\n\nSo you're probably wondering whether Sleeping Dogs has anything to do with sleeping dogs. Nope. Just like Watch_Dogs has nothing to do with watching dogs. It might be a tad boring that way. Just a tad. You play as an undercover cop named Wei Shen who's job and goal is to take down the notorious Triad Sun On Yee gang in Hong Kong. The story plays out really well and characters have good voice acting and are memorable.\n\nIf you haven't played the original (which is unfortunately not available anymore on PC) you wouldn't notice the difference in graphics. The only two noticeable changes I saw is the lighting and amount of people on the streets; which already makes for a much more fun experience as it makes Hong Kong feel much more alive. There are some minor annoyances but nothing game breaking. Cars and motorcycles pinball off of walls and other cars and sometimes combos and counters don't register. But it doesn't happen often. I very highly recommend this game as it delivers unique combat on foot and in cars. Which reminds me....to those of you patiently waiting for Arkham Knight, this will fill the whole for a bit as you can unlock (basically) the Chinese Batmobile. It will gain upgrades as you do more missions with it.\n\nThat's the end of my review. This paragraph is for those curious to gain knowledge past playing the game. Sleeping Dogs is based on true events. How true? That I don't know but I do know this. The fictious Sun On Yee gang is based on a real Triad gang called the Sun Yee On. And the 18K is based on the Sun Yee On's real arch rivals the 14K. Sun Yee On was founded in 1919 by a man named Heung Chin and currently has around 55,000 members around the world; which is supposedly the highest count among the Triads. The Triads control extortion, drug trafficking, gambling and prostitution. Which is basically everything you encounter in the game. Their favored weapon of choice is the cleaver; which you see plenty of in the game as well. The Triads do not give any mercy to traitors and rats. They do indeed torture their victims before killing them. The term 'red pole' is also a real term used and is actually not a huge deal within their structure. 'Red poles' are enforcers; just one step up from being regular members. Before you were even in the Sun On Yee you were considered a 'Blue Lantern' which is the uninitiated. The initiated and regular members are considered '49ers'.\n\nThe characters you see in the game are based off of actual people; but the names were changed to protect them. There is also a reason why Wei Shen came from San Francisco. The Triads were really noticed by the US in 1977 due to the "Golden Dragon Massacre". The attack resulted in 5 deaths and 11 wounded. 2 of which were tourists and the other 9 weren't gang members either. This event led to the creation of the 'San Francisco Asian Gang Task Force'.\nPeople usually tend to think that videogames aren't educational and they teach you absolutely nothing. This is....the definitive way to prove those people wrong AHAHA....I'm sorry I couldn't resist. Now go enjoy being a sleeping dog for (San's) sake!","February 10, 2015","true","21.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No voy a hacer un review extenso sobre sus PRO y CONS por que simplemente no tengo tiempo. Im too busy playing the game hahaha\n\nEn este juego , tu eres WQei Shen, un policía infiltrado encuwbierto en el mundo de las Triadas de Hong Kong.\n\nEl setting thel juego es inmersivo, la historia está muy bien llevada. Los personajes tienen caracter propio, los detalles esteticos de la ropa que Wei Shen (el personaje principal) puede tener es entretenida y tematica. mas de algun guiño haciendo referencia a otros clasicos ligados a las Artes Marciales. El humor es atractivo y las misiones son versatiles y requieren de un monton de minipuzzles en algunos casos.\n\n...Lo mejorpor lejos, son lso combates a mano descubierta.\nel melee en este juego está muy bien logrado y las habilidades y mecanicas de combate hacen del juego extremadamente entretenido.\nfaltan muchos pequeños detalles que enriquecerian aun mas la aventura de jugar en esta ciudad pero para un juego con ya tantas cosas por hacer, seria pedirle ser perfecto.\n\nlos graficos del juego son hermosos. reflejos, niebla, las luces de hongkong de noche ...en medio de una lluvia... una pelea de esquina contra las triadas rivales, cuerpo a cuerpo, cojes el cuchillo, lo rompes en una serie de golpes letales contra un contrincante, sigues con una combinacion de patadas, saltas sobre otro enemigo, lo tiras a piso para darle el golpe final, pero ya te estan golpeando y debes bloquear desviando los golpes.\n\nno jugar este juego, aun que sea la campaña y sus misiones, es perderse el mejor referente estilo GTA que se ha creado hasta ahora.\n\n....espero ver mas de esta maravilla de juego, en una segunda version.

There's just a couple glaring defects that makes this game unplayable for me.\n\nFirst, its openworld like a GTA, but the camera angles are atroshish!!! So trying to look at any one object in the game is frustrating. Which makes me not want to explore the world too much.\n\nSecond, the game clearly puts a premium on careful driving and rewards you for being careful every chance it gets. Once you understand this your fine. But the driving isnt all that fluid, its second rate to a GTA or even a Saints Row 3 or 4.\n\nThird, the combat, admittedly there is a lot to like here with all the combos. Think recent batman games, except the controls aren't as tight, so if you're in the middle of one move and someone tries to hit you they WILL hit you bc you can't couter in the middle of a move. But the big thing with the combat is YOU WILL DIE. Like recent Final Fantasy games where 1 out of every 10 fights or so you would run into something you'd never seen before and get killed by it. The same thing happens here to.\n\nGraphics are great.\nStory I hear is good to.\nBut as much as I want to, I just can't look past the gameplay.","November 13, 2015","false","9.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Hong Kong oozes atmosphere and character, and everywhere you look is another homage to Hong Kong action flicks. The combat hits the exact right level of complexity and difficulty, and the city is fun to traverse. Plenty of collectables that give rewards for grabbing them, and show up on the minimap when you finish certain missions (I have a pet peeve of games with lots of collectables but no proper way to track them down). Wei Shen is a likeable protagonist, and the story is great. The DLCs are also pretty well done.

Unfortunately for me, I got this as GTAV was coming out :/. I did however play for a bit and so far this game shows an insane amount of promise. Excellent attention to every single detail in the genre. If you are a fan of Saint's Row, Grand Theft Auto or any open world game like those, this is more than right up your alley. You should ask your mom to slap you if you haven't at least tried this. All in all, I give it 4/5 stars.\n\nPros:\nHoly crap its detailed! Even down to the combat system!\nVisually pleasing without the bloated system resource hogging of other *cough*rand*cough*eft*cough*auto games.\nIntricate gang system and a wonderful blend of RPG elements to keep you on your toes and progress the story.\n\nCons:\nProbably in one of the only game genres capable of being described as a title instead of genre, and this is not the title associated if you get my drift.\nSomewhat clunky camera angles\nNon-standard keyboard controls, i just got used to them. I am not sure if you can change the keybindings.\nPossibly offensive to certain ethnicities.","May 20, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Rebel spaceships,\nstriking from a hidden base, have won their first\nvictory against the evil Galactic Empire.\n\nDuring the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal\nsecret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the\nDeath Star, an armored space station with enough\npower to destroy an entire planet.\n\nPursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess\nLeia races home aboard her starship, custodian of\nthe stolen plans that can save her people and\nrestore freedom to the galaxy...\n\nThe awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total\neclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny\nsilver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers\nfrom the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed\nby a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly\nlaserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing\nthe main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY\n\nAn explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-\nD2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way\nthrough the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are\nold and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His\nface is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.\nThreepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of\nhuman proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic\nsurface of an Art Deco design.\n\nAnother blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDid you hear that? They've shut down\nthe main reactor. We'll be destroyed\nfor sure. This is madness!\n\nRebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in\nthe main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe're doomed!\n\nThe little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that\nonly another robot could understand.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThere'll be no escape for the Princess\nthis time.\n\nArtoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as\nloud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment\nare heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat's that?\n\nEXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE\n\nThe Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade\nRunner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the\nunderside dock of the giant Imperial starship.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n\nThe nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a\ntremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and\na score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make\ntheir way into the smoke-filled corridor.\n\nIn a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with\nlaserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns\ncreating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck\nbehind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers\nwho scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered\narms and faces.\n\nAn explosion hits near the robots.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI should have known better than to\ntrust the logic of a half-sized\nthermocapsulary dehousing assister...\n\nArtoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages\naround the two hapless robots.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY\n\nA death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.\nThe tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone\nfigure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations\nwho looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy\nhair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable\nlad with a prize-winning smile.\n\nA light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a\nlarge battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the\ndesert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided\nby a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot\nappears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.\nA bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and\nhe instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his\nutility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying\nthe heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired\nLandspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet\nabove the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the\ntiny robot to follow him.\n\nLUKE\nHurry up! Come with me! What are you\nwaiting for?! Get in gear!\n\nThe robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and\nsmoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his\narms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps\ninto his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum\nmadly.\n\nINT.

Because the game has 2 big flaws that prevent me to consider this (i completed it without rushing) a truly enjoyable experience:\n1-The driving mechanincs are bad, the awful and totally unrealistic vehicle handling (and dont get me started on the silly "ramming" mechanic) and the ridicolous damage model (cars and motorcicle are almost indistructible, taking huge amount of enemy fire or crashing at 250 km/h on concrete wall without consequences, but then you got one bullet on the tire and your car immediately explode in huge fireball for some reason). That's particulary annoying considering this game has A LOT of driving related mission, and games with much less focus on those like Mafia 2 or even L.A. Noire did an incredible better job when it comes to driving.\n2-The story (the last part in particular). The story actually starts off very interesting, and it remain so for the first half of so, they truly manage to get the player the impression of Wei's conflicting loyalities, you also get a nice unexpected shock moment that makes things even more interesting but from that moment to end, the story become one of the most predictable and boring i've seen in a while.\nYou know when a crime or thriller movie, seems so much predicatable and obvious you are sure that there is going to be some huge plot twist near the end? Well this game second half of the story gives exactly that same impression, but in the end you get no plot twist and everything turns out to be exactly as lame as it seemed to be. Your friend that got huge deathflags all over himself actaully die, the bad and unlikable superior actually turn out to be stupid, and corrupt, the characters that are reasonable and nice to you, turn out to be really good people, they also get the happy ending to make it more clear, in the end, extremely disappointing. Also your enemies are some of the most uniteresting and flat characters i've seen in while,"huh watch me i'm so violent and evil just for the sake of it!!!! i'm also stupid and short sighted (but somehow i became the most powerfull and respected Triad boss of Hong Kong) I'm such a bad guy!!!! do you hate me already???"\n\nIn the end this game got quite some nice aspects to it, but, if you are not fan of the setting (that's actually very nicely done) i'd say there far superior alternatives when it comes to this genre (especially if you are looking for a good story-driven title, coughMafia2cough) that are much more worthy of your time.","June 23, 2015","false","20.8"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

That doesn't mean I like this game, though.\n\nThis game's a horrible PC port.\n\nPros:\n- Fantastic melee combat system.\n- You're playing as a cop. (Or is that a con? I guess neither. At least it's different than GTA V.)\n- Longer story than GTA V.\n- Voice lines that does not have at least one n-word in every single sentence.\n- Great voice acting.\n\nCons:\n- Annoying mouse acceleration that you can't switch off.\n- You have to hold a keyboard key rather than just press it to be able for the game to recognize that you're pressing it.\n- You can't change controls.\n- Limited graphics settings. You can't even turn VSync off.\n- Takes long to exit a motorcycle because you have to take your helmet off first.\n- It's really hard to get any weapons. To get a gun, you have to find one hidden across the map, or kill a police officer.\n\nI've played this game for a little over four hours. I think Grand Theft Auto V is much better, but a few aspects of this game are amazing and much better than what GTA V has to offer.\nAlthough, there are too many cons to really like this game. I only bought it because it was on sale.\nIt looked good from all the positive reviews, but then after I bought the game, I saw that many people had similar problems as me.\n\nIt's a good game, but not a great game.\nIt could do so much better.","May 27, 2015","false","5.2"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","7","16","2","12"

Or when you are nearly unable to chase down an old truck on a motorcycle, and you barely can catch up to it. But later in the game, when you drive the truck, it is so slow every other vehicle could overtake you... well, WHY?!?\n\nI like the characters and the story, but after the tenth time a guy runs away and you have to chase him down and beat the crap out of him and his friends, it really gets old really fast.\n\nOh, and attempting to DRIVE away from the cops?

Especially the new density improvements making mini Hong Kong come alive and bustle with crowds.\n\nPerformance is good, although sadly so far AMD Crossfire doesn't seem to be working for me. Even so even with a single card, the game can easily be maxed out at 3440x1440 with AA set to Normal aka FXAA. I have not seen any improvement using the high AA settings at my resolution.\n\nWord of warning though, if you use an Ultrawide monitor or multimonitor setup, all cinematics are rendered in 16:9. Resulting in pillar boxing.\n\nNone of which detracts from the game, and it is very good. The story is compelling, and there is a variety of sub missions, and favours which can be done. There is a small RPG element, allowing you to visually customise your character via unlocking or buying new clothing. Along with upgrading skills. Which are in three main categories. Police, Triad, and Martial arts.\n\nThey all complement each other, and levels are gain in each by doing their respective faction's missions.\n\nIf you already own the original and enjoyed it, but you're missing the DLC and want those. The Upgrade cost to the new version is easily worthwhile, and you gain the new improvements with it.\n\nFor new players I would happily recommend this as a sandbox action game, with a very good story, and great gameplay.","October 10, 2014","true","21.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

The story goes pretty stereotypically from there based on the Triad background, but it is so fun along the way.\n\nThe world size is pretty big, and the amount of things to do is pretty fun.  I will also applaud the game for the focus on hand-to-hand combat mechanics rather than gun-play, as it makes it much more interesting most of the time.
