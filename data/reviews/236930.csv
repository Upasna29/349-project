The Blackwell games managed to stick the landing completely and Epiphany makes for one of the best conclusions I've ever seen in a video game.\n\nDo yourself a favor and buy the whole series right now and start from the beginning. The series grows and gets better with each installment. Epiphany is just a great culmination of everything that came before it mixing great writing and logical puzzles into an overall fantastic game.\n\nEpiphany has quickly become one of my new favorite games. I also would say that The Blackwell Series as a whole easily rivals the adventure game classics. Fans of the series should buy this game ASAP and for those who haven't played them I reiterate to just buy the whole series now if you're interested, you’re in for a memorable ride. I definitely won't be forgetting it anytime soon.","April 24, 2014","true","6.1"," 76 of 79 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","76","79","0","0"

You've been prepared for this final act throughout the whole series, and when you face it... you will know there could be no better ending. It is not the ending you want. It is not the ending you asked for. You keep whispering to yourself, even screaming in your head that this shouldn't happen! Yet you know that there is no better ending that this title deserves. We go out with a bang. It leaves you with a bittersweet sensation. We have to acknowledge that it is our time to say goodbye.\n\nA couple months after the events of Blackwell Deception, we learn that Rosa has established a symbiotic relationship with Detective Durkin. She has become a silent informant for Durkin, as he helps Rosa to reach inside information on cases that she works on. Durkin doesn't ask questions, Rosa doesn't impose answers. We catch up on this partnership when Rosa is sent to investigate a rundown hotel by Durkin. A casual enough "ghost whispering" case occurs and finds resolution by Rosa and Joey's already tried abilities. Just as Rosa was leaving the scene, she witnesses a dreadful murder! The next day, not a word is spoken on the news about the said murder and Rosa's suspicions do raise by the minute. Does the police cover up the story? Why? It is time for us to chase another mystery... Maybe our last.\n\nIn this final game, we encounter many old friends, enemies and familiar bystanders. Sometimes we smile, sometimes we pout, other times we wish that we'd be capable of throwing a punch through our screen. We live through our saddest, happiest, weirdest, cruelest encounters yet. But in the end, what rests with us the most are no other than Rosa and Joey. We witnessed their growth, both in character and relationship step by step. Now we are able to see that Rosa has fulfilled her potential, and we can finally claim that we know who Joey Mallone is. They are the kind of characters that you'll keep carrying with you long after their stories are told. Rest is "a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing".\n\nGameplay wise, the game contains the longest playtime compared to all other installments as you can expect. There are many things to reveal, explore or dabble with. I'd say one play through would take around 8-10 hours, which would completely worth the full price. We are already familiar with all options and controls that the game has in store for us. Nothing changed. If I were to complain about one thing, I'd say there was some relevantly periodic backtracking which concerns casual visits to police station. Aside, I am silent on the complaint department.\n\nThere are thousands of words that I wish to write about this masterpiece of an adventure game, but sadly the contents elude me as I ponder on. This was it. The one big finale. The grand exit. Literally no more Blackwell games to wait for. I found myself holding my breath as the story unwraps its countless unexplained mysteries one by one. Each crisp of information blew my mind. Each answer that I have been given, I anticipated for more. Flashbacks, metaphors, oddly exchanged dialogues, the gravity of choice and the collective unconscious; they all came back to present us the finale that we were waiting for. And that finale, was excellent!\n\nJust as I realized "what the hell was happening", the credits started to roll. I felt tears filling my eyes, and I cannot say this for a lot of games. Well done, Dave Gilbert. Well done and well played! I bow before you! I'll be missing everything about this game.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 25, 2015","true","9.6"," 47 of 56 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","47","56","2","4"

If you've never played a Blackwell game before you really should start with The Blackwell Legacy (or even The Shivah, which ties-in) because this is the fifth and final part of a story arc, and it just won't mean anything to you unless you've done the others. It is a fairly typical Wadjet Eye game - good characters, a deep, rich plot, great music and some lovely art that mixes modern with retro styles - and it comes with the flaws you expect from adventure games, i.e. moon logic and a rigid progression structure... ah, whatever. It doesn't matter.\n\nIf you liked the earlier Blackwell titles, this will cap the story for you and you just... have to. Seriously.

One. The only one that I could find anyway. I only really looked for it because I had a slight difficulty with something I missed. I'd seen what I needed to do earlier, I just didn't remember, probably because I'd run out of coffee quite a while ago.\n\nAnything I could rag on this game would pretty much be nitpicking. In all honesty, if this game made any screw-ups, they are no worse than certain AAA titles that get stupidly enormous amounts of undeserved praise. The ending wasn't perfect, I kinda saw it coming, but it gripped me and it didn't ♥♥♥♥ me off. Granted, yes, a few holes were left unfilled, but ultimately they can somewhat be ignored due to the way things were wrapped up being quite final. It did seem a tad abrupt, though, but I've seen far worse endings, believe me.\n\nThe gameplay tries to draw elements from all the previous titles and succeeds rather well. I felt it was a bit of a challenge without being completely convoluted and irrational as torturing your neighbor's dog for no reason, so I'm happy. At no point did I really need a guide, but nothing was excessively easy. This and the last game both did this pretty well, unlike Convergence which felt rather too straightforward to me.\n\nMaybe the series could have kept going, wrapped a few more loose-ends up, but overall I think this was a fine conclusion to an excellent series. It's a shining light at the end of it all.","October 27, 2014","true","17.5"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","32","33","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LTNetjak/recommended/236930/","LTNetjak","LT Netjak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LTNetjak/","273 products in account","This review stands as a full review of the entire Blackwell series. I was introduced to this series a meager four days ago. I was intrigued by the old-school point and click "talkies" I had grown up with on old CD-ROMs from Fate of Atlantis through the Monkey Island series all the way to the newer Telltale Games products. I hardly knew what I was getting myself into.\n\nThe Blackwell series stars the Blackwell family, mainly Rosa and introducing her Aunt, Lauren, in Unbound. At some point in the past, their Grandmother suddenly became saddled with a ghost, Joey, who was her spirit guide. Unable to take the pressure (limiting plot spoilers), she died and Joey passed onto the aunt. It turned out he is a spirit guide, destined to guide Mediums like the series protaganist Rose to lead lost spirits to the final destination.\n\nThis is where the puzzle element comes into play. Like most adventure games, you interact with the environment through investigation, item manipulation and conversing with other characters. The first game in the series, Legacy, is fairly light on puzzles and is easily completed, but the series quickly grows into a satisfying old-school adventure title as the series progresses. Epiphany is the masterstroke of the series in this regard, with multi-threaded and complex puzzle threads that still fit well within the realm of logic.\n\nHowever, where the series truly shines is in the storytelling. The writing, character development and accompanying voice acting is near perfection. The series easily hooks you into the characters and makes you care about them. The slow reveal of the history, feelings, pain and emotion of each character over each of the five games easily drew me into the Blackwell world. With Epiphany, the entire series wrapped up in a way few games, movies or even television shows could ever hope - satisfying, even if bittersweet.\n\nThere are a couple of hiccups in the game, primarily in code bugs in Unbound that cause voice tracks to trigger improperly, one being an ugly spoiler mid-way through that gave away part of a conversation from the game's finale, but otherwise is solidly coded and well designed. The graphics may also be a bit of a put-off to more modern gamers since it is intentionally created in a low resolution, non-widescreen format to mimic the old CRT monitors some of us older gamers were stuck with nearly two decades ago. But the artwork presented in close-ups, photos, desktop backrounts, and other areas is fantastic and feels alive.\n\nI whole heartedly recommend the entire five game series. Go back to the Blackwell Legacy and pick it up from there and don't stop until you finish up Epiphany. The game is a well build emotional ride with solid puzzle mechanics fit for a good old school adventure game. From someone used to adventure games being the high-energy comedy like Day of the Tentacle, The Blackwell series was a huge surprise. Though the surprise was pleasant and I believe it will be so for everyone else who gives this a try.","April 25, 2014","true","6.3"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/terra_ex/recommended/236930/","terra_ex","Terra_Ex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/terra_ex/","1940 products in account","The biggest and best game of the Blackwell series. If you've played other games in the series you'll know what you're getting into, but to put it simply this is Wadjet Eye's finest work to date - a point and click game that I can easily recommend alongside classics in the genre.\n\nOnce again, players take on the roles of both Rosa Blackwell and Joey Mallone, their job is, as always to help lost souls move on, and as before there are a large number of ghosts that need saving, each with a different story to tell. Unlike previous games, all the ghosts in this game tie directly into the primary overarching narrative, adding considerable gravitas to proceedings and helping to shake things up. There is some assumption of prior knowledge of the series, the game doesn't waste time retreading how Rosa and Joey do their jobs but instead dives right into the main course. In terms of gameplay. The dual characters mechanic returns once again and players must make use of both Rosa's and Joey's different abilities to solve puzzles and overcome dialogue based obstacles throughout the game. Puzzles are for the most part fairly simple, there's no hair tearing moments and bizarre solutions to impede your progress - for the most part everything is pretty logical. The clue system from previous games returns, requiring players to combine topics/clues from their in game notes page to determine links and hypothesise potential solutions to problems. This works well for the most part, with Joey again serving as an in-game hints system that the player can utilise as much or as little as they desire. The focus here is very much on the story, there are also plenty of references to previous games for fans yet the game is also strong enough to stand on its own.\n\nIn terms of game length, the game feels longer than previous entries, I think Wadjet has finally hit upon the optimal length for its games with Epiphany after previous entries were criticised for their short length. The narrative and writing quality are consistent throughout, Wadjet Eye have been going from strength to strength with this series and Epiphany is no exception. I did notice a new mechanic in play early in the game, where the two leads would spontaneously begin short, unprompted banters discussing their current location, etc, not unlike the party banter systems employed in several rpgs. Sadly this fizzled out quite quickly and is only seen in the first third of the game.\n\nThe artwork in Epiphany is fantastic throughout, it's building on a similar aesthetic to Blackwell Deception but everything is more detailed and beautifully rendered in pixel art. They've found a really great style to use (and artist to bring it to life) and they neatly sidestep the animation issues that many other modern point and clicks exhibit because of it. Hoping to see future games maintain the same style and level of quality.\n\nThe music is nice and fits well with the tone of the game for the most part, it did seem to be a little on the quiet side this time around and is very much in the background for most of game. In terms of other audio - Wadjet's voice acting on the technical side of things has come a long way now, there's none of the issues the plagued earlier entries to be found here which is great. All series regulars reprise their roles in Epiphany and they all give solid performances.\n\nIn terms of story, this being the final game in the series, Epiphany wraps up the Blackwell series and answers most of the questions you might have had. I won't lie though, I wish we'd have seen some more entries to the series before the finale.\n\nSadly there is one significant dropped plot arc which occurs (or rather should have occurred) between Deception and Epiphany that I felt hurt the continuity between those two games somewhat. Based on the ending of Deception and where Epiphany picks up it felt that we'd skipped a step in the story of Rosa and Joey and just leapt from there to the series finale, which is an unusual and unfortunate misstep. Aside from this one issue the series as a whole flows nicely from one game to the next. I won't talk about the ending here as I think that's something best experienced and I don't want to colour anyone's view on it, suffice it to say I felt it was a fitting ending but it's not the one I would have gone with.\n\nThere's always been a certain sense of familiarity with the Blackwell series and the protagonists thankless task of helping the dead move on all the while the hustle and bustle of New York. There's something that's quite grounded in reality about the series that makes it quite endearing and relaxing to play, this is underlined through Dave Gilbert's commentaries that are embedded within each game you really get a sense that you're experiencing these locations through his memories and the series as a whole just really has a sort of personal touch that's difficult to describe and I don't often see/feel in most games. That, married with the real world setting really heightened the experience for me across the Blackwell series.\n\nUltimately, Blackwell Epiphany is highly recommended, as a fan of the series this was a deeply satisfying game to play. If you've never played the Blackwell series before, or if it's sat in your Steam backlog, start with Legacy and work forwards from there - if you're a fan of the genre, you won't regret it.","April 27, 2014","true","15.7"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

Enter Joey Mallone, a ghost and spirit guide tied to the female members of the Blackwell family. When Rosa's aunt, Lauren Blackwell, passes after being in a coma for decades, Joey is 'released' from Lauren and enters Rosa's life. Details are revealed throughout the five installments of the Blackwell series regarding the female members of the Blackwell family, how Joey came to be, what happened to Aunt Lauren to trap her in a comatose state, etc. Together, Rosa and Joey seek out and help tormented ghosts trapped in the physical world cross over to "the other side" throughout the series.\n\nIn BLACKWELL EPIPHANY, the fifth and final installment of the game series.\nRosa’s now fully embraced her quest to find trapped spirits in New York and help them to move on.  We finally discover the origins of the two most prominent characters of the series, and learn a little more about a shadowy organization that is the antithesis of everything Rosa and Joey stand for. Many answers to things will be brought to light which have been hanging over the series since it's inception. The Blackwell series has always been focused on human stories, which has made this series so special. It definitely stands strong on its own merits with the incredible writing of Dave Gilbert.\n\nEPIPHANY begins and immediately takes a serious dark turn when people's souls are ripped apart right in front of Rosa and Joey's eyes. And there's the ghost of a little girl which hits Rosa and Joey harder than others -- but, for the most part, not treated as all that different or special than the others along their journey.  Death is unfair. Rosa and Joey know and accept that. It's the race to get the little girl's ghost ‘safe’ before whatever is destroying souls can take her death as easily as it took her life. There are other ghosts to be dealt with, too. From the TV news anchor desperate to leave her past behind, to the brother and sister striving to deal with childhood abuse.\n\nHow does one end such a phenomenal series? When you get to the last act, everything kicks into high gear heading for the finish line ... the grand finale. And, wow! What a finale! The very last scene is ... dare I say ... perfect!\nThanks, Dave, for such a wonderful experience over the past decade with the Blackwell series. Kudos!!!\n\n(To enjoy the story at it's best, the games should be played in order of creation. 1st 'LEGACY' -- 2nd 'UNBOUND' which explores the events and time that Lauren Blackwell and Joey were working together in the 1970s (while Unbound turned out, unintentionally, to be a prequel to Legacy, it should be played after Legacy to not only help enlighten the player as to what happened in the first installment, but also gives the player clues as to what is coming in future installments) -- 3rd 'CONVERGENCE' which takes place about six months after the events in Legacy -- 4th 'DECEPTION' which takes place some time after Convergence -- and 5th 'EPIPHANY', which is the final installment in the Blackwell game series.)","January 8, 2015","true","35.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/recommended/236930/","MakoSipper","MakoSipper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/","3792 products in account","Overview: Blackwell Epiphany is the fifth and final installment in my favorite point-and-click adventure series in this century. The Blackwell series definitely has a special place in my heart. Epiphany tells the story of Rosangela Blackwell, an experienced medium (aka Bestower), and Joey, a spirit stuck with the Blackwell family, and they both go about solving mysteries in NYC and investigating cases related to ghosts who couldn't move on to the afterlife.\n\nPros:\nDespite having ghosts and all, characters are very realistic, well-developed, deep, interesting, funny, and loveable\nThe story is interesting and solving the mysteries is really fun (despite the whole game being really on the depressive side)\nGreat and unpredictable ending to the series--I've read some bad reviews about it, but I thought it was awesome\nEverything you've ever wanted to know about the series will probably be answered\nThe puzzles are kept to a sober level of difficulty, but there's no handholding, either--if you're used to the series, you shouldn't get stuck or need any guides\nThe dialogues and the voice acting are really outstanding, I can't stress it enough.\nHas a very interesting mechanic in which you combine clues instead of items to solve puzzles, and that works really well with the investigation theme. This feature is even improved in this game, as good as in Deception or probably slightly better.\nOnce again, you get to control both Rosa and Joey (whose roll is even bigger then in Deception), adding a lot to the puzzles\nLike in Deception, having the smartphone to do research and calls makes the game flow even better than the first three games\nReally gorgeous retro graphics, always going up in quality throughout the games\nBGM is awesome\nCons:\nNo in-game way to change the resolution\nAlt+tabbing and alt+escing kinda screw the game (keyboard stops being recognized, some dialogues get cut down in a split second and you can't listen to/read them anymore), so you'll probably have to quit it and load it again to solve this issue\nA few minor inconsistencies, like characters not reaching the conclusion at the right time, or combining clues not working until after it was reasonable for it to work and stuff like that (most of those were indirectly justified in the commentaries, like "this was added in the last week of production" or something like that)\nIT'S OVER!!! =(\nBought on: Steam Store for R$ 11,19 (US$ 5.99 in the US at that time). I would've bought it last holiday sales even if it had no discount (and I wouldn't be disappointed).\n\nVerdict: This is the last game in the series. Epiphany is considerably better, deeper, longer, more clever and more emotional than its prequels. Definitely the most serious, depressing (in a good way) and enjoyable game in the series. It's really fun and brings you back to old-school adventure games, while still bringing fresh elements to the table. Epiphany also imerses you in this intricate plot in a way like no other Blackwell game does (and they were already good at that). If you're into classic point-and-click games, you most definitely have to try it! Don't forget to play the other titles first! While you could play Epiphany as a standalone game, you'll miss a lot if you haven't played the other games. So don't do it! Start at the beginning.

The ghost stories are all exciting, touching, and presented with great writing skill. The framing plot knows how to push you forward, but in a subtle way. The characters are as deep as ever with great dialogues.\nThe puzzles are a lot closer now to a usual adventure game: they are far from being realistic, but they also offer better game play and balanced difficulty, if you can get yourself into the adventure game mindset.\n\nThe majority the game follows the well-known path: you find ghosts, learn the tragedy behind their deaths, and send them to the afterlife. All of this is wrapped in a larger and disturbing mystery without all the forced conspiracy nonsense of Deception.\nWe have a brand new kind of problem instead: the end of the plot not just jumps the shark, but it plays hopscotch on a sea of sharks. The somewhat believable dramatic storyline suddenly turns into the climax of a really bad 90s anime with meaningless pseudo-philosophy, godly powers, and an antagonist who, naturally, wants to kill everything.\nIt’s a shame, really. The game shows creative genius all over. Too bad it lost all traces of credibility in the end, dragging down an entire series with another botched final.","July 7, 2015","true","7.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","3"

Every scrap of story left hanging from earlier parts is brought back and wrapped up here, rewarding you for sticking with it to the end. The production values are better than ever, and when I started it I hoped I would be here saying it was perfect.\n\nIt might be because I played them all back to back, but I didn’t like how transparent the story structure felt. The second game established a structure which all the later games followed. This worked for the second and third game. But by the fourth it felt old, and doing it again for the final game made it weaker. I don’t want to overdo this point though, it didn’t by any means ruin the game for me. It’s just one of a few things that made it not as good as it could have been.\n\nAnother weak point is the solutions to a few of the puzzles. A common point and click problem: the pixel hunting. In this game there are loads of locations, some with busy visual styles. There’s a couple times where I wanted to rip my hair out because I overlooked a 4 pixel thing on a table right next to a pile of identical stuff I couldn’t interact with.\n\nI also didn’t like how it ended. Parts of the third act were very exciting and made me giddy. But how it ultimately ends made me go “oh ok”, instead of jumping off the walls in excitement as I was hoping. That said, it wasn’t bad! I feel myself warming up to the ending as I’m writing about it. I still very much recommend this series to anyone who is on the fence about playing it. As point and click adventures go, this series, and this final chapter, are easily among the better ones.","June 21, 2015","true","4.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Things quickly spin into an even more grim situation, where bad times seem contagious and things are steadily getting less and less good, both for our plucky protagonist and, eventually, all of New York City.\n\nOf the entire Blackwell series, I'd say this round's change of sprite art is my favorite, and the portraits are up there in the ranking as well. Puzzles felt a bit easier this time around, but it could just be having gotten used to Blackwell logic after already finishing four other games in the series.

And it's impossible to talk about this game individually outside the context of the entire series.\n\nThe Blackwell games are the kind of games you enjoy while sipping on a smooth whiskey and listening to slow jazz. Luckily, the games' soundtracks provide some amazing jazz, so you only have to worry about the whiskey.\n\nThe art is a purposefully pixelated retro style, which works because the gameplay and philosophy behind it is very much in tune with the visually similar point-and-click adventure games of the 90's.\n\nThe puzzles can be occasionally obtuse and frustrating, but for the most part once you learn the mechanics you'll know what to do next. And if you don't, the one tried-and-true adventure game formula of exhausting all conversation options and trying to combine every item with everything interactable will inevitably work.\n\nWhere the game really shines is the voice acting. Dave Gilbert continually got very talented people to work with him and the games are so much better for it. Both Abe Goldfarb and Rebecca Whittaker deserve to win awards for their multiple performances.\n\nThe series just kept getting better and better, making Epiphany easily the best entry of them all. The story really shines when it gets dark and serious, and Epiphany succeeds tremendously there. I'm so glad the writing didn't shy away from some really rough places and concepts. Bravo for taking a risk and going there.\n\nThis game is like the icing on the layered cake of the whole series. Its creators should be very proud of it. You won't find better on the indie adventure game scene.

It doesn't tie up every loose end, and not every plot development makes quite as much sense as you might like, but as a chance to reconnect with these characters and see them through one last, sweeping adventure, it is not to be missed. The voice acting and pixel-art backgrounds have never been better, and the story itself is longer by far than any of the previous entries, giving you chance to really lose yourself in the spectral mysteries and companionable snark of the Blackwell world.  If you enjoyed the other Blackwell games, it is unthinkable that you will not get a tremendous kick out of this one.\n\nQ. I liked some of the other Blackwell games, but not all. Which features does this use?\nA.You can still swap between Rosa and Joey, you can use inventory objects on the outside world, and you can once again combine entries in your notes to make fresh deductions (a feature I deeply missed). The art is SVGA-ish pixel art, as opposed to the cartoony drawings in some versions of earlier games, and as I say, it's probably the best art in the series (though the oddly stiff walk animation from Deception seems to have lingered just a bit).\n\nQ. Do I have to play the other games first?\nA. Technically no- most major plot points are recapped or alluded to in the game. You will, at the very least, be able to follow the gist of the story. But why punish yourself that way? The earlier games are funny, clever, and quick to play, and give the events of Epiphany a real impact. To say nothing of the countless grins and gasps you get from recognizing some long-forgotten plot development suddenly blossom on the screen.

This beloved series that just keeps growing on ya! I'm extremely impressed by the way that Dave Gilbert developed this story. By the end of the whole series I felt very connected to Rosa, Joey, and the cast of characters from the entire series. It is also amazing to see the games improve as they progressed, getting rid of elements that detracted from the game and replacing them with elements that helped push the game along. I'm not much of a mystery/clue finding type of gamer, so if a game series is able to get me to enjoy something that I'm not that into then the game is pretty special. For this fifth and final installment here are some of the pro's and con's of the game.\n\nPro's: The storyline is marvelous in this game, lets just say everything wraps up rather nicely. I absolutely love Rosa and Joeys relationship and think that the actor who plays Joey does an amazing job and yes the hilarious banter is still there. The puzzles were fun, as usual. I was glad that this game had some different puzzles that the other four games had not done before and the continued ability to switch between Rosa/Joey. The length of the game was good, comparable to Convergence and Deception (Unbound and Legacy both seemed a little short).\n\nCon's: One word, the art. Still hate it and always will! I also think it is funny that I love and hate the consistency issues. I think that making the necessary changes from game to game is a good thing to do, but it really makes you feel like they should have done that in the previous games and can be a little jarring when Joey is drawn different, the style of music changes, the mechanics change, or the voice acting is different.\n\nAs I've said in many of the other reviews, some of these games by themselves are not the greatest (cough...Blackwell Legacy), but if you can get through the first boring chapter in the book then you will find a pretty amazing series one that will not disappoint.\n\nBlackwell Legacy: 6/10\nBlackwell Unbound: 8/10\nBlackwell Convergence: 7.6/10\nBlackwell Deception: 8.2/10\nBlackwell Epiphany: 8.5/10\n\nBlackwell Series: 8.2/10\n\nCheck out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!","May 16","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

You can pretty much expect more of the same as before - there are a bunch of cases to solve, and a bigger mystery to unravel.\n\nIf you've not played any of the previous Blackwell games...Then you should before playing this one, otherwise things will make no sense at all, because almost everything mentioned in this episode draws upon bits of the story mentioned in previous episodes.\n\nSummaryTo be honest I expected a better ending.

The conclusion to everything. And, may I add, a magnificent conclusion. Epiphany mantains everything positive from Blackwell's previous instalments, and even manages to improve them, by a good margin.\n\nGraphically speaking, there's been no evolution whatsoever. And that's pleasant, due to the already suiting, and fitting art style. Besides, after four games, one gets used to the low resolution, and pixel graphics, that are not a negative aspect, at all. There are still a bunch of achievements that add replayability to the game, as with the previous titles.\n\nImagine if you grabbed all the action scenes from Legacy, Unbound, Convergence and Deception. Epiphany seemed to have about the same action and suspense as all the other games combined, if not more. That's amazing. And justifies the price tag, as well. As such, the title is also the lengthier of the five. Voice acting is still suprisingly good, and I will miss the sound of Rosa's and Joe's voice. Soundtrack is still a beautiful mix of Jazz, and the same theme is always being played, in different takes.\n\nConcluding this not so long review, as I can never write about everything I experience through games, I feel like I will miss the Blackwell series dearly. I will miss to send ghosts to meet their peace. I will miss to hear both Rosa and Joe talking to each other, joking in the process. This was quite a ride.

While Blackwell Epiphany was my first experience with the series, it was clear in no time that the writers at Wadjet Eye Games were raising the stakes in Epiphany higher than they ever dared to raise them before. With guest appearances by characters from way back from the first game, Blackwell Epiphany powerfully and poetically concludes a game series which has lasted nearly a decade.\n\nBlackwell Epiphany is a point-and-click adventure where players control two protagonists (Rosalinda "Rosa" Blackwell and her ghost sidekick, Joey) who are tasked with finding restless spirits and guiding them to the afterlife to finally find peace. While Epiphany does feature a few puzzles, a staple of the point-and-click genre, the majority of "puzzles" involve uncovering facts by grinding characters for information, and conducting online research through Rosa's smartphone. About halfway through the game I fell into the rhythm of searching online, checking with the police, and asking suspects about a new piece of information I had uncovered. By the end of Epiphany I felt like I was ready to be a paranormal investigator myself.\n\nBoth Joey and Rosa come with their own set of abilities which they can use in the hunt for information. Rosa comes equipped with her smartphone, which is the information hub of the game, and an always-warm cup of coffee that is used a handful of times during puzzles. Joey, being a ghost, has the unique ability to traverse through solid walls and locked doors, allowing Joey to discover information that Rosa may not have direct access to. Joey can also use his ghostly form to stir up a weak gust of wind in order to move small objects. In one case, I used Joey to blow a glass off of a table in order to distract the bartender, allowing Rosa to slip by unnoticed.\n\nThe game takes place across real-world New York, and players familiar with the region may recognize a few landmarks. Turning on the commentary feature in the options menu will illuminate many real-world inspirations the game designers had for the game. I would even recommend playing through the game for the first time with the commentary, especially if you are not the sort of player who plays through a game a second time. Hearing first-hand from the designers and developers at Wadjet Eye Games really adds a level of personality to the game that would be impossible to inject otherwise.\n\nBeyond the inspired plot settings, the game's dialog is the highpoint of Blackwell Epiphany. The banter between Rosa and Joey keeps an otherwise gloomy game lighthearted. Joey, in particular, made me wish I had a snappy ghost sidekick to follow me around through my daily life.\n\nThe great writing extends to many of the supporting characters as well. The five stages of loss (denial, anger, depression, bargaining, and acceptance) are all well represented within the characters of this game, and the voice actors present believable and at times, moving, performances throughout the entire game.\n\nBlackwell Epiphany does suffer a pretty substantial blow to its presentation in the form of a locked low-resolution issue. This issue has to do with Epiphany's game engine, Adventure Game Studio. On larger monitors, the game does not look great when run in fullscreen. A solution I found was to go to the game's properties in Steam, then to Launch Options, and type in "-windowed" to force the game to run in a small window. The end result looked much better, albeit it was about a fifth the size of my screen.\n\nAs a newcomer to the series, I was afraid that much of Epiphany's tension would be lost on me as I had not experienced the buildup of the previous four games. But with such likeable protagonists, puzzles that elucidated the story further rather than slow it down, and plot twist after plot twist, by the finale I felt like I was part of Rosa and Joey's story. I felt like I was right there with them at the end when...well, you'll just have to see for yourself.\n","April 24, 2014","true","17.5"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

I definitely recommend that fans who play this should do so with small breaks since there's a lot to take in. Literally all of the unanswered questions that have been bothering me - on top of Epiphany's plot, in addition - was crammed in and some bits may have flown over my head in the process.\n\nThankfully, the mysteries surrounding Joey and the Blackwell family are finally revealed and I was happy to get that closure.\n\nEpiphany pulls out all the stops when it comes to drama, and I found myself feeling weary of what would happen to the majority of the characters - not just Joey and Rosa - which is great because that shows that the other characters are relatable and likable.\n\nThe story itself does a complete turnaround and you won't be expecting the culprit behind it all and the resulting ending!\n\nI really enjoyed Epiphany, not quite as much as the others because of the depressing undertones and some of the events that unfold, but it's still a Blackwell game and it holds up to its predecessors.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that the events could have been spaced out a bit more so that it wasn't just one thing immediately after another - it felt overwhelming at times. Also, the ending wasn't favorable in my opinion but I suppose it fits.\n\nBe sure to bring lots of tissues...\n\nThank you Dave and Wadjet Eye for this amazing series and congratulations on its completion!","May 3, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fortunately, I did not spend eight years waiting to play them all as I started in early 2014, just in time for the last one to be released. The series aging poorly over a such a long time isn’t really an issue here as it’s done in the 90s style of point and click adventures. Pixel graphics, above-par voice acting, items to pick up and most of all, a compelling story.\n\nWhat do I think? Not bad, not bad at all. The characters draw you into well-written, appropriately voiced, engaging point-and-click adventure. It’s probably one of the most intuitive adventures I’ve played in a while (especially after playing Monkey Island and Sam & Max).

I love the genre - faults and all. Some of my favourite games are adventure games.\n\nThe Blackwell series completely surprised me. It had incredibly engaging characters, an intuitive investigation system, and puzzles that are challenging, but not impossible.\n\nAll of this comes to a head in this fifth and final entry in the series. Its gameplay time is roughly twice or three times longer than previous games, with a lot room for character, mystery, and puzzle development. Each game in the series improved upon the next, whether it was in puzzle design or its interface. Ending the series on such a high note leaves you wishing there was more, but also feeling satisfied by its tear-jerking finale.\n\nHonestly, if you're reading this and thinking of getting it or the series as a whole, I say yes. Absolutely. I say this especially as a fan of adventure games. The Blackwell games are a gem in the sea of adventure games and you're doing yourself a disservice by not playing them.","June 17, 2014","true","13.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I found it in the very excellent Gemini Rue and have bought and played almost all of Wadjet Eye published games since. It is quite incredible that such low-res pixelated characters can evoke so much subtle emotion. The environments drawn with so much thought made me feel as though I've visited New York City.\n\nI have no comments on the gameplay and puzzle solving itself as everyone has their own level of patience for point-and-click games. The blackwell games always make sure you solve the puzzles on your own (and feel great about yourself!) with just enough suggestion secretly planted in your head. Never are any of the puzzles unfair pixel hunting frustrations.\n\nIt's somehow extremely saddening to learn what is preventing a ghost it from moving on. And so I will always say the best part of the blackwell games is how well it portrays tragedy and death. "Lots of stuff happen that shouldn't. It's just... stuff"","September 27, 2015","true","16.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is a game that does something very well.....and that is end well. You definitely can't say that of a lot of major AAA titles these days. This game has the charm of a 90's point-and-click without all the hiccups. By now, the ones who have played the entire series are ready for one more hurrah with Joey and Roseangela. What a team they are. Their banter is hilarious and really keeps the game going. The puzzles really aren't difficult, since it feels like you are solving cases rather than puzzles. The atmosphere of a moody New York City in winter is perfect, along with the soundtrack. For those who haven't played the Blackwell series, you should give it a try.

Like all the Blackwell games, it has a pixelated art style and smooth repeating track for each location that is reminiscent of an old GameBoy game. The writing was intriguing, witty, and never dull.\n\nEvery Blackwell game does an amazing job of tying each game together. Epiphany is no different and answers all loose ends left from Legacy to Deception, even leaving small, satisfying "Easter Eggs" about previous games and events.\nSome of the puzzles are a bit abstract, but the amount of items you sometimes resort to blindly using are not too vast, in that you can figure it out in time. Gameplay is also the longest out of all of the Blackwell series, most say around 9 hours for the first play through. I was more eager on hearing the story than figuring out the puzzles, which is reflected in my hours played.\n\nThe end is, as I said, bittersweet and leaves an unfulfilled hole in your heart, but doesn’t any story when you fall in love with the characters?\n\nAll in all, a fantastic point and click adventure game.

I really can't get behind Epiphany though. Part of my problem is I just find Joey as completely unlikeable as before and I don't care for the story behind his character. He's just a smarmy jerk. Rosa seems to less fleshed out in this version too. I can't quite put my finger on how but it just doesn't really feel very much like the character I was really liking in the other games.\n\nWithout getting into spoilers, the plot is a mess. The creator claims he had the ending planned all along but it certainly doesn't feel that way. Plot holes pop up all over the place and certain characters just all but vanish in the second part of the game. Everything feels very contrived and coincidental. There's also a point where all of the work you've been doing in the beginning of the game is completely wiped out.\n\nAs for gameplay. It drops a lot of the note taking and deduction stuff from the previous games for more nonsensical puzzles. Joey's blowing power either doesn't work on things you'd expect it to work on or does work on things that it shouldn't (Like blowing a surgical scalpel down a long hallway.)\n\nThe voice acting and art direction are still top notch as would be expected from a Wadjet Eye game, but in the end it just didn't really interest me the way the previous games did.","October 21, 2014","false","5.2"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","17","36","0","0"

Or I could also evoke Goodbye Deponia.\n\nThe conclusion of Blackwell Epiphany is anticlimatic, lacks catharsis, and is somewhat depressing and discouraging. I'm not petitioning for a happier ending, but even for a deliberate "bad end", it's badly executed, and falls short of whatever you might be expecting or hoping after Blackwell Deception.\n\nBlackwell Deception spoilers ahead, and some hints at the ending of Epiphany...\nAs you remember from Deception, Gavin was totally freaked out when we took him to the spirit world, saying that he's not supposed to be there, hinting at some kind of contract that forbids this... And true enough, he was torn apart there and then.\nNow, given the slight hints at things going on behind the scenes, I was expecting a spiritual conspiracy drama, some kind of detective mystery, with superhuman, and potentially divine powers moving the pieces from behind the scenes. I mean come on, if you like conspiracy stories, what better than a conspiracy God himself may be in on. I was really curious about the "They" mentioned by both Gavin, and the first victim we meet in Epiphany...\nWell, drop any expectation, because they are going to be betrayed. There IS no "they". The solution of the mystery is so incredibly inane and bad, that I could only liken it to a "the butler did it" moment. And in this mystery, it is not through investigation and clever handling of clues that the butler is uncovered by Sherlock Holmes or Poirot. Naaah. The butler just confesses without warning.\nAnd yeah, the conclusion that follows is pretty cliched and not thought through AT ALL. Not to mention being quite similar to bloody Mass Effect 3.

I may be writing a review for this game, however, it revolves around the entire series as a whole and should be played as such.  From the start, you realize this is just like any point and click adventure from old.  The minimalist approach to the interface is overshadowed by the thought and heart poured into a truely enticing story and wonderful characters.  I do recommend you start with the first entry, and enjoy the ride for the entirety.\n\nDoes that sound too good?  Well, realize, this is actually a review, not just gushing compliments of a few aspects of the game.\n\nOnce you take the plunge in the first game (the first in the series, not the precursor game which I did not know about till I completed the 5 Blackwell games), you will get a sense that the creators want you to learn, and the tutorial aspect is not necessary.  It takes a bit, but once you get into the swing of things, you will start combining notes, using the few items you collect in the game properly, and later in the series, you will get the hang of swapping between your main character and their  ghostly companion.\n\nThe weaknesses of each series seems to be repeated.  I personally felt that some of the 'puzzles' were simply 'do in the right order no matter what information the player has seen', 'luckily you clicked the right notes in the right order' or even 'glad you visited this person now after you did one thing' to progress.  Later entries in the series seemed to try for less linearity, however, it really boils down to perfect order.  Maniac Mansion, this is not.\n\nThe story, characters and a large portion of the quests, however, make up for the handful of blunders.  I won't spoil the series ending, but be prepared, it is a doozy.\n\n`Rogerztheurbanlegend","August 18, 2014","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a collection of relatively short, story-rich mystery games.  The voice acting is excellent, and, except for the first game, the ambience is so deliciously noir with a great smooth-jazz soundtrack.  While the actual graphics are, obviously, old-school adventure-game pixelly, the game is still beautiful.\n\nRegarding Blackwell Epiphany specifically: I had to purchase this one separately, but I had no choice - the game had been so good to me, I just had to continue.  I was not sorry - game was well worth the money.  The graphics and UI took another step up in this installment.  The game gets interesting when you hop back and forth in time, seeing the origins of many recurring characters and tying up loose ends.  I was sad when I realized that this was the end of the series, but what a pleasure this whole game has been.

I honestly think that the thing I liked most about the series was that some of the voice acting felt a bit stiff and 'un-professional'. I say that not as an insult, but as a compliment. Especially considering that Rosa went against the mold for a large number of reasons, I feel like it gave her a more natural feel. It carried a lot of the social-awkwardness, and really drove home that these were not heroes in a story; these were just people (and.... well, a few un-people) doing the best that they can in a world that despite their efforts continued to grow increasingly stranger and more dangerous. Most of the puzzles are simple, though considering the series is primarily story driven, that isn't a bad thing as it helps to keep the plot advancing. Admittedly, as all adventure games go there will be one or two puzzles in any of the games that can leave you scratching your head for a while. Definitely going on my list of Adventure classics, and definitely a series worth picking up.","November 2, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ever. I'm not generally an emotional person\nI don't often review games, but this series seems like it flies under the radar of many people, as it did mine. I found the bundle during one of the Steam sales being a lover of the old point and click videogames (Kyrandia, King's Quest, Monkey Island) and this game certainly doesn't dissappoint. The graphics are pixellated, in a style which is very reminiscent of the first and second Kyrandia games. I quite like it, and if you're a fan of that sort of thing, I'm sure you will too. If you DISlike pixellated graphics, don't let that dissuade you from buying this game.\n\nHowever, don't you DARE buy this game standalone. The bundle is not that expensive, so buy every game. It deserves that. After playing all the games coming before Epiphany, I grew to love the main two characters, and actually cared about them. That's rare for me because I generally dislike female leads. I can't talk much about the story because I don't want to spoil any of this amazing game or series, but once you get attached to the characters as I do, this game will break you. I feel as though my soul has been ripped out and dragged through the snowy streets of New York.\n\nFirst game to bring tears to my eyes, and I'm genuinely impressed by that. I reccommend it to anyone who likes retro point-and-clicks, mystery/detective games, or who has some money to spend and some time on their hands.\n\nBuy this game, buy the others in the series.

The first thing I can say is that you'd be best playing the previous Blackwell games first because this is the end of the series, and there are quite a few call backs to previous games of the series. I feel the complete journey to this game is where you would get the most out of it, that full emotional investment in these characters and their stories all the way to the end. This really was a great way to wrap it up and I didn't notice any loose ends. The game has some really devious puzzles to solve, a great story with some very unexpected twists, and it's the longest game of the series. I clocked in 7 hours, but that does also factor in being stuck on puzzles. I'd guess you could beat this in at least 6 hours if you know what you're doing.

Each game in the series weaves in all of the different plot threads and mysteries and the finale actually manages to answer all of the questions and bring a clean and definite closure to this incredibly well-crafted and heartfelt story.  A satisfying and definite ending is a rare thing, but they have managed it here.  Epiphany's story takes some very dark turns, even moreso than previous entries, but is underpinned by the uplifting relationship between Rosangela and Joey.  The development of the main characters, and their friendship with eachother is done very well and you really care about them individually and as a team by the end.  The soundtrack is great.

I liked how closure came, and how things fit together. But I do not dare to say anything more.\n\nLike in past entries, you control both Rosangela, the "medium", and her ghost partner. Both have their own skills. The puzzles are well planned, with no out of place logic puzzles. Most puzzles are of the conversation type, so you only have a few items in your inventory at a time. Other puzzles involve fact checking, and that is what the in-game smartphone is for. It really feels like a Private Eye story at the end of the day. Conversation with the ghost is witty, and is part of the hint system. However, I have not used the hint system often, as it was clear what I had to do. The only point I was really stuck was when I have to pick up a key card I did not know it was there in all the filth.\n\nDialogues are good, and voice acting was up to that quality too. However, I would have prefered to have a voice with accent for the asian man you meet. Rosangela's actions are believable, as she is still a human.\n\nAs this is the fifth entry on the series, you probably know you want or not this game.

It runs longer than its predecessors, and features all the staple mechanics of the series: you have your Joey and your Rosa, you solve mysteries and save ghosts, and you engage in lots of conversations with a colourful cast of New Yorkers. What is noteworthy, however, is what the game *doesn't* contain; specifically, it doesn't really address the major cliffhanger set up at the end of Blackwell Deception, opting instead for an entirely different (and rather more cosmic) climax. There are also a few moments where the game just seems to "forget" about a character or a plot point, and a somewhat annoying "cheat" right at the game's final puzzle, where all of a sudden a staple mechanic from the series works a different way from how it always has. Those are minor annoyances, though, and overall the gameplay is smooth and engaging, and the dialogue is brilliant. The voicework by Rebecca Whittaker and Abe Goldfarb has come a *very* long way since Legacy, and is now quite good. Plotwise, there is one major twist that is far too obvious, but several surprises, and an ending that is probably not at all what you're expecting.\n\nOverall, I'd give Blackwell Epiphany 4/5. It's quite a good game, but it seems to be perhaps a bit too ambitious; it's like there was too much stuff trying to cram its way in. Also, the setting gets rather high fantasy by the end, and I prefer the more down-to-earth setting of the first three games.","May 4, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not because those games are bad, by any stretch. The whole series is an enjoyable plate of oldschool adventure gaming goodness and paranormal detective work. But Epiphany is the most mechanically cohesive and intuitive of the series. It's the one you'd want to shove into the hands of someone hesitant to play point-and-click adventures, and then they'd just be lost for want of several episodes of back story.\n\nIt's not perfect. Recording quality is always iffy on Wadjet Eye games and it's disappointing that the logic mechanic that lets you combine note entries is pretty much an abandoned afterthought. But Epiphany finishes up a good yarn with some satisfying conclusions. It's a fitting end to a great series.","September 3, 2014","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If  you have already played the previous games, then no further words are needed. Go pick up Epiphany.

Cue sudden appearance of Joey Mallone, a enigmatic ghost seemingly connected to her. it may sound cliche, ghosts and mediums guiding lost souls but the strength is in the writing and characters.

They shift expressions as they talked but I kind of liked the animated talking ^^;; But I can see that can actually be a bit more tedious to do over time.

Blackwell.\n\nOn one hand, this is a fantastic series and ends without wearing out its welcome, but at the same time, this is like two games crammed into one [which is sort of awesome but tedious if going for the "leave under 300 footsteps" achievement]. It has a very Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows feel in that it's really designed for the fans who've played through the first four--while I wouldn't recommend it, it IS possible to play Unbound, Convergence, and Deception without first playing Legacy. Epiphany really needs to be played last to be satisfying.\n\nSpelling this out: DO NOT PLAY THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THE OTHER BLACKWELL GAMES FIRST.\n\nOverall, I basically love everything about Epiphany... except... I've listened to the commentary, and I understand the reason for the ending, but... I really wanted it to end differently. It's such a Deus Ex Machina, besides being the least probable outcome [even being a series about ghosts and mediums], and... I dunno. I do get and like the imagery and respect how that's the only way it could happen--it's just kind of... aww.\n\nThe commentary is particularly insightful at the third act twist [where the Epiphany is explained], and I highly recommend listening to it if you have the chance.

The game has some really devious puzzles to solve, a great story with some very unexpected twists, and it's the longest game of the series. I clocked in 7 hours, but that does also factor in being stuck on puzzles. I'd guess you could beat this in at least 6 hours if you know what you're doing.

Both have their own skills. The puzzles are well planned, with no out of place logic puzzles. Most puzzles are of the conversation type, so you only have a few items in your inventory at a time. Other puzzles involve fact checking, and that is what the in-game smartphone is for. It really feels like a Private Eye story at the end of the day. Conversation with the ghost is witty, and is part of the hint system. However, I have not used the hint system often, as it was clear what I had to do. The only point I was really stuck was when I have to pick up a key card I did not know it was there in all the filth.\n\nDialogues are good, and voice acting was up to that quality too. However, I would have prefered to have a voice with accent for the asian man you meet.

This game offers one of the best friendships you'd see between two game characters and you can see how they move from meeting and accepting each other (ep1), barely tolerating the fact that they have to be around each other (ep3, which strikes you with the different voice tone Joey uses toward Rosa than Lauren), warming up to and finding qualities they love in each other (ep4), and finally, being fully invested in friendship (but would forever pretend they are only barely standing to each other) in this episode. And the ending happens and you are sad.\n\nThe story is so well conducted and ties up perfectly in this episode. I am saying only this about the story because I appreciate it so much that I don't think I'd be able to stop myself from giving spoilers. Of course, writing has its faults then and there, no story is 100% even if you like it enough to feel like it. And to be honest, I did think the vortex and "universe superpowers" in this episode were a bit excessive but it pays the price of breaking your heart so that it seems more realistic than if it didn't have consequences. All  I can say about the storyline without giving spoilers is that it's good and worth your time.\n\nBut beware if you get attached to the characters, and if you are really into story-rich games and can see what meaning lies underneath things said and done - you WILL get attached to the characters if you like the game, you will be hurt.\n\nStill, 10/10 would let it break my heart again.","August 8, 2015","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can really tell how far the series has grown and developed since the Blackwell Legacy, as Epiphany presents darker themes, more complex (yet still logical) puzzles, and more advanced graphics. All elements have become perfected in this installment. Of course, since Epiphany is the final installment in a 5-game series, it is best enjoyed only after playing the previous games since by then you'll have a greater understanding of the characters and backstory - and those games are definitely worth playing and come at good prices. All of the previous plot threads are tied together, and a lot of information is revealed in this game that wouldn't make sense without playing the previous games first.\n\nThe story comes to a peak in this game in terms of emotion, and manages to tackle more serious themes skillfully. The characters are well-rounded and interesting as always, and the banter between Rosa and Joey is still present and brings great humor to lighten the mood. The final scenes of this game were very-well done and gave the series a proper grand finale that it deserved, but it can be a lot to handle at first after playing the previous games and becoming so attached to the characters. This is truly one of the few games that broke my heart. The entire series has made me greatly admire the skill and effort of Dave Gilbert and his team.\n\nI give this game a 10/10, and I strongly recommend the entire series to anyone who enjoys adventure games.","June 17, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After playing the bundle I had to see how it ends and was not disappointed. This last game is the best of the series, in interaction, backgrounds, the characters, the dialogue, puzzles and length. Playing them all makes you realize how everything has improved over the years with experience, which in its own is a nice and educational touc.\n\nEven though  the previous ones are not as awesome, they are a must play. Even the first one that serves as an introduction is perfect when looking at them as a whole.\n\nI am happy that someone still makes good 2d classic adventures. I missed a really good pixelated one :)\n\n\nGood parts:\nAtmosphere, backgrounds are nice and colorful.\nNice story, enjoyed it without being annoyed by any hickups.\nThe puzzles were ok, I did get stuck a few times and the hints are not helping much (more on the not-so-good)\nThe conversations between the characters are funnier and feel more comfortable. The evolution of the games feels similar with the relationship of the main characters. The more experienced the game, the more comfortable the relationship. That felt nice seen as a whole.\nInitially the subject seemed a bit boring I think, but the story is better built than it seems at first. There's even morals to it, and moments to get you thinking about our purpose in life. There's not a too in-depth explanation of how everything works, but it's very satisfactory overall.\nThe commentary is a nice addition, especially if you want to know fun info about developing games. I found it entertaining.\n\nNot-so-good parts: (maybe spoilers)\nAfter finishing all the games, I would've liked to know why the protagonist got to be the protagonist, or the history before our times. Centuries ago. Why was this all here? I don't want to expand on this, but the backstory feels like it could've been a bit more rewarding. It's not bad, but when you binge, you want to binge all the way. This is what I could've used to be really happy happy.\nI may be too old for this, but I run out of patience easily and had to use a walkthrough here and there. Not too often though. It's easy enough to keep you entertained and it was overall a breeze.\n","December 11, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They shift expressions as they talked but I kind of liked the animated talking ^^;; But I can see that can actually be a bit more tedious to do over time.

I could praise voiceacting. I could describe the gameplay and the story and what to expect. But Steam is full of those. So I will just warn you:\n\nIt hurts. It HURTS. This game offers one of the best friendships you'd see between two game characters and you can see how they move from meeting and accepting each other (ep1), barely tolerating the fact that they have to be around each other (ep3, which strikes you with the different voice tone Joey uses toward Rosa than Lauren), warming up to and finding qualities they love in each other (ep4), and finally, being fully invested in friendship (but would forever pretend they are only barely standing to each other) in this episode. And the ending happens and you are sad.\n\nThe story is so well conducted and ties up perfectly in this episode. I am saying only this about the story because I appreciate it so much that I don't think I'd be able to stop myself from giving spoilers. Of course, writing has its faults then and there, no story is 100% even if you like it enough to feel like it. And to be honest, I did think the vortex and "universe superpowers" in this episode were a bit excessive but it pays the price of breaking your heart so that it seems more realistic than if it didn't have consequences. All  I can say about the storyline without giving spoilers is that it's good and worth your time.\n\nBut beware if you get attached to the characters, and if you are really into story-rich games and can see what meaning lies underneath things said and done - you WILL get attached to the characters if you like the game, you will be hurt.\n\nStill, 10/10 would let it break my heart again.","August 8, 2015","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Epiphany takes the puzzle-solving, action, storytelling, and atmosphere of all the previous games and forms a suspenseful, wonderfully made game. The game continues to build, and build, and build until you finally reach the end. And the ending, oh my gosh..... so intense and.... All I remember is picking my jaw up off the ground, and rushing toward the exit ramp of the emotional rollercoaster.\n\nFor the Blackwell series, this is my favorite game. I would highly recomend playing the other games in the series, as to get the full experience of the series, before playing Epiphany ( if this game even interests you, you won't regret it). So I give this game my highest recomendation.   :)","February 17","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is perfect in every ways. It just makes you want to play it all again and again and never. The ending is perfect, I was not expecting it...

Very good storyline and game mechanics. It kept me up late at night several times because I just wanted to know how the story ended. The only bad thing I can say about it, is that the story ended after part five. But that is probably a good thing because you do not want to ruin a good story by stretching it thin.\n\nYou play this adventure with two main characters: Rosangela Blackwell and Joey Malone. Part two is kind of a prequel in which Rosangela is replaced by her Aunt Lauren Blackwell.\nRosangela and Lauren are mediums and Joey Malone is their spirit guide. Together they help the souls of dead people (ghosts) that are stuck in this world to move on. Doing so they encounter a number of persons/ghosts who play an important role in the story later on.\n\nJoey is a ghost himself so he can reach places that Rosangela cannot, but he cannot wander off too far because he is bound to Rosangela. He also cannot touch anything so he needs Rosangela for this. This poses some interesting situations in which Joey needs to get Rosangela into locked rooms/buildings.\n\nA very interesting game mechanic is that you have to cross-reference pieces of information. By cross-referencing the right information you will learn new things which will help you to further progress into the game. Some information you have to lookup on the internet (in game) and emails play an important role too in this game.\n\nThe Blackwell series consists of five separate parts:\n\n1. The Blackwell Legacy\n2. Blackwell Unbound\n3. Blackwell Convergence\n4. Blackwell Deception\n5. Blackwell Epiphany\n\nBe sure to play them in that order because it is in fact one big story divided over five parts.","February 7","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game as far as point and click adventures go brings a nice mix of making you think, while having fun.\n\nThe characters are 3 dimensional and are really likeable and believable, the graphics while a turnoff for some are very well done in their pixel style and feel fleshed out. I really enjoyed the voice acting and the little quips between Rosa and Joey\n\nIf you have played the rest of the series this is a no brainer, its the final chapter and the ending will leave you shocked. If you are new to the series you owe it to youself to give it a try as it has to be one of the better point and click adventures i've ever played","January 17","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of time was spent building and crafting a great world and characters that seem "alive" (PUN!). The voice acting for all the characters is great and fits each person very well. If you enjoy a little some light supernatural story in a modern setting then the Blackwell games are for you. Now for Blackwell Epiphany - a fitting way to end the series with a polished engine and a story that leaves you wanting more.\n\nI'm really happy I picked up the Blackwell games on a whim.

It's also a satisfying length and is longer than the other games in the series.\n\nI'm really impressed at this Indie studio that makes games that are as good or better than some of the classics, and the retro pixel-art style is beautiful.

This Game should be played as part (final part) of the whole Blackwell Series.\n\nThe Story is astonishing told and has all the ingredients of a really good story. It has emotions, tension, humor and seriousness. The story is really well told and that strong to put this series in a league of one of the best adventures I played the last few years.\n\nAbout the different aspects of the this Games/Series:\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphic is no highly polished, effectful 3D grahic, but it is always fitting to tell the story also in appropriate graphical way. The graphics get better with every part of the Blackwell series, but it never takess the attention away from the story.\n\nBlackwell Epiphany: 6/10\nBlackwell series: 5/10\n\nAudio:\nThe Audio is great. Every bit line is sychronized and well played by the different voice actors. This one is really great and support the whole game/series and how emotionally the story is told. The music is atmospehric and is never nerve-racking.\n\nBlackwell Epiphany: 10/10\nBlackwell series: 10/10\n\nStory:\nI wrote it at the beginning of my review. This is one of the best told stories in an adventure / adventure series in the last few years. It has it all emotions, tension, humor and seriousness. It is well support through the graphic and even better by audio, meaning voice actors and music.\n\nBlackwell Epiphany: 10/10\nBlackwell series: 10/10\n\n\nI can defintely recommend this game... WAIT... I insist I recommend the whole series to get the full experience out of the fantastic story.\n\nThis game / series is worth every dime of it. You wil not regret it!\n\nHave fun with this adventure gem(s) :)","June 5","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
