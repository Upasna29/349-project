I spent most of my time on career mode maxing out my shooting stat and smoking the hell out of goalies. This game, atleast in my opinion, shows the guts and such of the game of Lacrosse. Now I do think its a little over the top on the hitting, considering straight up flattening someone isnt legal all of the time depending on where you get them at. I find this game to fit as a fun past-time and just a sort of "chill-out" game.\n\n\nThanks for reading my crappy review.","March 10","true","104.8"," 87 of 92 people (95%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","95","87","92","12","0"

The only REAL next gen thing about this game is graphics. Most of the game mechanics are kind of a let down. There is also many glitches to encounter with in this game. For instants, celebrating after a goal,  you may phase right through the net. It's not game breaking but frankley unproffesional of the developers. As a defencive player in high school, I have found the defence in this game insulting. Sorry if I offend anyone, but it almost makes us look ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. And the goalies, I know there is a ton of scoring in lacrosse (I play it) but, the goalies reactions are terrible as well. Not because they can't save anything, it's because there movements are choppy and not fluent, smoothe. If you dissagre with me I totally get, but I have been waiting for this game since the fund raised, and kinda have been disappointed with the outcome. I know you developers in a lot of hard work, and i appreciate it, but some of these mistakes are impossible to miss. I cannot get past the part I had to go out and buy a new controller to be able to play this. No keyboard support, REALLY? Don't get me wrong I do love this game, and I'd love to see some updates for future improvement. But for the time being I really do not believe this should be a $50 game.","March 10","true","6.2"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","25","32","3","0"

So I am going to try and make an in-depth tutorial. I was a backer for this game when the crowdfunding campaign failed in the fall of 2013, as well as when the crowdfunding successfully was achieved in 2014. So, I have been waiting for this game for awhile, lol.\n\nI fully recommend this game! It captures the realism of lacrosse and for the first legitimate lacrosse game ever, EVER, it well exceeded my expectations. The graphics I have seen on youtube are amazing, I have a weak machine so I have the equivilent of xbox or Playstation 2 graphics, and still have put already 37 hours onto the game. So if you have a weak PC do not be discouraged, I still think it is a great buy.\n\nPROS:\n- Realistic Lacrosse, AI responds as they would in a real-game.\n- Good shooting animations and controls\n- Commentary is basic, but good\n- AI is hard to beat! I played on Sophmore difficulty (2nd easiest of the 5 difficulties) and I still barley can win at times.\n- A good amount of scoring, but not all games end 20-18, sometimes lower scoring like 6-5.\n-THE BEST PRO: To me, the customization in this game is unreal. If you like creating players and Teams, ORDER THIS GAME NOW. It is my favorite part of any sports game and this one makes by far the best creation-centre.\n\nCONS: I think many of these wrinkles will get smoothened out in the next game and/or updates.\n\n-The game has no indication when quarters will end! There should be a beep or something when there is 5 seconds left in a quarter. All of the sudden, the play stops and the quarter will end.\n- The sprinting is ♥♥♥♥, you get short sprint bursts which then regenerate after a short time.\n- Glitchy celebrations, players run through other players and the nets\n- The goalies can make saves, but sometimes when they let in goals they look like blind vegetables\n- Defense was really hard to get at first, learning what buttons truley did what.\n- No tutorial to teach basic lacrosse rules or the gameplay (Like I said, defense was hard to learn)\n- Apparently, no customization to players after career mode begin\n\nI would give this game a 9/10, I love it so far and the thing is I give it that grade and THIS IS THE FIRST LACROSSE GAME EVER! Many more to come with better improvements!","March 10","true","75.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","16","18","3","3"

Have only played a couple of casual games, but I can't wait to get into the career stuff.  With all the hoopla surrounding disappointing big-budget releases (XCom2, The Division, WWE 2k16), it was really refreshing to see this game blow all of those out of the water.

However, totally worth the wait.  Visually the game looks amazing up there with NHL and FIFA 16.  Passing, shooting, and slashing controls are perfect.  Also the player, team, league, and even referee and coach creation is a plus.  The only complaint I have is the dekes could be a bit less jerky.  Hopefully this game does well and we can get another in 2017 and wouldn't mind some box lacrosse added as well.","March 10","true","12.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It is basically a reskin of the games for Xbox they released several years ago with added career modes. I played Lacrosse at the DIII level and while this game does do some things well, it gets bogged down by an unexplained control scheme, poor AI, and wonky physics. Half-field offense is extremely difficult as is 1v1 dodging because you can never accurately judge when the D can take the ball away from you. Defensive players simply charge the ballcarrier and slide up-field with no regard to team defense, turning the game into a fast break simulator. This is a good start and I will pick it up again when the price drops to around $15-20. Hopefully they get the opportunity to make another and focus on improving the AI and tweaking the little things so that the game can accurately reflect the half-field game which is where the majority of the game is played.","March 29","false","1.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I had never seen a Lacrosse game before, I only knew it's a rather exotic sport from Canada and I was curious. And hey, it is like Ice Hockey on grass. Similar pace, similar fun, similar rules, easy to learn. The controls (especially the shooting) seemed strange to me at first (moving the right stick instead of pressing a button), but I got used to them and won some matches already.

This game rocks, graphics are great, controls are great, presentation is good, stats are great, edit/create is good, this game is better then what I imagined a lacrosse game should be. This game needs to get more recognition, sports titles are extremely rare on PC's today, our only options are the #$%^ EA games. I am forever humble that these devs and supporters made this game a reality. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! Lacrosse Rocks! I just happened to run into this game browsing titles.......I couldn't believe it.\n\nGraphics: 9\nSound/Audio: 9\nControls: 8\nReplay Value: 9\n\nIn short, ß@Ð@$$!\n\nPs, rating a game crappy because your intergrated video card can't handle this game is stupid. This game does require a decent PC to run it. I have a few, my Pentium I7 PC's with 970+ GTX and 16+ gb with SSD drives had NO ISSUES, NO SLOW DOWN ON MAX SETTINGS! My living room PC which has an IDE HDD, AMD 6 core, 8 gbs ram and GTX 750 ti runs it okay, but there will be skipping and stuttering when passing and shooting. This game is taxing, and will require a 1000 PC to run on MAX SETTINGS, you can still run this game very well if you tweak your graphics on a low end PC. You should never expect games of this caliber to play with intergrated video.","March 14","true","72.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It really does look and feel like lacrosse. And speaking of looks, this game looks fabulous. The players, field, and stadium are all decked out in lush current gen graphical goodness. Note: More on graphics below.) For an indie game, it has the visual look and feel of a big studio product and in my opinion this makes CP16 a milestone achievement for a crowd funded game. And there’s plenty of ways to get to the field - there’s single games, a decent (but not overly deep) career mode, and tournament modes.\n\nAnd special mention for the excellent Lacrosse Academy in-game editor that gives you the ability to fully manage tactics, rosters, and starting lineups, plus create custom teams, players, coaches, and even referees. While this game doesn’t carry official licenses from either the NCAA or Major League Lacrosse, the developers have invented a fabulous trick the very first time you start the game. The first time you turn on the game you have the option to update all the rosters to the highest rated teams available from the community through the Lacrosse Academy. That means you can instantly update your rosters from the generic teams that come with the game to 67 real NCAA teams or the nine MLL pro teams. Granted, there’s not official logos for any of the college or pro teams, but it’s a great feature and one that I hope other studios picks up on with their titles.\n\nWith all that said, here’s the downer. As noted above, this game is beautiful but be forewarned that you’re going to need a powerful PC to play with decent graphics. This is an all out current gen game and to get the max out of the graphics (PS4 or Xbox One equivalent) you’re going to need a rocket ship of a PC.\n\nAll in all, as a representation of the game of field lacrosse, this game is very well done and compares to any sports game offered by 2K, EA, or other big outfits. Even if you’re not a lax guy, this is a great sports title.\n\nNow how about that box lacrosse title?","March 10","true","2.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Yes it has some glitches and a few issues here and there, but considering it had a low budget and it has good graphics AND ITS A FREAKING GAME ABOUT LACROSSE, it's amazing. It is also a pretty good way to learn about the sport if you are just picking it up. Yet with that being said, if you are just looking to pick upo a quality sports game that isn't from EA, you might find this a bit lackluster in comparison to AAA franchises such as Fifa and Madden. Overall I recommend this game, especially if you love lacrosse.\n\nP.S. None of the teams are licensed, meaning they have fake team and player names. However this can be fixed by simply selecting YES when the game starts up and asks you about downloading the most popular team set-ups created by the community.","May 10","true","19.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Installing the game and playing for the first time there was no tutorial or practice mode where u could really learn the controls. I found the controls on the difficult side to memorize, and jumping right into a game was overwhelming. I started with manual controls to switch players ect but found it wouldnt switch to the person i wanted and would go to someone across the field that couldnt even be in the play. i found that alone extremely frustrating, because it made defense impossible. I then switched to automatic and that as well went to players on attack while i was playing D. I found offense very easy and playable, at times the game would pass to the wrong person but i guess that takes practice to aim it to the right person. The annoying stuff on offense would be if a offensive player passed it across midline to defense. which causes you to lose the ball and its just annoying.. why would i want to pass there? While playing defense u can really only be one player therefore AI in the game is supposed to cover the other players that cut through. AI did not do this so i pretty much played a 6 on 1 because my AI teamates litterally stood still and did nothing. I would recomend the game if what above is fixed... as of right now dont buy it for $50, its only really fun while playing with a friend and that means u have to buy another controller or they have to buy the game themself. (ITS NOT WORTH IT)","March 25","false","2.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It was originally called LAX 15... Majority of the time wasted making this game didnt go into actual gameplay. It went to getting its kickstarter backers in the game. The devs were completely quiet about the release date for a long time and then when they finally released it decided all those kickstarter funds werent enough, so they slapped a 50 dollar price tag on something which should be 30 at most. The gameplay is ok at best and there isnt much to it. If this game was priced at 25 bucks id say absolutely yes and thumb it up without thinking about it because its lacrosse and i can play it on my pc. However, the devs got greedy and asked for 50.\n\nThank you for bringing a lax game but some of the ways you did it sucked. Hope to see better from you guys next year i will change my review when the price drops","March 22","false","3.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

WHAM overthrow 1 meter away. Of course it happen to the opposing team also but it's usually cause you presure them.\n\nThe AI is completly messed up also , my defensive middie rushed to a lose ball on the ground , touched it with his stick and ... runned away allowing an easy counter attack and goal. The groundball handling by the AI is catastrophic , i doubt any Lacrosse player would be so scared of the ball. The interception is also entierly handled by the AI , even if you control a player, the AI take in charge the interception.\n\nAt some points, i tried to create a user team and entered a competition and suddenly some of my players went from 84 overall to 46 without an explanation or a choice.\n\nMaybe I was a fool to expect a gameplay similar to NHL or Handball games but I always feel like you don't control anything. The user gameplay is not bad at all the control are well thought so that you can understand most of it after a few hours only but the  game itself  and the user experience is bad.\n\nI regret having gave this much time to convinced myself that it was a fun game because now the refund time is way gone.\n\nOh, and let's be honest , 3.0GHz processor minimum for what is shown to us is a clear waste of ressources (XCOM 2 was 2Ghz for a lot more display, the graphic rendering is very fine though for the card asked)\n\nConclusion : If you like the lacrosse sport, give it a try , it's better than nothing, other, be very careful , you might be wasting your time.\n\nPS : I played junior difficulty to learn the game and then switched to senior.","March 16","false","14.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Easily worth the $50. There are some kinks but overall it is an excellent adaptation of a severely underrated sport.\n\nPros:\n* Graphics\n* Infinite customization options\n* Realistic shooting, passing and checking\n* Games can be low scoring and dominated by defense, or they can be high scoring shootouts decided by the offense.\n* Sprinting is realistic - Most games have a sprint button that you press for the entire game. This game only allows sprinting in short bursts, after which you need to wait for that player to recharge. Saving your sprint until right after a dodge can decide whether the possesion ends in a goal or a turnover\n\nCons:\n* The game isn't lacrosse "smart". Instead of being careful near the crease the you will run straight through it\n* The wing middies are slow to react to the loose ball on a faceoff\n* It's a shame the gamemakers couldn't get the rights to use the MLL teams and players, and instead used knockoffs. The customization is a decent work around but the MLL should have agreed for free just to get some publicity.\n\nSome of the issues are a bit much to expect from the first decent lacrosse game available, but hopefully this is the first of many.","March 11","true","57.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
