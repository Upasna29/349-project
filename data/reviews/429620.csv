The WORST character progression I've seen in quite some time - You literally have only 3 skills on each character for the whole game and you can simply upgrade 1 of them each lvl so that it does a little bit more dmg)\n2. You can't change up your team (yet?) - but so far you get 5 dudes and that's your party - you can't adjust your team to the dungeon or anything. You just walk up in every dungeon with the same 5 people.\n3. Repetitive. (Has also to do with the first 2 points) - but basically every fight feels completely alike.\n4. If you have a decent "strategy" (well with so few spells it's not that hard to do) the game is just too easy - there was no dungeon that really put up a decent challenge\nMinor points\n1. The Trap-System feels completely random and pointless. What's the point of traps that let you untrigger them first when you step on them (and you always have enough stamina to untrigger all of them)\n2. Some Skills are just way too powerful (Whirlwind, Sleep-Ability) - Together they allow you to beat bosses with barely taking any hits\n3. You get WAY too much gold - you can literally buy Everything the shop offers every time. (Yes you need that gold for building your dungeon (which is PVP) but if you just play the campaign you have soo much gold floating that you can't even use in any way)\n\nBUT all that said - the game has certainly potential. And if they work on some of the problems I can see this as a fun game. (But seriously - Do something about the Character progression and character design - Only 3 skills that you can just upgrade a little bit on lvl up feels not rewarding at all)","May 13","false","4.0"," 50 of 63 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","50","63","0","6"

Combat is alright if a bit boring at times and character progression needs some work because so far all you can do is upgrade the 3 skills each character has. However, the crafting system is good and I love the feature to be able to build my own personal dungeon and challenge other player's dungeons. All in all, a fairly good early access title. I recommend purchasing this game.","May 14","true","12.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

There's a huge selection of members to choose from. The art-style is cute and charming, and each character has their own appeal. Thorgrim is your grumbling old dwarf who grows increasingly tired of your antics, that vampire chick is obviously high maintenance, and you can't have a proper dungeon travelling party without a musical bard at your side. The game allows you to create your own dungeons. In any game with any amount of drawbacks, a space for player-created content is always a plus.\n\nMost importantly is the fact that the game is still in the very early stages of development. It's — in my opinion — one of the more well-developed games to hit Early Access, and it has room to grow considerably.\n\nHow simple the game is designed means developers can freely add content as time permits. While it does little to inspire and offer a completely memorable experience, the game definitely shows promise. That's a huge win as far as I'm concerned.\n\n\nBad\nThe combat system is so easy that even a chimpanzee can achieve success.\nNo progression, all characters look the same.\nCan get repetitive.\nOnly three abilities, and there's no need to use the other two.\nGood\nMovement is simple.\nNo sad or typical story of heroism or vengence. Just a whimsical adventure of a boy turned treasure-hunter.\nRandom events keep you on your toes.\nDungeon designer is easy and intuitive, and player-made content is enough to force players to use their other skills.","May 18","true","4.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","1"

Very slow. You have to grind through levels and do a lot of levelling, with features being given to you gradually over a very long period of time. 2 hours in now, and I still haven't gotten the arena or my own dungeon unlocked. I still haven't unlocked enough characters to even make use of the party swap in/swap out feature.\n\nI can tell there's something great here though. A detailed RPG with a really cool art style that will challenge your decision-making skills and allow you to compose your own party of adventurers which will get slaughtered unless you think ahead and use some strategy with your composition.\n\nIf anyone has any questions, feel free to either add me or comment on this review, and I will answer them!","May 11","true","2.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The problem with this is that they can really ruin your run if you get debuffs like poison, bleed, or burn damage which will damage your characters pretty severely in battle, while the good buffs don't seem to help that much. (I would have liked to have seen a "HP/Mana restore" buff from one of these events)\n- Lacks enemy variety, or more importantly there's not enough bosses which makes it feel like you are fighting the same group of monsters over and over that doesn't feel rewarding.\n","May 11","true","2.9"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"
