I didn't know he had a brother!) where you go through the necessary tutorials to understand just how awful the controls in this game are. The basic controls are all there; jump, roll, strike, run up walls... block isn't one of them, because apparently it isn't useful when you're fighting several dozen enemies at once, with an arrogant sword combo so slow it gives you an extra half second every strike just to appreciate how much you hate the game. Oh and it's just the one weapon, no several weapons, no stealing them from monsters, or using them to throw at enemies, or infact throwing enemies at other enemies (Come on, we all did it), no instead the Prince relies on a much more effective stategy of kicking them. Yep kicking them, oh and apparently all that awesome jumpy acrobatic mid air strikes stuff just wasn't cool enough to continue. Then again this is probably for the best as Prince has difficulty moving correctly because the controls are so poorly calibrated (or at least different from the previous 3 games) made worse by the AWFUL automatic camera showing you various angles of walls and the Prince's ♥♥♥♥ instead of useful stuff like obsticles or enemies.\n\nMerits: Good Story, good boss characters, some new obstacles\nPitfalls: Everything else.\n\nI got this game on sale and I still feel ripped off. This is the kind of game that makes you want to slap the whole of Ubisoft in the face.","December 30, 2013","false","9.2"," 178 of 277 people (64%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","64","178","277","9","17"

The game is ignoring everything the previous games did right and it feels like a generic game for the stupid mass.\n\n-) The Prince's movements are not smooth, they are rough and not fitting.\n\n-) I know most of his movements are impossible in real life, but jumping against a wall, pausing and THEN start to run up the wall? COME ON!\n\n-) What happened to the fighting system? There are no combos, no special time abilities, nothing! The only thing you have to to is smashing X and and once in a while all the other buttons. WTH Ubisoft?\n\n-) The story is lame, average sequel story-crap, predictable and plain stupid.\n\n-) Sometimes the Prince is making a funny comment, but if you expect witty comments or dialogs like in "Two Thrones" , you'll be greatly disappointed.\n\nAll in All: If you liked or loved the original Prince of Persia Trilogy, DONT BUY "Forgotten Sands", it's a waste of time and money.

The platform part was great, you can freeze the water (freeze time for the water) which opens a totally new door for platforming. Sometime you have to freeze a fall to run on it, jump, unfreeze water to pass through a second fall and freeze it again to grab a column of water.

In Warrior Within you had many combos, you could jump on the wall onto the ennemies, grab them break their neck and steal their weapon... great time ! The Forgotten Sands is freaking lame, you have to attack buttons, weak attack, or a stronger version of that attack, NO COMBO, NO VARIETY, NO FUN...

Its acrobatic platforming is smoother, better balanced and with a greater sense of flow and action than all of the previous games.

The puzzle platforms are great, the cenarios are beatiful remembering the ones from The Two Thrones, the songs are forgetable, the story is ok and the battle system is lame, but at least there aren't many fights and they are over really quick. Let's talk about the powers. You can rewind time like on the other Prince of Persia games and now you can level up the prince and use four new spells. You can leave a trail of fire, create an impenetrable armor of sand, send forth shards of ice with each attack and release winds to push enemies back. Besides that there is a genie that will give you the hability to freeze water, materialize structures that were destroyed and jump long distances over an enemy target, which are all used for the puzzle platforms. There aren't many types of enemies and they are all super easy to kill, there is no challenge at all at killing things. There is no fancy move list, you start with the same lame slash attacks, a jump attack, a kick and with them you'll end the game. They send lots of enemies at once making it fell like you are stomping ants, but at least it is not as bad as the battle system from the PoP 2008 which also had an awful platform system. Summarizing, battle bad, but berable and platform good as it should be in a PoP game.","January 14, 2014","true","8.0"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","0"

I don't need an escort for my parkour mistakes, I HAVE RECALL FOR THAT!\n\nApparently the Prince has been working on some new parkour techniques after SoT, but then forgot them in WW, (guess thats why its called Forgotten Sands) because in this game, you can infinitely wall jump, which now wall runs a bit, and then wall jump again, rinse and repeat, you get the point. Also, he must of got some beauty sleep because he looks pretty suave, and then in WW, he must of took an ugly dirt nap or something, cause in WW he looks worse than he did in SoT.\n\nThis game has a pretty cool new mechanic in which you can make water solid for a short period of time, such as waterfalls, and jets of water, to make walls to wallrun and jump across, and to make poles of solid water to swing on respectively.\n\nAnd um... other things.... I assume theres other powers and whatnot, but honestly this is somehow the LEAST memorable PoP game. Probably because I only played through it once, then again I only played through PoP 2008 once, and I remember way more in that than I do this, mainly cause them cel-shaded environments, lack of time powers (yeah, it probably ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off enough to make me remember it more), and overly dramatic one on one battles, and its wacko ending.\n\nAlso, theres a giant boss at the end where you're on a really sketchy platform in the sand, HAVE FUN!

It's a great game and it's even a good PoP game. I literally can't find much fault here. The game is unpatched (v 1.00) yet I've encountered not a single bug. The prince moves and fights smoothly and responds well to commands. I've only encountered a handful of times in which I wanted to do something that he did not (usually that's wall jump instead of wall run or vice versa, which has always been a problem). There's everything here that makes an interesting game: good platforming, interesting mechanics, devious traps and relatively diverse combat, though this is still the weakest part of the game (but thankfully after having played Sands of Time right before this one it's nowhere near as bad and actually quite enjoyable). People complain that there is no block button...you don't need it in this game. Simple as that.\n\nThe platforming is extremely smooth and there are enough mechanics introduced throughout the game (about 8 hours in total) that it won't get boring. You have a few boss fights, mini bosses, etc. The story is actually rather interesting as well, though here is my one and only real gripe with the game...it's a pre-sequel. It's PoP 1.5 instead of PoP 4 for example or just an entirely new game. It interjects the overall story arch with something that wasn't necessary in my opinion and since it's about 8-13 years newer than the rest of the games it takes you out of the immersion (it's weird going from 2003 to 2010 and then back to 2004 and 2005). Apart from that I can only recommend this one. It looks good, plays seemlessly and has an interesting story.","February 24","true","8.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

From what I understand there is a trilogy of PoP games and Forgotten Sands is what one should call an interquel, an episode that portrays the events in between those that were explained in two other PoP games.\n\nThe story follows the prince who tries to help his brother, Malik. Malik was a bad boy and unleashed an army of sand creatures so it is now up to the prince to save the world from Solomon's Army. Story-wise, it offers nothing special, but I liked the struggle between the two brothers - there is a certain tension there that makes you want to proceed and find out how it'll end.\n\nWhen this game came out, Ubisoft was in deep development of the 2nd or 3rd Assassins Creed game. You can only imagine how fluid the climbing in this game, right? Some of these climbing sequences are actually a bit over the top - the prince can later on solidify water to use them as columns or can rebuild the environment if it's in ruins (only for a short period of time, though). Some powers can be used against the enemies, as well, and while fighting you gain experience points and eventually, you level up. This is just a minor RPG component here as PoP is essentially an action-adventure game far from true RPGs.\n\nForgotten Sands has a very high production value that all Ubisoft games can be associated with. It's a relatively long adventure that all gamers should participate in. If you have never heard of the Prince of Persia franchise, you might pick this one up for starters.","March 8, 2014","true","19.7"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","0"

Let's just say they keep the narrative going for the game, but they are not going to be a shining beacon in the videogame world. Trap comedy never gets old for Ubisoft.\n-Platforming - absolutely the greatest achievement of the game. It keeps the Sands of Time trilogy basic format, adding here and there some of the features we'd seen in the reboot, plus all-new mechanics which make it so much deeper, and in my opinion better than any of the old ones. It even makes up for the need for uPlay....Ah, yes, of course, there's uPlay... *sigh*\n-Combat is the hard one. So... love it or hate it, I guess. The fighting system is completely different than before: it's not anymore as acrobatic and varied combo-wise as the old trilogy, but hey, if you're into cleaving through a swarm of enemies with large swipes and the occasional roll-out-of-trouble, this might suit you well. I'm personally pretty ok with the chosen style. If you played the others for the combat though, this may not be the game for you. The powers one can acquire, always in my opinion, all in all are fun and useful, probably more than the sand powers we were used to. Fights get a bit dull, as per usual, at the end with the acquisition of the ever-present "water-sword-of-the-day".\n","February 21","true","6.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

I know it doesn't seem that way, but that's because I first owned it on XBOX 360 before selling it a long time ago and purchasing it on sale on here about a year later.\n\nThe Prince of Persia is back, and he's smoother than ever. With a new engine for the series, new visuals, new gameplay, you'll be hooked. I think besides having one of my favorite characters ever lead the way again, the other part that got me hooked was the upgrades and the upgrading system itself. I really like games that have this, even if it's minimal. I don't like being stuck with the same set of skills and powers for the entirety of a video game.\n\nThe Prince is sent to study alongside his brother, Malik, in order to become a great leader. On arrival, he notices his brother's kingdom under attack again, only this time it's much worse. He is forced to rely on a mythical army to stop the invaders of his kingdom. He releases the army, and not only are the invaders turned to sand, but so too are his soldiers. The only thing that's stopping The Prince & Malik from turning are the amulets they acquire from when Malik released the army. Find out more by playing this amazing game.\n\nI really like the smoothness of everything, from the combat to the parkour we all know and love. The Prince is also able to upgrade powers he later acquire and uses, his health, energy, attack power, and more! If you're like me, and you want to stay protected during a fight, so you don't have to scavenge too much for health and energy, then upgrade the power that armors you.\n\nI recommend playing this game with a controller. My logitech gamepad works great with this. I don't know about the xbox 360 wired controller.\n\nThe developers were able to combine SoT & WW into one fantastic game, and I couldn't have kinder words about it. I only wish there was some kind of epilogue DLC, where The Prince runs into something he has to deal with on the journey back home to his father. That would've made the game even more epic.\n\nI look forward to more Prince of Persia games.\n\nOverall: 10/10","March 18, 2014","true","14.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

While is not the best in the series, proves to add some improvements to the whole gameplay; a new and somehow fresh story about the Prince of Persia (kinda short if you ask me) has the typical elements of the series, such as: the puzzle rooms, sword fights and some confusing "extra" powers. One of the big differences compared to the other games is definitely the combat as this time you fight hordes of enemies which will grant you experience to unlock more skills and/or powers. At first can be fun to fight a lot of enemies, but after a while it is somehow repetitive as there are too many enemy variations.\n\nGraphics and the environments are okay and probably way better compared to the other games. Music is okay too. Probably where the game shines is in their puzzles and room exploration as you progress you will get a power which will change the room exploration greatly (you will know while going through the story, but don't want to spoil it for you).\n\nCompared to the other games this game has a challenge mode, which is pretty much survive 7 waves of enemies to get more experience and unlock the Prince's skills in story mode. Not really difficult to beat, specially if you have the sword and life upgrades already.\n\nI'd recommend this game only if you played the previous games in the series and you are curious about this game, otherwise you will feel the game is really short and doesn't have too much content, for the same reason pick it up when is on sale.","May 1, 2015","true","7.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saito_logan/recommended/33320/","saito_logan","saito_logan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saito_logan/","94 products in account","A great game that follows the styles of combat, obstacles and most things from the original trilogy of Prince Of Persia (The Sands of Time, Warrior Within and The Two Thrones).\n\nBeen a fan of this series for a huge long time, I used to think the game didn't have that kind of charm and fun in adventure and platforming like the original trilogy, after the spin-off game Prince Of Persia was released back in 2008. (which in my opinion was a good game that has nice story with good characters, though it was a strange spin-off) but I'm really glad I was so wrong\n\nObstacles and platforming:\n- One of the two special charms of the whole series, hard to dispute this game can pull off without these beautifully made mechanism of traps, and the design of the way to guide the player through them.\n- Some of the obstacles are back from the Original Trilogy (the Spikes, the straight-up high walls, the swinging axes, the running saw wheel..) and some even from the 2008 spin-off game (sliding slope..)\n- Newer, bigger and much harder obstacles in the game (one of which is the multiple layers of water wall, which in my opinion is the hardest of all obstacles I have ever seen in the whole series, and also the swinging huge thorn tree log)\n- The platforming has been upgraded to a higher new level, this means whoever still got the mind back when playing the original trilogy, now can rest assured that their style of platforming will be upgraded to a higher new level. Since it requires 1 or 2 more steps to pass the ostacles.\n- The Saving Checkpoints were arranged nicely , typical of the whole series itself\n\nCombat:\n- No longer a young prince, this guy now can make a lot of nicer attacks, combos and smoother acrobatic movements. However, The Forgotten Sands does not have the old mechanism of using 2 swords + combos (which were in the original Trilogy) , or stealth kill (The Two Thrones)\n- One thing has returned from The Sands of Time: You got a fight with a huge platoon of enemies by yourself! But that doesn't mean you can't take them all out.\n- In fact, the enemies in this game are pretty not that hard to face, which doesn't seem to be much of a concentration in this game, since the design, scenery, platforming element and story of the game are the main focus.\n- The new system of using 4 natural elements in this game are pretty nice to help you with all the combat, though after a while, you'll recognize that they are only useful in facing some types of enemies.\n- A whole new system of upgrading (which was only from the spin-off game, not the original trilogy) will help you get so much better. And I agree with this decision of Ubisoft Montreal. No more running around trying to find the upgrades and water sink to recover the health (Warrior Within), you can get Health, Energy and XP from the enemies and vases (which is an old point of the original trilogy)\n\nDesign and graphic:\n- The design of the obstacles, the platforming in The Forgotten Sands are smooth\n- The color when using the elements are really nice, especially when you freeze the time flow of the water, each drop of the water wall is so clear to see and beautifully made.\n- However,... once again, it seems the enemies are not really the main focus of the game, so they are quite not that well designed, but it doesn't matter, what matters is what they can do to you though.\n\nI believe most people who used to play the original trilogy should check this game out and get immersed in the World of the Prince of Persia once more. Even if you haven't played the Trilogy, this game still won't make you feel disappoint at all. In fact, it may even bring you back to play the original trilogy itself!\n\nRating: 9/10 by me. -0.5 because the Djin temple quite lacked the design and change in the 2 pictures (you'll see, they should have recorded the moments of the game) , -0.5 because the challenge mode lacks too much effort invested by Ubisoft.\n\nHave fun!\n\nP.S: Ezio is also spotted in the game, though in different shape. But who knows, maybe someday AC and POP can be brought together.\n- Of course, since it was released back in 2010, try to buy the game when it's on sale.","February 21, 2015","true","9.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Purple Rain is my favorite song. ...wait. Not that Prince.\n\nForgotten Sands is pretty decent so far. I have no idea how far I am through it, but I can't be more than about 25% done (it takes me a long time to play a game, OK?). It's not the best in the franchise, and it's certainly not my favorite. But if you like Prince of Persia, eh...why not? It's super cheap on Steam right now. The music is awesome, the graphics aren't mind-blowing but they're pretty good, and the story is enganging enough that it keeps me wanting to play it.\n\nThe Ubisoft start-up menu is annoying as hell. (You start the game, which starts Steam, and then it starts Ubisoft's community thing on top of that, and THEN you start the effing game, so be sure to build in an extra 10 minutes in when you want to play to get beyond all that crap! Jesus, Ubisoft!.)\n\nAlso, you really, really (really, really, really) need a joystick or game pad to play and perform combos effectively unless you are some kind of a savant with WASD. I am not (I recommend the Logitech Gamepad F310 for PS3 users. If you prefer Xbox, you're on your own.).\n\nOther than that, it's the same snarky Prince we all know and love.

The other two are obsolete and are just there as stat fodder.\n-You don't get to wear Malik's mask if you have the Malik skin.\n\n\nI give it a 6.5/10\nCause its a good game which could have been great if there were more to it than just this.\nPick it up on a sale cause you won't regret it if you get for less.\nCheers","March 20, 2014","true","9.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This is the first one I have bought since SoT and I'm definitely glad I did.\nI'll admit I was fairly sceptical about buying this game and it would never have come to my attention if it wasn't on offer but I own it now and I don't regret it. The game has an alright story, its nothing special but the characters never acted unreasonable or stupid which I had expected.\nThe graphics aren't too bad considering it came out in 2010, definitely nothing special although the facial animations were pretty good, at least for the Prince anyway. The voice acting was also pretty decent, the characters were convincing except for the occasional interruption of a puzzle by the Prince inner monologuing about how to solve it.\nThe parkour was up to the usual PoP level and with a few very welcome additions. The abilities to freeze water and teleport makes for some really interesting gameplay and adds a time element to the levels. However even though I could never place my finger on why, the sense of scale and feeling of progress wasn't as strong as in SoT. I regularly lost track of why I was going the way I was and the heights weren't brought to my attention very much. Luckily this didn't really take much away from gameplay.\nThe combat conjured some very mixed feelings. It started out being very boring, just chopping at enemies and moving on. I was really dissapointed to see my favourite elements removed since SoT. No longer did I feel like I was taking down bulky enemies through agility and manuevering, now I was the bulky one and I could chop them down in a few swings. But as the game went on and I experimented more and more I found it was decently varied and not as bad as I first thought. However late into the game you are given a powered-up sword and for the first five minutes I got a kick out of killing enemies in one hit. But then I realised any and all strategy it once had was gone.\nThe game started out as expected but entertained me throughout until the final boss, a clunky giant with lumbering swings and poor reactions, pretty standard and very boring but forgivable.\n\nOverall I really liked this game, if you have never played Prince of Persia don't go for this one, start with sands of time. If you are a fan then buy this one, it's actually pretty good.","April 6, 2014","true","7.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","3","6","3","0"

No thats no joke you simply cant block. All you do is pressing ctrl if someone is attacking you and between pressing ctrl u do some left clicks, short for a normal attack and long for a strong one and you can combo it up to 5 times in diffrent ways means long-long-short-long-shoert, long-long-long-short-short etc. If you take it this way there are 120 combo-pssibilities! And there is a kick if someone has a shield but forget about this nonsense.\nNo longer 2 swords and diffrent ways to combine left and right handed-hits to freaky  over-the-top moves all you are able to do is left-clicking. Even the wall-slice isnt possible any more. I got bored after the 3th fight.\n\nAnd thats only the fighting system...\n\nThe Puzzles i met so far (i haven`t played a long time right now and i cant imagine its getting more..) are just boring and simple as hell, maybe some of you still remember the activation of the defense system in Part 1? this one was harder then all of the puzzles right now together,but i have to admit the maybe get better later on.\n\nThe Sand-Monsters look... i would use some words i dont want to write down right here but they just aint cool. Its like a zombie out of an 60`s zombie movie, its like the complete cliche and the story feels like: Blablabla hit these zombies now! The story wasn`t the strongest part in the other games neither, but this one beats them all. His brother gets introduced as the new sidekick, but to compare him with farah or even.Kaileena is absurd.\n\nI played the spin-off Prince of Persia (2008) which was pretty funny for me as long as uyou dont expect too much and so i  looked forward to play this game, but im completely dissapointed and all thats left to me is telling everyone who loved the old Games and   was close to Tears when the Prince and Farah stand on the top of the Babylon palast and he starts to tell her the fairytale of the first part again, dont buy this one and left him as your memories as he are and as he deserves to be.\n","February 24, 2014","false","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I don't understand the hate for this game, it's underrated as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nGameplay is more fluid than ever with top notch animations and completely renovated parkour mechanics as well as a mix of cool powers besides controling time, such as controling water and other cool ♥♥♥♥, it makes the platforming and solving puzzles so much more ♥♥♥♥ing fun.\nIt's also the first PoP game with which I have had trouble completing some puzzles, it's really challenging at certain points but I was never fustrated while playing it unlike some of the previous games.\n\nThank ♥♥♥♥ for this new combat system, the combat in previous games was SUCH a drag sometimes, specially in Warrior Within, felt forced as ♥♥♥♥ but I had to push through it to get to cool platforming.\nIn Forgotten Sands though, I actually enjoyed fighting enemies and there's a perfect balance between action and plaforming through out the whole game, the enemies themselves even serve a purpose in a lot of platforming sections which wasn't seen before in the series. You also get this skill tree system to unlock cool new powers for fighting the big waves of enemies the game throws at you. There's a cool enemy variety, as well as really cool monster designs and boss battles. The game even has a challenge mode just for pure gameplay fun.\n\nThe level design and environments are absolutely top notch, my favorite in the series so far. Gorgeous graphics. Amazing soundtrack as always.\nThe prince still has the original voice actor and still has his funny personality from Sands of Time, you get to hear his witty comments and funny remarks all the time. So it still feels like a true PoP game within the original trilogy.\n\nThis game was obviously a tie in with the Sands of Time movie that came out in 2011 so the story is simple and short, and honestly, I prefer it that way. Two Thrones already set a perfect ending to the trilogy and it would suck if they started messing around with characters like Farah, The Vizier, Kaileena or even the Dahaka.\n\nOverall, this game was an absolute joy to play through, it was so fun I beat it in one day. It's quite sad it has such an unfair score\reception by people. Are they blinded by nostalgia or were they actually hoping this game would continue where the trilogy left off? This game was honestly a surprisingly really great attempt at rebooting the series and it's a shame Ubisoft didn't go through with it.","November 29, 2015","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are worse ways to spend your money on Steam, but there are better ways. If you can get a really good sale for a pack that includes Sands of Time, or you're desperate for a Prince of Persia fix and are willing to settle, then get it. Otherwise, Forgotten Sands is competent, but forgettable.\n\nMy first PoP game was Sands of Time (often considered the defining title), but that was only a couple years ago. No nostalgia blindness here. Sands of Time not only holds up after 13 years, but was a superior experience to this one.\n\nForgotten Sands has just the right amount of minor bugs to ruin any sense of immersion without driving you from the game completely. The combat is boring, repetitive, and sometimes blatantly padded. The platforming is adequate, though far from the best in the franchise. The dialogue is competently written, but "get the macguffin" hardly qualifies as a plot and a character saying "oh golly I feel less anxious about _____ now" hardly qualifies as character development.","January 18","false","9.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/33320/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","I wanted to like Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands. I love the (admittedly westernized) genre of strong princes and fair princesses set against a backdrop of rocky mountains, roiling sand and Moorish castles. I was hoping to get some of that with some good graphics, music, story, and some climbing thrown in.\n\nWell, forget the story. There is one, but not so you'd notice. The game is a series of climbing puzzles / challenges, with some hack 'n slash combat every so often. The combat is fairly easy, and the puzzles, with two exceptions, are not that hard to solve. Actually playing the puzzles through, though, is intensely frustrating (I play exclusively with a keyboard + mouse). Lag is extraordinarily high. The game is sometimes not sensitive enough to input, and at other times too sensitive. Some skills and abilities are on a timer (freeze water for X number of seconds), so what seems a minor annoyance at the beginning of the game magnifies into greater and greater significance later on (expect The Aqueducts level to really give you trouble). I can put up with all that, though. The killer blow for me is the same thing I hated in Ubisoft's sister platformer, Assassin's Creed. Get into a place with one path forward, and the camera view locks up: you can't turn and look to see where you need to go without just blindly following the path indicated by the camera lock-up. I absolutely HATE this; I hated it in Assassin's Creed, and I hate it here. In this case, without the ability to look around, you'll die multiple times until you realize, oh, I need to go in X direction, so I need to do the upwards back-and-forth-between-walls climb three times to reach my objective ledge. Incredibly frustrating, and for me a game-breaker.\n\nAs  I said, the story is near non-existent. An invading army is attacking the castle, so the Prince's brother Malik unleashes King Solomon's army - of sand soldiers. The Prince has to figure out a way to corral the army - and stop his brother, who seems to be accumulating the power of the sand-soldiers with each one he kills. Whatever. I never really felt a connection to any of the characters. They're just there as an excuse for some platforming. The graphics are good, even by 2010 standards - fire looks very realistic - but the water is strangely low-res. And there is a lot of water in this game. The music is suitably evocative, but after capturing the initial mood, is repetitive and unexciting (thought the orchestration uses a number of different instruments and it sounds well-played).\n\nIncredibly disappointed in The Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands. Not because it is bad per se, but because frustrating gameplay mechanics mean I'll be moving on to something else.","September 27, 2014","false","12.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The story seems rushed, and while sure, story isn't everything in a platformer, that, combined with lackluster combat and poor camera control makes this feel scraped together. If you are looking for good platforming, it works well in that area, if you are looking for more than that, and can deal with outdated graphics, go for the Sands of Time trilogy instead.","May 26, 2014","false","23.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I've beaten this a long time ago on console so I know it is good from start to finish. The graphics are very good (for its time) and the entire game looks outstanding. The sound is great and the controls are smooth and solid and very intuitive. The gameplay is smooth and the game engine runs flawlessly. Combat is a lot of fun, especially once you learn new skills. The levels are expertly designed and there are some pretty challenging platforming stages. The game is so much fun to play because it just looks so awesome. I really love the artwork. Overall this is well worth it when you can catch it on sale, and is even a good buy at its normal price. The only downside I've found so far is that the game exe crashes when you exit, which doesn't even matter as long as it is on exit. Doesn't make sense but oh well it doesn't affect anything. Also when you are playing if you bring up the steam overlay then go back to the game, no keyboard keys work anymore for some odd reason, but it can be quickly fixed by alt+tabbing out then back in so it's not much of a big deal. It is also a big time button masher when it's combat time. So to avoid killing your hand from left clicking insanely, use a controller to play.

Так же остановка воды не влияется на не заскриптованную воду, например на лужи. Разработчики даже не добавили прогулок по коронам бьющих из под земли фонтанов. Да и всё использование почти не отличается от "нажми кнопку получи упор для прохождения", мало того убрали "розетки" и настенные трамплины, убрали рычаги, возможность вернуться назад и многое другое. Зато добавили прыжки по врагам в сеть акробатики. Мало того что оно совсем не реалистично, так ещё видимо не учли что видя врага начинаешь искать способ его убить и вернуться в режим акробатики, поэтому часто в упор не видишь способа продвинуться дальше. Говорящим мечом конечно никого не удивишь, но меч бубнящий заклинания при каждом взмахе - интересная идея.\n\nБольше всего это похоже на то что Darksiders смешали с Spiderman: Shattered Dimensions и декорациями из четвёртой-шестой частей.","November 27, 2013","false","3.1"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","6","20","0","0"

If you played the whole Sands of Time trilogy, and you hunger for more, Forgotten Sands will be perfect for you. If you're hoping for a new take on the franchise, you're looking in the wrong place - Forgotten Sands is not about innovation. It has the same plot and setting as every game in the Sands of Time trilogy, the same old Prince (snarky, not angsty) as ever, and the same kinds of puzzles and fights. (To be fair, the Prince gets a couple new abilities that he's never seen before to spice things up. Nothing groundbreaking, though.) However, it has refined all these so that the bad elements - quick time events, awkward chariot races, angsty Prince from the second game - have been removed and the good ones rebalanced to make them better. It is the Sands of Time trilogy with all the burrs polished away. Don't play this one first, but if you've already done the other three, Forgotten Sands is worth your time.","December 27, 2011","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Platforming is largely the same as the previous games, but with a few new moves such as freezing water to create walls or climbable pillars. Sometimes it gets rather complex to do wallruns, freeze, reverse time, etc. which presents a certain level of challenge.\n\nCombat is much improved in this game, and is much less boring than in the previous games. Mostly because of the upgrades available after collecting experience points. It makes you happy to fight hordes of enemies, knowing you'll be able to get the next upgrade. Those include adding to your health and energy bars, as well as powerups that can be used against enemies. The story is kinda meh and the game is surprisingly short, but other than that it's very enjoyable.

Forgotten Sands does not hold back on the acrobatics, and the amount of "are you sure that can be done" moments towards the end are AWESOME! :) The addition of water freezing and recalling memory powers add to the complexity of the acrobatics in an good way; you always get satisfaction when pulling off that next imposible stunt!

I was one of the people who was disappointed with the  PoP game made in 2008, the cell shaded styled one . I enjoyed it for what it was but I felt it was a move in the wrong direction. I liked the beautiful art design but it really was just too easy.\n\nAs for this game, considering it was made in 2010 the graphics were very well done. The prince and his surroundings are very detailed and everywhere you look there has been a great attention to creating a beautiful world to enjoy. From the wisps of sand moving below a swinging trap, the great use of light peering through cracks or the fine details on clothing and armor. Everything looks great. Including the newly designed prince. PoP games have always had great graphics and this game continues that tradition.\n\nAs for the game play, I think it is great how the designers have added the control of elements, like water, into the great gameplay that we saw in the previous games. It really adds a welcome new twist to the action/puzzle solving style this game series has always done so well.\n\nI see alot of people knocking the combat, well for me I love it. I like that I can charge my attacks, I like that I can kick enemies down and I really like the addition of finishing moves that are stylish and enjoyable to pull off. Quite simply this is the best combat engine ever use in a PoP game. As for it being easy, well I think it just makes you feel more powerful and I for one enjoy the fact that its not frustrating. It keeps the game moving along and that is something I prefer over games that have overly difficult combat (ex : Ninja Gaiden, Dark Souls) I think it was done purposely because the game was meant to be enjoyed by more than just hardcore gamers.\n\nOne thing that makes the combat seem easy is the addition of powers that you unlock with experience points. Like an RPG you can spend these points anyway you see fit to give you special abilities like stoneskin or allow you to knockdown all surrounding enemies with a wind based attack. Again I find these abilities a welcome addition to the game and I like the carrot being dangled knowing that I have more and more powerful ones to unlock as I progress through the game.\n\nAs for the sound I think this was well done, just like everything else in the game. From the voice acting to that music to the background sounds everything works well and never distracts for the experience. Which for me is what good sound design is.\n\nI can't help but wonder what it is that gamers and reviewers who knock this game want from their games. This game is polished and fine tuned. It looks great and plays great. It has everything we loved about the past games while injecting some fresh new ideas into the mix. It gives you more of everything. More enemies, more abilities, more combat choice with finishers, new puzzles that use traps and timing as well as the new addition of elements like turning water solid. I think people look for the smallest imperfections when they should be enjoying what is so good in the game.\n\nSure the camera can occasionally be out of place, but what game like this has a perfect camera ? Actually I haven't experienced any real problem with it so far anyway. It has a snap behind button and rotation control, so whats the problem ?\n\nPrince of Persia Forgotten Sands is an excellent game and in my opinion the best in the series. It has a great balance of action, combat and puzzle solving all set in a beautiful world and for me thats all I wanted and the team at ubisoft delivered in this latest PoP adventure.","September 18, 2012","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the very start you see what will happen and if you think there is some major twist in the game that would make you go WOW, you're wrong.\n\nCharacters are blander than water. No humour, no stoy, no smart comments, I swear it would be more interesting if every character would just stay silent.\n\nAlso, with Ubisoft you'd expect some wonderful graphics at least. Well, I feel like the Sands of Time had better graphics. If I don't even mention PoP 2008 or what it was which was work of art in the graphics department. The prince is yellow, his liver must be failing big-time. Painfuly blue eyes, that can't be good for the retina in such sun. And muscles are showing as if there were no skin whatsoever.\n\nFirst thing the tutorial tells you that you can move your camera as much as you want in a very easy way. A first lie too, coz most of the jumps and whatnot are from forced perspective. Only fights are actual move-as-you-wish and not all at that.\n\nThe game is short, so linear it's painful. Puzzles ... there are no puzzles, for each room the game camera pans up, following the path you have to take to get through.\n\nThe fights are swarm, which is very popular, but when you have maybe 2 combos and they all consist of clicking the mouse's left button it gets kinda old very fast.\n\nThe biggest challenge in the game is pressing SHIFT R-Mouse-button and ALT at the right times. And even that is not a challenge. In about 5min your hand starts working on reflex and it's right 95% of the time.\n\nSome things are worth suffering Uplay for ... this is most definitely NOT one of them.","March 13, 2015","false","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are spectacular to see and add complexity and fun to traveling. Level design is also cleverly creative, utilizing all Prince's powers. Combat is fluid and dynamic though sometime repetitive. There is no life upgrade but improving with experience and upgrade points which well integrated into the game increasing depth and customization.

Overall the game is very reminiscent of the first game from the platforming, some of the combat and the Prince's personality/musings.

The upgrades were rather simple/straightforward though felt like it could be expanded on.

In many aspects it really does feel like a refreshed portion of the trilogy while bringing in fresh new elements, other portions however veer off from what I expected from the game going in. Playing the game when it came out honestly I hated it for stupid reasons but recently replaying it I found it an excellent game and I actually look forward to playing it again sometime.\n\nLet me start by saying that this game is in NO way connected to the movie.  This installment is almost completely unconnected to the Sands of Time trilogy, in fact the only character featured in this who was in the trilogy is the Prince.  When I first played the game I really hated this, looking back however I feel a lot of care went into giving the feel of playing the trilogy while still leaving the original story alone.\n\nParkour is where in my oppinion this game shines, it feels like the trilogy on roids in this aspect. Everything just runs so fluid and the Prince is more agile than ever.  As the game progressed you obtain powers that allow you to control the environment which just adds to the amazing vibe the parkour gives off. What else can I say aside from I feel satisfied when I run up walls?\n\nCombat is almost completely different from the trilogy, you cannot duel wield in this game which honestly is a little dissapointing from the start for me. The combat in this game seems to focus on taking down numerous enemies at a time. I would be a liar if I said that I didn't enjoy the combat in this game but it could have been greatly improved. With the trilogy it was awesome to use the environment to your advantage, this game however is parkour and combat are hardly ever connected. It's a crying shame actually as I think the abilities you unlock could have had some interesting uses in battle.\n\nAll in all for me this is a welcome addition to the franchise. If you are a fan of the trilogy I definitely reccomend giving this game a shot as more than likely you will like it. Just remember this has nothing to really do with the trilogy and although that may be a disappointment to some I for one am happy that the trilogy was not tampered with.","July 17, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this game along with The Sands of Time which, in my opinion, isn't as good as The Forgotten Sands. BE WARNED: you have to create/log in with a Uplay account in order to play this game.\n\nI haven't gotten too far into the story, but it's not awful. It's not that great either, but it's good enough that you're at the very least slightly interested. Basically, it starts out with you going to visit your brother, only to find out your brother's palace/castle being attacked. You fight some enemies and get familiar with the platforming. Once you meet up with your brother, he tries to unleashe Solomon's Army, the only hope for not losing the battle. This doesn't go as planned since you are then told that army is evil. That's about all that happens at the very beginning.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty fun. The swordfighting is enjoyable and well animated. You basically have three attacks: normal attack, strong attack, and aerial attack. Also, you can't block, just dive-roll. The platforming is very fun as well. Although it's really no different from the platforming in The Sands of Time, it seems more exciting in this game for some reason to me.\n\nThe game looks great. Like I said, the animations are pretty good and the characters look awesome. As far as I've gotten into the game (which is only a few hours) there isn't much variation in the locations. However, this is probably because you're in the same place.\n\nThe music is good too. Not the best soundtrack for a game I've ever heard, but it goes along nicely with the game.\n\nThere are also a few extra things in this game: challenge maps and extra skins/costumes. You get one challenge map and costume by entering the CD key in the Extras menu. You can also get Ezio's costume from Assassin's Creed by buying it with points through Uplay.\n\nOverall, Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands is a pretty enjoyable experience. Fun combat and platforming and a relatively interesting story make this a good buy. The main things I don't like are the inability to block during combat and how a Uplay account is required to play, although this doesn't bother me a whole lot.\n\nI give this game an 8.5/10.","March 22, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Platforming is largely the same as the previous games, but with a few new moves such as freezing water to create walls or climbable pillars. Sometimes it gets rather complex to do wallruns, freeze, reverse time, etc. which presents a certain level of challenge.\n\nCombat is much improved in this game, and is much less boring than in the previous games. Mostly because of the upgrades available after collecting experience points. It makes you happy to fight hordes of enemies, knowing you'll be able to get the next upgrade. Those include adding to your health and energy bars, as well as powerups that can be used against enemies. The story is kinda meh and the game is surprisingly short, but other than that it's very enjoyable. More PoP fare for fans of the series, with a few new well-executed features. 7/10","September 5, 2012","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes the controls and automatic camera movement can get a little frustrating, but overall it's a nice game. I understand that the automatic camera movement and restrictions are necessary to understand where to go next, but sometimes it switches camera positions while doing an important move which then fails, because you need to switch directions according to the new camera position. Whichs ends up in dying and using another sand/history-slot.

In many aspects it really does feel like a refreshed portion of the trilogy while bringing in fresh new elements, other portions however veer off from what I expected from the game going in. Playing the game when it came out honestly I hated it for stupid reasons but recently replaying it I found it an excellent game and I actually look forward to playing it again sometime.\n\nLet me start by saying that this game is in NO way connected to the movie.  This installment is almost completely unconnected to the Sands of Time trilogy, in fact the only character featured in this who was in the trilogy is the Prince.  When I first played the game I really hated this, looking back however I feel a lot of care went into giving the feel of playing the trilogy while still leaving the original story alone.\n\nParkour is where in my oppinion this game shines, it feels like the trilogy on roids in this aspect. Everything just runs so fluid and the Prince is more agile than ever.  As the game progressed you obtain powers that allow you to control the environment which just adds to the amazing vibe the parkour gives off. What else can I say aside from I feel satisfied when I run up walls?\n\nCombat is almost completely different from the trilogy, you cannot duel wield in this game which honestly is a little dissapointing from the start for me. The combat in this game seems to focus on taking down numerous enemies at a time. I would be a liar if I said that I didn't enjoy the combat in this game but it could have been greatly improved. With the trilogy it was awesome to use the environment to your advantage, this game however is parkour and combat are hardly ever connected. It's a crying shame actually as I think the abilities you unlock could have had some interesting uses in battle.\n\nAll in all for me this is a welcome addition to the franchise. If you are a fan of the trilogy I definitely reccomend giving this game a shot as more than likely you will like it. Just remember this has nothing to really do with the trilogy and although that may be a disappointment to some I for one am happy that the trilogy was not tampered with.","July 17, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the very start you see what will happen and if you think there is some major twist in the game that would make you go WOW, you're wrong.\n\nCharacters are blander than water. No humour, no stoy, no smart comments, I swear it would be more interesting if every character would just stay silent.\n\nAlso, with Ubisoft you'd expect some wonderful graphics at least. Well, I feel like the Sands of Time had better graphics. If I don't even mention PoP 2008 or what it was which was work of art in the graphics department. The prince is yellow, his liver must be failing big-time. Painfuly blue eyes, that can't be good for the retina in such sun. And muscles are showing as if there were no skin whatsoever.\n\nFirst thing the tutorial tells you that you can move your camera as much as you want in a very easy way. A first lie too, coz most of the jumps and whatnot are from forced perspective. Only fights are actual move-as-you-wish and not all at that.\n\nThe game is short, so linear it's painful. Puzzles ... there are no puzzles, for each room the game camera pans up, following the path you have to take to get through.\n\nThe fights are swarm, which is very popular, but when you have maybe 2 combos and they all consist of clicking the mouse's left button it gets kinda old very fast.\n\nThe biggest challenge in the game is pressing SHIFT R-Mouse-button and ALT at the right times. And even that is not a challenge. In about 5min your hand starts working on reflex and it's right 95% of the time.\n\nSome things are worth suffering Uplay for ... this is most definitely NOT one of them.","March 13, 2015","false","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Forgotten Sands does not hold back on the acrobatics, and the amount of "are you sure that can be done" moments towards the end are AWESOME! :) The addition of water freezing and recalling memory powers add to the complexity of the acrobatics in an good way; you always get satisfaction when pulling off that next imposible stunt!

Plus the difficulty for the obstacles was pretty good.\n\n+ It looks pretty (nothing really to add here)\n\n- Really meh story: Dumb brother releases evil thing, brother gets possessed, go kill brother. There, now you can save some time and not watch the boring cutscenes.\n\n- Comabt: It happens way too frequently and it almost always boils down to "Mash X until everything is dead". Sometimes there are some super big guys that charge you, but even then you just need to dodge and then mash X. There are some power-ups you can get once you get enough XP from enemies, but honestly I just found mashing X was way easier and quicker then using the powers.\n\n- Screen tearing: There's no VSync option so you're going to have to live with it! It mostly happens during cutscenes but it's still really annoying. (especially one paticular cutscene had nearly the entire screen screen tearing yuck)\n\n- GLITCHES: Definitely the most annoying thing about this game! A few times I've had poles disapear while I was on them and other poles wouldn't let me grab onto them for some reason, but those didn't happen that often. The most annoying and frequent glitch, however, was sometimes if you got hit by a big baddy or a trap you would fall down and be unable to get back up for a few seconds. Luckily you usually didn't take damage while you were like this, but it happened way too frequently for me to just me a minor nuisance.\n\n- Crashes: I had the game crash 4 times while I played, 3 of those was in one paticular area that I did eventually get past (there were a lot of enemies that wouldn't give XP which I tried to skip, but once I killed most of them I got past it) and once when the credits were nearly finished. Maybe I was just unlucky and they might not happen to you, but I thought I should still point this out.\n\n- Uplay: You better have a stable connection to play this! (plus any other negatives associated w/ Uplay) I didn't have any Uplay problems while playing but I thought I should point it out anyway.\n\nSo while there are a lot of negatives, I did enjoy the platforming enough where I normally would say "Maybe?". So if you think you can get though the comabt and annoying glitches, then maybe get it when it's on sale? Otherwise, I wouldn't blame you for skipping this.","September 25, 2015","false","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Disagreement doesn't make you right or wrong, and neither does agreeing.\n\nHeresy. Complete and total heresy, not worthy of the title, nor the story used.\n\nAny who praise this heretical slanderous filth are not welcome, and I shun them.\n\nThe story was so far removed from the original trilogy that it can't even be considered filler. It falls far too much on it's "improved graphics", which don't make up for the incredibly forgiving combat. Though at least it's better than no failure state whatsoever. *cough previous title after Two Thrones *cough*\n\nEnemies didn't feel aggresive enough for how weak they were, and the ability to regenerate health in combat (via slain enemies) just made it feel nothing like a Prince of Persia game. The same can be said about the upgrade system. The original trilogy had a large variety of bonuses that rewarded you for exploring. Found a hidden area, got through a bit of a course? It gave you an upgrade to your health. Not in this game.\n\nSimply killing enemies and choosing what to level up made it feel more like an RPG than the previous titles. I have not been this disgusted by a continuation of a series since Prototype 2 and it's awful, bland changes to an otherwise interesting and enjoyable system.","October 19, 2013","false","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Hack and slash style of combat takes away the fun. The "free the water" ability is more a gimmick then unique.\nAnd finally it lacks any good writing. The story simply got patched inbetween the second and third game of the the sands triology.\nIn my opionon, just play the first three sands of time games, they are all unique and worthwhile, no matter what console. The first two being prime examples of how to mix paqour and fighting.\nThey probably led to the AC franchise with the first one, as its very heavy on wallrunning and climbing. The second one doing way more fighting. The third one being a nice mix, even though it based on an alternative ending of the second one wich probably 5% of the players experienced and were confused until they googled it. And finally there was this. A cashin with no meaningful story stuffed inbetween the story of better games with less mechanics and less enjoyable gameplay.\nJust dont.\n'nuff said","February 3, 2015","false","7.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

You can actually fight dozens of enemies in a single fight, and for discount Arkham combat, it's not bad. Slightly more actual enemy variety. Decent mechanics for combat, acrobatics, puzzles, traps, and great balance between how much they appear in this, albeit few to no real changes or additions. Saving Checkpoints are very well-placed. Great design all the way... everything looks and sounds great. Pretty much every good element from the series is in this, and they almost all work.\n\nCons: as is typical for midquels: irrelevant and, yeah, forgettable, through and through: story, location, conflict, enemies, characters(other than the Prince), etc. Watered down traps. Plays it too safe. Lazy, half-hearted attempt at recapturing the, well, magic, of the Sands of Time trilogy: it especially wants to be the first of those three, with an opening way too similar. Why does control of the four elements essentially amount to a handful of parlor tricks? Bland magic powers, and they replace, rather than being added to, the use of Time manipulation during combat: all that's left is Rewinding(which in this doesn't comes from the Sands of Time. How many different magic sources in ancient Persia let you rewind time?). Stiff control of the Prince, especially with the Rewind, which feels like you have to rewind a certain amount, rather than you pinpointing the second you want to proceed from. Being knocked down half the time glitches to where it's difficult to get back up for a few seconds. Enemy AI kind of just... stops if enemies aren't in a group, and a few meters away from you. We're back to slash-at-the-calves boss fights. This is a few years into Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed producing, and so this does have some of “it looks cool but isn't that challenging”.\n\nMy recommendation: if like me you love this franchise, or at least this kind of game, it's a fine installment. If not, go for one of the others, and in general, skip this one. Note that this version, for the PC, is the same as for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, but completely different from the Wii version.","May 2","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lutsy/recommended/33320/","lutsy","Vaylute ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lutsy/","695 products in account","TL;DRThis is basically Prince of Persia: SoT, climbing puzzles and all, with a few God of War elements slipped in. It starts slow at first and man does it feel its age, but gets pretty good halfway through.\nHow long is it? Main game is about 6 hours, NG+ and bonuses add a few more.\nDid you like it? Yeah, but it took a while for me to warm up to.\nHow much should I spend on it? Around $5. Wait for a sale, or get Sands of Time.\n\n=== Overview ===\nPrince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands tries to bring back a lot of what made the Sands of Time game successful - the frantic, skill-based jumps and puzzles, the snarky main character, and the simpler combat. Problem is, where the original game shined (in story and in characters), this game fell flat on its face. The environments are so bland and same-y, the story is completely flat, and the moments where the prince's snide nature comes out are just too few and far between. Even the combat starts to feel a bit wonky and boring. Where the game really shines is in the puzzles. Swiftly leaping between traps, timing your jumps just right, was a lot of fun, especially when you get really neat special powers like the ability to stop water mid-air for some fascinating puzzles.\n\nI'll be honest though, it took me a couple times of dropping the game and coming back to it to finish it, but it got fun half-way through.\n\n=== The good ===+ Great parkour-styled puzzles\n+ They brought back the original Sands of Time voice actor!\n+ They did come up with a couple of neat settings for you solve your way through.\n+ Certain special powers, like the ability to stop water mid-air, was really fun.\n\n=== The bad === - Flat, uninteresting characters.\n- Bland, one-note story.\n- Boring music.\n- The combat is snore-tastic and grindy.\n- Very little replay value.\n- The environments hardly make any sense at certain points.\n\nBottom Line If you're bored and want a Prince of Persia game to turn your brain off and play, this'll do it for you. Just be prepared to turn your brain back on half way through the game once the devs started trying.","January 30","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
