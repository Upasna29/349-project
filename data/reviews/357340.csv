"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/recommended/357340/","MrWoodenSheep","MrWoodenSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/","2273 products in account","Cobalt is an action platformer with very satisfying combat mechanics.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LQ__S1SiSM\nThe game is relatively easy to pickup, but there are a lot of tools given to you that if used properly, can give you the edge over your enemies. Timing and skill is quite important when it comes to combat, which makes it that much more satisfying.\n\nFirst, I should mention that you can't aim freely in this game. You shoot wherever the character is facing, which is left or right. That is unless you hold the crouch or sneak button. That makes your character aim at the closest enemy automatically. That's how you can take out enemies on ceilings, or in the air. Your character will also auto-aim at enemies while you roll.\n\nRolling has other uses as too. If you roll into an enemy projectile, then you will deflect it and avoid taking damage. If it hits your head directly while rolling, then you'll deflect it at your enemy and in turn hurting them. However, if the projectile hits your feet while rolling, then you will take damage. It's little things like this that continue to make the gunplay interesting in this game.\nOne detail I love is that if you time it just right, you can punch the ground as you roll to launch yourself into the air.\n\nYour arsenal consists of melee weapons, firearms and thrown objects. All of these add variety when it comes to destroying your foes. It's fun stuff!\n\nThere are two modes to choose from.\nStory mode will have you making your way through huge levels, navigating different paths, completing puzzles, picking doors, discovering secrets etc. It's similar to other "metroidvania" games if you want a more direct comparison. This mode is also sprinkled with a few cutscenes and dialogue, which are generally quite funny and well written.\n\nThe arcade mode pits you in constant action. You can choose combat or speed mode here. Speed mode has you try to navigate through levels at high speeds, where combat mode lets you wreak havoc. You've got shields, cool armour and tonnes of enemies to mow through. You feel like a badass.\n\nMy only gripe with the game so far, is sometimes you'll want to break a barrier above you, and since it's not an enemy, your character will not auto aim at it. That means you need to roll and time your shot in hopes that it'll hit the barrier. It would be nice in cases like this if you could aim upwards.\n\nI absolutely love the soundtrack. A lot of it consists of 80s dark synth-y type of stuff, although it's got quite a variety.\n\nLastly, in all games, I always find myself moving my character to the music. Crouching to the beat and turning with the melody. This game actually rewards you for it! If you do certain actions in the rhythm, it gives you points. I just love that little detail, as it encourages you to have fun with little details like dancing to music.\n\nOverall, I think it's a really solid game, with a lot of variety when it comes to game modes, and the combat is really what takes the cake. Fun, and satisfying.","February 2","true","15.4"," 130 of 153 people (85%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","85","130","153","11","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Isogash/recommended/357340/","Isogash","Isogash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Isogash/","351 products in account","To me this game is already a timeless classic.\n\nStory: 8/10. A solid plot with plenty of humour. Not a masterpiece, but the story is conveyed excellently through the campaign style. Story mode is not the primary focus of Cobalt, but it is a lengthy, challenging and rewarding campaign. The lore behind the game is intriguing and leaks through into some of the arcade mode maps, which I think is a really nice touch.\n\nGraphics: 9/10. It's not beautiful pixel art and it's no Mona Lisa, but playing some of the custom maps completely convinced me that this game can look really amazing.\n\nSound: 9/10. The music is catchy and memorable and the sound fx perfectly match what is happening in-game, slowing down when the time dilation kicks in. I can't think of anything I would change here.\n\nGameplay: Beyond 10. In an age of games where the gameplay is often left to one side, Cobalt turns around and says "here's what it means to be a gameplay focused game." The entire game is physical and feels very natural after a while at the controls. There are really endless possibilities to what can be done inside the Cobalt engine, which is why I'm incredibly excited to see that there are already modding possibilities. Never before have I played a game that creates so many awesome moments. Doing a backflip over a missile whilst shooting your gun at a grenade so it bounces off a wall and into another player is just tame to me now. This is the game that will make you squeal, will make you sweat and will make you feel like the most awesome person in the universe.\n\nCobalt sets the bar for gameplay now. Forget Mario, forget Smash Bros, forget every other game under the sun. I will never be able to look at another game again the same way. If you think this is just another arena brawler like Duck Game and Towerfall then think again. I can't play those kind of games anymore without thinking "man, I'd rather just be playing Cobalt."","February 3","true","241.0"," 54 of 64 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","54","64","5","4"

Almost 7 hours in and I am extremely satisfied!\n\nAbout 2 years ago I bought the alpha because that by itself looked simply amazing and revolutionary. I am now 7% complete with the story mission and have very little to complain about. The story has kept me interested a lot of characters lack depth but rarely humor. Dialouge is actually kind of fun and will leave you laughing.(Just remember your ABCs cobalt) The developers are AMAZING, they are helpful, answered my questions personally, and even played with me WUT!? Many thought this game was abandoned for a long period of time, but its my guess they were spending that time adding the LOADS of content that is in game now.\n\nI played probably 50+ hours of the alpha and know a lot about the multi player, survival, team strike etc. Am excited to explore the new features and additions. Despite probably a crash or two every hour the alpha was a fun experience by itself which should say something. Oh and if you have a gamepad USE IT, the keyboard controls are extremely bizzare especially if you are a newblett. Oh and a side note on that game pad controls are changed from the alpha, and they are much easier to use.\n\nThe game has a story that seems well put together, and it feels like the three or so man dev team actually cares about the backstorys, lore, etc. The mystery has kept me playing, but for the love of my foot IM GETTING SICK OF THE SAME STUPID COMPUTER BOSS FIGHT, im not kidding I WILL KICK MYSELF IF I HAVE TO FIGHT THAT FRIKIN COMPUTER AGAIN. 3rd times the charm devs, change it up a little.\n\nExpect to feel like a complete mlg rekt blazit noscope proscope oh baby a triple double, backfliping slowmotion maniac, in the multiplayer, which needs some connection issues fixed, it feels laggy and slow curently.\n\nSo um yeah buy it,\n\nenjoy it,\n\nlove it.\n\nCobalt/10\n\nWoop","February 2","true","37.9"," 44 of 49 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","44","49","10","0"

Not only was a stellar team working tirelessly to put such a complex game together, they were streaming their development process; There was always open communication between the devs and the community. Not only this, but they were backed by Mojang- A new testament to the reliability of small-team game developement.\n\nCobalt is a game of reflex, maneuverability and precision. There is no shortage of skills and strategy to be employed and the skill ceiling will leave casual gamers and veterans alike in awe of the possibilities of team composition, movement, vantage points, and finger dexterity.\n\nOne of the coolest features of Cobalt is the Time Dialation mechanic which slows time locally (relevant to each player) giving players more time to react to incoming projectiles. It is this mechanic (which I assume was a pain in the ♥♥♥ to get working consistantly for multiplayer) which enables players to perform feats which would simply be impossible in other platformer/shooters.\n\nThere is a copious amount of weapons, accessories, and characters ensuring that every thinkable playstyle can be catered to and employed successfully. This is especially useful for players hoping to customize their online experience, essentially allowing users to create their own classes in multiplayer matches and by extension, a new meta game for each lobby you join.\n\nFans of PVP gameplay will get hours of enjoyment from this title. A true test of gaming skill. Marvelous. Simply marvelous.","February 6","true","61.0"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

Oxeye's run-and-gun platformer has action, charm, and humour by the spadeload and is absolutely worth the asking price. It also has giant sabertooth space hamsters!\n\nBattles in both singleplayer and online are chaotic and will often have unpredictable and hilarious outcomes, but you never feel that you've lost control. Time slows down as bullets and grenades get close to you, giving you the opportunity to execute a pixel-perfect dodge or perhaps even punch a grenade right back at whoever threw it! Facing a hail of bullets? No problem: do a combat roll straight into them and reflect them off the top of your robot's armoured head!\n\nAlthough some people have commented that you need a gamepad, I'm getting on just fine with keyboard controls.

Nonetheless, let's talk about the game itself -- the graphics are pretty, the soundtrack is amazing and the gameplay is quite unique; despite the bullet time, it's a really fast paced game that requires a lot of precision, reflex, teamwork and strategy.\n\nThere are dozens of weapons and game modes, making it even more enjoyable and not as repetitive. Since there are so many mechanics that you need to understand and improve, every match is a different experience as you get progressively better, be it at dodging, at aiming, moving around the map and whatnot.\n\nIt might take a while for some people to get used to the controls, especially if you're on the keyboard (some prefer a controller, since you don't have a mouse aiming system) but it's no big deal, they respond well and that's enough for the gameplay to be smooth. Even when you're playing in a room where you've ~200 ping, the match is still enjoyable.\n\nAltogether, the game is amazing, has a lot of mechanics and technics that you can get good at, an awesome soundtrack that fits very well and simple but elegant graphics. I would totally recommend it, especially if you can gather your friends to play with, as with every game, it's way more enjoyable with someone you know.","February 13","true","8.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

This is something that can only be fully understood once you can play multiplayer deathmatch at sufficiently high level. I have played single player for 4 or 5 hours, but all of the rest was multiplayer deathmatch.\n\nBecause the combat in Cobalt is deep and refined.\n\nEach minute decision of when to spin, when to jump, when to air jump, and on which direction, creates a *very* fluid and natural response in the player character. The result is that movement alone is a skill that you can spend hours upon hours mastering — and the range of possibilities is so vast that after practicing just movement for many hours (yes, I spent several hours jumping around alone in DM maps) the skill cap is still nowhere to be found.\n\nOn top of this, every weapon is its own delicious little niche of discovery. Take grenades, for instance. The path trajectory of grenades is influenced by your movement in multiple ways: (1) grenades will go further the longer you press the fire button; (2) grenades will inherit the speed at which your character is moving; (3) spinning allows you to throw grenades on any direction by correctly timing the release button, and (4) some grenades bounce off walls, some explode on impact, some get stuck to walls. These four factors multiply into *so many* possibilities! With the right sense of the thing, you can learn to place a grenade almost anywhere at almost any moment, with a good idea of when it will blow up. Someone is about to fall on top of you? Spin an explode-on-impact grenade directly above while falling down. Opposite team is rushing through a fixed path in large numbers? Spin a grenade in a long, tall arc to stall them from a safe position. Grenade throwing is a huge skill all in itself, and can make or break an entire game.\n\nOr take punching, for another unpopular example. To properly punch your adversary requires a mix of timing, prediction (of what he will do), jumping and spinning (to avoid his shots), so that if you can do it properly the visual end-result looks as if a robot ninja from hell is warping a vortex of pure kung-fu on his unwitting prey. If you add on top of that that punching the ground or the wall will push you away from it, you will come to realize that even the damned melee weapon is beautifully designed.\n\nAnd I could go on... I'm sure there is plenty of things I didn't discover!\n\nLet me give you two parting tips for playing multiplayer: You can configure your keyboard to have three different keys for immediately shooting each category of weapon (melee, fire, grenade), and three different keys for selecting the weapon in each category. (By default cobalt you have three keys for selecting the weapon in each category and one fire key to fire the weapon in the category that was last selected; this will become a roadblock if you keep at it)\n\nMuch luck and have fun,\nBruno\n","April 24","true","101.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

Sometimes auto-aim can be a drag but you'll get used to it and work with it.\nThere is online multiplayer but not many people playing, so probably local is the way to go. Online is certainly possible and fun, only it's possible to have 0 people online.\nThe story is alright. The level design is a bit open so sometimes you fall or die and then there will be some boring backtracking and finding your way. The story is fully 2 player coop so that's good.\nI don't know why everybody hates the keyboard controlls. I own four xbox360 gamepads, but I prefer to play this game with the keyboard. It works fine to me.\nThere are challengen you can complete which are pretty fun.\nThe game isn't too expensive, maybe wait for a sale but that could take a while.

Play story mode a bit (or a lot because there are loads of things to do), play a variety of gamemodes with your friends, including classic deathmatch, but also original gamemodes like Plug Slam, where the object is to get the 'ball' into the opponents goal by any means necessary (think throwing, shooting, exploding).\n\nThe singleplayer modes are plenty difficult, and you will come across situations where you're surrounded by legions of robots and because you were stupid like me, forget to stock up on ammo and have to resort to punching them to death (which is difficult but you feel like a badass when you succeed). This is one of the most fun parts of the game: you can do some crazy ninja ♥♥♥♥ and kick some real ♥♥♥ once you get good at it. And you never stop becoming better at it.\n\nMost gamemodes are also available online, which is also loads of fun when you don't have friends. There is also an extremely expansive map editor, which can lead to amazing things if you think creatively. I learn new things everytime I open it.\n\nThe visuals are great and the weapons feel very satisfiying to use. The soundtrack is brilliant and really fits the game well! I've almost never had problems with lag either, and if I did, it was because I created a tower of about 30 giant mech robots all firing homing missiles stacked on top of eachother in the editor.\n\nThe only issue I see with the game (and it's arguable it's even the games fault) is that there aren't that many players. This means you'll only see a couple online games at a time. Still, the most popular gamemodes (TeamStrike and Survival) always have at least one open game so it's bearable.","April 13","true","168.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Forget everything you’ve learned about combat. Cobalt’s slo-mo mechanic lets you perform moves that other games can’t comprehend. Play though the story and discover answers to mysterious questions including: What happened to the humans? Why am I riding a space hamster? How is my cyborg head so good at deflecting bullets? Multiplayer is a less cryptic, though equally enjoyable affair: face off against friends and enemies in local or online multiplayer, learn the intricacies of over 80 maps and 67 weapons, and dominate the leaderboards.  -  Highly Recommended!","February 4","true","0.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

So I told myself "just give it another shot" and I'm glad I did.  After about an hour of practice it was as if a gift from heaven was sent down by God himself.

Flipping through the air in slow motion while ricocheting bullets back into enemies as you time a grenade throw just perfectly into your enemies face. Wow.. Cobalt is such a unique concept.  There is really nothing like it so that means it just takes some time to get used.

A full length story driven single player game with characters and tons of different weapons, equipment and variety in it's level design both from an aesthetic and mechanical perspective.\n\nThe character moves at the perfect speed to have the option of chaining together exhilarating moves such as deflecting bullets back at enemies while dodging others and shooting down alarms if you can time the moves correctly.\n\nIt feels like it was "finished" years ago by the standards of most games and rather than polishing it up and releasing it, the devs decided to fine tune and add depth, content and features, perhaps without the pressure of money running out with the backing of Mojang's millions.\n\nOn top of all of that the multiplayer game is anything but a tacked on extra.

This does get offset by the fact that the new gamemode, plug slam, is an incredible amount of fun! Kinda like soccer except with way more luck involved, but also a bunch of strategy!\n\nOther negative is the fact that the original survival mode was fully taken out (replaced with the waves survival), as that pretty much defined Cobalt for me back when it didn't have the story mode in.","February 2","true","21.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flyhippie/recommended/357340/","flyhippie","Panther","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flyhippie/","108 products in account","I bought this game on Jan 2nd 2012\n\nAfter a long dev process and failed promises of linux and MacOS ports,  admin abuse of stupid forum rules that almost eroded any remaining community surrounding the game beyond the devs themselves.. and the acquisition of Oxeyes parent company by Microsoft. We have Cobalt.\n\nIt is a wonder that this game ever made it through development and despite my gripes with the team involved, they obviously love the game and have put their heart and soul in to it. The game now features a story mode with lots of hidden secrets, great puzzles and some very geeky if not a little clunky, dialogue.\n\nMultiplayer can be a really fun experience of total mayhem, and yet I have still always enjoyed my solo runs more. Take from that what you will, but Cobalt as an experience definitely has a lot to offer.\n\nWorth noting that I have a controller and yet choose to play with the keyboard, so don't let the prospect of that deter you.\n\nI believe this is a game that could have benefited from steams EA program  but I understand why they didn't or couldn't go for it.. Especially after how rigidly they policed development through their own medium, I can imagine had they been so totalitarian on the steam forums this game would have a bag of negative reviews already.\n\nThat being said as a new comer you don't need to have any dealing with Oxeye at all. This is a finished product and while arguably a tad overpriced at this point (I paid closer to £5, 4 years ago). I still feel it an easy recommendation to those intrigued by the prospect of a skill based side scroller.","February 2","true","8.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Fast forward two weeks, I had purchased the alpha of the game and vested a good 20 hours into it.\n\nCobalt's emergence from alpha has been a progressive and evident one. This 'version 1.0' of Cobalt is chuck-full of features that make the game limitless in fun and interest: multiplayer is awesome, and the story mode is quite imaginative as far as platformers go. The map designs by the developers are just the tip of the iceberg, as you can design your own maps & levels.\n\n$20 is not too much, might I add, for a game that has this extensive amount of gameplay. I have already sunk countless hours, and I'm not kidding when I say this game is still highly playable after 2 and a half years of playing it. It has a novelty, succession of updates, and evident quality.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean that Cobalt is 110% awesome, however. There is a learning curve and rather difficult controls. However, some messing around and patience is sure to get you a control setup you will enjoy. I find that anyone that complains of the game's controls has always proven impatient or ends up enjoying the game once they grasp the understand of 'how to play.' The great thing is that the controls are customizable and I understand gamepad support is available.\n\nOverall, the game has an outstanding blend of fast-pace and slow-mo shooting action, accompanied by some great creative direction in design. As far as platformers go, there are few as good as Cobalt. As far as combat platformers go, there are none as good as Cobalt. The novelty, playability, design, and organic gameplay that Cobalt provides is one of the most unique and imaginative platformers around. You will not be disappointed.","February 4","true","2.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I came in expecting another side scrolling shooter and found a much more intricate and complex design with some real character to it.  The graphical design is stylized and matched by ambient as well as beat heavy music.  The audio thump of weapons firing, punches connecting and robots being gibbed is satisfying every single time.\nIt is easy to tell that this is a labour of love.  Oxeye has been working on this game for 6 years, and it shows.  With multiple single player and multiplayer methods of playing, and the idea of having a full toolset to make your own levels is really cool.  So far, this title is an interesting diamond in the rough.\n\nThat’s not to say that it is without problems.  The review build I was provided by Oxeye seems to not recognize options changes.  I couldn’t change resolution or graphical quality.  The toolset opened to scripting errors and I did have the occasional crash when attempting to make options adjustments.\n\nAll of that said, for $20 you can do a hell of a lot worse and if it gets a large enough install base to where the multiplayer maintains an active community, I could see this game lasting quite some time to take advantage of those free updates Oxeye has promised.  I look forward to seeing what else Mojang might consider publishing.\n","February 2","true","9.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The challenge of getting to Mountainhammer time on the speed runs is so fun to me, and the Grifball-esque "Plug Slam" game is super fun as well. I mean, how can you expect something hardcore from Mojang? I'm pretty sure they're not in the business of hardcore. They're in the business of fun and, well, games.","April 20","true","15.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My favorite gamemode was survival (coop vs bots in waves), and everything would usually go great, until suddenly the everyone and everything stops moving for 10 seconds...and when the lag stops I've died. Also, sometimes the lag never recovers and the game is "frozen" eternally, forcing you to leave the lobby.\n\nFor a game designed to be a fast paced shooter, where the fidelity is high enough to dodge/deflect bullets or explosives... the netcode is simply too terrible to allow that to happen.\n\nWhen it was working it was an alright game. Most of the guns can only fire 10 feet though which seems needlessly ridiculous.

It proceeds much like a Metroidvania, except that the journey is a purely linear one with no abilities to unlock to open new areas to explore.\n\nThe controls are a little odd. You have to hold Up or Down in order to aim, which stops your movement unless you're sliding down the hill. To melee you have to first hit X to switch to melee and then hit RT to attack, instead of X just being a dedicated melee button.\n\nAnd then we come to the first boss fight, an exercise in going around a large room activating consoles while killing constantly respawning enemies. It's about as fun as it sounds, and it first introduces Cobalt's frenetic, chaotic combat, where you need to roll to deflect shots, shoot / hit incoming explosives to deflect them, and to pray. Success seems equal parts skill and luck as you're rolling and blasting and hoping you kill everything.\n\nAnd after defeating the first boss, you get to do it all over again 5 more times, go through a similar set of maps to reach the same exact boss fight, just in a different room with different respawning enemies.\n\nThis is where the quantity over quality makes itself felt. Each of the 6 areas plays out exactly the same, with the same exact un-interesting boss fight at the end of each one. There's a plethora of weapons to collect, each with more stats than you'd find in an ARPG, but few are truly memorable. There are likewise armor upgrades, 5 items for 5 slots, that feature such dramatic differences as a 0.4 increase in damage reduction.\n\nThere are even animal enemies to summon or tame and ride, but they're all disposable.\n\nAnd then there are bugs, from small things like how the Time Guardian never introduced himself and yet my character referred to him as such, to the game breaking bug after beating the 2nd boss fight. An item was supposed to spawn, but didn't, leaving me stuck and having to quit out and repeat the fight. I similarly got stuck in another area where I couldn't get out and couldn't progress until I brute forced a combination lock.","April 18","false","35.5"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

Which means that shooting is on two buttons. Why not just aim with the mouse as in Trine? Or only where the character is looking as in Samurai Gunn/Broforce/Duck Game?\nWhy are the keys locked to arrow keys, and I cannot use WASD? It is unplayable on keyboard + mouse, I mean keyboard since mouse is not used. Edit: The keys are rebindable, but the sheer amount of buttons required to compensate for not simply using the mouse to aim/shoot/roll/change weapon type makes it seem like a spider is the only creature that would be comfortable in playing this game.\n\nSo I switched to controller, but the game feels sluggish and approximate, especially with the button to "auto-aim" placed on the movement stick.\n\nThe only nice feature is a dodge-roll that can also deflect enemy bullets. Quite important to master, considering the huge amount of enemies to fight at the same time (and all the more infuriating with the unpractical control scheme).\n\nThe game features a single-player campaign (can be played in coop), and multiplayer (local and online). It has a lot of features, but I can't get over the gameplay to appreciate anything else the game has to offer. Even accessing the campaign missions is slow and complicated.\n\nIf like me you are picky about controls, especially with games where you have to fire guns, you can give this one a pass.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=671015980","April 17","false","0.8"," 13 of 31 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","13","31","2","5"

Back when Mojang could do no wrong and Notch was a god in the gaming world.\nIt's a tight little action platformer, with fairly unique mechanics and deep gameplay. Had a lack of content, polish, and major bugs, but the core concept was solid. I played it on and off for a few months, then forgot about it for years until it got its full release on Steam. I redeemed my code from the alpha version, and tried it out.\nThis game, at a 20$ price point, is unbuyable. It lacks content, and has so many game breaking bugs I would call it an Alpha rather than a full release. I've crashed no less than 16 times playing for a little over an hour, and encountered odd lag in multiplayer. The controls for keyboard are awful, and overcomplicated, so I played on controller, which was mediocre at best. The story seems fine, albeit not voice acted or interesting apart from the gameplay, and the multiplayer is night unplaybly buggy. The funnest part of Alpha Cobalt was removed (the survival mode, like Horde mode/COD Zombies), so I can't really rate that. This game has good core gameplay, but lacks in controls, stability, and content.\nIf this were priced at 10$, you might actually find some people to play with in the multiplayer, which is dead (3-4 players online at peak hours.). I got a good game of multiplayer in with 6 others once, and that was fun. For now, I'm going to give this game a thumbs down.\nPeople who like the idea of this game, try out Duck Game. It's great. Really great.\n","February 5","false","13.9"," 26 of 65 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","26","65","0","13"

I used to enjoy Minecraft (I've just moved on since then), but the game is unpolished and the story is confusing.\n\nThe controls (like aiming) are terrible. It so hard to aim without standing still, and then you take too much damage.\nAbout the story, there is like 0 backstory before the game starts, and in the first level you are just wandering through random hallways supposedly responding to a distress call, but nothing gets explained ever. Near the end of the level I guess you come to this huge labrynth area and i tried for like 15 minutes but it was so confusing I just gave up.\n\nI was hoping Mojang would deliver another good product. Scrolls was great, and so was Minecraft (before the fanbase went to s**t). But I just can't reccomend this.","February 18","false","0.5"," 8 of 37 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","8","37","0","5"

But I'll try my best. Cobalt is a platform-shooter game. There's singleplayer modes and multiplayer modes, as most of you have come to expect in shooter games. But Cobalt adds in battle mechanics that are not comparable to any other game. There's rolling, extremely satasfying (I probably spelt that wrong, didn't I?) matrix-style slow mo, more rolling, interesting aiming mechanics, more rolling, and generally just a lot of rolling.\n\nThe keyboard controls seem a tiny bit weird at first- seems a little more like a browser game then a Steam game- but I've actually gotten used to it after not very long, and you can modify them if you're not happy. There's also different ways to play the game. There's campaign, which can be played by yourself or with someone else too. There's local multiplayer, which can be played by yourself against bots or with people on your wi-fi. And of course, there's multiplayer, which needs no explination. There's also gamemodes for multiplayer (local and normal multiplayer), which is where it gets interesting.\n\nFree For all is self explanitory- every blueface for themselves. There is team options though.\n\nTeam Strike is team deathmatch- bluefaces unite. You can't respawn, but appearantly you can take over bots when you die. I'm unfamiliar with this gamemode, as I usually free for all with teamed.\n\nPlug slam is like Uplink for you COD Advanced Warfare fans- you try to get a plug into a goal. Simple enough, but a lot of fun.\n\nSurvival Mode is where you have to fight off waves of robots. Yeah, I don't know a lot about this gamemode either.\n\nCombat and speed challenges-err... I know nothing about them. :P But the name is kinda self-explanitory.\n\nCampaign is also a lot of fun. You play as Agent Cobalt who is trying to find out what happened to a human settlement. But there's more to it. You can go to dances for no reason whatsoever, roll, train endlessly for combat even though you are already a master at it, roll, make friends with birds and feel bad about life when they die, and more rolling. I hope you like rolling, cause if you do you're in for a treat with this game.\n\nOverall, this game gets 9/10. 1 off because although the game explains the mechanics really well, it does leave you with a few blanks in campaign, which meant I had to try and figure it out myself, and ain't nobody got time for dat!\n","February 27","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to mention other gadgets to augment your experience, such as jet shoes and shields.\n-You can ride giant carniverous space hamsters.\n-Steam Workshop, so users can make maps.\n-The best pro is that there are no cons.\n\nSo yeah.

Story is meh, and it spawns you in a spaceship without telling you much of what to do, kinda like the "find out yourself" vibe that Zelda II: Adventure of Link gave. (whether or not it exists physically, that game doesn't exist in our hearts)\n-NO MOUSE SUPPORT. Absolutely disgusting having to control the menus with controller or keyboard. Duck Game can get away with it because the menu is literally in-game, but this game is different.\n-Controls to switch between weapon types can get overwhelming at times, lots of players are franically switching to grenades instead of their gun or melee weapon, etc. (on controller, I don't use keyboard)\n","February 2","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

IF YOU ARE A METALASSAULT FAN, WAIT UNTIL IT COMES OUT AND PLAY THAT. OTHERWISE, THIS IS A GREAT GAME, DEFINITELY WORTH GRABBING!\n\nThis game has come a long way since its alpha, and many, many things have gone from "meh" too "pretty cool!", "sick" , or "sweet dude!".   The combat mechanic is definitely the reason people will end up playing the game, with pros and cons of the game here:\n\nPros:\n-Awesome rolling mechanic, the thing makes combat insanely skill based with infinite outplay potential.\n-Slow motion to help out with the sticky situations\n-Local and online multiplayer, with options to change game modes, maps, ranked/unranked, etc.\n-Story mode, which can get fun at times (more about that in the cons)\n-Full controller support with decent mapping and control.\n\nCons:\n-Slow motion in 4 player deathmatch gets really hectic at times, as you may be trying to get into the action, but the other players are constantly in combat, triggering slow-mo for everyone\n-Campaign is pretty crap. Story is meh, and it spawns you in a spaceship without telling you much of what to do, kinda like the "find out yourself" vibe that Zelda II: Adventure of Link gave. (whether or not it exists physically, that game doesn't exist in our hearts)\n-NO MOUSE SUPPORT. Absolutely disgusting having to control the menus with controller or keyboard. Duck Game can get away with it because the menu is literally in-game, but this game is different.\n-Controls to switch between weapon types can get overwhelming at times, lots of players are franically switching to grenades instead of their gun or melee weapon, etc. (on controller, I don't use keyboard)\n","February 2","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's easy to learn but hard to master (you can punch grenades to send them back, well-timed rolls can deflect shots, there is a weird and awesome bulletime system in place...). Which makes this game super fun in local versus. It's a must have if you have friends coming over, like super smash bros on consoles.\nEach match can be customized like crazy (which robot you're playing, stage music, available weapons,...)\n\nI didn't play much with the solo modes yet but so far I like what I see. The story seems fun and humorous and you can upgrade/customize your character, which is something I didn't expect at all (it kinda give an RPG feel to the game). There also seem to hav a lot of little interactivity thingy which I really like (you can mount certain creatures, get a bird and see it dies by a rocket 5 seconds after,...)\n\nI tried some of the challenges and that seems to be fun, there is a leaderboard so you can compare your score to other players and try to be the best (carefull, it's addictive as hell since a challenge doesn't take more than 30 seconds) ;)\n\nThe sound design is amazing, musics are nice and you won't believe how much diversity the devs could offer you with "blip", "bloup" and "biip" sounds.\n\nApparently you can unlock things, which I always appreciate.\n\nSo... well done devs. Your game was amazing 5 years ago, and you managed to make it even better now :)","February 2","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All the information I knew was that it's a platformer and that it's a shooter. I wasn't in the beta, and I'd never even really seen this game hyped up like others. But it was created by Mojang, so I planned to buy it no matter what just to support them.\n\nThat was an amazing decision. I'm not too far into the game yet, but I already love it. The mechanics are unique to all other plaform shooters. The slow-motion effects give a nice change of pace in the fast paced world of platform shooters, while still maintaining that fast paced aspect that all platform shooter fans love. It's an amazing take on the genre. I haven't' yet touched multiplayer, but I expect it will be just as good as the story mode.","February 2","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't usually write reviews, but I felt like I should weigh in on this.\n\nBottom-line: this game's good.\n\nIt's pretty difficult, but it depends on your skill as a player, rather than artificial difficulties (like traps, attacks you couldn't see coming, etc). The music's nice and atmospheric, and keeps up the tension as you explore the game world, looking to avoid getting overwhelmed by multiple soldiers. The graphics are crisp and high-detail, and the game's pretty well optimized, to boot.\n\nThe multiplayer's surprisingly lagfree and is pretty deep, as well - for example, rolling can change how and when you attack, and also reflects bullets. So it's pretty much mandatory if you want to play singleplayer, even more-so online. However, rolling all of the time becomes a burden, like dodging or blocking all of the time in a fighting game, as when you're in a roll, you can't stop rolling, and a shot that hits your feet will damage you. So you have to mix it up, time your rolls, and move around to avoid dying, haha.\n\nThere's a ton to do in the game, and there's room for improvement, as there's also additional game modes that are present on the Workshop maps. For example, Classic Survival mode is not like the regular Survival mode. In Classic Survival, you don't face off against discrete waves, but rather deal with enemies as you explore the game map, searching hidden alcoves and safes for loot and weapons. Classic Survival's probably my favorite game mode, haha.\n\nAnyway, my opinion's that this game is EASILY worth more than $20. Get it!","February 14","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are a robot dude, and you shoot other robot dudes and things. When a bullet, grenade or other hazard comes close, time locally slows down around you, giving you time to punch that grenade back, deflect that bullet or pull some otherwise epic combo. Trust me, this is way more fun than it sounds.\n\nWith the high skill ceiling on all aspects of the game (timing shots, throwing bombs, punch jumping, etc) there is a lot to learn but the game is pretty easy to pick up and has plenty of things to do such as a detailed campaign, speedrun challenges (against the rest of the world), wave survival, plug football (except you can throw it) and good old deathmatch.\n\nBrilliant gameplay, and I also like the graphics style. I would recommend this to anyone who likes action and pulling cool stunts and general awesomeness. There is plenty for both competitive and casual players.\n\nGet it.

It's fun, but there are lots of 2D shooter-platformer games,  and this one is not really different, occasionally it slows time, but it's too rare and doesn't really do much. This games good - but don't get broke for it.","May 4","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I launched the steam release version yesterday I was blown away. This game has grown sooo much since then, and I have only seen 2 hrs worth of it so far.\nThe people from Oxeye clearly poured their heart and souls into this game; Everything is just so well put together...\nLovely presentation in terms of sound and visuals, extremely responsive controls, easy to get into but hard to master (just the way we like it), local co-op & online modes, dodge-rolling at it's finest and... well...  you should probably just give this a go!","April 17","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
