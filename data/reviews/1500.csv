So it gets an obvious reccomendation from me. There is a lot going on with Darwinia and I've never played anything like it. It's one of those types of games that is really hard to describe, and you can only really understand after playing it for a bit. It's a weird game to get into at first. But once you get past the first two or so levels and understand what's going on it really takes off.\n\nSo basically what's going on with this game is your thrown into a level, and your given a few goals to complete the level. There are a lot of different objectives in the game, but most of the time your goal is to kill all the enemies on the map, and move your little Darwinians to key locations. What's really nice about the levels is all tools the game gives you tie in together in really clear ways. You make soilders to kill enemies and create souls, the engineers retrieve the souls and bring them to the soul collector to generate new darwininans, and the Darwinians interact with the map and you don't have direct control over them. It all comes together really well.\n\nMy favorite part about the game though is how much freedom you get. It sounds weird but let me explain. Darwinia perfectly lets you experience it at your own pace, and in your own way. There's so many ways to handle each situation in the game, and you're encouraged to handle it any way you want to. You can be super effiecient and try to carefully mine every enemies' soul, or you can do things more crazy and charge in with air strikes. Both are valid strategies in Darwinia. You can try spam engineers to take over a semi-hostile base and raise hell from inside the enemy territory, or you can enter from the shores and work your way in. The game doesn't care which way you do it. Nothings timed, nothings scored. And I love that. Because if you had a score, or a time limit it means you'd have to play the game in the most effient way, but without those things I felt more encouraged to try out crazier ideas, or ideas that I knew were just stupid, but its ok because it's fun. And that's what Darwinia encourages. It's all free. But it's more than just that. The game let's you jump into and out of levels at anytime and it you'll be able to jump right back into exactly where you left off instantly. You can acess more than one level at once so if you get bored or stuck on one level, you can jump out and start working on another level. It's great! Probably my absolute favorite part about Darwinia is how free the camera is, and that's a really weird thing to say, but lemme explain. The camera in Darwinia is very free. You can move it to any location, and look at anything from almost any angle. It's almost like a camera you'd see in an editor of some sort. But it really really works in Darwinia. Because the camera is so free it really makes the game feel like a world that's actively happening, and you're just interacting with it. Almost like a little toybox world, or at least that's how it makes me feel anyway.\n\nWith the camera, and entire game giving you so much freedom, and a lot of the units do things on their own in this game, ontop of the very simple art style(which is perfect for this game), and the great ambience the sounds create, I felt like I could get really immersed into game. I liked to put the camera at dramatic angles and imagine all sorts of adventures and stories as things were happening. I've taken more screenshots in this game than any other. So basically what I'm getting at, is if you like to imagine weird stuff or like to get really immersed into a game both strategically and artistically, then this game does the trick.\n\nAnd the game has a level editor and mod creator. Yeah. ♥♥♥♥in sweet. This is one of those games that I have NO idea why this isn't more popular. And the story is really weird and cool. And it's really existential and you are an active part of the story... like you the person sitting at their computer, not you the player in the game. It's a bit weird, and I didnt really understand what was going on for awhile. But I really like that kind of stuff so the plot I really really liked.\n\nSo final reccomendations: Definity get this game. It's amazing. It really really appeals to what I like personally, so you probably wont think it's the most amazing thing like I do, but I think you'll definitly have fun. Don't get it if you don't think you'll be able to handle the controls. Darwinia can also be really weird difficult to understand at first so if you're not willing to do that, then you probably wont enjoy it either.\n\nAnyway, love this game. Personal favorite. And it's $10. So no excuses. That's less than a movie, or dinner at a nice restaurant.","January 19, 2014","true","25.0"," 54 of 57 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","54","57","0","0"

The gameplay is fun in a non-frustrating way - it's hard to get into a position where you lose, and even if you aren't employing the optimal strategy for a level, given enough time, you will be able to beat each stage in different ways. I rarely got frustrated with this game and never really felt bored, even though a lot of the gameplay isn't necesarilly that complex. The story doesn't dominate the experience, but the brief sections where you learn more about Darwinia are definitely rewarding.\n\nOverall, all these little details don't really matter in the face of the fact that I constantly was entertained while playing this game and never really felt bad, something that even modern games don't necesarilly provide.\n\nIf you're expecting a complex RTS, this is not that game. Think of it as more of "digital weeding", as you slowly and carefully purge the viruses through each stage using a variety of tools.\n","October 30, 2014","true","8.6"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","19","19","3","0"

Something in the way it's presented just made sense to me, and I found the context to be especially endearing.\n\nPart of what really appealed to me was how simple and straightforward everything was: soldiers shoot stuff, engineers build stuff, etc. Even the upgrade options, in the context of file updates (v2.0), made everything feel more accessible. The game code is mercifully stable for an "indie" game and I found myself wasting hours defeating every last enemy and making sure that every uninhabited piece of land was repopulated. I frequently found myself rooting for individual scouts and soldiers that bravely out-maneuvered their enemies. It really says something about a game that can make you feel so attached to its literal pixels.\n\nThe excellent score and sound effects coupled with the game's relaxingly retro aesthetic have proven great for replayability, making Darwinia a world I'm happy to revisit often. 9/10.","February 18, 2014","true","51.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

It's part RTS, part god game one could say. You are in charge of protecting and restoring the Darwinian population, however you can't directly control them, although the officer tool does make up for that fact. Instead you spawn in several programs to assist the little guys in order to destroy the red virus that has infected their world.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty solid, and becomes massively fun during the fights where you get to utilize your Darwinians. Having two massive forces collide and duke it out while you influence the battle field with your programs is something not many games capture too well.\n\nSpeaking of the Darwinians, they are the stars of this game. They are important for manning buildings, turrets, and eventually the main fighting force at your disposal. They have a few things they do that adds a nice little touch, such as jumping into the air when a mission is complete, or mourning over the loss of a fallen comrade. The story brags about how smart these guys are, but they don't do much that isn't scripted. They really come to life in battle however, their digital screams, panic, and blaring war trumpets and marching tunes give them character.\n\nThe story is servicable, although nothing groundbreaking. They thankfully allow you to skip through it if you aren't that interested, although I soaked in as much as I could. If your a sap like me, you'll grow fond of the little guys, otherwise the gameplay should suffice.\n\nAll in all, the game is great fun and a blast to play. It took me around 6 hours to beat on one playthrough. Beating it will give you a level editor to muck around in and another profile with all locations enabled, so you can edit to your heart's content. Some would argue it's a little short, and I feel like it could have a few more levels, but what it does offer is more than worth it's price tag.","January 22, 2014","true","21.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

The retro graphics are vaguely evocative of Tron, and the enemies and characters are all subtle references/homages to video games and video game culture of the mid-to-late 80s and early 90s.  There are Spiders and Centipedes reminiscent of Centipede, the Engineers which are evocative of Recognizers from Tron, even the Bombers that respond to Air Strike beacons look like they're right out of Space Invaders.\n\nThe Darwinians themselves are adorable.  Though they have no animations and are simple 2D sprites in a 3D world, they manage to demonstrate a lot of personality.  From the little mourning kites they release when souls ascend to the Central Repository, to the way Officer Darwinians chant out a marching cadence when issuing a "Follow Me" order, to the screams of horror and pain Darwinians have when terrorized with explosive weaponry and laser fire, you can't help but feel a little for the little guys.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it's very intuitive and usually pretty solid, some camera wonkiness aside.  Managing a Squad is simple (Everything you can do aside from secondary-weapon switching is handled with two buttons) and intelligent use of Squads forms the cornerstone of gameplay.  The game doesn't punish you for failure - replacing Squads is as easy as hitting F1, then clicking within a valid spawning area.  You're encouraged to replace your Squaddies often and try out different tactics to accomplish your goals.  All of the other units you can control are similarly uncomplicated, and the game gives you plenty of room to learn without holding your hand and beating you over the head with forced tutorials.\n\nDarwinia encourages freedom of choice and lateral thinking in ways I haven't seen a lot of games do - stages are frequently nonlinear and the objectives can be accomplsihed in any order.  Often times, you're simply thrown into a stage and challenged to figure out your own method for victory.  Do you burmush your objectives or methodically wipe out the virus infestation between you and your target?  Do you take your foes head-on, or can you sneak an Engineer around to a different comm port and use it as a second beachhead?  Do you carefully avoid enemies in order to get a shot on a particularly annoying foe unopposed, or do you just carve your way in?\n\nAll in all, Darwinia's one of the most refreshing tactical games I've had the pleasure of playing, and I heartily recommend it for anyone who enjoys a little old school nostalgia, adorable faux-retro graphical charm, and solid gameplay.","March 22, 2014","true","20.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Darwinia's a cool retro-style game about a digital world populated by little people called Darwinians, who are under siege by a dangerous computer virus. Under the instructions of Darwinia's creator, you have to help get rid of the virus and restore Darwinia to it's fully-funtional self.\nThe whole time playing I thought I had the ending figured out, I thought it was going to end on some lame twist where Darwinia's actually Earth or something. But no, it actually ended very originally, and on an extremely bitter-sweet note.\nMy only complaint, and it's really a minor one, is that for a game called "Darwinia" it's not very Darwinian. I was expecting a lot of heavy symbolism reflecting Charles Darwin's Theories of Evolution, but there's only a few, very subtle, nods to evolution where you can upgrade the troops of Darwinia. In fact the game's sequel "Multiwinia" is more Darwinian, since the Darwinians are battling eachother for supremacy.\nThere's actually more symbolism for religion than anything else. But don't be alarmed by that, the symbols are very subtle. And even then the symbolism is actually really good, the symbolism helps the message it tries to convey, which I won't tell you, because it would spoil the ending. Just trust me it's a really good and interesting message.\nI can't recommend this game or the team behind it enough. I've never seen anything like Darwinia, and I'd say you should check it out too.","July 25, 2013","true","8.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The team makes modest, beautifully conceived, games that are compelling to play and darwinia is one of their best.\nThe gameplay is challenging enough without, save perhaps one small exception, being frustrating.

I never felt forced to find the trick to advance forward and the game never worked against my approach to the maps, as often happens in other games.\n\nThe graphics are simple, as you would expect from a group that isn't cranking out a million dollar blockbuster, but beautiful and enhance, rather than detract from, the experience.  At first it might seem offputting, but you quickly realize that it isn't something that requires tolerance but actually fits the game's story and design. The story doesn't feel like an afterthought.  It is well written and has a strange emotional pull for a video game.  The lovely music changes to help drive this emotion  but is never in your face and never becomes tiresome. It all combines beautifully, and doesn't feel slapped together, but has a spare, elegant quality.\n\nI found myself amazed at how emotionally attached I became to each little stick figure and its survival.\n\nThis game is well worth the modest price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryo786/recommended/1500/","ryo786","BULiK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryo786/","369 products in account","Darwinia is a classic indie game, an RTS on a large yet microscopic level.  Very tron-like in it's intention and it pulls the theme off well.  I highly recommend it, and it's "sequel", Multiwinia.  The basic story revolves around you, a hacker, that finds a scientist's private server, that contains his experiment on creating a digital species (Darwinians).  But viruses have corrupted the majority of his life's work, and you need to command his creations to free themselves from the malware and virueses that are destroying the world that the scientist has created for them.  It makes you feel good when you have a victory, and mourn the loss when innocent souls are slaughtered on a mass scale in these epic battles.\n\nGameplay-wise, it has essentially no resource management whatsoever.  But that is a good thing, especially for those that are just dipping their toes in the RTS genre, and just want action.  You instead control the battlefield by initiating various programs and deploying them to fight the infection. as well as appointing captains of the local population of darwinians that rally those nearby to attack, move to a position, and such.  The programs you can initiate to help fight your battles include engineers that collect dead 'souls' to be revived, and capture important buildings such as spawn points and traffic lanes.  Then there are you direct combat commandoes, the squad.  The squad is a group of 3-5 heavily armored humanoid soldiers that you can command to directly move anywhere, and you can direct their fire yourself, like in a top-down shooter.  Upgrades can also allow them to lob grenades at your will, among other things.  As I mentioned before, you can appoint a Darwinian to be a captain of sorts via another command.  The final program is initiating an airstrike over a designated location, devastatingly ripping anything below (including your own troops) to pieces.\n\nAs you progress through the campaign, you can find boxes of previous research from the scientist, and tell him to research (essentially, upgrade) one of your commands, which takes some time but is useful.  Upgrades include adding more members to a squad, allowing regular darwinians to throw grenades, adding another bomber to your airstrike runs, etc.\n\nNo buildings that you can control ccan ever be destroyed, and there is no resource whatsoever that you have.  Darwinians spawn in waves, coming out of large buildings that you can take control of with your engineers.  Your engineers can also pick up the souls of dead enemies and allies that linger after they die, to deposit them into these buildings that resurrect them.\n\nAs you can see from the trailer, the battles are massive cluster#$!@s of friendly and not so friendly darwinians, other enemies lke snaking viruses and spiders, etc.\n\nThe story is inspiring, the gameplay is unique, simple, and fun - I would recommend it to anyone, even those that don't do the RTS genre.  To be honest, this a a gateway drug to the RTS genre.  What I have to say to the customer who wants to buy this, is that they should buy this in the pack you can see below that has all the classic games from Introversion (The development studio behind this) and two of their soundtracks.  Multiwinia is essentially the same as darwinia just without as much direct unit creation, but focuses on the aspects of using the darwinians in legions and using such strategies.  You can get power ups too, that allow you to do various things like in Darwinia, plus some more.  DEFCON is a good RTS that takes heavy inspiration from movies like 'Wargames' and the general Cold War scenarios that were hypothesized in the mid 20th century.  You control a world power with nukes.  You are just the general in the bunker, not any politician.  As the situation escalates, you mobilize more and more forces that you place strategically early in the game.  Then everything goes to ♥♥♥♥ as thermonuclear war breaks out.  It really is more complex than what I'm saying here, and you might as well get it with getting the other games.  Uplink is a neat, almost too-plausible hacker simulator inspired by the things you see in your average action movie.\n\nSo I would get all of their games for the value price when they are bundled, and it includes the soundtracks to two of them.","May 27, 2014","true","20.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

An interesting story about AI and developing societies in which you help bring back from the brink of destruction all from the guise of a pseudo-user (if you'll pardon the TRON reference).\n\nThe UI is tastefully simple, combat is also fairly simple, which makes the game easy to learn.

In Darwinia, your resources are actually the souls of dead units and you need to harvest them soon after you kill them.\n\nThis choice between harvesting and military is very dynamic. You can and have to change your tactics fast to deal with the situation. You have a low maximum number of units but there is no build time. However, you can only build at certain locations, so waiting time depends on where the battle is taking place.\n\nThird, micro-management is quite different from what you're used to: You don't just click to attack, you decide exactly where your soldiers shoot. Macro-management is really narrative-driven. Levels have very different goals with each other and winning feels more like solving a puzzle than managing and allocating resources.\n\nDarwinia is a weird little game, it's one of those things that broaden your horizons.

I bought it on Steam to see if it was as good as when I played it a while back. The game is amazing. The art direction of the the world is beautiful even though the game was made a while ago. Dealing with the virus in each level requires more than just running in and shooting at everything, especially in the later levels.\nThe game does have a few minor flaws though. Mostly just squaddies getting stuck on narrow strips of land and the rare frame rate drop when several explosions are on screen at once. But all in all, if you're looking for a good RTS, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.","February 18, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dimeinurear/recommended/1500/","Dimeinurear","Dime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dimeinurear/","267 products in account","This game is great, and I remember seeing it on the store back in 2005.  Back in those days, my computer couldn't even RUN the ♥♥♥♥ing thing.  Seriously, I got engine errors.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say by saying that it came out in 2005 is that this game has NOT aged well.  Graphically, it's fine.  Infact, the graphics are still very appealing and I like them.  Technically, it isn't good.  The game forces Vsync on, and not only does it cause input delay, it also causes serious mouse issues.  The mouse is really glitchy and jumps around a lot.  Force disabling Vsync in your graphics card's control panel helps alleviate this issue.  It does not FIX it, it just makes it bearable.\n\nOn the gameplay side, you control little dudes called "Darwinians" and you're fighting back a virus.  There is no resource aside from "souls," which drop from your Darwinians and the virus monster that you kill.  There's also a "task manager," which means you can only have 3 to 5 (depending on your upgrade progress) 'programs' running at once.  Programs include things like armored units, 'engineers' (workers who collect and process souls), and armored tanks.  Oh, contrary to what I said: you cannot directly control a Darwinian, instead you control them through Officers, who give basic orders like "go over here," or "follow me."  The game's AI does the rest.\n\nThere are a few SERIOUS gameplay elements that annoy me a lot.  The upgrade system is time-based, but once you get an upgrade, you keep it forever.  However, the upgrades take FOREVER to finish.  No joke, I think upgrading a system to level 3 takes something likes two full HOURS of real time.  Despite this, you can still play the game normally and the upgrades work in the background.  Each mission can take about an hour, so you don't really notice the time, especially if you're going for 100% objective completion.\n\nThe second serious complaint I have is a monster called a "Soul Eater," or something along those lines.  I just called it a "dragon" because it looks like a dragon.  This monster is pure luck to kill.  You have to kill it with explosives, but rockets don't hit it, only grenades and air strikes do, and only when the monster is near the ground.  It's pure luck if the monster is actually near the ground when you launch your explosive.  These monsters can also one-shot every unit you can create, which means they slow the game right the ♥♥♥♥ down.  I hated fighting these guys.  The only tactic I found to be effective is to switch to rockets, and have my squad suicide by shooting rockets at themselves, hoping it does some damage to the dragon.\n\nBesides these two complaints, I love playing this game.  It's slow-paced and casual, but still very enjoyable, especially if you like RTS.  It also has its own hectic moments, as well.","April 30, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A simple idea done elegantly.  Plus, it's a lot of fun to play.\n\nThere are 10 or so levels that take any where from an hour or two to complete.  Even though this is not a large game, I found it to be worth the price.  Better yet, try the free demo and then make up your mind.\n\nI wish this positive review was also true for Multiwinia, but that later version, changed the game play around for the special units and structures which I never did get used to.","December 29, 2013","true","33.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All I know is it was on Steam when Steam was brand new (i.e. used for Half Life, TFC, CS) and since Darwinia was on it, I assumed it was made by valve. Haha, silly young me.\n\nAnyhow, this game is an interesting take on the RTS genre with some "lemmings" functionality built in; in other words, there are units in this game that are friendly, that move around, and that you cannot directly control.  They fit into the story because they are the artificial life forms that you need to protect.  You do so with a couple "squads" so to speak of programs you can control directly.  Together with these not-exactly-helpless, but non-controllable "AI", you must navigate the campaign and complete various objectives. There are some extremely large-scale battles that seem very chaotic due to the lack of direct control the player has, but overall the game is fun and challenging despite being a little raw.\n\nWhat I really must add in is that the game kind of made me, the player, believe these sprites were, in fact, "living" beings. The game, in its simplicity, is actually very immersive, and it's easy to project "soul" onto these sprites you are trying to save. When they die, you feel sad, when they are happy, you're happy. It's a fascinating combination of storytelling and gameplay mechanics that created an unexpected sense of emotion for me while playing.\n\nNaturally the trailers and screenshots don't do that last bit justice. But Introversion is a stellar developer and Darwinia meets the high bar they set for themselves and their games. I would definitely recommend.","January 20, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Frist i'll tell you what i liked about the game: The story, the art style, and gameplay! I haven't read much about the story in other reviews but i like it and thats all ill say. The art style is supposed to look like you are in a computer world(kinda like tron) so it is really simple but kinda "cute" or cartoony. The game play is what everyone is talking about so first the problems.\nI couldn't unplug my headset while playing the game or else an error would appear and it would crash.\nThe Darwinians are like cattle where they move in straight lines but if you use officers correctly then you're fine.\na bug happened where i couldn't build anything but restarting the game fixed that.\nThe first mission (not prolouge) is really boring and that deterrs many people.\nPositive:\nAlot of game time for 1$ (currently 13hrs)\nI thought the sound effects were funny.\nSome stratiegic thought and tactics do go into this game. (its not just run at each other, get more units and repeat)\nYou unlock something at the end that increases the amount of time you could play it! ;)\nNice soundtrack\nThere is alot more that i like but i must go to the counter arguments or problems.\nDubhe said\n"- Units with bizarre controls, like:\n--- Left click to select\n--- Left click to move\n--- Left click and hold to to special action 1\n--- Left click and hold near the unit to do special action 2"\nI don't know what game he was playing but you do use left click to select and move but you hold right click to shoot and while holding right click if you left click they do their special.\nDubhe also said\n"--- Don't worry, though, because your units will randomly exit and reenter the turret every couple of seconds! Even during battle!\n--- Also, you can't control where the turret fires! And it does damage to friendly units!\n--- And, it's inexplicably easy for enemy units to kick your guys out and take control of the turret!"\nMy units never reentered and exited turrets unless the units inside the turret were killed. You can control where the turret fires but darwinians have to be inside and your units can also kick enemy out of turrets too. (kinda funny when they just keep kicking each other.) XD\nLidion45 said\n"Unable to select more than one unit at once?!?!\nClunky controls for moving units\nUnits don't fire by themselves, yet randomly play the shooting sound when you're not looking?\nBullets bouncing on uneven terrain makes shooting very awkward given most of the map is mountainous"\nYes the first is true but i didn't have a problem with it. My units did fire by themselves (maybe he/she didn't have darwinian reasearched to level 2?) Bullets do bounce on terrain and sometimes that got annoying so i avoided terrain like that.\n\nOverall i loved the game even though it does have its little bugs and problems but wouldn't buy it for the 10$ (or 20$ for both) I would get them on sale so you get both games for 1.30$.\n(No offence to the other reviews I just used yours as counter arguments.)","December 22, 2014","true","13.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But its use of Keyboard & Mouse controls are good enough the same.\nGraphics: 10/10 - From what i have saw, this game makes clever use of pixellated shaders for the unit models (Squad, Engineers, enemies, etc.) and aswell the 2d sprite entities of the Darwinians. Their frame rate of the model turnings have a excellent take, the HUD looks like as a futuristic PSX game design and it reminds me if this game was made in the 1990s with great graphics.\nMusic: 9/10 - It has some music, and it is especially intended for cutscenes. None music is intended to work when you play the game, as to face with the atmosphere of the 1980s technology setting. But in the intros you'd laugh that some are took from the amiga cracktros for the cracktro-styled intros. I have even heard one which is a remix to Thunder Cross by Konami, a obscure space shooter arcade game.\nGameplay: 9/10 - It has a different genre of strategy in this game, you can find research cubes in some of the locations to obtain more stuff such as more weapons for your Squads, new units, and more. Sadly, you have few units like Squad, Engineers and Officers for the Darwinians, but it's good the same because it would be ridiculous to have like a team of different units. :P\nTotal: 4.6/5\n\nYou might also check out Multiwinia, the multiplayer-driven sequel to Darwinia. It has the same gameplay but with 6 different game modes for greater enjoyment with your friends. ;)\n","January 10","true","13.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Indeed it was so small, due to absence of textures and usage of "procedurally generated" graphics or something instead, which look stylish and very original. Unfortunately my experience at that time ended right in the first mission because I didn't know how to complete it and the "help" system gave no clues.\n\n10 years later, in 2015 I got this game inside a bundle together with Prison Architect from the same dev (Prison Architect is a very good game btw). So, now, again, I almost got stuck in the 1st mission. Luckily I then guessed that you need to capture some satellite dishes (or something, the graphics are pretty low-polygonal) by placing an engineer next to it. And to go to a different island - since you can't send squads there because they don't walk over water - you need to delete a squad, then create a new one near a satellite dish on a different island. And - engineers walk over water and get to that dish... ok. This time I completed the first mission and got stuck in the second one because I don't know how to transport a flock of darwinians over water. And I ran out of patience because it took me half an hour to guess why red snakes keeps respawning (you need to kill a big red egg-laying spider with grenades or something - normal shots don't seem to hit it? the presentation was very unclear). That basically sums up my experience with the game.\n\nPros:\n- great unique graphical style\n- pleasing music\n- nice intro scenes at the beginning of the game (one of them is a "game of life" simulation well-known to programmers and mathematicians; another says the game was cracked by a hacker which it's not since I got it on Steam..)\n- intriguing story\n\nCons:\n- terrible tutorial, nothing is explained -> which alone makes the game unplayable for the vast majority of players and would actually make this game worth 0/10. Yet, judging from other reviews, also ones I read on professional websites, I still think that's it's me who is dumb and there is tons of gameplay which I wasn't patient/clever enough to get to. I'm pretty damn sure I represent the majority though\n- non-existent pathfinding (basically, units can only walk in straight lines, and if there is something in the way which they can't walk thru - they will keep pushing into that obstacle forever)\n- awkward camera system, with mouse wheel zooming in/out working in reverse (!), with no way to reconfigure that\n- unique but awkward unit selection/creation/ordering/combat system\n- units walk too slow over huge landscapes, no way to speed up the game\n- no save/reload\n\nOverall, this game is more of "look how much we can stuff into 1.5MB" rather than a product for real people. I doubt they even tested this game on anyone outside their office. If you get it in a bundle for $1 or less - fine, it's worth a look for its originality. But most likely you won't be able to play it due to the described issues.","December 16, 2015","false","1.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/1500/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","In the first five minutes, you will realize that this game offers close to zero instruction on how to play, and its in-story help mode/tutorial are deplorable examples thereof. Then, about 30 minutes into the game you will realize that the path finding is probably the absolute worst in any game you have ever played. The controls and operational methods are so inadequate and poor that you will wonder if this is the result of a bug (or many bugs), or even if the game has been installed correctly. Proceeding past the second mission without help is impossible. Because Darwinia does not explain itself to the player, you will be forced to search on Google for help and explanations, as this is the only way to make sense out of this presentational disaster. Further, because many aspects of the game are obscured by terrible presentation choices, you will feel as if the game does not allow you to play it. You will not know how to do several things that are required to achieve many of the mission objectives, thanks to the developer's choice in being vague and uninformative. The goals in Darwinia are explained so badly, that once again, I imagine that this portion of the game is also among the worst in any game I have played. The developers clearly did not have any care in designing a game that is intuitive, user friendly, and enjoyable. The feeling is that Darwinia is simply not complete, nor is it fully operable by the user. It is as if there are numerous amounts of game play that were not done to completeness, leaving the player at a loss and in frustration. In addition to the aforementioned problems, you can not save during a mission. The game does all the saving for you, after you complete each mission objective and at other seemingly random moments. This means, that you sometimes have to restart a mission from the very beginning, if something does not go according to plan. This is totally unacceptable. If the rest of the game was better suited, this saving problem would not bother me as much. The responsiveness of your units is atrocious. Ordering the units and Darwinians around is quite problematic, as they simply do not respond as they should, nor are they very useful to your commands. The processes required to order them around are tedious, slow, and unresponsive. They have such a difficult time maneuvering around the map, it's disgruntling. These shortcomings are so major, that enjoying the game as a whole is an arduous chore as you progress through the missions. Slowly, as you learn to endure Darwinia's league of problems, there are minor and sparse hints of quality gaming behind it all. Achieving the mission objectives as you hurdle past the developmental shortcomings and obstacles can give the player feelings of accomplishment and relief, since Darwinia is so inefficient and unfriendly. After all, this takes more work than it is fun. The creativity from the developers is undeniably present. The plot and storyline are original, going along well with the artwork and aesthetic style. Each map is basic, but they do have their stylistic charms. The missions can be repetitive, but at least they make sense in relation to the story. Unfortunately for the developers, creativity does not equal a quality product. There is a serious and widely known bug that will not allow you to deploy new units to the map, and the only way around it is to quit and restart the game. There are also some placement glitches that mysteriously do not allow you to deploy units. Darwinia is all about being an annoyance, a bother, a bore; a game with severe flaws that barely works or provides the player with anything remotely enjoyable. It is an incredibly tedious and inconvenient game. You\nwill be spending your time and money better elsewhere.\n\nDarwinia is bad.","March 20, 2014","false","7.4"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","0"

But along comes Darwinia that decided to simplify both the graphics and gameplay and created a wonderful game.\n\nDarwinia stars the player as a internet wanderer that stumbles upon a network filled with little A.I. creatures that Dr. Sepulveda created in order to research how they grow and evolve. But at the time the player enters, the network has been almost completely overrun by a virus and nearly destroyed the entire environment. And through the rest of the game the player must help the Dr. eradicate the virus and find the cause in order to bring back the world of Darwinia to its former glory.\n\nAnyone that has played a real time strategy game will notice that Darwinia is a really simplified RTS were instead of managing resources, dozens of unit types to choose from, and hundreds of units to organize the player only has to manage a couple of "programs"; soldiers, gatherers, airstrikes, transport/machine gun nest and the Darwinians themselves through a task manager so that the player can take control over.\n\nGraphically the game is a interesting one as it's the not the graphical power house that every game out today is but is very simple and is a bit of a throwback to old school pixelated games, there is even a setting in the games options that read "I need a upgrade." Really it is very possible to run the game on high settings while on a netbook or 5-6 year old computer.\n\nThe sound is a soothing electronica, which I'm not a fan for but fits the game exceptionally and the effects of the surroundings and weapons are loud and powerful and isn't bad for digitally created.\n\nFor all RTS fans, Darwinia is a no brainer. But for players that have never played any or very many RTS's, Darwinia is simple enough to pick up and play and are sure to have fun.\n\n8/10","January 1, 2012","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unless you're aiming at getting all the research items and killing every virus, you'll probably beat it in a maximum of 7-8 hours.\n\nThe one thing I would've loved in this otherwise fine game is co-op multiplayer.

This is not a bad game, not by any stretch.\n\nThe first thing I would say is that I absolutly LOVE the soundtrack! the mix of old 8 and 16 bit music with a modern twist is greatly appreciated. I can acutally see me listening to some of this outside of this game it is definatly good enough.\n\nThe theme of the game being set inside a network that has been invaded by a virus,and you have to help restore systems and giving personification to the systems and AI is a wonderful touch. I also like the progression it is tied into finding upgades via research that your enigneers have to scan in order to upgade your capabillites. The graphics are pretty simple, and this works in its favour, almost like a visual representation of something much more complex.\n\nThe unlocking of new areas is tied into the opening of ports in the maps you visit, this is wonderful as it both plays on the theme, keeps within the story and makes you push to the ports in order to open up more content.\n\nYou can clearly see the effor that has been out in here and as an indie title the has definatly got some wonderful features and a little bit of a story to carry it.\n\nNow the bad, Firstly the tutorials are awful, they simply do not explain things enough, I am not asking for hand holding here just it is kind of like;\n\nto do this... go in that direction.... meh figure it out yourself.....\n\nI spent a few hours playing around with it, and a lot I had to figure out myself, some people said oh its a learning curve, no a learning curve implies that you actually are told what tools you have at your disposal, and you have to learn how to impliment those tools, that is not the case here, the tutorial is just to sparse. In order to progress any further I would have had to look up how to get any further outside of the game, that should never have to happen with this type of game in my opinion.\n\nSecondly there are a few little annoying glitches and bugs, like when selecting a unit to build, often I would not always get the one I chose, and so had to dismiss the unit just built and give the build order again, its annoying the first time, by the tenth time I was actually getting into the habit of automatically holding down the unit menu [TAB] in order to cancel what it was going to build... thats not a good thing. And a number of troops would happily walk into force feilds or danger despite having a clear path they could have took, meaning micro management is compulsory.\n\nThirdly there is no way (that I have figured out, forgive me if this comes a little later in) to group up multiple units, this makes micro management even more annoying and takes away from the flow of gameplay as you cannot split tasks easily.\n\nOverall this is not a bad game at all, the theme is enjoyable the story is alright and for the price you definatly get a good few hours distration, and the soundtrack it as I said earlier really good.\n\n\n\n","March 2, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perhaps not the best "game" or RTS out there, but there are some really unique aspects to it, if you can get past the frustrating and confusing first missions.\n\nThis is very clearly an indie game, but it's one of a kind we don't see too often, nowadays. Everyone can make some kind of game, so our focus has shifted and broadened from what it was back then, when mainly programmers and computer scientists could make a game on their own. And this game shows that perspective a lot.\n\nThis game is you trying to clean up an accident that happened with sentient AIs that downloaded a Spam e-mail's virus. And the way that the story is presented is clearly from a more technical point of view which is not all that common, nowadays.\n\nI'd think of Darwinia more as a Sandbox than as a game. Honestly, the campaign wasn't all that good. The game hasn't aged well (suprisingly, the graphics still looks fairy modern). It doesn't explain its mechanics well at all, and I was stuck on the first two levels for completely different reasons.\n\nFor example, the missions don't end. You'll get a message that your objectives are complete, and then you manually leave the level. It's... strange. And if you miss the message, good luck finding what's wrong!\nAlso, a lot of the missions boil down to "wars of attrition", while you figure out a decent strategy.\n\nI thought of dropping the game after the first couple of level.\n\nBy the end, however, it gets really good. Once you get past the micro managing a squad with a very awkward path-finding, you get to spawning dozens and dozens of Darwinians, and exploding dozens of the enemies at once. Then it gets really cool!\n\nIt's mostly a Conquest game, where you try to spawn as many Darwinians and move them to a ConqueredPoint to spawn even more of them, and eventually conquer the whole map. But something about the way its done is really charming, and it's just fun to see the AI do their thing.\n\nI didn't enjoy the campaign, for the most part.

This is not a bad game, not by any stretch.\n\nThe first thing I would say is that I absolutly LOVE the soundtrack! the mix of old 8 and 16 bit music with a modern twist is greatly appreciated. I can acutally see me listening to some of this outside of this game it is definatly good enough.\n\nThe theme of the game being set inside a network that has been invaded by a virus,and you have to help restore systems and giving personification to the systems and AI is a wonderful touch. I also like the progression it is tied into finding upgades via research that your enigneers have to scan in order to upgade your capabillites.

In order to progress any further I would have had to look up how to get any further outside of the game, that should never have to happen with this type of game in my opinion.\n\nSecondly there are a few little annoying glitches and bugs, like when selecting a unit to build, often I would not always get the one I chose, and so had to dismiss the unit just built and give the build order again, its annoying the first time, by the tenth time I was actually getting into the habit of automatically holding down the unit menu [TAB] in order to cancel what it was going to build... thats not a good thing. And a number of troops would happily walk into force feilds or danger despite having a clear path they could have took, meaning micro management is compulsory.\n\nThirdly there is no way (that I have figured out, forgive me if this comes a little later in) to group up multiple units, this makes micro management even more annoying and takes away from the flow of gameplay as you cannot split tasks easily.\n\nOverall this is not a bad game at all, the theme is enjoyable the story is alright and for the price you definatly get a good few hours distration, and the soundtrack it as I said earlier really good.\n\n\n\n","March 2, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I loved it so much that I had to give the devs their due.\n\nThe game is short and sweet, but that doesn't mean it's not fun.  Darwinia drops you into a virtual world inhabited by Darwinians, A.I. programs that are the result of a 10-year research project.  Unfortunately, a virus has gotten loose in the system, and it's up to you and Dr. Sepulveda (the world's creator) to eradicate it.\n\nThe game plays like an action/RTS hybrid, with a look-and-feel heavily inspired by TRON.  Your main "programs" (read: units) are the Squad, which can attack the virii directly, and the Engineer, which can recapture buildings taken by the virus and collect digital "souls" for reprocessing.  Most levels consist of the having the Squads and Engineers clear out an infected area, converting the dead virii into new Darwinians, then sending in the Darwinians to work the various buildings that are central to Darwinia's operation.  Later on, you get some upgrades and new programs that allow the Darwinians themselves to join in the fight.\n\nThe control scheme is interesting; you create programs by drawing gestures with the mouse.  Once you master this, it's a snap to quickly roll out whichever programs are suited to the task at hand, especially when it comes to switching between the Squad's secondary weapons.  You can switch to a menu-driven interface if you prefer, but I personally think the gesture system is more fun, if a little finicky at times.  Maintaining your composure enough to accurately draw a gesture while in the heat of battle is part of the challenge!\n\nIf I had one complaint about Darwinia, it's that it's just too darn short.  You can reasonably finish the game in a weekend, but it only leaves you hungry for more.

Your main "programs" (read: units) are the Squad, which can attack the virii directly, and the Engineer, which can recapture buildings taken by the virus and collect digital "souls" for reprocessing.  Most levels consist of the having the Squads and Engineers clear out an infected area, converting the dead virii into new Darwinians, then sending in the Darwinians to work the various buildings that are central to Darwinia's operation.  Later on, you get some upgrades and new programs that allow the Darwinians themselves to join in the fight.\n\nThe control scheme is interesting; you create programs by drawing gestures with the mouse.  Once you master this, it's a snap to quickly roll out whichever programs are suited to the task at hand, especially when it comes to switching between the Squad's secondary weapons.  You can switch to a menu-driven interface if you prefer, but I personally think the gesture system is more fun, if a little finicky at times.  Maintaining your composure enough to accurately draw a gesture while in the heat of battle is part of the challenge!\n\nIf I had one complaint about Darwinia, it's that it's just too darn short.  You can reasonably finish the game in a weekend, but it only leaves you hungry for more.  Guess I'll need to check out Multiwinia next...","May 6, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perhaps not the best "game" or RTS out there, but there are some really unique aspects to it, if you can get past the frustrating and confusing first missions.\n\nThis is very clearly an indie game, but it's one of a kind we don't see too often, nowadays. Everyone can make some kind of game, so our focus has shifted and broadened from what it was back then, when mainly programmers and computer scientists could make a game on their own. And this game shows that perspective a lot.\n\nThis game is you trying to clean up an accident that happened with sentient AIs that downloaded a Spam e-mail's virus. And the way that the story is presented is clearly from a more technical point of view which is not all that common, nowadays.\n\nI'd think of Darwinia more as a Sandbox than as a game. Honestly, the campaign wasn't all that good. The game hasn't aged well (suprisingly, the graphics still looks fairy modern). It doesn't explain its mechanics well at all, and I was stuck on the first two levels for completely different reasons.\n\nFor example, the missions don't end. You'll get a message that your objectives are complete, and then you manually leave the level. It's... strange. And if you miss the message, good luck finding what's wrong!\nAlso, a lot of the missions boil down to "wars of attrition", while you figure out a decent strategy.\n\nI thought of dropping the game after the first couple of level.\n\nBy the end, however, it gets really good. Once you get past the micro managing a squad with a very awkward path-finding, you get to spawning dozens and dozens of Darwinians, and exploding dozens of the enemies at once. Then it gets really cool!\n\nIt's mostly a Conquest game, where you try to spawn as many Darwinians and move them to a ConqueredPoint to spawn even more of them, and eventually conquer the whole map. But something about the way its done is really charming, and it's just fun to see the AI do their thing.\n\nI didn't enjoy the campaign, for the most part. But certainly something to try out!","May 31, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your goal is to conquer 10 maps, and you can do it at your own pace, which is unique for a real-time strategy game. It's also forgiving, if one strategy doesn't work out, you can try another one. I've played it thrice, each iteration took me about 20 hours (though you may be able to do it quicker).\n\nThe game has a very nice storyline, dealing with artificial intelligence, and seems to pay homage to Sir Clive Sinclair, a British entrepreneur and visionary who created the ZX Spectrum home computer in the 1980s, without explicitly mentioning his name.\n\nThe game is relatively old, I got my first copy in 2005. (Tidbit: Darwinia was also released on Steam in 2005, as one of the first 3rd-party games.

This game takes the best of arcade-fashion gameplay and adds the 3rd dimension.

It's been a fun 20 hours.  Great game., very unique which I appreciate.  Short and intriguing story.  The Top 10 reviews pretty much have everything else covered.  It's different.. in a good way.","January 8","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It provides a nostalgic gaming experience but I found it too dated to be much fun.  Not really worth it, unless you can get it for ~25 cents like I did.","June 4","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
