Full Burst brings you a revamped of Storm 3 Cinematics and a New Chapter, a Chapter that enables you to fight against Kabuto at his Sage Mode, he can be playable after the completion of the chapter.\n\nThe game has over 80 playable characters, from the young generations to the characters of the On-going 4th Great Ninja War. In addition, 100 new missions has been implemented on this version that expands the gameplay hours due to challenging objectives. In addition, 38 Free Costumes, character outfits that were DLC's from the orginal Storm 3, which were worth more than ¬£30 in total. English and Japanese audio is available within the game alongside with english subtitles.\n\nOverall the gameplay is fun and entertaining, ain't hard to get grasp on to execute visually appealing combos. The characters has been re-balanced for the satisfaction of online play from the orginal Storm 3. The game does not end after the story mode, the all New 100 Missions and Online play is available for the challange. Over two thousand in game collectables are available to haul, from profile cards to titles, which can be used to customized your in game battle profile.\n\nVerdict:\nAs a Anime fan i would give this game a 9.5/10 due to the justice it served on the original content as well for the Ninja Storm franchise.\n\nHowever as a Gamer the game appeal to me as 6.5/10 due to the lack of depth gameplay mechanics, although this type of game isn't supposed to be complex, unlike Guilty Gear and Street Fighter which have more rigid and competitive gameplay. Though Storm 3 serves multiple objectives, it can be a gateway to a reminisence childhood or enter a whole new world of dedicate fans of animes. Or maybe you just simply want to enjoy to see Sasuke getting lariat by the Raikage dozen of times. *no offense to Sasuke's fans ;)*\n\nNOTE: The game starts directly after the Pain Arc, no filler characters are in this game, only Canon story is implemented - summarization with 3D visuals, more than 24 hours worth of 3D custcenes.\n\nIn case you're not familiar with the Shippuden series and want to watch/catch up, there are roughly 200 anime episodes to watch in total, filler excluded, in order to catch up with the story in this game.\n\nWatch Guide List:\n\nWatch episodes 1-56\n\nSkip at 57-70\n\n71 - Last 10 min or so is manga material. But is relevant for the next arc.\n\nPick up at 72-89\n\nSkip at 90-111\n\nPick up or Skip - 112 - Last 10 min or so is manga material. But is relevant for the next arc.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RageVG/recommended/234670/","RageVG","RageVG üçÜ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RageVG/","144 products in account","[SPOILER FREE] Very, very good game - Not so good port.\n\nIf we were to focus on the porting of the game rather than the game itself then we'd get nowhere, as there's not a lot to say and not much of it good. So instead, I will focus mainly on the game itself from my experience with the Console editions, and later tie that in with the PC port.\n\nSo, as anyone who has played a game in the STORM series knows, it is the go-to series for a true-to-the-anime experience. Everything is there; the beautiful graphics, the original voice actors, the story, everything. Even the tiny details you wouldn't normally catch (Such as Tobi's subtle and goofy taunts), are present. It's really what the anime would look like if it were real.\nSTORM 3 was a massive step up from its predecessor, Generations, in that it took the new mechanics and elements brought to the table and refined them further, and over a year after release there are still new mechanical tactics being discovered or used in entirely new ways. There are more ways to fight in STORM 3 than there were before; many viable combinations of characters and playstyles. Although it seems at times that some are more useful or practical than others, typically it lies down to individual cunning to overcome what is ahead of them.\nThe story is faithful to the anime (Up until a certain point, however the anime hadn't got to this point yet so it's understandable), and really makes you feel as if you were in the Naruto universe. My main gripe is the endless chains of cutscenes, with no option to skip them all, as there is a loading sequence between each one. I love the cutscenes as they are stunning, especially with Full Burst's revamped graphics, but they lose their impact if you're replaying the story mode. It would be nice to be able to skip them all without loading up each one.\nAside from the main story, there are side missions aplenty, allowing you to learn a little more about the other characters in the universe that still tie in to the main story. Very good for anyone who enjoys the other characters and want to see more of them.\nThe soundtrack to the game is reminiscent of the anime and equally as awesome. No complaints what-so-ever about the audio, as it's been spot on in all of the STORM games and I'm a huge fan of each OST. (My personal favorites were STORM 2's "White hot battle at the summit" and "The Uchiha Hideout" stage music.)\n\nAnother reason people are drawn to the series is for the multiplayer. Sadly, with exception to the new roster and mechanics, STORM 3 did not bring much new to the table that was exclusive to the multiplayer, however they did take what was already there and make it just that bit better. For example, whilst there are now thousands of possible ninja info card and title choice to choose from, none of this is visible to other players unless it's a 1v1 fight. It subtracts a lot of the motivation to unlock these cards and then spend time personalizing it when there are only two modes in which people can even see it, and even then it's only for a few seconds before both players prepare to begin character selection.\n\nAs for the non-1v1 modes, Tournaments or Endless, Both modes had a new feature added, but neither of them were really that interesting.\nNobody plays elimination Endless (A mode where you keep playing until you lose, at which point you are kicked from the lobby) because people join endlesses to play mutliple matches with a group of people over a period of time, and being ejected from the lobby for losing, or having your opponents ejected when you win, is just like playing 1v1 modes except with a waiting list.\nAs for Perpetual tournaments (Tournaments where each match has two stipulations that affect both players), they can still be interesting, however the feature just wasn't taken advantage of. There could have been countless possibilities for different rules and options. They could've made it so one player is affected by one rule whilst the second player is only affected by the second one. They could have also added in many more rules, too, however you'll usually have seen it all after your 3rd or 4th tournament.\n\nThe Ranked mode has also gotten considerably worse; CyberConnect2 sacrificed a lot to try and keep the game balanced, and ultimately it went to waste as there are still the small stable roster of characters and supports you'll see in the majority of your matches (Looking at you, Kimimaro and Neji.) however unlike the past games, balancing patches have been brought out to try and quell this, however most players still stick to the familiar "meta" teams.\nDisconnections (Or Ragequits) were an issue CC2 attempted to address, however there still seems to be literally no penalty for people disconnect often, as there are players with thousands of disconnects and people still play against them. Some people actually take pride in their disconnection frequencies now that they have no limit.\nEssentially, CC2 is concerned about punishing legitimate players who accidentally disconnect, however that's exactly what's happened now; I'm still getting disconnects just like someone who ragequits. If they would just give disconnecters a loss and, or heck, even JUST give the other player a win, then nobody would be bothered by disconnections at ALL.\n\nBut not all multiplayer must be online - The offline multiplayer is fantastic. All of the tournament features are available for offline use, and with addition of Full Burst; there are plenty of challenging missions which actually net you some nicely-made wallpapers. Each battle has unique stipulations, which further begs the question of why they didn't include them in the tournament mode.\n\nAnother unforseen but very welcome addition only possible due to the PC port is the inclusion of mods. Sadly is there no official support for mods - yet (wink wink) - however the community has still managed to bring some incredible content to the table, such as unlocking characters that were once unplayable and actually caused CC2 to recieve a bit of backlash for not including. There are new costumes, new stages, new characters, new movesets, you name it.\n\nSadly that's where the good news stops when it comes to the PC port. On launch, the game was plagued with a terrible bug that rendered the online mode nearly unplayable. It took a rather long time to fix, but it was eventually fixed. There were also many crashes during the story mode, however one still remains as of writing this. It appears that CC2 is eager to co-operate with its community though so I expect that these issues shan't persist forever.\nAnother problem were the very high system requirements. Although understandable for such a stunning and complex engine, it was rather disappointing to many people that the game simply couldn't run, especially due to the very little amount of graphical settings available to the user.\n\nWith that being said, here is my conclusion;\n\n+ Brilliant graphics.\n\n+ Perfect OST\n\n+ Faithful to the anime\n\n+ Very easy to pick up and play\n\n+ Huge and active fanbase\n\n+ Mountains of content of all kinds\n\n+ Community-driven developers\n\n- PC port was rather disappointing\n\n- Too much focus on a "balanced" online mode which didn't end up being balanced, often at the sacrifice of other, much more enjoyable features\n\n- No official support for mods despite a thriving modding community\n\n- poorly optimised\n\nOverall, I love this game, and this series. I have put thousands of combined hours into the entire series on PC and consoles.There are definitely glaring issues or places where they could've really put some work in and made something incredible, however everything else that is expected of the STORM series is met in spades. I cannot wait for the next STORM game and can only pray that CC2 keep up their level of community interactivity and keep on improving on constructive feedback.","February 5, 2014","true","398.7"," 257 of 299 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","257","299","0","11"

I felt ripped off when I was in the launcher, as I there are only two graphical options, no default keyboard config(many ppl recommend to play this game with a controller). After I got a good keyboard config(guide made by ThillinaC), I launched the game, hoping to find my moneys worth. After the prologue, my feelings about this game turned 180 degrees. I wasn't a Naruto fan, but the story of the game won me over. I wasn't a fan of fighting games, but now I have more of those in my wishlist.\nThis game isn't a good PC port, but it has the steady 30 FPS, so you can enjoy this game that it's better than most expect. Like every fighting game, there are a ton of characters with different unlockable skins, each one with their unique moves. Even tough you'll most likely end up with picking favourites, picking random characters will show you that each character can win if you have the skill. The battles aren't about tactics as much as about timing, as the controls are the same for everyone, just the way the characters execute the commands is different, which makes every character interesting.\nThe story is so good that it makes the game deserve an underrated tag. For me it's up there with games like Mass  Effect, since I've experienced many emotional impacts and catharsis throughout the game. It's all about the kid who turns out to be the hero that inspires five nations to believe in themselves again and fight the war to prove the opponent that peace in this world can be. The story can turn out to be enough to get a person out of depression.\nThere's also free roam and the sense of exploration brings many rewards. The missions can be replayed, along many bonus ones. There are a lot of extra battles, like tournaments and mission challanges, that make wallpapers be available for the desktop.\nIt's a great game, both in quality and quantity, but it's also a bad port. I won't complain about the graphics, but some texture models could have used an improvement. 9.3 is the score for the game and I(along many fans) look forward for the next game and every naruto game that comes after it(that's how much of a fan this game has made me)","August 23, 2014","true","56.0"," 223 of 268 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","223","268","3","4"

Here's a game not simply for any old Naruto fan, but for Naruto fans who are completely up to date with the story and characters as they currently exist in the anime/manga episodes and are seeking a new way of experiencing previously explored plotlines. If you're not up to date, then not only are you going to struggle enormously with the story as depicted in the game's early stages, but you're going to ruin what you've not yet seen of the TV series. Unfortunately, due to gameplay that is as unwieldy and bloated as its title, Full Burst is not an acceptable way to get yourself up to date with this franchise.\nhis may be a beat-'em-up, but the primary Ultimate Adventure mode features so little gameplay in comparison to cutscenes and dialogue-heavy exposition that you'd be forgiven for thinking you're sitting through a barely interactive (albeit combat-heavy) soap opera. It feels as though developer CyberConnect2's plan was to create a condensed edition of the anime in which fight scenes are playable, rather than create a game in its own right. This leads to an experience that features such haphazard and irregular pacing that your principal cause for intrigue rests in trying to work out just how long it's going to be before the game asks you to pick up the controller again--and even when you do, the core combat is a shallow, button mashing affair that requires little in the way of skill. While there's definite and worthwhile value in repackaging the events of a beloved series in a new format, there's also value in a game giving you something to do.\n\nThere may be a lack of interaction in story mode, but that doesn't hold true for the package as a whole. Including all of the downloadable content released for the original Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja 3 release, the volume of content on offer is gargantuan. Chief among the additions is the extra Ultimate Adventure chapter, which sees Sasuke and Itachi Uchiha take on the nefarious Sage Kabuto, a segment that is so phenomenally difficult in comparison to the rest of the game that all previously learned tactics become essentially redundant. The same Sage Kabuto is unlockable as a playable character if you have the patience to jump through the numerous hoops to unlock him, and there are also some new costumes to swoon over.\nhe biggest, but certainly not most interesting, piece of extra content comes in the form of supplementary challenge missions. One hundred of these have you beating an opponent in a fight while handicapped in some way--removing your ability to jump, for example, or setting a limit on the number of attacks at your disposal. While these missions do add some welcome variety to the combat, they primarily serve to highlight just how shallow the core mechanics are. Without these externally shoehorned twists on battle, fighting suffers from an overwhelming shallowness that sees you engage autopilot once the basics become second nature. Only during set-piece boss battles are you asked to do something out of the ordinary.\n\nTo compound matters, the most members of the enormous character roster plays in the same way. You swap between characters regularly during Ultimate Adventure, but this is done predominantly to facilitate the narrative rather than to spice up gameplay through variety and diversity. Granted, significant and impressive visual flair is achieved by switching often between characters with attacks that are literally out of this world, but that aesthetic quality doesn't remain interesting long enough for the combat inadequacies to be forgiven. Clearly, this is not a game with the remotest desire to cement its place in the bastion of hardcore fighting game legacy, but that doesn't excuse the fact that there's so little meat to the gameplay that you're essentially feasting on elaborately painted bones.\n\nSimilar problems exist with Ultimate Adventure's role-playing-game-lite elements, which allow you to roam around a number of different environments with a view to collecting and buying items to use in combat (health potions, strength buffs, and so on) and optionally talking to loitering non-player characters. At times, these moments provide a welcome break from the cutscene/fight/cutscene pattern, but more often than not, they feel designed to artificially lengthen the game and trick you into thinking you're playing something with genuine genre-blending aspirations.\nThe closest comparison to this format is Asura's Wrath, another of CyberConnect2's offerings. However, where Asura's Wrath succeeds in this style of storytelling thanks to its short length and ferocious pace, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 suffers from attempting to cover far too much ground for the core mechanics to handle. If you do classify yourself as a Naruto aficionado, then simply having another medium through which to consume the narrative is potentially going to be enough to satisfy you. Without a doubt, everyone else should look elsewhere.","November 10, 2015","true","017.0"," 89 of 103 people (86%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","86","89","103","13","16"

Since this is the 3rd game, it starts the story in the middle so if you haven't played the other games (I haven't) but you have read/watched the entire series, it's all good. This game just goes on the story from the part right before the Great Ninja War. If you are a Naruto fan, this is a guaranteed "You'll like this" game for you.\n\nThe game is a 3D style fighting game and you go can either go through the story to fight the battles that happened in the manga in the game. The one thing I like about this is that everytime a battle starts, it starts on the normal difficultly, but if you are having trouble with that battle and lost over three times, the difficultly gets lowered. I really liked that, caused me not to get stuck on certain battles.\n\nThe cutscenes are animated 3D models, and that is pretty amazing how they made them look beautiful with models, at the same level as RWBY, which is probably the best 3D animation(anime?) ever. The characters and voices were great (I think they used the same ones from the anime) and matched the story of Naruto overall.\n\nThere is one section of the game where you can play as Naruto's pregant mom and that part really cracked me up. Another thing is that everytime you buy ramen from the ramen guy in town, all your health and chakra gets restored. THE RAMEN IS MAGIC!!!!\n\nThis game is supposed to be on XBOX controllers but the PC version is also great, but has some problems. There are glitches in the game. Sometimes theres one battle that just causes the game to crash, or one specific move that will cause the game to crash. This is one of the reasons why I never actually completed the entire story within the game. One of the last battles during the Great Ninja War would keep crashing, so I gave up. (I already know what happens anyway)\n\nI suppose one of the things I didn't like was the spread of save points. Some save points would be placed 2 minutes of each other while others are 2 hours from each other. That was one of the cons of this game since I can't play games in a marathon and I don't think I am the only one.\n\nOverall, this game has its ups and downs but is a great game. It's also pretty long and hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading this long essay. ^-^","July 13, 2015","true","17.6"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","50","54","6","5"

Most of the people you find online anyway, will probably have a poor connection anyway, making the game very hard to play.\n\nThe online mode is pretty much only fun if you have friends who have this game too and you can get mods to make the game even better like... combo customization, unlock characters that shouldn't be playable, model swaps, and texture changes.\n\nI recommend this game to:\n\n- Those who want to play the great story mode\n\n- Looking for a simple combat system that is creative and can get complex\n\n- Who want to play online with friends\n\n- If you want to play with mods\n\n\nSome problems:\n\n- The Story mode at the end is not canon (It's not the true ending).\n\n- Free Battle is missing some characters that should be there.\n\n- Online mode is incredibly laggy.\n\n- There is no penality against people who disconnect or 'ragequit' before they lose.\n\n- The community is awful, everyone does the same thing, spamming jutsus and choosing overpowered support.\n\nSuggestions in the future for Naruto to CC2:\n\n- Stay canon obviously, why would they think that doing a fake ending was good? It'll only cause confusing in the next game.\n\n- Include every character that is fought in the story mode, now I'm not meaning giants from boss battles but...\nThe Edo Kage, The 7  Swordsmen, Dark Naruto, Edo Sasori, Gin and Kin should all be in the game.\n\n- Also, put more customzation into the game, looking through the files of the game, I found that you could swap jutsus and ultimate jutsus without having to choose the certain character, just like in the older games of Naruto.\nIf I want to play as Anbu Itachi and have Fireball, I should be able to, the jutsu shouldn't be locked to a certain outfit.","February 5, 2014","true","904.4"," 83 of 111 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","83","111","0","24"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NOGAMES/recommended/234670/","NOGAMES","NOGAMES #TeamBean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NOGAMES/","699 products in account","I'll start by saying that my only real prior experience of this series comes from the first game which I played on PS3 and very much enjoyed. That said I can't comment on how true it remains to the story in the manga or anime or whatever. Yet, it delivers a stunning movie like experience that rivals that of games like Metal Gear Solid and the Yakuza series. The attention to graphical detail is top notch and I've encountered very very few graphical errors which is pretty impressive for a console port. Going back to the cinemographic experience, the game is locked at 30 FPS in order to maintain the feel of the anime and even so it plays really smooth.\n\nThe gameplay itself is more reminiscent of a button mashy beat-em-up or more like one of the Dragon Ball Z fighting games than a true fighter. However, there is definitely a little bit of skill involved in managing your chakra and substitutions in on-line battles. Right now the on-line seems hit or miss. Some people can't connect to me at all, however with one person I played 10 matches without a single error and no major latency issues. Hopefully a patch will be deployed to fix the on-line issues. Single player vs cpu versus is available in addition to a local 2 player versus. The single player story mode starts off exciting, hits some slow points, then gets pretty good again and held my attention.\n\nOverall, as someone who is not a typical fan of the series I can highly reccomend this game to anyone who wants to enjoy something not typically found on PC. It is easily one of the best looking games I've played in a while.\n\n9/10","October 25, 2013","true","18.4"," 90 of 126 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","90","126","0","2"

If you like anime, you'll love this stuff, it almost √≠s an interactive anime.\nGreat over-the-top "ultimate" attacks with matching over-the-top visuals to show it off, yeah, the fighting scenes really look nice...\n\nThe combat controls take some getting used to, but when you get the hang of it you could win a fight in seconds. Mainly it's a 3d fighter, so if you're used to the 2d fighting games you'll have to learn some new tricks... No ducking from high attacks, but sidestepping frontal ones, and other such differences.\n\nApart from fighting solo, you can also fight with a team, and summon teammates to stand ine way a bit, or launch team attacks. Which makes a fight look pretty busy the moment all 6 characters jump around on the field.\n\nThe game consists of a Story mode, Free fight mode and online mode.\n\nThe story stays true to it's nature, which is nice, the only drawback I guess is that it's either full of spoilers if you really want to read/watch the manga/anime, or you end up skipping most of the cutscenes because you already know what's next.\n\nThere's also a few boss battles that require QTE's. Oddly enough they kind of make sense with the motion, rather than throwing random button inputs in your face, but they do detract a little from the action scenes going on. Either way, don't worry about normal battles throwing a QTE in halfway.\n\nAfter completing the story there's a few extra quests to do and roam a bit around a few locations of the story.\n\nFree fight has a survival mode which is nice to test skills with. And also has a mission mode, setting a few extra fighting conditions like losing power, getting poisoned by enemy attacks etc. Ofcourse there's also the mandatory quick battle.\n\nOnline Multiplayer seems to be a hit'n miss with lag, as with most of these fighting games... I guess getting a second controller and sticking to local multiplayer would be the best idea as long as internet can't catch up to these games.\nOr make sure you know who you're playing with and both have a decent connection to play this stuff.","March 16, 2014","true","48.9"," 57 of 81 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","57","81","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paper-tiger/recommended/234670/","paper-tiger","Paper Tiger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paper-tiger/","185 products in account","The Good:\n- Awesome realization of a fan-favorite anime/manga, with voice-acting in both English and original Japanese\n- LOTS of unlockables, including 80 characters and hundreds of music, audio, video clips and customizable features\n- Art is colorful and detailed and stands as a shining example of a game adapted from a manga/anime\n\nThe Bad:\n- *Very* cutscene heavy; familiarity with the series is basically a necessity in order to keep players invested in the lengthy story\n- Many forgettable level-specific mini games\n- Online play can be frustrating since some characters are very imbalanced\n\nNaruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 is a solid manga/anime-inspired fighting game that does a great service to fans, but might have a bit of trouble drawing in newcomers. It's not really a stretch to say that this game expects its players to be familiar with its universe. Taking place fairly far along into the series' second major story arc, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 jumps right into the story. The game does a good job of introducing characters and events, but I wouldn't be surprised if some people new to the series were to get a little lost in all of the terms and introductions.\n\nThe story mode is very custcene heavy. These cutscenes feel almost like they were extracted directly from the anime, which serves for a pretty cool and authentic experience. This is strengthened with the presence of the series' well-known music, which plays throughout the game's story and further immerses the player. However, similar to the anime, these cutscenes can be drawn-out at times, testing the patience of its audience. While there is always the option to skip these cutscenes, one should be aware that the game's story mode sometimes expects the player to be sitting for up to nearly ten minutes at a time, watching the story unfold like a movie, with little to no interaction.\n\nVisually, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 is very colorful and exciting. The cel-shaded graphics do an excellent job of capturing the aesthetic of the anime, really helping to bring the ninja world to life. Throughout the cutscenes and in-game environments, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 blends animated graphics with detailed illustration, providing a seamless picture that looks like it was taken straight from the anime.\nAdditionally, the animations of all the characters are very fluid and nice. General movement and specific fighting styles are all unique among characters and do an excellent job of giving each character personality. While the combat system itself is not remarkably deep, it still feels great to see and play as some of your favorite ninja, with most of the playable ninjas having their own unique style.\n\nOne thing about Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 that fails to impress is the multitude of mini-games and forgettable mechanics that the game tries to implement and then quickly discards.\nThe game does this multiple times with several different mechanics, introducing different mini-games that appear once in a level, never to make another appearance for the rest of the game. The fairly common introduction of insignificant mechanics lowered the game's overall quality for me, being a common but nonetheless painful mistake made by all sorts of games.\nHowever, outside of the story mode, these mechanics are not present and do not affect the fun of the game's actual versus modes.\n\nAside from the story, there is also challenge missions which challenge the player to complete fights under certain conditions. Along with the multitude of unlockables, these challenge missions do a great job of adding to the game's replay value.\n\nEDIT: Since beating the game's story mode about a week ago, I've played more of the challenge missions and done some of the side quests that are left over after the main story. They're actually really enjoyable and give you more opportunities to interact with your fellow ninjas, which is pretty cool. There's also a lot to explore - it surprised me how many places you can go after you finish the story! It does a great job of adding to the game's playability after the story mode! :D\n\nThough Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 does nothing to revolutionize the fighting game genre, I highly recommend this game to fans of the series. Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 stands as a solid fighting game in its own right, but the greatest appeal it has to offer is the way it brings the beloved Naruto universe to life.","January 13, 2015","true","57.0"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","24","26","2","2"

It is also advisable to have a  gamepad  to play, since fighting style games are not really developed for keyboard and this one is no exception.\n\nYou have 3 game modes available: Ultimate Adventure, Free battle and Online.\n\nStarting by the Ultimate Adventure, the story picks up after Pain destroyed Konohagakure and goes until the end of the Fourth ninja war (giving it an alternative ending to the manga). The main story takes about 10-12 hours to complete, of which probably 6-8 are cutscenes. After you finish the main story there is a load of side missions to do, and if you want to complete everything to 100% (S-rank every fight with bonus) it can take close to 30 hours. The art is fantastic, with little to no bugs in the free world map, and with very interesting side quests in my opinion. In here was where I learned the game mechanics which are pretty simple but still manage to make the game enjoyable.\n\nAfter you finish the Ultimate Adventure more than 100 characters will be at your disposable to use in Free Battles. In this section you can also do the 100 misssion battles with different challenges each, which should take you 10 more hours if you go for the 100% again.\n\nLastly the Online. It is terrible in my short experience. Games crash a lot (I wasn't able to finish a single combat in 5 tries and have a 100mb connection), and there is also a significant delay between when you press a button and the action takes place. This could be a turn off for you if you are buying the game for the online, but for fans like me, the offline mode will keep you very happy.\n\nI saved the best for last: YOU CAN USE MODS IN THIS GAME!! It is awesome, you can add characters like Goku Naruto, change characters movesets and even add new stages, all developed by a fantastic community and just ready for you to download xD\n\nTL; DR:\n\nPros:\n\n+Simple but addictive gameplay\n+Lenght (40 hours offline only)\n+Ammount of characters\n+MODS\n\nCons:\n-Extensive cutscenes\n-Online\n\nHope I have been helpful (:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","June 22, 2014","true","40.5"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","35","47","0","5"

It is an exceptional fighting game with strong and weak points to boot. As a fighting game and anime fan I do find this a very exceptional game\n\n\nThe story of Naruto if you don't know it please do look it up for it is long and still ongoing. The game will move on this time around to the ninja wars and will cover pretty much the events leading to it along with some material that isn't canon (Due to the fact the show is still going on and the game was made before it was finished so they had to find an area to stop). Also after beating the game there are also points in the game that will revisit the past Naruto.\n\nThe music is Fantastic, the voice acting is right off the show, and the style this game is done in fits it completely. Very fun game to play if you are looking for something to kill time on, lasted me hours playing this at least more than 10+. Works best on a controller.\nThe game features the fighting system that was used in the recent Dragonball games. You have dash away, power moves button, item usage, and attack, charge up etc and basic buttons and that you can learn. If you master them they can be pulled off in very advance ways. Though some of the characters are overpower nevertheless you'll have a ton of variety to choose from, play single player but ALSO INCLUDES TAG TEAMS AND MORE GAME + Less dlc!

This was especially annoying while trying to 100% the challenge missions.\n- Not enough graphic options.\n- The game seems to use more resources when running on window mode. I had no framerate issues while running the game on fullscreen.\n- Cutscenes. Too many damned cutscenes! The original cutscenes animated for the game were good but a good chunk of it is reused from the anime. It actually feels like the cutscenes were longer than the campaign itself.\n\nDespite all that, the game left a good impression on me.\n\n- The battle system is simple and easy to learn. The set of battle tips found in the start menu did a good job of explaining various mechanics. I think that a proper tutorial such as a practice fight would have been a lot better though.\n- The game cutscenes (not the reused anime cutscenes) were done really well.\n- The challenge missions were a good challenge. Some of them ranged from really easy to moderately hard.\n- Large cast of playable characters. I wish it were larger though.\n- Flashy moves!\n\nThe game was decent. It has problems that are common among ports but the production quality redeems it to a certain extent.\n\n7/10","October 23, 2014","true","27.1"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","29","46","0","4"

There is also a storymode (that I still have to play) and a very nice multiplayer with your own customized profile card. This game is well-balanced, since I could win with Zabuza from the Hokages and the Sannins easily. Also very fun to play this with friends or random online people. The hours I played is mostly the hours from local and online battle. It still didn't get boring.\n\nArt-style/GraphicsIt looks like your very own trusted Naruto. The graphics are pretty neat since it still has the anime style in it and the characters don't look very different from the original anime.\n\nI hope this helped, and if you have any questions, just ask and I'll answer it as fast as possible!\n\nUpdate after playing 150+ hours\nCombat System\nThe combat system of this game allows a lot of freedom. You can walk around the battlefield freely while fighting the opponent. There is also a substitution system in this game, which lets you transport most of the time behind the enemy, however there is a limit to doing that which is 4. After that, it recharges after an amount of time. Furthermore if you ever get beat down, you can use your awakening to try to take the lead again. Some characters have the ability to awaken whenever you want (at the cost of your *chakra) and other characters get the ability to awaken when a certain amount of health is left. The 2nd awakening is mostly more powerful too.\n\n*Chakra = it's a system where chakra stands for the energy your character has left. You can charge your chakra whenever you want in the battle and use it for quick dashes, ninjutsu** and your ultimate jutsu***.\n\n**Ninjutsu = if you want to deal more damage than just hitting the opponent, all characters have a special kind of attack to offer, called ninjutsu. For example, some characters like 'Itachi' can shoot a fireball.\n\n***Ultimate Jutsu = You are able to do the ultimate jutsu when your chakra fills up to 75% - 80% of your chakra bar. If you hit the opponent with your ultimate jutsu, the opponent will have a big part of his health bar reduced.","December 9, 2014","true","159.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Continue reading for further explanation.\n\nNARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst for the PC is a poorly optimized port. Judging this game on PC alone simply goes by how well your system is. The FPS is capped at 30, which is fine for me, yet high end systems still have difficulties hitting this cap. In addition, the game suffers from serious slow down at certain moments. While this is ignorable in moves that bring up cutscenes like Ultimate Jutsus, when they're on the field due to intense gameplay it really kills pace as frames slow down and inputs are delayed.\n\nThe story mode is alright. Free roaming doesn't really hold as much of a point in this game than it felt in Ninja Storm 2 (I skipped Generations so I cannot compare to that) there feels to always be something right to another which is understandable due to the approaching and commencing Fourth Great Ninja War, there is still a huge amass of repetitive side quests, a lot of them looking like things that won't lead to fights, and then lead to fights because its a fighting game.\n\nWhile Super Hard difficult CPU are alright, they tend to use Instant Awakening litterally until the points where they are forced out of it due to low Chakra or verge of death in some characters cases. This can make some fights really easy if they have jutsus that replace their supports if you end up landing a hit and able to predict their subs and counter, as they will have no outside help and will continously lose chakra.\n\nStory mode CPU while getting more difficult also tend to gain bonus stats to confront your ability to use food to boost your stats pre-battle for the whole battle, but becomes tedious and unfun as you're constantly breaking from the action to restock your ninja tools, which I flat out skipped aside from Paper Bombs and Healing items which I was reluctant to use due to having to manually restock them even if you have them stocked. The food items that heal you and give you bonus stats are still necessary if you're going into battles with lower health but also become tedious when you're full health having to navigate and wait on the menus to use one for the stat benefits, which almost feels necessary torwards the end of the game and in post game content when opponents can have +70 - +80 in one stat, which if that stat is Attack, a jutsu can end up doing around a third of your health which is about the amount a Ultimate Jutsu does.\n\n(No Spoilers) The ending of the game was also a great disappointment as fights have altered endings from Manga and Anime counterparts that drop all action immediately to just try and make sense of the game ending where it did and giving a bad transition into letting you free roam again to do the countless requests and Ninja Time Line, the rewards gained are for the most part not worth it. The benefit of some items are absolutely none as they sit as key items in your inventory that don't end up doing anything other than be collectables, while the majority of prizes are Ryo and ninja tools which while Ryo can be used to buy asthetic cards and titles for the Online mode, you only need to have around one run of the story to get enough Ryo to buy most if not all of the cards you can want. Ninja tool item rewards are lackluster as they are one time use and only useable in story mode, while thankfully, but serve little of a point as it seems the reward of one request is pointless money and tools to replace the ones you used if any.\n\nThere are, however, some fights in the Story mode with bonus missions, while all story mode fights have bonus missions it becomes more clear when looking at the time line that the rewards are different, getting Great Ninja Timeline scrolls for the timeline missions they have and beating those, result in gaining cards and titles which can be nice as they are normally relating to the fights which tend to be big ones like Naruto against Sasuke in the Final Valley, Sasuke vs Itachi in the Uchiha Hideout, Naruto and Pains fight in Konoha/Hidden Leaf.\n\nWhile the game does have its balance issues, I enjoy playing online. Although fights rely on the system and connection of both players to be fun as you sync with your opponent in frames so the slower of the two sets the frame rate for the game, while connections can still display "Transmitting..." connections in fight, which can range from sparce to every second or two, and even result from minor to drastic input delay. If you're looking for online play it may be better to pick this up on console where everyone has the same system and only worry about connection issues, while you may have a high powered computer to play the game 30 FPS easy, and internet to match, won't insure your opponents from having the same setup and will cause frusterating gameplay issues.\n\n\nThe game itself I feel is great. It's issues lie in its balance of certain characters, while there are a lot of characters and most of them sit in the same reigon of difficulty and reward, some even being lower in terms of reward, there is unarguably a higher tier of characters that have less difficulty for higher reward due to their high responsive movsets and great hitboxes allowing them to strike opponents straight out of subsitution or even hit opponents who substitute due to back hits and quite possibily attacks that make opponents sub in the same place which they aren't able to guard before hitting the ground allowing them to get locked again unless subbing multiple times to avoid taking full combo damage which can also be counterd by dash canceling to continue combos.\n\nAdding on the Guard Support, while not entirely broken, is nearly a must have on any team that isn't single support as its presence cuts momentum for someone who's ahead trying to keep the offensive, and for cutting the momentum of players in a loser position trying to capitalize on certain things like trying to cover great distance to an enemy who's just lost all their subs, but the guard support can end up blacking any dash as long as the opponent keeps his distance and making the opponent try and use dashes and counter them when they hit the guard support. The down side to this is when a Guard Support is deployed either as the manual jutsu support or doing its guard, if its on the field it won't guard if its on the field. If you strike a guard support with your dash it will be knocked on the ground giving about a 1 dash window where you can try and close distance and make contact before showing up again, but this is again, up to the enemy if he tries to delay you with jutsu, supports, chakra projectiles or even back dash. This is going to be fixed in Naruto Shippuden Ninja Storm Revolution where suppor types are taken and revamped into battle types, and that supports can be damaged and removed permadently from any source of damage be it even projectile tosses or dashes.\n\nOverall, as a PC Port, I've seen more than enough issues that cause the game to be unfun. The game is good but by extension of massive slow down, hard to reach but low FPS cap, and possibility of transmission screens and input delay fights online I'd have to give it overall a 6/10. If Cyber Connect 2 somehow ports this better to fit on more systems to better improve medium and lower end systems FPS it would be the difference between playable and unplayable. The game is over priced with a sequel on the horizon promising to be made more competitve and we can only hope that CC2 will end up making a better port as it will come to PC as well.\n\nIf you're looking to get Storm 3 on PC I would suggest waiting until Revolution comes out, and if it's in the same state or better in terms of optimization for regular game and online servers then pick it up as they will probably be a $10 difference at most, unless this game is on sale.","June 15, 2014","false","104.1"," 90 of 163 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","90","163","3","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/QuVoG/recommended/234670/","QuVoG","QuVoG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/QuVoG/","60 products in account","STORY:\nTo those that have watched the anime, the game starts off after Naruto defeats Pain and ends off with a fight with Tobi and the rest of the tailed beast, but his true identity was not yet revealed. Should you watch the anime first before playing the game? Ideally, yes. The Naruto STORM franchise basically caters to fans of Naruto in cases where one can simply skip one of the first few games and jump right to the latest STORM series and still be immersed in the story. This is especially so for us steam players, where only STORM 3 and 4 are available, but not the earlier STORM series.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nGameplay is very smooth and I personally feel that the fights are very fluid. Each character has their own unique jutsu (spells), thus making it more interesting to play each of the many playable characters to witness it, along with a short unique scene if you defeat your opponent with your ultimate jutsu. Not to mention that there are different combos that each character can use. Would definitely suck if there is only 1 attacking combo :(\n\nAfter you have completed the story mode, there is a free roam gameplay where you can roam to different villages and complete missions for achievements. However, one flaw of the free roam gameplay is that there isn‚Äôt a menu that lists the available missions. Only a few missions are available on the get go and the rest will only activate after you have completed a particular mission or fulfilled a certain criteria. I would find myself constantly referring to guides to figure out what and where are the available missions I can do so that I would avoid wasting my time running around aimlessly. It would also be nice if the free roam gameplay is a little bit more interactive, like being able to climb up walls with chakra, jump across huge gaps, and maybe beat up some random shinobis whenever I felt like it. This could be felt mostly during the story mode, where free roam gameplays simply just felt like filler to extend the overall gameplay time since all you can do is just run to your next destination. Well, I guess that it isn't Naruto anymore if there aren‚Äôt any fillers :p\n\nAnyway, I'm sure that most of the people here are more concerned about the 30fps cap. In my opinion, I felt that there is no need to have the cap raised as it has the same native fps as the anime. With this configuration, it felt familiar to those that have watched the anime. Furthermore, the fps of the game does not dip for me, giving a very stable fps of 27-30. In the beginning, I too was concerned about the 30fps cap. I mean, most games that I've played have fps above 60, but I eventually got used to it and felt that it wasn't really much of an issue that would stop me from enjoying the game.\n\nHowever, at certain instances, the animation videos doesn't sync with the audio. It isn't really much of an issue since it only happens once or twice, but would definitely be nice if it is fixed.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nThe graphical quality and art of the game is beautiful in my opinion. During the free roam gameplay, you are able to explore some of the villages like the Sand village. In between each village, you can witness the several breath taking landscapes unique to each of the villages. There are cases where I would simply just stare at the background of the game for several minutes :p\n\nEven though I'm using a NVIDIA NVS 5200M, which is a business oriented graphic card, I am still able to play the game with a stable fps. This would be good news to those that are not using a gaming laptop.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS:\nAchievements are relatively easy to get since you can simply replay a particular fight to get an S rank by going to the menu. Some fights may be challenging, but looking up guides will definitely make you feel otherwise. The only tedious part of the achievement process is the one where you have to complete 50 mission battles. Other than that, getting all the achievements isn‚Äôt that hard.\n\nPRICE:\nIs the game worth getting at full price? Yes. In my opinion, spending around $39.90 to entertain myself for more than 30 hours sounds pretty good to me.  However, if you‚Äôre willing to wait and not in a rush to play the game, I would recommend to just wait for an offer since the game usually goes on a discount of 75% every few months or maybe more in the future.","May 18","true","28.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Besides the story mode we still mode "Free Battle" where the duel with characters from the game, among others in tournament matches BE A missions with specific rules and objectives.Next mode is the game "Multiplayer" where we had a chance to try our skills against other players in the preseason or ranked games involving scoring points and promotions for another "titles" of anime.In conclusion in the game will not be bored rather a mass of things to do and win in the "online mode" and to "single" .The game itself is very enjoyable but not happen once we get angry because a close victory but ultimately our failure.Game recommend to people who like myself to play and relax but such maniacs as they play just to be "the best".\nBut is not the point?

That being said, I recommend this game, albiet only circumstantially. I'll elaborate on what I mean by that.\n\nWhether or not one considers his or herself an "anime fan", there is surely a plentiful amount of people that find satisfaction in over-the-top ninja battles and explosive action in general. I, personally, enjoy this game because you are put right in the middle of the ridiculous madness that is a Naruto battle, and it feels very fun. I know practically nothing about the series, and by purchasing this game, I didn't hope to expand my knowledge on it. I only play the story mode (which isn't anything special except for the boss battles) to gain access to all the characters to use in multiplayer battles. There isn't much depth to that, and that is significant in my personal enjoyment, because if we want to get metaphorical, I didn't buy it as a game. Rather, an explosive Japanese cartoon ninja action simulator. And at being that, it excels.\n\nIf you want story, don't buy it. If you don't have friends to play with, don't buy it. If you don't have a controller, don't buy it.\n\nIf you like fighting games on a large 3D plane, throwing fireballs at your friends or co-workers, or have ever dressed up like a ninja and run around your house yelling "rasengan!", this one's for you.","June 13, 2014","true","9.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It has tactical fighting requiring you to use tools, dodge, block, and time your attack patterns.  You success depends on making the right moves at the right time.  It's a great game and I think it's a worthy buy.  The cut scenes are extremely long and there is a long time between save points.  That's the only thing I have to say I don't care for.

The only downside may be a huge amount of cutscenes and unnecessary "walk from A to B" feature. The story covers everything from the end of Pain arc till Naruto breaks Tobi's mask.\nAdventure mode: A complete boredom. It had a solid potential as you take a look at Storm 1 but in this game it's just terrible. You can't sprint, you can't jump on buildings, you don't get fully voiced dialogues while interacting with other characters. All that you can do is travel through some places, break a crate, hit a mushroom (WTF?), receive a ridiculous amount of Ryo, finish a few filler-ish requests and complete the ninja timeline. That's it. I'd be willing to pay to see at least one person who enjoyed the adventure mode.\nCharacters, freebattle and online: This is the main thing for the majority of people who bought the game. Fighting mechanics are fairly simple, yet hard to master. You won't win against anyone that has spent some time on this game with your pure mashing/spamming skills. There's also a reasonably decent amount of characters but some of them are outdated or broken (overpowered/glitchy).The online mode itself is O.K. These are the modes that you can find online: Player matches, Ranked, Tournament and Endless. The biggest downside of online experience is the community itself. It's a rarity to find a decent player since most of them will try to play in the cheapest way possible and later on they'll rage quit if you will have the lead. Oh, and don't forget about the lag! You do need a good connection, otherwise don't even bother playing online or just submit a refund. So I suggest to find people to play with and you're good to go.\nVisuals, options, technical stuff: Every Storm game had sick graphics to present that anime feeling, it's famous for spectacular boss battles and especially ultimate jutsus, no complaints here. However, the video settings are just poor as well as the keyboard support. It is playable in freebattle just fine (keyboard warrior here with 500+ hours) but It's complicated to do analog spins in story mode.\nOverall, the port is poorly made (fps drops here and there), long loading screens, lack of settings, multiple bugs, netcode and server issues, etc. But despite these cons. I'd still recommend this game since it's fun anyways. 8.5/10\nMy Storm 4 review\nMy Storm Revolution review","March 15","true","520.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This kind of reminds me of dark souls , all the commands are xbox commands too, so when those quick actions come at you, you get a bitter taste in your mouth when you miss one simply because there are no default controls.  I mean otherwise, it is a good game. I don't like the way your keep the health from the health you had from the previous fight, seems to me like a way to make people who suck at the game feel better about themselves when they win against weaker ai opponents. I notice that in those matches they barely come at you unless you come up to them. It's clearly noticable. When there are single fights, no back to back fights, the opponent can play normally. There should be a difficulty setting in that case. Maybe it's just me but I just think it's a bit sad that that's the way they chose to make the fights more challenging(which they aren't).","October 11, 2014","false","4.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Most of the soundtracks are from the anime but there still is some new ones which is really good. You can see that the voice actors in this game really did some work on the voices. If you played the game you know what i mean.\n\nThe Story: Much like the anime it plays out in the Great Fourth Ninja War. From fighting and big demon fox too playing as konohamaru this game really have some amazing characters chooses. There are some quick time events which are real fun too.\n\nDLCs: There is no you get the full package when you buy this game\n\nThe Cons:\n\nIf you buy this game on pc your gonna have a bad time. There is no keyboard support for the game which makes it really hard to play it if you are on pc and dont know how to plug in an controller or dont have one.\n\nThe fights in this game can sometimes be really glitchy and overall bad, there is still really nice fights but some are just naaah.\n\nFinal Score:\nGraphics 4/5\nSound 4/5\nFighting: 3/5\nStory 3/5\n\nTotal Score: 3,5/5\nPlay this game if you really like naruto or want to try a new game. I dont recommend this game to people who doesnt read the manga or watch the anime. Sometimes it could be really confusing and some people could have a bad time with it\n\n\n","January 24","true","19.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

That is not to say the game can't be played with just a keyboard.\n\nI wish I could give this game more than a simple "I recommend it", because it deserves just so much more.\nI bought the game as a newbie to the Naruto universe and knew nothing, if not for a few basic things, but I had no trouble understanding what was going on and there were no important references to things that aren't actually shown in the game's story itself.\nThe story is engaging, fantastic and very lenghty, the cutscenes are mixed and balanced well with the actual fighting and when the quick-time events are never of the nigh-impossible kind. As all the DLC's are included in the PC version of the game there are many, many things to do well after the final mission. (Included some story side-archs which are no joke)\nThe difficulty of the game is well balanced too, it's never too hard but you have to learn pretty quickly how the mechanics work or you'll find yourself losing high amounts of health to attacks you could've easily dodged.\nThe fighting, as the story is just... fantastic. There are characters which outshine others but it's due to every fighter being unique to himself, there are even varying fighting styles between all the characters. (Puppeteers, ranged fighters, etc...)\nIf you're worrying about crappy graphics due to the game being a port, don't. There are some occasional graphical stutters that might annoy you but it's never anything harsh.\nSeriously, words cannot express how good this game is.\nDon't make the mistake of losing out on this gem, even if it's not on a discount, because, unless you absolutely despise Naruto (it got me, a complete ignorant, very interested to its universe), you will love the ever-existing guts out of it.\nI haven't tried out the multiplayer yet due to, after 33 hours of gameplay time when I was writing this review, still being immersed in the fantastic single-player experience, but I heard it's not dead. (Don't  ABSOLUTELY  miss out on the 12 mission-rewards wallpapers as they are absolutely beautiful and come in 1920x1080 size).\nBuy.

(Some nicer\nStory: 5/10 (Rating how well it did in adapting from the Anime/Manga.)\nReplayability: 8.5/10 (Online mode, and story mode have some stuff going for it.)\nMusic? 10/10 I thought it was done very well throughout each stage. I might be giving it too much credit, but it's definitely doing Naruto music justice.\nVariety? 8/10. Despite how much is put into the game, a story mode, an online mode, and a vs mode is really all it has. It wasn't jam packed with much, so the online mode, and even vs mode is really all you'll be coming back to the game for. Unless you're that psyched for the story mode in the game (Which, I'm sure not AS many were.)\n\n\n\nOverall rating for the game:\n8.5/10.\n\n\nI'd recommend picking it up if you had some extra cash at the moment.\nAnd definitely if you're a Naruto fan.","August 7, 2014","true","17.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

Even if it's not really original, cause its just the animes scenes with videogame graphics, it's done very decently and much better than other fighting games story mode. The graphics feel really sweet, despite the not so good FPS and the frame rates issues. Some lag in online mode as usual. A lot of available characters from the anime. Overall, a great fighting game.... if they cut the original price down you should definetly buy it, or if it's on a promotion like i did","August 25, 2014","true","13.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's pretty fun to experiment with all those ninja moves and jutsus , which the characters offer you. Unfortunately the story is short and only contains a part of the Naruto Shippuden series and the online mode isn't very good, because it takes a long time to search for players and most of them are PROs, which beat you up or Ragequitters. :D My Opinion: If you are an ardent Naruto Fan, then buy it. :)","January 10, 2014","true","59.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

In addition, many fans (including me) have grown indignant of purchasing EVERY damn game of these damn series, but still had to pay in order to get some freaking alternative costumes...... -_- (such a let down....)\nFinally, many really beloved to the fans characters (Kin, Gin, Edo Kages, 7 Ninja Swordsmen) are found in the story mode, but not in the free battle mode.... so.... that's another negative point...\nAnyway, all in all, it's a truly pleasant game that anyone, fan or not, can savor. But in contrary to that, it could potentially end up being a bit monotonus and annoying (especially when playing online).

As my Dualshock 2 wasn't compatible with this game, keyboard was the only option I had and !"#¬§% me was it hard to configure. Well the configuration per say was easy enough, but to actually bind all of the buttons needed for this game through a keyboard was a challenge in and upon itself. I believe the setup took apx 90min with some trial and error to get a grasp of the game mechanics and what worked or not.\nThat being said... It is most definetely playable through a keyboard given the correct settings! Don't get me wrong, a controller is a much better choice mind you... Still, you can enjoy the experience and get used to playing through the keyboard as well!\nGame itself? I honestly didn't feel much for it at firsthand, battles feels like a mixture between the Gekkitou Ninja Taisen series on GC and Ultimate Ninja on PS2. Overall it works but I don't enjoy them nearly as much! The overworld imo doesn't fill any meaning other than being an annoying slowdown between the progress of the game per say. Speaking of which - The game feels more like a movie! Now I've played the DBZ Budokai series and they too had fights followed by cutscenes along with various unlockables, however the game definetely was more challenging and fun due to customization of capsule skills, true you can customize your items for this particular game but at the same time I never found myself using them EVEN ONCE!\nOverall it is almost exactly like watching the anime with the exception of worse graphics and certain altered scenes, again for the worse.. I really !"#¬§% hated it in the beginning, but as time went on and what it really comes down to is that it's still very much Naruto at it's core and naturally you DO have an interest in the characters and the story...\nAs for the gameplay, it is extremely unbalanced! it goes from certain battles being a joke to some being insane, granted you can still S rank them within 5 tries or so. There are however during certain battles and these are mainly during the bosses when you have special objectives to be filled if you wanna achieve the highest rank. Some of these being purely !"#¬§%&/ LUCK BASED!!! For me this game goes to shiets at when you're supossed to rely on luck rather than skill..\n\nBottom line is that you will most likely enjoy the game if you are a fan! But truth be told, there are better installments of the franchise and it's by far not a masterpiece by itself either. I think metacritic was very generous giving this game 80 or what they did.. I wouldn't give it more than 65 at the most!\nMy advice is to pick it up on a sale at 9,99 AND NOT HIGHER, if you are to pick it up at some point. All I can say is don't expect greatness from it other than feeling a bit of nostalgia from the series, as the manga is to end within 8 weeks from typing this, it's fun in a sense to remember the past 15 years that has been Naruto. At the same time though, I can't wait till the anime is complete in order to re-watch the series and TRUELY feel nostalgic the correct way","October 14, 2014","false","20.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It runs smoothly, the combat is fun and the art is gorgeous.  The story is arguably pulled off better than the anime or manga.  It's not really an entry level story if you're not familiar with the anime but it's a fun game nonetheless.\n\nThere are a few issues with voices syncing with the lips but it may just be because of the native japanese and the requirement for multi language support.  They probably didn't want to animate for two different languages.\n\nI don't remember this being said on the Steam Store, but you pretty much need a controller, or at the very least look around for a proper keyboard layout.

For obvious reasons the game deviates from the anime slightly towards the end to create a suitable conclusion to the in game story.\n\n+The combat system is easy to master and very fluid; this makes it relatively easy to play on a keyboard [xbox gamepad is better] and still have a lot of fun.\n\n+The main story mode allows you to explore the ninja world on foot which for naruto fans is an amazing experience; you get to see parts of the villages that you don't really get to in the anime.\n\n-A large portion of the game revolves around secondary events and requests that you get from all sorts of NPCs which is not bad as it adds a lot of extra hours to the game but running back and forth through the same areas can get tiresome. One of my biggest issues is the lack of effort put into the way you move through the world; you can run, jump and break stuff. It would have been amazing if you could actually jump on/off of trees or buildings, or at least dash.\n\n\n- The combat system is a little limited due to the simplicity in my oppinion and I personally would have liked to see a few mor button combinations to allow for more jitsus [special moves] than just Y+B or Y+Y+B.\n\n- Multiplayer is an option for PC but in my opinion nothing beats a console at this sort of multiplayer; not having the person in the room as you smash him/her into a mountain with a giant Rasengan is just not the same as seeing that person slumping in defeat right next to you :D\n\nTo conclude I would have to recommend this game especially right now as it is on special, it is a great addition to the Bandai fighting game family.","June 19, 2014","true","30.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When the connection is clean, the game runs without a hitch, but when the connection chugs you'll feel it in both delay and the occaisional "Transmitting Data" popup for a moment. The gameplay flow makes laggy matches far from unplayable as there really isn't any urgency with your inputs or strict timing, but it's still an inconvenience when things slow down.\n\n\nThe single player story in this game shines bright, between the gorgeous graphics and the well written story (granted, it's yoinked from the show/manga, still a solid story), it's just a good experience. Also it's long. VERY. LONG. In a good way.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is worth a pickup for both fighting gamers and fans of the series alike. Just don't try to fight players outside of your region online.","March 7, 2014","true","25.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Stringing together badass combos to completely wreck your opponent's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is super satisfying. The story is very well put together, but if you haven't been keeping up with Naruto you might need a little explanation. Throughout the game you can unlock Ninja History Missions, which let you play fights from Naruto's past adventures, they dont give much story to what was happening, but they are all in order. I DO have a few nitpickey things to say though, like that we don't need 18 Naruto's with the same moveset, or all the Hokage's with their kage hats on (Seriously though, some of these costumes were completely unecessary for the game(swimsuits being completely necessary shutup)) If you already own the original it on a home console, its worth just waiting for a really good sale( I got mine for 10 dollars on both Xbox and PC) Overall, this is a really great game for someone that wants a good story with great characters, and Im really hyped for Storm Revolution this September","June 24, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

And the gameplay is awesome too + the challenge missions with the reward system everything. I even got some wallpapers for my desktop a feature which I havent seen in any game before that I played.\n\nThe free roam system feature + tournaments + random events + tons of missions and even some kind of a moral/friends system for your fellow ninja and a samurai you met in adventures with mail getting to choose the right question for more favor all great.\n\nAlso my favourite character is sage mode naruto his ninjutsu never missed and always guaranteed a ring out. :D","August 15, 2015","true","40.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm sure many of you here already own this on a console and pretty much know what the game is all about. So I won't waste my breath here regurgitating all the much-deserved praise this game has already received for being a beautiful and fantastic story and its masterful art. You already know that you want this game, and you already know that you will love it. All you want to know now is really: Should I go invest in a controller? Will my computer run this?\n\nThe answer is yes and no. Yes you MUST invest in a controller for this game, there is no way around it. Get yourself something you'll be comfortable, I use my 360 controllers, because this isn't the only game you'll ever need one for. And the 2nd answer is no, because this game is a port it's uber poorly optimized. I have a 1200p monitor and I was extremely confident in my PC running the game full resolution with 2x anti-aliasing. Quickly my PC told me to go ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• myself because YES - THIS IS APPARANTLY HARDER TO RUN THAN BATTLEFIELD 4! So - this being a fighting game and all - you are shooting for 60 solid fps, so you will need to turn your resolution down to 720p and don't even bother with that anti-aliasing crap.\n\nStill on the same topic - the game looks fantastic no matter what, just do everything in your power to keep it ~60fps because if you don't then the animations will all slow down accordingly (30 fps will slow the game down to 1/2 the speed). Just trust me - this will look much sharper on your PC than your console even in 720p with no anti aliasing and that actually made it a more enjoyable experience and worth picking it up a 2nd time!","June 5, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But in my suggestion i liked this alot better than the anime. Even though there were alot of cutscenes and Quick Time Events (which i do love in this game.) The game had so much emotion in the game that will make u feel depressed or sad in some ways.The only flaw i would say in this game (If people have a xbox controller then your one lucky mofo) is that you have to setup your own keybindings for the game.Usually people who don't have or seen a xbox controller would be REALLY confused and there is no tutorial to exactly know what the controls are (unless you look at your setting controls or when u press start to see the buttom mechanics.) that will be fustrating also for alot of people. But after a 30+ i got used to the controls so well (Using Keyboard)and the movement is smooth and fluid, also it's fine with the keyboard(but i would recommend people to use the xbox controller if you do have a controller O.o). Other than that the game is pretty fun.Mostly the multiplayer is pretty much the main potentiol of the game and it's characters. The only problem i have witht he multiplayer is if the host is either lagging or has some horrible internet, it will infect u while your trying to fight the person in a 1v1 match.\nI would rate this game 9/10. Just bc i am a huge Naruto Fan and the game is fun even though i watched the anime/manga I am kinda glad they have this game on PC other than xbox or ps3.","March 1, 2014","true","33.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In story mode there are either normal battles or boss battles, with unusually strong opponents who need advanced strategies and some QTEs to be defeated. The RPG elements of Ninja Storm 3 comes into play regarding some "ultimate decisions" you can make in certain battles (which can change the way some encounters are played) and the items you can equip and use in battle (some of them being able to heal you, others to boast your stats, others to depower your opponent, ...). The game follows the series' main plot very closely, sometimes even expanding upon some specific events (and always for the better). The only downside of the story mode is the enemies AI, which leaves them wide open to exploits, making several battles rather easy (with the exception of later bosses).\nNinja Storm 3 is a solid fighting game with some unique and interesting features: you can use a substitution technique in battle to escape an opponent's attack and get him easily (althought the technique works only with a set of charges that aren't always ready); you can summon a maximum of two supporting characters to either protect you, attack your enemy or pull of powerful combination moves; you can use ultimate awakening modes if low on health to gain the upper hand.\nNinja Storm 3 features also a multiplayer battle mode and a free battle mode, which are made very entertaining by the high number of playable characters and combinations of them you can make.\nThe Full Burst expansion comes with updated graphics, a challenge mode that requires you to beat a series of battles with specific conditions and a short new bonus story chapter, "Brothers reunited", which pits you against a new bonus boss, Sage Kabuto.\nNaruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is both a great game for Naruto fans (who will surely appreciate its many details coming from the series proper) and an entertaining title for who is just looking for a fun fighting game","June 23, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But in my suggestion i liked this alot better than the anime. Even though there were alot of cutscenes and Quick Time Events (which i do love in this game.) The game had so much emotion in the game that will make u feel depressed or sad in some ways.The only flaw i would say in this game (If people have a xbox controller then your one lucky mofo) is that you have to setup your own keybindings for the game.Usually people who don't have or seen a xbox controller would be REALLY confused and there is no tutorial to exactly know what the controls are (unless you look at your setting controls or when u press start to see the buttom mechanics.) that will be fustrating also for alot of people. But after a 30+ i got used to the controls so well (Using Keyboard)and the movement is smooth and fluid, also it's fine with the keyboard(but i would recommend people to use the xbox controller if you do have a controller O.o). Other than that the game is pretty fun.Mostly the multiplayer is pretty much the main potentiol of the game and it's characters. The only problem i have witht he multiplayer is if the host is either lagging or has some horrible internet, it will infect u while your trying to fight the person in a 1v1 match.\nI would rate this game 9/10. Just bc i am a huge Naruto Fan and the game is fun even though i watched the anime/manga I am kinda glad they have this game on PC other than xbox or ps3.","March 1, 2014","true","33.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fortunately you can find people on YouTube that post tutorials.\n\n- Unskilled players are easily able to stand their own against other unskilled players, however there is a high barrier of entry for people who want to improve.\n\n- Skilled gameplay mechanics rewards those who have better reflexes and observation skills (provided that both characters in a battle are within the same tier).\n\n- The characters are unbalanced, several characters in this roster have a clear advantage over the others and this is abused very often in the online matches, speaking of abuse there are also a few glitches in the game.\n\nOnline:\n- You will often run into character teams that are disproportionately stronger than the team you selected.\n\n- One of the most notorious glitches used online is the use of close range ultimate attacks.

I was super hyped for this game. FINALLY, a Naruto game came to PC! And since i don't owe any consoles (except for a PS2), i was over-excited to finally skip the Dolphin's Wii emulatons; the PSP imitations, and play it for real. At first, i thought it would be great, since i didn't expect to play online. And boy, was i right about that.\nI do'nt have any console controllers, but i managed to make my way through with the keyboard (i literally imitated Mister Sheen: WINNING!), and i felt great until i had pretty much unlocked everything. It soonly started to get boring on SP, so i tried MP. A sad thought crossed my mind after seeing the game have a bad transmission. But still, i could just keep playing with bots, so it was a very small setback.\n\nWhat keeps my addicted until this day, is a very simple, and perhaps unexpected thing: The Community.\nBut not the raging quitters, the trolls, the spammers, or the IA Abusers (Neji, i'm looking at you). It was the modders. Modders like "wajinshu" in youtube, doing the first few mods for the game. Mostly Texmods, but sonly started the character swaps. Typhonua, who made some of the best swaps, not leaving much to be missed about it. Ultimate OmbuStorm for his awesome moveset mods, and many others. So yes, i'm stuck in this game, FOREVER, not because of the internet. Not because of most players. Because it's my favorite anime. Because it's worth it. And although it is a bit over-priced, i can't help it but be thankful for the guys who managed to mod it so much, everything is now accessible to us. Literally, EVERYTHING. Goku costume, Hokage Costumes, new Movesets, New Rosters. There's been thousands of mods, many of which are great, and that's what has been keeping me in here all this time.\n\nIf you're a big Naruto fan, i'm sure you'll like to buy this.\nIf you can't afford it, then i think i know what you'll end up doing.

Follow Ten-ten's adventure as she learns that truth, love, and friendship are completely meaningless if you can't hit the broad side of a barn. Cyber Connect once again proves that games are not about gameplay or story; they're about cutscenes.

This game brings some interesting additions to combat system which makes the game far more enjoyable and less frustriating while playing online against move spammers. There hardly is any noticable graphical change between this and previous part. But nevertheless its an amazing game that will keep you occupied for hours. The storyline is very touching if you are fan of the series otherwise it might seem very stretched and over dramatic at places. The Tailed beast fights are rather dull and camera angles are sometimes problematic. The boss fights are as epci as always giving you the feel like you are controlling the main character.

There are lots of characters to play with and they all have a unique style so the gamplay is endless.\n\nCampaign:\nIt follows the actual anime and it has enough side missions to spend time on after the main story has ended. These extra stories also unluck new pictures, substitution items, etc... even a survival mode where you can train your skills with your favourite characters.\n\nOnline:\nThough there are a lot of idiotic persons out there, who find it funny to just camp and counter/ spam and be irritating, there are also players who want to have a great battle with you. These guys will maybe give you a hard time but with them you will be able to really learn the basics.\nAlso the internet connection/ lag can occur quit often, though you will quickly find someone that doesnt lag and hey just add them to your friends list. I have got quite a couple active non-lagging players who I can play regularly with.\n\nOverall an amazing game, just find the right good-minded jplayers who are willing to help you and play fair and this game will keep you buzy for a long time.\n","March 11, 2015","true","277.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was super hyped for this game. FINALLY, a Naruto game came to PC! And since i don't owe any consoles (except for a PS2), i was over-excited to finally skip the Dolphin's Wii emulatons; the PSP imitations, and play it for real. At first, i thought it would be great, since i didn't expect to play online. And boy, was i right about that.\nI do'nt have any console controllers, but i managed to make my way through with the keyboard (i literally imitated Mister Sheen: WINNING!), and i felt great until i had pretty much unlocked everything. It soonly started to get boring on SP, so i tried MP. A sad thought crossed my mind after seeing the game have a bad transmission. But still, i could just keep playing with bots, so it was a very small setback.\n\nWhat keeps my addicted until this day, is a very simple, and perhaps unexpected thing: The Community.\nBut not the raging quitters, the trolls, the spammers, or the IA Abusers (Neji, i'm looking at you). It was the modders. Modders like "wajinshu" in youtube, doing the first few mods for the game. Mostly Texmods, but sonly started the character swaps. Typhonua, who made some of the best swaps, not leaving much to be missed about it. Ultimate OmbuStorm for his awesome moveset mods, and many others. So yes, i'm stuck in this game, FOREVER, not because of the internet. Not because of most players. Because it's my favorite anime. Because it's worth it. And although it is a bit over-priced, i can't help it but be thankful for the guys who managed to mod it so much, everything is now accessible to us. Literally, EVERYTHING. Goku costume, Hokage Costumes, new Movesets, New Rosters. There's been thousands of mods, many of which are great, and that's what has been keeping me in here all this time.\n\nIf you're a big Naruto fan, i'm sure you'll like to buy this.\nIf you can't afford it, then i think i know what you'll end up doing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolf-li/recommended/234670/","wolf-li","Wolf Li","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolf-li/","35 products in account","A fantastic fighter, especially if you are a fan of the manga or show and even if your not. ****Transmission Error's or not.**** Scroll to the comments section to for transmission error fix.\n\n-- Singleplayer --\n\nIf you're someone like me who can't sit through 15 seasons of filler and slow paced talking scenes the game does a great job of filling you in on most of what's happened without eating up months of your free time. Even if you have been watching or reading though it also gives you the option of picking the "Legend" route on certain fights to experience things differently; a great alternative to experiencing the same thing you've seen before but still progressing. The cut scenes are fantastically done and the option for the Japanese vocal track is always nice as I for one will punch someone if I hear Naruto say "Believe it!" one more time. Of course you are still forced to play as certain characters for certain parts that aren't always fun. Some of the boss battles can also be down right cheap, the final one for instance but hey, you only have to do it once and that's a small price to pay for how much fun is packed in there.\n\n-- General --\n\nNow for me considering I haven't played an Ultimate Ninja game before this was a welcome change from the Clash of Ninja fighting games, the cinematic, epic feel of every battle and the sheer complexity of the mechanics was something I wasn't expecting from an Anime fighter. If your looking for a little one on one kick-assery this is a fantastic place to land your feet. It is a little sad that you can't play even a tag mode or something similar, the complete lack of co-operative fighting does seem like an oversight considering how entertaining it could be and considering it's something Clash of Ninja has had since the get-go.\n\nOne more key thing to point out as well is the sheer amount of content here, holy crap the content. There is the massive Story Mode, the bonus Challenge Mode with 100 battles to complete, Survival Mode, Tournament Mode, the regular VS Mode and of course Online Mode. That's a a lot of things to clear. There is also an almost obsurd amount of collectables to unlock and purchase from Titles for your online Ninja Card to Ultimate Jutsu Demonstrations. The game contains 89 (correct me if I'm wrong) playable characters with only a few available as support only, as well as several characters having different costumes. Not counting same movelist, different costumes that seven versions of Sasuke to play as, rejoice Uchiha fans. It will take a while to unlock every character mind you but that can be done by either playing and earning money or clearing the entirety of the massive story mode. So if you don't like running through the sometimes tedious boss battles and the like, just hop into VS mode and beat the crap out of your friends. Which brings us to the biggest problem - I didn't say the game was perfect.\n\n-- Multiplayer --\n\nThe game does a decent job of balancing the massive roster but at the end of the day, some characters are just down right overpowered and cheap. Which can be a problem unless you happen to have mastered the game and the other person hasn't. Roughly 60% of the matches you play online will either be against the ultimate form of Naruto, Minato or Itachi and there's a reason for that. Not that the cheap characters are unbeatable but unless you're also a high tier character prepare to have an annoyingly difficult fight; oh Itachi your crows will haunt my nightmares. Of course this being said it's not the end of the world by any means. If your fighting your friends or just playing for fun it probably won't bother you and overpowered characters is something you should be expecting going into a fighter with such a massive roster that isn't aiming to be a serious competition game. Virtua Fighter this is not.\n\n****-- Multiplayer Section 2 --**** Scroll to the comments section to for transmission error fix.\n\nAnother key thing I have to draw attention to is something that has been completely "broken" about this game since launch: Transmission Error's. For those of you who don't know what this is, it's a disconnection error that occurs in most matches played online, example: I have played roughly 350 matches online, completing only 120 of them. While Namco-Bandai has assured us they are working on it, it has been present since launch and still isn't fixed. They have released a NA only patch for the game that, to it's credit did work somewhat, but instead of getting disconnected in some games we are presented with a slow down kind of lag and even then, sometimes are disconnected anyways. Assuming they do, at some point fix the issue the game will be downright fantastic but until then, the loyal fan base is left raging every match until you fight someone 30 times because it doesn't disconnect you for once.\n\n-- Final Thoughts --\n\nAll in all it's not a perfect game and until they sort out the transmission errors in the online portion, it will be broken for those seeking to use it. However, it still retains a fighting experience that you simply can't get somewhere else. Trying to end an epic battle with an Ultimate Jutsu is so much fun and that terrible moment when you chakra dash right into someone elses costing you the match, leaving you yelling out curses; barely coming out of a match on top thanks to a well timed awakening and realizing you lost by 1/8th a heath bar to Rock Lee and you didn't land a hit on him. Moments like these make you forget about the shortcomings of the game.\n\nIf your looking for a solid fighter pick it up and prepare to lose the next few weeks of your life, and bring some friends. If your looking for a competitive fighting experience, best to wait till the fix the online before investing. But either way, buy it at some point, it's worth the money.","January 2, 2014","true","181.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

However, this is the cool part and the sad one at the same moment. The game (if you can call it that way) has no adventure side, you follow the story in a cinematic/dialogue type, with little to no gameplay (the gameplay limits from going from 1 screen to another, and no more than 3, and this is from time to time), then, after a while, after watching a cinematic or reading the dialiogues, a confrontation between characters will happen, mostly the same fights that happened in the anime/manga. This is your gameplay, a small fight, then you go back to the cinematics/dialogues.\n\nThe sad part is that you get so little gampleay that you feel ripped off your money, however, the fighting mechanics, as basic as some button mashing can be, are quite fun, specially if you have teammates with you, which help you in battle (support characters ala mvsc), from time to time you will find some quicktime events, not actually difficult, but they might take you by surprise, since there are not that many.  Yesterday, i was "Playing" chapter 4, i watched 40 minute cinematic after a 5  minute fight.\n\nThe cool part is that if you have not watched that part of the story, you will catch up, and if you have, it doesnt matter, the game looks gorgeous, the art design is beautiful, the animation is very fluid, vivid colors, it is breath taking  watching the cinematics and the quick actions, i cant say the same about the english dub, but the original languaje is great.\n\nThe soundtrack is allright, while the main theme of this game is a very quiet/slow song, though beautiful, it does not reflect what we are used to hear in the anime. The soundtrack is good, dont get me wrong, but it lacks the punch of songs such as rising the fighting spirit, the jiraiya theme or even the orochimaru theme, the soundtrack here does not stand out, but it does set the mood for the scene in turn. (<--- Scene, geez, im reviewing a game, never expected to say that)\n\nThe controls are basic. hit, kunai, cover, kawamiri no jutsu, chakra charge, jump/dash and support buttons, not much to do there in matter of combos, just mash the b button several times and you will do a 10-12 hit combo, the cancel mechanic allows you to hit more times, but again, mashing the b button. The controller works, but its very simple.\n\nGraphics. As i mentioned before, i cannot complain about the graphics, since the game looks awesome, however, the native resolution (1280 x 720) did not managed to stress my old radeon 3870, when i tried to get more juice from the graphics, i increased them to 1440 x 900 (MAX). My card couldnt handle tomb raider at that resolution, in this game nothing changed, nothing at all, is as if i never changed the resolution in the first place.\n\nThe controller. Although the controls work as intended, the problem is the support, i dont own a console nor a 360 controller, the game did not accepted my generic usb controller (first game that does that, never had an issue). So i had to play with my keyboard, which was very annoying to set up, allow me to explain.\n\nWhen you open the game, a menu appears, you can launch the game, customize your controls, change graphics/audio. The keyboard binding is blank by default, the first time i logged in, i couldnt do anything at all, no up/down, no back, no exit, no controller detected, i had to alt+f4.\n\nThen, i rebinded some keys (coudlnt tell what they do) and launch the game, after the first fight, i figured out some actions, i wanted to rebind to my liking now that i knew what was going on, but i couldnt do it with the rebinding options ingame, since some of the keys i was planning to use were not binded first in the pre launch menu, i had to close game to rebind (again)\n\nThen, after i was playing for a while, the first sequence appeared, i binded a,s,z,x,space,ctrl,q,w,e,r, the 4 arrows, i know what each key do, i can manage without a problem, but the quick action was requesting to press the x -yy-b-a. i do not own a 360 controller, i dont know what is the action of those buttons, why they cant add a quick action with your current binding? why does it have to be a 360 controller layout despite you are playing with a keyboard? It is not hard to change, i have seen this type of notification changes in some games for windows, why this one cant?  Seriously, the controller issue is so annoying and extremely confusing if you are not used to an xboc controller. But to be fair, once you are able to set up the thing, the controller works as intended, nothing extraordinary, it just works fine, very responsive.\n\nthe versus side is self explanatory, 1v1, either pvp, pvc, or any combination, single match or team match (team match is a single match, but you have some support ala mvsc after a timer fills up). It has a ton of characters, and i mean A LOT, you cant complain about diversity, however, the gameplay for each character is very similar (at least the ones i have tried), but again, there isnt much to do when the controllers are so simplistic, the gameplay is fun though, and i believe that most will get this game just for this mode, where you can actually play.\n\nso, summing all up. Campaign has little to no gameplay, its the anime with better graphics,, Visually awesome, very bad controller configuration, soundtrack allright, fun vs mode.\n\nI recommend it, however, be careful, you are paying 40 bucks to watch the anime in super hd and play for some minutes (which IMO is worth it), if you are looking for a game packed with action/fighting/adventure this is not your game.","February 19, 2014","true","15.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even if you don't like naruto or anime isn't your thing in general then you shouldn't be disheartened because you'll still definitely enjoy the game. The fighting style is very good and unique and you can do some pretty sick moves. The story line is very detailed and not hard at all to understand (Although you should probably read or find out what's happened in the anime before the game's storyline.

Secondly it's highly recommended to use a gamepad, or you can still use the 'ol keyboard but a mouse isn't compatible with the game (which really fudgin sucks!)\nFinally, they have bought out some new characters that weren't in the other games but they should keep some of the old ones too.","June 6, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's very fun if you are into the series or the fighting mechanic, which is quite unique (I hate typical fighting-genre games, but I love this combat system.)\n\nIt was great for catching up on the series without actually watching them as ain't nobody got time for dat, though I'd recommend a controller as the keyboard and mouse controls might be jarring; you also have to make your own keybinds since they have no default!\n\nThe game adds a new feature for fans of the older ones where you are fighting a group of enemies instead of just one (thought I've only seen this once) and a "branching" type system which determines what happens and how difficult it is, but doesn't seem to change much.\n\nOverall, if you don't have a controller, I'd stay away; if you like Naruto or the combat, then you should buy it if you can, but you might be able to find as good a deal as I did if you wait.","February 27, 2014","true","9.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealbl1nk/recommended/234670/","therealbl1nk","bl1nk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealbl1nk/","363 products in account","Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is perhaps the most extreme example yet of Namco Bandai's attempt to appeal to the converted and only to the converted. Here's a game not simply for any old Naruto fan, but for Naruto fans who are completely up to date with the story and characters as they currently exist in the anime/manga episodes and are seeking a new way of experiencing previously explored plotlines. If you're not up to date, then not only are you going to struggle enormously with the story as depicted in the game's early stages, but you're going to ruin what you've not yet seen of the TV series. Unfortunately, due to gameplay that is as unwieldy and bloated as its title, Full Burst is not an acceptable way to get yourself up to date with this franchise.\nhis may be a beat-'em-up, but the primary Ultimate Adventure mode features so little gameplay in comparison to cutscenes and dialogue-heavy exposition that you'd be forgiven for thinking you're sitting through a barely interactive (albeit combat-heavy) soap opera. It feels as though developer CyberConnect2's plan was to create a condensed edition of the anime in which fight scenes are playable, rather than create a game in its own right. This leads to an experience that features such haphazard and irregular pacing that your principal cause for intrigue rests in trying to work out just how long it's going to be before the game asks you to pick up the controller again--and even when you do, the core combat is a shallow, button mashing affair that requires little in the way of skill. While there's definite and worthwhile value in repackaging the events of a beloved series in a new format, there's also value in a game giving you something to do.\n\nThere may be a lack of interaction in story mode, but that doesn't hold true for the package as a whole. Including all of the downloadable content released for the original Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja 3 release, the volume of content on offer is gargantuan. Chief among the additions is the extra Ultimate Adventure chapter, which sees Sasuke and Itachi Uchiha take on the nefarious Sage Kabuto, a segment that is so phenomenally difficult in comparison to the rest of the game that all previously learned tactics become essentially redundant. The same Sage Kabuto is unlockable as a playable character if you have the patience to jump through the numerous hoops to unlock him, and there are also some new costumes to swoon over.\nhe biggest, but certainly not most interesting, piece of extra content comes in the form of supplementary challenge missions. One hundred of these have you beating an opponent in a fight while handicapped in some way--removing your ability to jump, for example, or setting a limit on the number of attacks at your disposal. While these missions do add some welcome variety to the combat, they primarily serve to highlight just how shallow the core mechanics are. Without these externally shoehorned twists on battle, fighting suffers from an overwhelming shallowness that sees you engage autopilot once the basics become second nature. Only during set-piece boss battles are you asked to do something out of the ordinary.\n\nTo compound matters, the most members of the enormous character roster plays in the same way. You swap between characters regularly during Ultimate Adventure, but this is done predominantly to facilitate the narrative rather than to spice up gameplay through variety and diversity. Granted, significant and impressive visual flair is achieved by switching often between characters with attacks that are literally out of this world, but that aesthetic quality doesn't remain interesting long enough for the combat inadequacies to be forgiven. Clearly, this is not a game with the remotest desire to cement its place in the bastion of hardcore fighting game legacy, but that doesn't excuse the fact that there's so little meat to the gameplay that you're essentially feasting on elaborately painted bones.\n\nSimilar problems exist with Ultimate Adventure's role-playing-game-lite elements, which allow you to roam around a number of different environments with a view to collecting and buying items to use in combat (health potions, strength buffs, and so on) and optionally talking to loitering non-player characters. At times, these moments provide a welcome break from the cutscene/fight/cutscene pattern, but more often than not, they feel designed to artificially lengthen the game and trick you into thinking you're playing something with genuine genre-blending aspirations.\nThe closest comparison to this format is Asura's Wrath, another of CyberConnect2's offerings. However, where Asura's Wrath succeeds in this style of storytelling thanks to its short length and ferocious pace, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 suffers from attempting to cover far too much ground for the core mechanics to handle. If you do classify yourself as a Naruto aficionado, then simply having another medium through which to consume the narrative is potentially going to be enough to satisfy you. Without a doubt, everyone else should look elsewhere.","March 19","true","144.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even if you have been watching or reading though it also gives you the option of picking the "Legend" route on certain fights to experience things differently; a great alternative to experiencing the same thing you've seen before but still progressing. The cut scenes are fantastically done and the option for the Japanese vocal track is always nice as I for one will punch someone if I hear Naruto say "Believe it!" one more time. Of course you are still forced to play as certain characters for certain parts that aren't always fun. Some of the boss battles can also be down right cheap, the final one for instance but hey, you only have to do it once and that's a small price to pay for how much fun is packed in there.\n\n-- General --\n\nNow for me considering I haven't played an Ultimate Ninja game before this was a welcome change from the Clash of Ninja fighting games, the cinematic, epic feel of every battle and the sheer complexity of the mechanics was something I wasn't expecting from an Anime fighter. If your looking for a little one on one kick-assery this is a fantastic place to land your feet. It is a little sad that you can't play even a tag mode or something similar, the complete lack of co-operative fighting does seem like an oversight considering how entertaining it could be and considering it's something Clash of Ninja has had since the get-go.\n\nOne more key thing to point out as well is the sheer amount of content here, holy crap the content. There is the massive Story Mode, the bonus Challenge Mode with 100 battles to complete, Survival Mode, Tournament Mode, the regular VS Mode and of course Online Mode. That's a a lot of things to clear. There is also an almost obsurd amount of collectables to unlock and purchase from Titles for your online Ninja Card to Ultimate Jutsu Demonstrations. The game contains 89 (correct me if I'm wrong) playable characters with only a few available as support only, as well as several characters having different costumes. Not counting same movelist, different costumes that seven versions of Sasuke to play as, rejoice Uchiha fans. It will take a while to unlock every character mind you but that can be done by either playing and earning money or clearing the entirety of the massive story mode. So if you don't like running through the sometimes tedious boss battles and the like, just hop into VS mode and beat the crap out of your friends. Which brings us to the biggest problem - I didn't say the game was perfect.\n\n-- Multiplayer --\n\nThe game does a decent job of balancing the massive roster but at the end of the day, some characters are just down right overpowered and cheap. Which can be a problem unless you happen to have mastered the game and the other person hasn't. Roughly 60% of the matches you play online will either be against the ultimate form of Naruto, Minato or Itachi and there's a reason for that. Not that the cheap characters are unbeatable but unless you're also a high tier character prepare to have an annoyingly difficult fight; oh Itachi your crows will haunt my nightmares. Of course this being said it's not the end of the world by any means. If your fighting your friends or just playing for fun it probably won't bother you and overpowered characters is something you should be expecting going into a fighter with such a massive roster that isn't aiming to be a serious competition game. Virtua Fighter this is not.\n\n****-- Multiplayer Section 2 --**** Scroll to the comments section to for transmission error fix.\n\nAnother key thing I have to draw attention to is something that has been completely "broken" about this game since launch: Transmission Error's. For those of you who don't know what this is, it's a disconnection error that occurs in most matches played online, example: I have played roughly 350 matches online, completing only 120 of them. While Namco-Bandai has assured us they are working on it, it has been present since launch and still isn't fixed. They have released a NA only patch for the game that, to it's credit did work somewhat, but instead of getting disconnected in some games we are presented with a slow down kind of lag and even then, sometimes are disconnected anyways. Assuming they do, at some point fix the issue the game will be downright fantastic but until then, the loyal fan base is left raging every match until you fight someone 30 times because it doesn't disconnect you for once.\n\n-- Final Thoughts --\n\nAll in all it's not a perfect game and until they sort out the transmission errors in the online portion, it will be broken for those seeking to use it. However, it still retains a fighting experience that you simply can't get somewhere else. Trying to end an epic battle with an Ultimate Jutsu is so much fun and that terrible moment when you chakra dash right into someone elses costing you the match, leaving you yelling out curses; barely coming out of a match on top thanks to a well timed awakening and realizing you lost by 1/8th a heath bar to Rock Lee and you didn't land a hit on him. Moments like these make you forget about the shortcomings of the game.\n\nIf your looking for a solid fighter pick it up and prepare to lose the next few weeks of your life, and bring some friends. If your looking for a competitive fighting experience, best to wait till the fix the online before investing. But either way, buy it at some point, it's worth the money.","January 2, 2014","true","181.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

There are lots of characters to play with and they all have a unique style so the gamplay is endless.\n\nCampaign:\nIt follows the actual anime and it has enough side missions to spend time on after the main story has ended. These extra stories also unluck new pictures, substitution items, etc... even a survival mode where you can train your skills with your favourite characters.\n\nOnline:\nThough there are a lot of idiotic persons out there, who find it funny to just camp and counter/ spam and be irritating, there are also players who want to have a great battle with you. These guys will maybe give you a hard time but with them you will be able to really learn the basics.\nAlso the internet connection/ lag can occur quit often, though you will quickly find someone that doesnt lag and hey just add them to your friends list. I have got quite a couple active non-lagging players who I can play regularly with.\n\nOverall an amazing game, just find the right good-minded jplayers who are willing to help you and play fair and this game will keep you buzy for a long time.\n","March 11, 2015","true","277.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

All that fighting and action is totally awesome BUT if you dont know a thing about naruto i.e. if you dont follow anime or manga the cutscenes and the story will be tediously boring. You will fell that the charcter keep blabbering on and on as if you were listening to your history teacher in the class whos talking in slow motion . Mind you the combined time required to see all the cutscenes is more than 7 hours (that might be more than the gameplay time if skip the cutscenes) ! Whereas most games have a total of 2-3 hrs (even the game of the name is soo long) . You will be vexed out out of pure boredom if you watch the cutscenes without any knowledge about anime or manga of naruto. So if you have no interest in naruto i suggest you skip all the cutscenes and enjoy the thrill of this breathtaking fighting game . However if you wish to see the cinemtic the i suggest you first follow up on narutos anime and manga on the net. This formidable game feature a colossal number of perplexing characteres and fighting moves.... i didnt even know what a jutsu is before i played this game.

The controller is alright if you either have a ps3 or Xbox controller.I don't recommend playing with a keyboard because it will make the gameplay very hard.The main problem is multiplayer, The Transmittion error.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/qwerty-space/recommended/234670/","qwerty-space","Qwerty-Space","http://steamcommunity.com/id/qwerty-space/","229 products in account","This review will mainly focus on the campaign.\n\ntl;dr: Really fun fighting parts, boring walking parts, long cuntscenes that will give you the feels.  Capped at 30FPS, and a bad port in general.  However I still recommend this game.\n\nNaruto Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst's "game play" consists of 4 main parts.  First off, you have the fighting.  The fighting is really quite fun, it's action packed, and requires you to quickly learn the combos and be able to pull them off quickly.  There are also quick-time events within some of these fights, but it's not that common.\n\nSecondly, we have the walking... This part is kind of boring, you just walk to where you're supposed to be going, and you can pick up small loot from some plants and stuff on the way.  You can also talk to some people and buy from the shop.  Yuu can't use your ninja dash here, and all you can really do is jump, so I don't like this bit.\n\nThirdly, you have the cutscenes.  There are two kinds of cutscenes, you have the ones where you press "A" after each speech bubble, I don't think this part was part of the anime, it's just filler to add more to the game (don't quote me on that though).\nThen you have the proper important storyline cutscenes, where you just sit back and watch.  This part is exactly like the anime, but remade with the game engine (so it's not as pretty), and it lasts a long time, longer than the other type of cutscene (so grab some popcorn!).  I really like this part, as living the through the anime so long after this part was aired is quite nice.\n\nThe game is good in the story progression, because you aren't always limited to fighting with the same character all the time, so it keeps it interesting.\n\nThe arena gamemode where you pick a two characters to fight is really fun, each character has multiple outfits, which come with different movesets and combos, making it really fun.  For some reason the girls all come with bikini outfits o_O *nosebleed* ...  Jiraiya will be pleased!  You unlock these characters and their respective outfits as you go along, but I believe that quite a few characters are already there as I can't remember unlocking so many!\n\nOverall, this is a really, really bad port.  It's capped at 30FPS, has loading times for EVERYTHING, due to this being on PC,  they could have loaded a bit more of the world for God sake, not just this tiny little area!  There are plenty of invisible walls, it has weird saving mechanics, and the graphics on character is shockingly bad, tbh, I would have preferred it to have similar fighting mechanics, but on a more pixel art-based 2D world, and then focused more art talent into the cutscenes.\n\nI really do recommend this game if you like the anime, because I love it, and I love the fighting in this game (despite being 30FPS locked.  Play with a controller if you can, and prepare to not actually play much.  This game is more of an anime, where watching and playing are not quite half and half, but I don't mind, as the fighting is incredibly fun in my opinion.\n\nBuy this game (or revolution) if you miss the anime!  And feel free to ask me any questions about the game at any time, I am glad to be of assistance if you are stuck, or are unsure of what something in the game is.","September 3, 2015","true","17.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/firstnamegreatest/recommended/234670/","firstnamegreatest","Linty üëÄ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/firstnamegreatest/","270 products in account","Overall this game is extremely good from a standpoint of how fun it is, when it works. With ongoing issues coming up with the server, in put lag, the still not yet defeated transmission errors,  and in my opinion a faulty connection system. This game is one of my favorites even along side all these issues, and within the month I've had it, my play time has surpassed everything  except Dota 2. Passing Borderlands 2, Terraria, and Skyrim. This game is extremely fun, and fluid fighting game who defines itself in it's own personal touch. Regardless of having a single 'attacking' ability this game still manages to maintain a decently high skill cap whereas you won't see a player who is obviously more inexperienced than you taking games off of you for silly things, while it is usually the case that doesn't disregard the fact that it is easily possible.\n\nAlong with the the fun gameplay comes obnoxious mechanics that have extremely low skill cap and can remove  a lot of the fun from the match, with awakenings like susanoo and fuu to obnoxious characters with Instant awakening resets like Asuma or Neji. In the end, i'll recieve more anguish from losing an obviously won match to a silly awakening or such than dominating a strong playe.\n\nWhile this game has it's issues with server and silly low skill cap easily accessible mechanics, I still recommend this game due to, while being short, maintaining an extremely fun story line and when working fun  multiplayer combat. I feel if CC2 provides proper patching this game could be more than just 'good'. ^^","November 25, 2013","true","443.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/234670/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is a great fighter, once it finally clicks. When you start the story nothing is explained and you start with a pretty hectic battle, which can rather easily be won with just some button mashing. After that comes a frustratingly long battle if you have no idea what you're doing. It took me over 40 minutes to finally beat this enemy, and by that time I understood the controls slightly better. When I was halfway into the game I was still figuring things out. It would've been nice if there was some sort of tutorial; the loading screens show moves and tips but half of the time they disappear way too quickly to properly read them.\n\nAs I said, it's a great fighter with amazing visuals and cinematics (although they're a bit too long) and a bit of (linear) freedom where you can accept sidequests, find 'secrets', eat food to heal your crew and buy items that you can use during your battles.\n\nBattles are usually relatively easy and if they're not the checkpoints seem rather limited. It took me several tries to finish the last battle, with is actually pretty long (10-20 minutes). All because it didn't have enough checkpoints. The easier battles had more checkpoints, but weren't usually needed. I thought that was a bit weird... Could be me, though.\n\nThe camera can also get in the way at times, but thankfully you can swing it the other way with the press of a button. Simple enough, but still noteworthy.\n\nUnfortunately, I had to skip most of the cinematics (they're uncountable, there are so many). Why ? I've never seen a single episode of this show, I have only heard of it. It's not a very newbie friendly game if you're new to the show or the game. I normally watch all cinematics but I didn't understand any of it. There are so many characters and the storyline seems to be all over the place, especially at the beginning of the game. I do know that you'll be skipping at least three cinematics every 5 minutes. They just keep coming, it's unbelievable. I don't mean this in a negative way; other fighters should take note ;) I just wish I had seen some of the episodes to know what it's all about.\nBehind all of the cinematics there's still enough gameplay to keep you occupied for at least a good 10 hours. Don't skip any of the movies and you can add several hours to that number. Even after finishing the game you can still finish your active sidequests, or accept new ones/ones that you hadn't found yet.\n\nThe visuals are amazing. I guess the game looks (and sounds) practically the same as the TV show. Most of the times I couldn't figure out if I was watching gameplay or a cinematic. It all works very fluently, and looks amazing. Some of the QTE battles are just gorgeous ! It's just a shame that all of this is capped to 30FPS, which is absolutely noticeable when you're not fighting, but running around in the environments.\n\nIn the end Naruto really impressed me. A lot. It just took about one hour to figure it out. It's a fun and solid game with amazing graphics, and if you love fighters, or Naruto, this game is a must. More please.\n\n[Rating: 79/100]","January 8, 2014","true","10.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Here's a game not simply for any old Naruto fan, but for Naruto fans who are completely up to date with the story and characters as they currently exist in the anime/manga episodes and are seeking a new way of experiencing previously explored plotlines. If you're not up to date, then not only are you going to struggle enormously with the story as depicted in the game's early stages, but you're going to ruin what you've not yet seen of the TV series. Unfortunately, due to gameplay that is as unwieldy and bloated as its title, Full Burst is not an acceptable way to get yourself up to date with this franchise.","April 7, 2014","true","1.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

However, the open world sections are terrible compared to those present on ninja storm 1. They only serve to slow the pace and ruin the mood you had from the epicness that likely occurred moments before. The game is easy to learn but it is definitely difficult to learn the small techniques and habits required to block and perform advanced maneuvers with good reaction time. Overall, the game is simple and fun. You don't need to follow the anime to play this game and the cutscenes go through pretty much all of the episodes in this arc while leaving out the filler.

If you're using keyboard, I would suggest looking for a comfortable configuration, one such as this: http://gyazo.com/4a1035b5d49dfd9f9dfe5859e29e61a4\n\nNinjas are cool. 10/10","December 22, 2014","true","17.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

This game simply put is amazing, any fighting game should consider playing through this at least once and also checking out the multiplayer.\n\nThe story is both engaging and beautifully animated, as I streamed this live on twitch my viewers even commented on how great the game looked. There's plenty of characters to keep you occupied in the other modes too.\n\nThe sounds are really crisp, the voice acting is really well done, and if you want that authentic feel you can switch to Japanese voices.\n\nThe actual fighting side of the game is extremely fair, and pretty well balanced, it took me a few hours to get to grips with all the Jutsu and counter systems, but once there you start to pull off nice combos and also figure out some strategies to taking out the enemies in front of you.\n\nI grabbed this in the steam sale for ¬£6 but if id of paid ¬£25 for this I still would of been very happy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IrisSapphire/recommended/234670/","IrisSapphire","Sassy Tanassy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IrisSapphire/","222 products in account","UNS3 is a strong fighter in it's own right, but also a good pick for people like me who more often than not, just don't enjoy fighters. This game has a very Beat-em' up feel to it.. it's also very simple by nature, with simple controls, combos and easy to perform moves. With that said, it has enough depth in the way that you can use those simple moves and turn it into a truly exciting game, full of satisfaction and devious trickery.\n\nThis game shines most in it's multiplayer. The best way to experience this game would be locally, with a mate or seven. Failing that, you can of course take to the online mode. The netcode looks like it needs work but disconnects are a thing of the past- the real beast to worry about is latency. Fighting any friend further than my own state (Western Australia) resulted in anywhere between a few milliseconds to half a second of latency, with those in my state being as responsive as a local match. Unfortunately, and this is likely due to poor Australian internet but it's still worth noting, playing any friend overseas was unplayably laggy, resulting in only frustration for both players. It kind of draws from the game, but it's more of an issue for us here.\nWhen you do get connected, it is undoubtedly the most fun part of the game.\n\nThat is of course not to say the single player doesn't excel too, oh it does. One of the best stories in a fighting game in thanks to the rich and interesting world provided by the Naruto franchise. The story itself takes place in the same arc the currently-airing anime does at time of release, the Fourth Great Ninja War. The story is solid, it has many moments that will blow your mind and a lot of them are fully playable. Each fight is as memorable as the last, nothing feels too forced or unnecessary and the pace is set nicely too, with the exception of an almost hour-long scene that just sucks the life out of the middle of the game for a while. If I were to pick some nits I'd say that the characters are a bit too stiff and they don't move during dialogue unless it's a big scripted cutscene, but when things get good, they get fantastic. Even flashbacks are implemented into story fights as you play, giving you some GREAT perspective. Some of the story is very simpified, and it focuses more on the Main characters than the Anime does, leaving out some very interesting and emotionally impacful backstory.. but it does the job. It teaches you how to play, offers hours of entertainment and will make you excited for the franchise all over again. Sadly, the ending is a little different to what happens in canon Naruto, likely to avoid spoiler territory for the anime, and thus is a little unsatisfying. It'd be nice to have gotten that little surprise at the end- for that, I highly urge you to watch the anime, the person behind that mask.. ooh! Amazing.\n\nFor a Console port, it has it's issues. There's a lack of tweakable options.. you're given a choice of resolution and Anti-Aliasing and that's about it. With that said.... the game runs very smoothly, even at it's locked 30 Frames Per Second, and the Anti-Aliasing does it's job well, there's a very noticable difference and the quality is greatly improved over it's console counterparts, especially in just how smooth and clear the lines are, it helps solidify the feeling this is an Anime. It doesn't really "Feel" like a port, if that makes sense- while you're playing it, it looks great, sounds great and controls great while running smoother than butter on any decent machine.\n\nWith all that said, I'd definitely recommend you give it a shot. It's got plenty of hours in store for you and is certainly a blast with friends. It's the definitive version of the game and I'm very happy it came to PC.\n\nI'll give you guys a hint for when you start playing.. don't rely on your subs too much. It's easy to think spamming them will win you a fight but if you learn to play while conserving them and recharging often, you will dominate your friends.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lmotaku/recommended/234670/","lmotaku","Yuhirou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lmotaku/","458 products in account","I'm going to start with what I feel would be the negative parts of the game, and then end with what I liked.\n\nIt's ironic when a Naruto game has filler, but a forgiveable amount, the actual anime is so full of unneeded garbage it's ridiculous. Please show the emotional and plot bulding flash backs, and get to fighting. Them standing around talking every 2-5 minutes is too much.\n\nNot to mention the actual traveling and "find" system was completely useless. I chose Legendary(hardest difficulty) and never used a shop, or used any ryo after getting the one achievement. There was no need for it. You'd have to be a kid, or really bad at fighting games to have to use items all the time. Not to mention it isn't even a battle requirement, ever. You could get by just from spamming ninjutsu and substitute.\n\nToo many cut scenes, it felt like work to get through the cutscenes to the content. It was like 5-10 minute cutsene, 1 minute battle,  another cutscene.\n\nSad part is I need to replay it to unlock all the achieves. Not going to. The things they want are damn near impossible. Why I say that isn't even a matter of skill, or being bad at the game. The fighting mechanics themselves and some of the battles you just can't do what they ask. ie: 6 vs 2 battle, legendary, can't block forever, you will eventually get caught by some random spam of ninjutsu that you can't block, and it's a fight for health all the way through. Unless there is an item that magically makes you have 2 more HP bars or something. If the mechanics don't get you, the camera will. Many times the camera just pans inside my character or is at an angle I can't see anything and a bunch of them with guard break/get me caught up in a bunch of crap.\n\nI did like however when they worked plot into the actual fight. I hated standing around listening about what they're going to do. Unlocking more emotional parts, etc. It was really fun to play the action sequences.\n\nThey mixed free roam into it, it looked nice, almost like you were running around in a real anime, but really fell short to previous games made in terms of map size, exploration, and items.\n\nThere is many hours of content here, took me quite awhile to beat it completely. I would say maybe 10-13hrs of gameplay on your first play through. At a certain point I wished the game would finally end, the bits of filler in it from the show of them talking for ridiculously long times about the same thing between different characters probably made it longer than it should be, same as the show.\n\nAs far as Naruto games go, I would probably give it 5/10.\n-Tried something different and were very creative in terms of UI and story presentation.\n- Very good artwork/textures, it was very fluid and felt like I was playing the show.\n- Easy to understand system, becomes pretty fluid by the time you end the game.\n- Captured the emotions of the anime really well.\n- Quirky\n- Had a bit too much talking and I felt bored pretty quickly at certain areas of the game.\n- Sounds/music didn't seem all that great, some audio glitches here and there.\n(Most of the time I didn't even notice their was music at all. If it had some original OST theme music in there, I must of missed it.)\n- While the free roam was a nice thing to have, I don't feel it was necessary, and I think it was thrown in "just because."\n\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes. Do Ithink it's worth what I paid for it? About 80-90%, it should of been about $5-$10 less.","March 20, 2014","true","18.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Everything is smooth. The Combat system is easy to learn and understand. The graphics during cut scenes and during battle are awesome. The Controller also works perfectly especially when in Direct Input. I also tried it playing with my keyboard which came out to be not to far from the game experience while playing with a controller. The Roster is pretty big too.\n\nWhat lack here is the ability to customize the matches. The life bar is so short, it makes player's battle experience hang on tenterhooks, especially on versus mode with your friends. The moves are also pretty repetitive. They also removed the ability to customize the ninjutsu used by the player.\n\nBut overall.

Remember to use substitution when being combo by AI or you just give him/her chance to win. Easy to execute Ultimate Jutsu and Jutsu. The characters are  balance  except Madara.\n\nI don't play online, but people say that it's good. Overall, a really good game if you love fighting games.

It's not the best Naruto game out there, but it's a huge improvement of the previous one (if you played it) it also have the semi-long cutscenes that gets down to the needy greedy of the storyline. Some people will get annoyed with that, but at least you can skip 'em if you already know what's going on and/or don't wanna watch 'em so that shouldn't be a huge problem.

I have enjoyed the series quite a bit, as it is one of my favorite 3d fighting game series to date. Now, for this one in particular, the game is very good. Unfortunately the port is not. My biggest gripes are no video options beyond anti-aliasing, screen size, v-sync, or windowed mode, the game is locked at 30 fps with no option in configs to up it to 60, and the online is extremely laggy if you can even find an opponent, which you won't. Also, while you can play with the keyboard, it is not recommended as the port was designed with controllers in mind. On the upside, the story is good. Now, I haven't kept up in the series for awhile so I had no clue what was going on, I was enjoying the ride it took me on. Characters are unlocked for multiplayer as you proceed, and there are plenty to unlock along the way. The actual gameplay is solid. You have a very simple combat style, which one button for melee, a button for ranged, block, dodge (if you have the chakra), awakenings (second forms/power ups) for most of the character, and every character has a ninjutsu and ultimate jutsu to choose from. The characters play very differently. I have found my favorites already, but it's fun to go and play all of the characters as I unlock them to see what they do. Although, if you get sick of playing against bots, you will need some actual friends. Overall, the game is great but it could have been a much better port. 7/10","February 10, 2014","true","11.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(I generally couldnt care less since I don't like playing with strange internet creeps anyway, but there you have it)\n\nThey only offer SuperSampling AA, which is a waste of gpu power when simple MS, CS, FX, SM or what ever AA you want is a better option.\n\n9/10, Fun, Good looking, true to the anime (until the end, they made up an ending instead of saying 'to be continued')\n\n^\nWtf where did my paragraphs go?","March 3, 2014","true","51.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I'll start by saying that that I have not played that game, my point of comparison is the 2nd game.\n\nCombat consists on either 1 on 1 or team on team (1 character and 2 assists) fighting on a 3D plane. The offensive game consists of performing simple attack combos based on a single button and tilt, a guard breaking throw move, throwing and useing various items, and activating special finishing moves by charging up. On the defensive end the options are movement, blocking, and specific to the series Substitution Jutsu which avoid an attack and place the player behind his oppenent. The Substitution has four uses that recharge over time. In low level play this perhaps dumbs down the combat to the player who attacks first on equal substitutions coming out out with a combo but I'll leave that discussion to hardcore players.\n\nPerformance wise the game leaves much to be desired. While it is colorful and good-looking for the most part, the lack of graphical options is disappointing. The game is locked at 30 fps, which seems a poor descision for a 3D fighter. These point to little care being put into the PC port.\n\nComing from Ninja Storm 2 the story mode is huge improvement. Fans of the series will welcome how long and detailed it goes, though sometimes the cutscenes are long.  Having read the series since being as young teenager I've really lost interest in the series, reading weekly as a habit rather than a desire. That being said the game was able to bring emotions to some scenes that the manga failed to do for me. To me that is something very special and a spectacular success. Some story battles have extra moments activated by performing certain actions and performing QTEs. In the context of the story mode this was actually pretty interesting.\n\nPlaying a bit online did not show a comunity as active as I thought it would be. As with any fighting game, coming in a few months later left me completely out of the meta, getting my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• handed to me by everyone playing as the 4th Hokage. The lag in game is TERRIBLE. But honestly anime based games are not serious fighters, and it is a hell of a lot of fun to play with friends.\n\nIf you like the series and have people to play with, get the game. Everyone else might benefit from a demo to see if its for them.","May 1, 2014","true","28.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

If you have a controller yourself however, then I'd recommend you'd use that.

What I got was much more than that, providing a game that appeals whether you have an interest in the anime/manga or not. NS:UNS3FB contains the awesome drop in and play experience I wanted, providing a large pool of characters which all have their unique traits but the control setup makes them easy to adjust to. It also backs this up with substantial single player modes, ensuring that I put in quite a number of hours exploring everything the game had to offer.\n\nThe battle system forgos the usual 1 on 1 fighting style for a behind character more open battle system. Control inputs are quite simple but still offer quite a wide variety of options when fighting, most of which tie into the chakra meter which you have to recharge during battle. Choosing when to unleash that ultimate jutsu or skilfully using a substitute to escape a powerful attack is great fun. Unfortunately the camera has some odd quirks, especially if you get designated as player 2.\n\nYou can read a full review of this game here.[www.neoseeker.com]","October 11, 2015","true","25.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you're not a Naruto fan, but you're looking for a good Beat 'Em Up! game then maybe give this game a try. Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 has no default controls for the keyboard, you'll have to manually set every corresponding key to the controller controls, HOWEVER you can search up various setups other players have put up which can make it alot more fluid to play. If you have a controller yourself however, then I'd recommend you'd use that. The story is based off the Naruto anime so if you don't watch Naruto, you may find the story a bit confusing as it skips some important details.","October 6, 2015","true","24.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What I got was much more than that, providing a game that appeals whether you have an interest in the anime/manga or not. NS:UNS3FB contains the awesome drop in and play experience I wanted, providing a large pool of characters which all have their unique traits but the control setup makes them easy to adjust to. It also backs this up with substantial single player modes, ensuring that I put in quite a number of hours exploring everything the game had to offer.\n\nThe battle system forgos the usual 1 on 1 fighting style for a behind character more open battle system. Control inputs are quite simple but still offer quite a wide variety of options when fighting, most of which tie into the chakra meter which you have to recharge during battle. Choosing when to unleash that ultimate jutsu or skilfully using a substitute to escape a powerful attack is great fun. Unfortunately the camera has some odd quirks, especially if you get designated as player 2.\n\nYou can read a full review of this game here.[www.neoseeker.com]","October 11, 2015","true","25.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I would recomend it, but I can not because of a couple of fatal bugs and annoyances. First, the entire game plays at around 75% full speed, which is annoying, but you can get used two. Second, there is like over 30 hours of cutscenes, over 50% of the loading times is to load another cutscene, and for people like me that like to 100% games, there's an achievement for not skipping any cutscenes in Campaign. I did not get this game to watch some anime. While I like it, its not great. Third, and this is by far the worst, there is a fatal bug in the final battle, which causes the entire game to crash. Nearing the end of the battle there is a quicktime event, it asks you to press "A", and then it crashes. Many people have told the developers about this problem, but they ignore it. After battling for half an hour, when you start it up again, you have to do the entire battle over again, only to have it crash again. There's also an achievement for beating the final boss..... So, yeah. You know how the best thing to do in a game (the most rewarding to a gamer) is to defeat the final boss? I never got that satisfaction. Thanks to YouTube, though, for letting me know how it ends. I now know that this is not the final battle, and now I can say a full thanks, Naruto, for wasting over 2 hours of my life (tried fighting it 4 times, crashed all times), on a battle made to look awesome, which ends in a crappy quicktime event, and ends up with (spoiler alert) the main bad guy getting away.","June 24, 2015","false","18.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

If the story wasn't about naruto, I'd never play this. You barely get to fight 3 minutes before you have to wait 20min worth of cutscenes to play again. Also, so many useless lines! Producers need to learn from Valve how to tell a story without interrupting the game all the time. Also, the game has pretty much nothing extra compared to the manga or the anime, so no bonus story. And  you have to play storymode if you want to unlock every other character, so you have no choice. You need to go through what's bad about this game before you get to enjoy it. And they probably don't give a damn about it, since it sells easily after the story is already successful. Only buy this if it's on sale, or else it's wasted money. It's a fun game on PvP, but the storymode is a complete desaster.","October 18, 2014","false","5.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

Here are some highlights and lowlights for each mode.\n\nStory Mode Highlights\n- Multiple battles with new characters\n- Boss battles with quicktime events continue to be visually stunning\n- Has a little bit of a "choose your adventure" vibe to the story\n\nStory Mode Lowlights\n- Story telling continues to be weak in distribution - subtitles are boring and most of the cinematics involve scrolling stillshots\n- Fights can get tedious - there's only so much variation you can do in this game\n- Final few boss modes are incredibly frustrating as poor camera angles ruin the fun\n\n---\n\nVersus Mode Highlights\n- The real star of the game, more playable characters than ever\n- Action continues to be fast-paced, great art direction\n- Adding cinematics on ultimate skill takedowns adds a bit of flair to fights\n- Challenge mode is pretty fun in a mindless sort of way\n\nVersus Mode Lowlights\n- Several characters are carry overs from the previous title, making their skills outdated in comparison to story mode progression\n- Some characters missing from story mode for no reason\n- Balancing issues, certain characters standard attacks can hit you even if you spam log\n\n--\n\nOnline Mode Highlights\n- It allows you to play with people online\n\nOnline Mode Lowlights\n- Net code is absolutely terrible. Ridiculous input delay makes the game nearly unplayable.\n- Very low online population. The people who do play are veterans with hundreds of hours - you will get wiped.\n- Items are not standardized and reflect larger balancing issues.\n\n--\n\nOverall, I can't recommend buying this game with the next one coming out next month. Unless you REALLY want to play some Naruto goodness right away, hold off for the next iteration which will have three times more characters and some real development on the versus mode side. But don't hold your breath for better online - this is clearly not a priority.\n","August 14, 2014","false","25.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Though if you are not very far into the shippuden series, the story mode in the game could potentially spoil it for you, and online can sometimes be difficult to play with friends and people in far regions, but other than that, the free battle mode is excellent, you can choose your own fights and play over 100 different challenge matches if you want to, even organise tournaments.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198101154965/recommended/234670/","76561198101154965","UnnaturalFacePalm","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198101154965/","83 products in account","So after playing this game and completing it I have made a few conclusions:\nIf you're a Naruto Shippuden fan and follow the series, there is no point to having this game, unless you follow the games also.\n\nif you are new to Naruto Shippuden this is a good series to start to get an idea of what has happened in the anime and manga series, (but if you are unfamiliar to the the original I would suggest looking that up before starting this series) although it doesn't have as much of the content that the anime and manga series contain.\n\nThe main purpose of this game is for you to know what is hapening in the series not for an original storyline or amazing gameplay, it's to tell you the story of Naruto Shippuden so expect a hell of a lot of cutscenes, enought that I admit drove me to the point where I stopped playing this for about a month from the bordome of sitting through all of them.\n\nSo onto what it does right and wrong, first I'll start with the pros:\n-It tells the story really well and does the franchise justice.\n\n-This is one of the very few games that actually make QTE matter as you get rated on how quickly you complete the QTE with stars leading up to a maximum, if you get enough stars you wil get a secret factor which is a couple of shots from the anime and has a little bit of dialogue which is the same in the games 1 and 2 also,\n\n-The music for the boss fights are amazing and the boss fights themselves are handled really well with the rating systems coming in to make it so much better.\n\n-The scenes that want to make to envoke an emotion are outstanding.\n\n-There are changes to the battle system occasionally, where instead of fighting one on one in a circle type arena, you play more like a hack n slash game where you run through different corridors and defeat a number of enemies, it's done alright but it can get annoying after a while.\n\nSo now onto the cons:\n-There are so many cutscenes, this game seems more like storybook than an actual game, they are also extremely long, wih most being around a good 2 or 3 minutes of just dialogue and nothing exciting happening in them, you'll find yourself skipping them towards the end just cause there was so many, like I did.\n\n-The main battle system is nothing special, it's ripped from the second game this time adding a few more characters that feel different which is good, but it's just kind of bland with each character having a melee combo and one or two jutsu moves depending on how long you hold the attack button. Also some characters have spammable moves that are really cheap whch can get extremely annoying especially if you find someone plaing them online.\n\n-The difficulty spike is awful, unlike ninja storm 2 where the opponents became more difficult over time, this one just has enemies towards the end spamming you with moves you can't dodge and just get overwhelmed with nothng to do about it, and throwing as many enemies as possible at you, either one at a time or all together, neither is fun.\n\n-There is no free roam and most side quests are taken out, once again unlike ninja storm 2 there is no free roaming, the game tells you where to go and you can't do anything to stop it. The side quests have devolved to fetching items for one or two people where you can only get back to them once you complete the game, where you do get to free roam when you complete the game it's not as good due to the sour taste left in your memory having to fight through the main story's corridors.\n\n-The lip synching is laughable, there is no attempt to match the character animation with the english version script. I know it's difficult but it looks like they made no effort with the characters lips still moving for a litle while even after their dialogue is finished (I would suggest to have it in japanese and put on english subtitles, the voice actors are much beter and it looks like the characters are actually talking).\n\nAll in all the game isn't bad, but it's nothing special, The story is great (apart from all of the cutscenes) but the combat is nothing out of this world, I would say that if you wanted a better naruto game go back to Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, it was much better done in basically every aspect.\nI'm not going to give this game a rating cause that is usually just the person that is reviewing its thought, so I will just say if you enjoy Naruto and want to start Naruto Shippuden but don't feel like going through 350+ of episodes, this game sums it up pretty well.\n\n\n\n","February 17, 2015","false","10.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

At first I saw instantly what people were talking about. The game does NOT come with a default keyboard config. I do not know how a game can be released in 2014 without a default config. That essentially means if you tried to instantly hop in a match, no controls will work. Let's also not forget the config diagram that's supposed to help you map out your controls is a diagram of a XBOX controller... yet the game is made for PC. If that's not a sign of a bad port, I don't know what is. HOWEVER, once you map out a decent config on keyboard, the game isn't that bad. The only other issue I have is the framerate being locked at 30 FPS I believe. The other issue being the fact that for some reason, I can't go into full screen mode on this game, while every other game does it fine.

I want to watch the story, but not in 50 minute incriments with no way to save your progress in the cutscenes. Honestly, this is the only horrendous thing about the game. Everything else works decently well, but my gosh, if the cutscenes were any longer I think I would just pass out from exhaustion.\n\nEDIT: Literally, sat there, playing the story mode for about 2 hours straight without a single save point.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/babyboyhp21/recommended/234670/","babyboyhp21","Anh Ho√†ng","http://steamcommunity.com/id/babyboyhp21/","386 products in account","Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 throws you into one of Naruto lore's most titanic battles right from the start. Without any preamble you find yourself clashing with the 20-story-tall Nine-Tailed Demon Fox as he ravages Naruto's home village. Except it isn't Naruto's home village, because he hasn't been born yet. Because this is, at last, the series' cataclysmic battle from the past that's been teased for years, but never fully shown before. It's a great first impression, and it sets the pace for the best Ultimate Ninja Storm to date.\n...And you're flung straight into it. First as Naruto's father, who must face off against the masked mastermind controlling the gigantic beast, and then as the Third Hokage in a breathtaking, intense battle that's fought leaping from rooftop to rooftop, circling around this monstrously large terror, coordinating with fellow ninja to hold the creature at bay. This series has pushed its visual spectacle to new heights with every installment, but it‚Äôs in moments like this that UNS3 proves to be the most epic and most fanservice-packed.\nWhen you‚Äôve finally managed to take down the Demon Fox, there‚Äôs no chance to catch your breath ‚Äì because you‚Äôre then flung right back to Naruto's dad, still in the middle of his own fight. UNS3 bounces around like this dynamically. You can be halfway through a major clash, then the focus will shift to another battlefield or point in time and have you fight a second, simultaneous fight before circling you back around to your starting point. It's a brilliant break from tradition that constantly keeps your attention focused and your energy up. It could've gone wrong and been distracting, but since each instance is interwoven with the storyline and serves a plot-advancing purpose, I never felt like I was bounced around for no reason.\nFor the most part, this is the same Ninja Storm combat as before ‚Äì just a bit faster. Ultimate Ninja Storm 3's feels as if the controls have gotten tighter and more responsive, which was appreciated as I ran, dodged, and teleported my way around each 3D battleground trying to gain a positional advantage over my opponent. Some mechanics introduced in earlier installments have been tweaked, too, like the fact that you can now enter your character's "Awakened" state without waiting until their health bar has been depleted to the edge of death.\nThings are a bit easier, too. UNS3's difficulty settings seem muted, as few fights will offer a true challenge to anyone who's bested any of the earlier games. The most elite players will have to seek out high-level opponents online, because the AI won't keep up with you.\nAt some points during the story, UNS3 offers some confusing decisions about which of two paths you want to follow. They're presented as a choice between the "Legend" path or the "Hero" path, but aren't both of those good things? I suppose being a "Legend" is more epic than just being a plain old "Hero," but it's odd phrasing ‚Äì and it's made even more perplexing because you earn either Legend Points or Hero Points for picking one over the other, and the distinction between those is never adequately explained.\nExperimenting with picking different story paths does open up unique cutscenes and fights not previously seen on the cartoon, though, so the confusion is worth enduring. In the opening clash against the Nine-Tailed Fox, for instance, you get to witness Choza Akimichi grow to Godzilla-like proportions and bodyslam the 20-story beast. So it's worth experimenting with, at least.\nOther than that, as with the earlier Ultimate Ninja Storm games, this one sticks pretty close to retelling the cartoon's plots point for point. Those decision moments are your opportunity to deviate a bit, which keeps things from being a total retread. You‚Äôre ultimately funneled back to the core timeline after having witnessed the extra, side content, so the decisions are never too earth-shattering ‚Äì you can‚Äôt end up picking a path where Naruto dies or anything like that.\nSome fans will no doubt take issue with the story's ending in this installment, as it's non-canonical and probably not a reflection of what will be seen in the show. Alternate story paths diverging from the events of older episodes are fun "what if?" scenarios worth taking a look at. But when UNS3 starts projecting out past the scope of currently aired TV episodes and currently published manga to invent its own vision of Naruto's future, the waters get a little choppy.\nOne area that disappointed was the limited exploration in story mode ‚Äì we're teased with free-roaming areas every once in awhile, but they never amount to much and you're quickly shuffling back into watching the next sequence of cutscenes. Also: do we really need all Fuu the Insect Girl as a playable character? We have over 80 now ‚Äì it's probably safe to stop scraping the bottom of that barrel.\n\nEven if the difficulty skews toward the easy side, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 speeds up combat with more responsive controls, and the visual spectacle of it all is more stunning than ever. Just as importantly, maintaining critical emotional connections to the story, even amidst all the chaos and explosions, overrides my concerns about non-canon story choices and lets us have fun with "what if" scenarios. Ultimate Ninja Storm's reputation as Naruto's most consistently enjoyable game series is safe.","October 19, 2014","true","96.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its easy to learn (although the in-game tutorials are not exactly helpful), and I can imagine it gets pretty deep the more time you invest.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the story is interesting and carries itself based on how much you like the franchise. Not to say there isn't anything here for new comers, but you'll definitely get your moneys worth if you know the story.\n\nHowever, the characters from a superficial samepoint all feel samey, and a lot of characters need to be unlocked in the story mode (which combines the one on one fighting with horde fighting), and that gives some incentive to playing the game in full. Theres a sort of morality system too: you choose between legend scenarios (ones that are generally shows of strength and power in the story) and hero scenarios (think mass effect paragon.) that give the story minor replayability, and allow you to level up these respective attributes. (For the most part, if you're looking for a challenge, you'll find yourself picking legend as unscrupulous as is despite your personal feelings on the matter.)\n\nWell, what else can I say? Good art direction, plenty of things for fans, online play, fun, pick-up-and-play action, you could do worse. I would wait for a sale, though, if you aren't in the fanbase already.","August 21, 2014","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a solid and fun fighting game that you can play locally with friends, or take the brawl online. It looks stunning thanks to the graphical revamp that came with Full Burst. Single Player mode also lets you catch up on the story and experience it hands on with massive battles that'll keep you at the edge of your seat(or couch in my case). Can't forget to mention how happy I am to see the series test the waters on the PC platform. This game is a must buy to all Naruto and anime fans alike, and those who love fighting games.","November 25, 2013","true","32.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The main fighting part of the game becomes repedetive quite quickly as the AI demands you pull no punches and rely on the same unblockable moves and counters in order to progress. The re-imagined scenes from the anime are spot on and the animations (on the most part) are smooth and responsive while actually playing the game.\n\nIt's not a perfect game by far but, for me at least, it was well worth it's sale price... I'm afraid I didnt have the time or inclination to try its online vs options so I can't comment on that.\n\n7/10","October 9, 2014","true","9.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The scenes are well made, good music, animation, synochronisation (I am talking about the japanese one), and so on. Most of them are even better done than in the anime. There are cutscenes that last over half an hour, one even an hour. That did not bother me at all, as there was nothing important cut from the story. I have spent over 30 hours just on the story mode, completing 100%. Also, there are nicely done encounters, conversations and so on.\n\nGraphics: No real improvement except in the cutscenes.\n\nGameplay: I am disappointed in this category. There were no real improvements over Generations, The amounts of melee combos has even been reduced to  3 instead of the known 4, even with characters that had 4 already. And it looks like the Free battle mode has simply been forgotten. You cannot adjust anything in the free combat exept time and difficulty, despite there already beeing so called "condition fights", but these are pre-set, meaning you cannot configure a fight with the fighters and conditions you choose. This is a extreme waste, because programming fights with chooseable conditions and fighters into the game should be pretty easy. It looks to me as if the programmers simply forgot.\nAlso, so called "Ultimate Jutsu Finishes" have been added into the game, which plays cutscene when a fight ends with a ultimate jutsu, but these are just one-liners and get boring pretty fast.\n\nPort: I have read reports about bugs, problems and so on, but I haven't encountered any problems. But playing this game on the keyboard is simply bad, I used a PS3 controller.\n\nAll in all, if you like the anime, the story mode will let you re-experience the cool scenes of the series and you will have fun with the game. The free Battle mode is disappointing, so don't expect much of it. But its a good game.","November 25, 2013","true","84.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a solid and fun fighting game that you can play locally with friends, or take the brawl online. It looks stunning thanks to the graphical revamp that came with Full Burst. Single Player mode also lets you catch up on the story and experience it hands on with massive battles that'll keep you at the edge of your seat(or couch in my case). Can't forget to mention how happy I am to see the series test the waters on the PC platform.

Whether the title is for some actual specification they might need in the documentation of Naruto story arcs, or just comedic genious, i'm not sure.\n\nThe GAME itself is less convoluted. Its a very smooth flowing back and forth fighting mechanic thats pretty damn addictive, but also with the potential to get quite stale quite quickly depending on how you like your beat 'em ups. Theres a kind of beauty to the simplicity thats just gotten better throughout the Ultimate Ninja Storm series.\n\nThe story is a highly emotional and powerful tool designed to pull on your heartstrings to concern you and have you caring about the ambitions and actions of each the characters featured. This can, for some, become a very cheesy and overly dramatic sequence of problems no one really gives a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about THAT much. I found myself facepalming and shaking my head at a lot of the "high octane emotional overloads" But those going through the story can expect a HUGE display of theatric and overwhelming chaos and action, which evens out the amount of sappy stuff and plays into the gameplay very nicely.\n\nWhen all is said and done, this is a great game!\n","November 26, 2013","true","17.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its very annoying and I hope it gets patched, they said it will and its well underway so cool.

This is probably why I am getting sick of the story mode right now since the cut-scenes can drag on for quite a while and I found myself skipping them a lot when I got the general jist of what the scene was about (sometimes even before that) and I would sometimes lose the context of a curtain fight.\n\nBut this IS a fighting game so the story isn't important what is important is the fighting system and I really like it. It's quite unique from other fighting games I've played and still manages to keep a kind of "easy to learn, hard to master" element.\n\nMost of the characters are pretty ballenced, except for the ones that have very fast acting far-ranged moves (like the exploding birds from what-his-face) that make fighting them with another character a real chore when it requires a lot more skill to beat someone who's just spamming the X button all day that is just as strong as special attacks, but doesn't use any energy for some reason.\n\nI wish the game had a few more options though, it's basically a boring story mode, or fight other people online. With the amount of resorces the delveopers put into the story mode I feel like they could have toned it down a little to allow room for other features.\n\nBut I digress, the fighting system was enough fun for me to sink more then 10 hours into the game, I just feel like the game could have used at least one other feature instead of another 3 hours of cut-scenes for the story mode.","October 28, 2014","true","13.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

During the combat there will be a quick option to press A if you're using the controller, no Idea what it is for keyboard, pressing A allows you to jump inbetween targets, getting rid of them faster.\n\nMultiplayer/AI Multiplayer: The main thing fighting games are made for is multiplayer, the soul key so players can go head to head, in Naruto, I must say some of the characters are a little unbalanced but that is expected because each and over one of them are differently skilled.\nSome of them can be slow attacking, most of them are usually ranged and occasionally you'll have the close up fighters like Might-Guy, Rock Lee, Killer Bee, and Ay (Raikage).\nDuring the multiplayer experience most of the players will more than likely spam jutsu, this is acceptable because most fighting games are like this.\nThere are loads of tactics, timing, and coordination with your partner (which I'll get to soon).\nThere is another mode which allows you to pick 2 or 1 teamate, specifically from the collection of characters.\nYour teamate has 3 roles he/she can be, Attack, Guard, and Balanced\nAlthough the character have many ways to describe each role, EXAMPLE: I choose gaara with guard because in the anime he uses his "Great Defense" sand as his defense, or hinata because she has the trigrams thingy which allows her to deflect enemies and projectiles\n(((AI MULTIPLAYER))):\nAI multiplayer is playing by yourself with bots, although not recommened because of how boring it can be by yourself, but practice makes perfect :)\nTraining against bots with unlimited health is ideal, there are tons of options in which you can choose to mix up your gameplay.\n\nThats all, so so far I rate this game a 8/10\nThanks~ Zambie","October 14, 2014","true","13.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

At first I saw instantly what people were talking about. The game does NOT come with a default keyboard config. I do not know how a game can be released in 2014 without a default config. That essentially means if you tried to instantly hop in a match, no controls will work. Let's also not forget the config diagram that's supposed to help you map out your controls is a diagram of a XBOX controller... yet the game is made for PC. If that's not a sign of a bad port, I don't know what is. HOWEVER, once you map out a decent config on keyboard, the game isn't that bad. The only other issue I have is the framerate being locked at 30 FPS I believe. The other issue being the fact that for some reason, I can't go into full screen mode on this game, while every other game does it fine.
