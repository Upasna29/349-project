And it delivers with stunning success.\n\nEverything about how this game is written is fantastic. There is rapier wit to spare in the clever dialogue, narrative and general premise, the characters are written exceptionally well, and the descriptive writing makes the absense of visuals a moot point; your imagination, from the visual cues indicated, is the most effective tool.\n\nThe story is quickly paced and never stagnates. Exposition is kept to a minimum and you make decisions frequently and often. Speaking of decisions, the choices you make in this game DO influence so much about the story and the characters and how everything ends. It feels like this could be your story, though the protagonist is probably a good deal more clever than you.\n\nIt's just an absolute riot, a delight to read, and you're guaranteed at minimum 2 hours on a single playthrough, and if you see those achievements you can tell there are MANY directions you can take the game. I'm gonna go for a replay soon enough!\n\nFor this pricepoint? It's an absolute steal.

This is far more sophisticated. This is a beautifully constructed game that takes a fun format and brings it to the next level. The story is completely engrossing, I couldn't turn the game off, it was that engaging. The writting is immersive and a pleasure to read, the choices are well constructed and satisfying (with just the right amount of humor thrown in), and the world is unique and intriguing. I was sad when the game was over, I wanted to explore the world more.\n\nI'd also like to note that I found no offensive content in this game during my play-through: nothing sexist, racist, homophobic--in fact it is very easy and satisfying to play as male or female, gay, straight or bi, and the race of your character is never mentioned or assumed. The cast is also racially diverse, which was a pleasant surprise. I never found the experience awkward or felt that it was only intended for a specific type of player. It's so uncommon to find a game that seems to be constructed for everyone to enjoy, but I think Choice of the Deathless has made it happen. I wholeheartedly recommend this game, and look forward to playing other titles by this developer.","November 3, 2014","true","6.9"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","0"

Like one of the old school choose your own adventure books. So many possibilities, so many ways it could have gone wrong or right. The replayability is amazing due to the amount of choices you make through the seven years you are with the firm before the final choices (yes, the final CHOICES) reveal themselves. Everything you do effects how the game ends. For me I had five choices, and I am sure there are a ton more possible, but honestly, I got the ending that I most wanted out of it all. By the end, I was happy. Everything went the way I wanted it. All because of the first choices I made in the game, then stuck with my guns, made some choices that I felt right, even if they contradicted my best interests.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlequillybunny/recommended/318310/","littlequillybunny","♫Quilly Shiba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlequillybunny/","4312 products in account","Choice of the Deathless\n\nChoice of the Deathless is a choose your own adventure type text-based adventure. As the store page mentions, you can choose your gender and sexuality without this affecting anything in the storyline, and thus you start your journey working at a “law firm” dealing with demons and other beings that exist in this world.\n\nQuickly you have to get used to your new work environment, and choose how you budget your expenses (Live downtown but pay high rent? Give yourself less pocket money?) These choices don’t affect the story at all as far as I can tell, maybe unless you either go broke or completely pay off your student loans, none of which I’ve done yet (I went for a neutral path moneywise).\n\nYou get to meet a variety of characters, some colleagues, some superiors, some clients, human, demon, and others. What you choose to say and how much time you choose to hang out with them affects your friendships and possible romance with them, which is pretty interesting - socializing matters! And if you’re an ♥♥♥ people remember… So I’d say this aspect is pretty interesting and where the game actually branches.\n\nScenario wise, I think you usually get the same most major scenarios to progress the story, and the choices you make in between aren’t able to cancel a future major event happening. It will just affect what options you can choose to do in the scenarios. For example if the major scenario in year 3 is happening and you have some allies by spending time/ helping them in the first few years they may help you out. Or if you became enemies they might mess you up.\n\nStorywise I found it quite entertaining, the writing style is alright, I’d say 7/10 in terms of smoothness and clearness. Would have liked some more details in how their world with humans and demons and other forms of life work, but how the author paints is it interesting and vivid enough on a small scale.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed the 1.5 hours it took to finish this story, and there are way more paths I could choose. As mentioned though major scenarios are mostly the same, what makes variety is your relationships with other characters. Just like a real life workplace! (Minus the necromancy of course) :p","September 12, 2014","true","1.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"

And here I am, having bought it again. Quite simply, Choice of the Deathless is one of the finest games from developer 'Choice of Games' and it's all thanks to the creative, imaginative world so beautifully crafted by Max Gladstone.\n\nNow, I understand that the prospect of a text only, choose your own adventure game on Steam sounds mad, especially considering the current age of gaming, where titles are often harshly, and mostly unfairly, judged by how they look and how impressive their visuals are. I also understand that this game simply isn't for everyone. But I think this game is worth a shot.\n\nSet in a universe where lawyers use magic known as craft to negotiate contracts, aid demonic clients and even fight for their life, the concept of Max Gladstone's world itself is very interesting, although you could claim it's nothing entirely new. With masterful worldbuilding, witty dialogue and exceptional imagery, the world of 'Choice of the Deathless' comes alive and lures you in. As your character is flung from choice to choice, you'll definitely find a few favorite characters along the way as they are all packed with personality and life.\n\nAnd of course, while the game doesn't offer you much physical character customisation, the way the story is written pretty much allows you to simply just imagine your character in the story. That is the key to enjoying this game, imagination.\n\nIf I had any complaints, it would have to be that the game is largely linear. The main story path never deviates that much on repeat playthroughs with the exception of one or two minor details. But the choices you are given lead to a surprising amount of flexibility. By the end of each playthrough you'll have crafted a  mostly unique story each and every time.\n\nSo while the idea of a text only, choose your own adventure game being released on steam seems a bit mad, at the end of the day you'd be hardpressed to find a better example of the choose your own adventure genre out there and for an exceptionally low price, it really is hard to say no to 'Choice of the Deathless'.","August 31, 2014","true","3.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

It's really really good. Not in "good for CYOA game" but, it is, independently, a very good fantasy story. Great setting. Unique premise. (Or is it Unique Setting and Great Premise?) Engrossing storyline. Good characters.\n\nI could totally see this as an actual, best selling, fantasy novel with a bit more development. I almost hoped it is instead of a CYOA game. But maybe not, because by it being a CYOA game might've gave me some different involvement in the story that color my view of the game. In other word, it works as CYOA game as well.\n\nWhat's it about? It's a fantasy story set in a universe where magic is a study of law instead of art or science. And magicians, or craftsmen as it's named in this setting, are more lawyers instead of scientists or artists.\n\nDefinitely the best Choice of Games work I've played so far.\n\nEdit: What do you know?

Substantively, it's enjoyable and that's rather an achievement for Spellcasting Lawyers: The Game. At first, you kind of suspect that none of the choices you make in this game will have any effect, because honestly a lot of games with dialog choices these days just do effect A, regardless of whether you selected option A, B, or C (hello Bioware). There are a few of those, but just like one or two. Everything else will have an effect, even if it's subtle or you aren't sure what's happening at the time and there's a few different major ways things can change without those. The theming is definitely odd, but it's quirky and charming and all-in-all "well that was more interesting that I thought it would be".\n\nHere's the problem. It's short, like really ♥♥♥♥ing short. This is actually the shortest game I've ever played. If you're a relatively average reader, your first playthrough will only take you an hour at most. Subsequent playthroughs will take less time, as you're already familiar with the setting and large chunks of text. And, while the writing is good, I don't honestly believe that it took all that long to come up with this or that it would have been overly difficult to double its length.\n\nIt's fine while it lasts, but I question if it's appropriate to charge three dollars for something you'll only be doing for one day out of your life and, even if you played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it to get all the achievements and all possible dialogues, will only get three to four quality hours out of.\n\nI'd only recommend this on a 50% off sale.","October 22, 2015","false","1.7"," 26 of 46 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","26","46","0","0"

Will you be able to save your friends and colleagues, and perhaps even find romance amongst them? Will your bosses be so impressed with the way you handle cases and clients eventually make you partner? So many demons, so many choices! And you could even die or lose your soul...\n\n"Necromantic legal thriller" seems like a good way to describe this story. It reminded me of Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman in some sense, dealing with demons and hellish creatures while keeping up the dry humour and a modern setting. If you love this kind of angle, then you'll probably like this game. I surely enjoyed myself a lot and heck, even dying is fun in this game where necromancy saves the day!\n\nThe Good+ The modern, demon-infested necromancy-casting setting\n+ Really well-written, especially the workings of magic and some of the romance scenes\n+ You can actually turn into a skeleton and still get the guy/girl!\n\nThe Bad- It's pretty short: you can finish it in 1-2 hours depending on your reading speed\n- No save points and skip options\n- Sleep and Soulstuff stats do not appear to affect your wellbeing and spellcasting ability\n\nIf you like the setting and text-based, interactive novels, be sure to give it a try! I had a great time as a bisexual skeleton demon lawyer who ended up with her favourite workaholic, saved the day, and eventually even made partner of the firm.","February 7","true","1.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But I strongly encourage you to explore it and enjoy its captivating universe - think of a more adult and "scientific" version of Harry Potter, using Craft to bend physical laws and travel through realities and probabilities.\n\nYou work as a "lawyer" for a firm and will have to solve some missions, using your four attributes - conviction, cunning, craft and charm - to make craft contracts, swindle gods by giving a physical manifestation to their contradictions, and make your firm prosper. You build relationships with others that could help you later - or make you fall.\n\nThere are three love interests: the male workaholic who steals credit to your job, the female soap box idealistic, and the rich haughty aristocrat (male or female depending on your preferences). A bit disappointing, and virtually no impact on the story. Another negative points is that a lot of stats are pointless. You have limited sleep and soulstuff (your "magical energy"), yet I've spent nights to work and used craft every single time I could, without ever running out of any of these. Those minor negative points have all been fixed in the sequel, Deathless City's thirst.\n\nOverall, I've had a great experience with this game and I recomment it - however, the sequel is even better, so I strongly encourage to buy the bundle.","November 5, 2015","true","6.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monsterberry/recommended/318310/","monsterberry","Monsterberry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monsterberry/","478 products in account","Choice of the Deathless is a text-only interactive fiction game that takes place in a post-cataclysmic world that is a mix between high fantasy and modern day Manhattan. The Gods have been slain, and demons are bound by magic to serve mortals, but they are always looking for ways to threaten the physical realm. There is a lot of awesome bits of lore like these that hint at a greater world. Your character is a member of a law firm that deals with demon contracts, so you are an interesting mix between lawyer and wizard.\n\nYou start off by just getting out of school and getting a junior position in the firm, shackled by crippling debt. Your goal is to earn money and power, while also dealing with interpersonal dilemmas. Each chapter ends in a personal conflict related to your case, which can be resolved in multiple ways. I chose to employ powerful magic and political backstabbing, but there are also options to deal with these by means of charm and friendship, sheer force of will, or trickery. The game keeps track of your stats depending on how you handle a situation, and you also develop reputation with certain characters.\n\nThere is a lot of great descriptions of the other lawyers, especially the more powerful ones, and ideas about magic that can only be expressed in text. I don't know how well the game will hold up on a second playthrough, but I suspect the scenarios will be the same, but with different side stories and reactions. I think there is more in depth characterization, even romances, if you specialize in charm, but I was a pretty ruthless guy who only had time for work. The ending was a satisfying conclusion. My bosses loved me.\n\nIt's cool to see Steam branch out into interactive fiction. It's a pretty underrated genre of video games. At the end, it's a well told story with a unique setting and an interesting take on demons, so I'd give this a full recommendation!","December 2, 2014","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At some points this game suffered the failing of not making it clear what my decisions would lead to (I was surprised to find out siding with my firm in the goddess case was considered the more morally wrong option), but it was much better about this than past Choice of Games I've played, so I give the writer points for clarity - particularly impressive given how easy it would've been to muck up that aspect with the very unusual premise the story is based on.\n\nWith the amount of intriguing options I still plan to pursue in future playthroughs and achievements I want to grab, this game is an excellent value for the very cheap asking price.","September 4, 2014","true","2.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story was entertaining and fun. However, it felt like the many choices you make in the game didn't actually have any impact on the story. Many of the choices resulted in another just saying "Perhaps." The choices you have in the beginning about being gay, lesbian, or straight, rich, poor, or middle class, save money, or live expensively don't seem to have any consequence either. I tried playing as both a man and woman as well as gay or straight but some of the characters genders kept switching so I couldn't even pursue who I wanted. There is an achievement for paying off your debt but I don't believe its possible to, even if you choose to be rich and then live frugally. There were plenty of choices which resulted in the same result but slightly different dialogue. The ending was good but also a bit disappointing in the resolution. No matter what you do the ending is the same for you. At the very end you get a choice to stay with your company or someone else offers you a job or you decided change careers, regardless you don't hear what happens after your choice. Making the decision is really pointless then. It seemed like a lame attempt to create multiple endings but that is not how it works. For the cheap price (it's already low, but I caught it on a sale!) the game is worth trying. You can finish it in an afternoon and I think its a good way to take a break from norm. I guess if you hate reading don't bother.\n\nI'd give this game a 3 out of 5 stars overall.\n2 out of 5 for the lack of real choice.\n4 out of 5 for the story.\n5 out of 5 for the theme. I felt like there were a lot of interesting details about how the world worked such as interaction with demons, post-God Wars backdrop, magic that actually requires skill, blood, liches walking around like its normal, etc. I think that was the best part of the game. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel with the same theme but also having real choice resulting in multiple story pathways and endings. Also, the character creation in the beginning actually impacting the story and how other characters react to you.\n\nI wish they had a save feature or at least a back button so you can change your answer without having to start the entire game over.","September 26, 2014","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The choices were average, nothing really has any bearing on the story, but you'll want to go back and pick all the other options just to read what happens.\n\nIf the description of the game sounded interesting to you, I can't recommend it enough.","May 4, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I first discovered "Choice of Games" on my Android phone, and was delighted to see the adventures continue on Steam. The writing is great, with enough intrigue and drama to satisfy any interactive novel fans, while having enough RPG-like elements to draw in some new players.\n\nAs a brand new necromancer, your job is to rise in the ranks of a corporation by using your skills and your wit to overcome adversity. You will go head-to-head against coworkers, rival necromancers and demons, and possibly even find love.\n\nThe story is well planned and flows smoothly, although there are a few bland bits scattered here or there. The choices you are faced with are as realistic as a game about raising the dead and summoning demons can be, with your character showing real human weakness and fears along with the courage and bravado expected from an RPG hero. Gameplay is easy, because there are no controls to learn: just read a bit, then click on the response you think fits your hero's personality. One of the great things about this type of game is that you can be anything you want to be.\n\nIf you don't enjoy reading, then this game probably isn't for you. But if you enjoy reading a good story and wonder what it would be like to be a part of that story and dictate the protagonist's every move, then look no further.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

The way this works is so metaphysical that it is unrelatable, confusing, and overly complicated. Magical interactions that are more important than moving your drink from a table to your hand are managed as contracts, the attornies review these contracts in this metaphysical world where the contract is illustrated as a web and the attorney reviews it for loop holes that are literal holes.

Since I was a poor gem lord, I perused over the cheapest games I could grab. I found this game in the bunch, and noticed it to be a "choose your own adventure" type of piece. I never knew Steam sold these, and I jumped at the chance to grab.\n\nI will say that I am extremely happy with this choice. This is an excellent adventure in of itself.\n\n\nI am not much of an avid reader at all, but I do enjoy a good story, and this one was more than just a good story. The narration is amazing; Gladstone truly made a compelling world that I just dove into. My imagination is pretty dull in some ways, and I did my best to visualize the context of this game, but the writing did enough legwork to surprise even myself with the imagery that came to my mind.\n\nI've only done one playthrough so far, but I hunger for more lore and choices! I will definitely invest into games like these in the future from now on, especially with "Choice of Games" [The Publisher/Developer] products.\n\nI invite others to do the same! If you've never tried a text adventure type of game, or love this type of genre, then PLEASE give this a shot when you can!\n\nCheers and happy holidays!  ~Beeps","December 24, 2014","true","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is not the best one that Choice of Games has to offer, but it is great and certainly worth the time and money. The story is very well-written, the humour used is witty, and the world is original and intriguing. The gameplay is not too linear, and the choices you make do matter. The characters are interesting and they have a certain level of depth to them.\n\nThe opening scene isn't great and some people could even find it dislikable enough to lose interest in continuing the game. The opening scene may be boring and fail to grab your attention, but that is not indicative of the quality of the rest of the game.\n\nSome scenes could be difficult to picture because the story takes place in an entirely original fantasy world where you have no basis from real-world examples and would need to rely heavily upon your imagination. The replay value is low and the story is also very short. Nevertheless, fans of interactive fiction and beginners will enjoy playing Choice of the Deathless.","January 15, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The writing for, “choice of robots” was philosophical and aided by generic technological terminology, and “heroes rise” was filled with comic book ability terminology interlaced with futuristic technology reasoning.\n\nWith this game, “choice of the deathless” you can tell that this writer has done not only his supernatural and spiritual research, but he is also well versed in the poetic styling of demonic fiction. Honestly, I went into this adventure expecting something a little more heaven vs hell, or even dealings with the devil type story. Surprisingly, the story was closer to demonic bureaucracy and internal politics.\n\nPersonally, I ‘m rather fond of finding love in the “choose your own adventure” style settings, and I can honestly say my choices gave me a rather enjoyable end to that journey. Although, love aside, I feel the pace of the story was rather rushed in the beginning which kept me from really grasping the world I was entering. I’m sure the effect that I felt starting the adventure was intentional after seeing just where the journey took me, but I think it also had a side effect by not allowing me to fully connect to the characters in a meaningful, remember able way. I would play this “Choice of” game again, only to give myself a better grasp of the world within.","January 27, 2015","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have to say that having gone through four of them so far that a couple of cliches have begun to spring up in their work. Thats only normal of course, as after enough work repitition will build. The only reason I bring that up is because their cliches are almost completely filled within this game. The game itself has a good lore and story, which can actually pull you into the game very easily. The choices, like the other games from them, have real choices which affect large parts of the story. They aren't what I would call 'fake choices' as some, and even most, can lead to big consequences. My biggest issue with this game is probably just within the biggest cliche that the developers use. That being the idea of starting the game at the end of the story. I'll admit that they do it creatively and differently each time, but it just seems to get old after the first time you see it.

Admittedly, that was what first drew me to the game (as well as a recommendation from a Steam friend), as well as another friend taking note of the title. There's not much to say for the game visually; you are presented with words and the occaisional pop up saying you've completed an achievement. What it lacks visually it makes up for with writing because this is some of the wittiest writing I've seen on Steam, and its title seems fitting of its content.\n\nGiven that this is a straight Choose Your Own Adventure game, the choices you choose will matter a lot in determining what happens down the line. The writing itself is very good at giving you a taste of the world, and yet not holding your hand through ever single aspect of it. This can be a little daunting to new readers, because you can quickly become lost with all the facets of this universe. Luckily, this story is set in the same universe as the author's published "Craft Sequence" series, which may be of interest to anybody who thoroughly enjoyed this game.\n\nThe characters you encounter (as well as the dialogue options for yourself) feel fresh and amusing, and the choices allow for a broad range of answers. As I mentioned earlier, it's incredibly witty and so if you love writing like that this will be perfect for you. The kinds of scenarios written also feel very interesting, though the one thing that may be a downside to some readers is how some of the events/scenarios don't seem to connect to each other much, aside from a brief mention by a character or so (this is, however, wholly dependent on the choices you make I believe - I am currently going through each possible route). Overall, however, there is a story that does weave its way through your adventure, and while the ending itself may feel like a cliffhanger, it was still an enjoyable read. If you're unfazed by the text only visuals, then I highly recommend giving this a go. And when it's on sale for a cheap, cheap price, why not?","December 23, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The writing for, “choice of robots” was philosophical and aided by generic technological terminology, and “heroes rise” was filled with comic book ability terminology interlaced with futuristic technology reasoning.\n\nWith this game, “choice of the deathless” you can tell that this writer has done not only his supernatural and spiritual research, but he is also well versed in the poetic styling of demonic fiction. Honestly, I went into this adventure expecting something a little more heaven vs hell, or even dealings with the devil type story. Surprisingly, the story was closer to demonic bureaucracy and internal politics.\n\nPersonally, I ‘m rather fond of finding love in the “choose your own adventure” style settings, and I can honestly say my choices gave me a rather enjoyable end to that journey. Although, love aside, I feel the pace of the story was rather rushed in the beginning which kept me from really grasping the world I was entering. I’m sure the effect that I felt starting the adventure was intentional after seeing just where the journey took me, but I think it also had a side effect by not allowing me to fully connect to the characters in a meaningful, remember able way.

Compared to the Choice of Hero trilogy, I've found that the writing has improved. Understandably, there is still a certain amount of railroading and the overarching story doesn't seem to be affected much by your decisions, you just get a few variations in a few scenes here and there. It has intriguing characters, and an equally fascinating world which unfortunately, you only get a short, shallow glimpse of. Naturally, some of this is understandable, given the amount of branching items that would have to occur to avoid the linearity.\n\nI'd recommend picking this up on sale, if you like the text story kinda thing. It's good for about two or three playthroughs, before the illusion of choice begins to fall apart.","September 26, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The novel I've found to both be my favorite and the most interactive, diverse, funny, witty, and entertaining is Tin Star. But behind that, I think I might say Choice of the Deathless.\n\nThis novel is just as interactive as others from CG, and very, very creative. You play a lawyer of sorts, working for a firm with a name I can't spell that settles disputes and writes contracts and otherwise for and between humans, demons, goddesses/gods (those of which aren't dead from this big war that happened before your characters time) and other things, though you mostly deal with the demons. I like the novel because it's fun and interesting - the author made an entire world both relateable and completely different from our own, using modern things like bars and apartments and student loan debt mixed with things like dragons that act as planes and demons made of glass and spencers with blood holes for eye sockets and too many mouths. It is really, really interesting in the world it's set it.\n\nBut it's also very confusing. There's various languages that are never explained and just mentioned in passing, which makes me wonder about what their real-world equivilent might be, but you never get anything close to an explanation. You do figure out your own language is called Kathic - that's the thing about this game, there's a lot of figuring out. I love connecting pieces of story together, but sometimes it could just be confusing. It'll throw words and phrases that I have nothing to attach to to make sense of and then just expect me to know it. It isn't a giant hinderance on gameplay/reading, but it can sometimes make things confusing and just had me lost now and then.\n\nGood thing is, though, that the characters are pretty fun. They're interesting, if not because of their characteristics then because they're all weird, physically and mentally. There's a few romantic oppourtunities and a lot of possibly funny scenes, and the dialouge is the most relateable I've seen in a CG game - but I really say that in a "it breaks the fourth wall" kind of way.\n\nAgain, sometimes confusing but with interesting characters and world, and various avaliable avenues and funny dialouge. It's cheap and has huge replay value, so if you're a fan of interactive novels I'd go ahead and buy it. 7/10 I personally found the sequal Deathless: The City's Water less confusing and maybe more enjoyable because of that, so you could start with that one or get the bundle of both games for 6 bucks (it's maybe 2 dollers more than just getting Deathless: The City's Water). The demos are also reasonably long so if you're really unsure you can try that. I also reccomend to anyone who ends up enjoying this game to check out Tin Star, which is a 10/10.","November 26, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a fun choose your own adventure and is fairly well written.  It is also refreshingly not heteronormative, allowing you to choose whether you're male or female, if your first kiss was with a man or woman, and if you're interested in men, women, or both.  That said, considering that the next book had a trans protagonist, it is surprisingly cisnormative, at least for your character, despite the line from a senior partner of "I have been three times a father, and once a mother, and none of my children speak to me any more."  However I can't much fault an incredibly inclusive game simply for not being inclusive enough.  I enjoy the world, and I love the melding of contract law and incredible magicks.  If you want to play as an immortal queer lawyer sorceress then this is the game/book for you.","July 26, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The novel I've found to both be my favorite and the most interactive, diverse, funny, witty, and entertaining is Tin Star. But behind that, I think I might say Choice of the Deathless.\n\nThis novel is just as interactive as others from CG, and very, very creative. You play a lawyer of sorts, working for a firm with a name I can't spell that settles disputes and writes contracts and otherwise for and between humans, demons, goddesses/gods (those of which aren't dead from this big war that happened before your characters time) and other things, though you mostly deal with the demons. I like the novel because it's fun and interesting - the author made an entire world both relateable and completely different from our own, using modern things like bars and apartments and student loan debt mixed with things like dragons that act as planes and demons made of glass and spencers with blood holes for eye sockets and too many mouths. It is really, really interesting in the world it's set it.\n\nBut it's also very confusing. There's various languages that are never explained and just mentioned in passing, which makes me wonder about what their real-world equivilent might be, but you never get anything close to an explanation. You do figure out your own language is called Kathic - that's the thing about this game, there's a lot of figuring out. I love connecting pieces of story together, but sometimes it could just be confusing. It'll throw words and phrases that I have nothing to attach to to make sense of and then just expect me to know it. It isn't a giant hinderance on gameplay/reading, but it can sometimes make things confusing and just had me lost now and then.\n\nGood thing is, though, that the characters are pretty fun. They're interesting, if not because of their characteristics then because they're all weird, physically and mentally. There's a few romantic oppourtunities and a lot of possibly funny scenes, and the dialouge is the most relateable I've seen in a CG game - but I really say that in a "it breaks the fourth wall" kind of way.\n\nAgain, sometimes confusing but with interesting characters and world, and various avaliable avenues and funny dialouge. It's cheap and has huge replay value, so if you're a fan of interactive novels I'd go ahead and buy it. 7/10 I personally found the sequal Deathless: The City's Water less confusing and maybe more enjoyable because of that, so you could start with that one or get the bundle of both games for 6 bucks (it's maybe 2 dollers more than just getting Deathless: The City's Water). The demos are also reasonably long so if you're really unsure you can try that. I also reccomend to anyone who ends up enjoying this game to check out Tin Star, which is a 10/10.","November 26, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Writing isn't that great unfortunately. I can't recomend this game.\n\nI've never been to impressed with the options that were laid before me and how the choices I made interacted with each other. Now, the obvious thing to say is "the nice thing about these kind of games is the various options they provide and how your story changes with each play through"; but when things are so boring you barely can stand playing through a game once, do multiple branching paths really matter?\nWhile "Adventure" was an acomplishment for its time and still manages to somewhat hold today, this game should be able to hold up to the fun that can be found in adventure but fails to do so. It feels like a constant reminder of the difficulties with interactive storytelling when such a media was still a fresh consept.\n\nSPOILER\nOne of the main complaints I had is that the description of this game sounds like the adventure. I thought there will be some kind of take on modern office life or some kind of commentary on how a law firm operates or even a hard boiled detective/ lawyer story that just happens to involve the undead. This isn't the case, as it gets into the undead part more than the reality part that I was hoping for.
