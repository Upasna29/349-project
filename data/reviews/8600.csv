As for me, a friend of mine gifted this game to me. I got the extreme edition including RACE 07 DLC, RACE 07 and GTR Evolution. Due to all the three contents, the selection of cars and tracks increased a lot. Addition of Nurburgring(Track) via GTR Evolution was must since every racing game is considered incomplete due to it's absense.\n\n\nAs for the ingame physics, the game is far better than Need For Speed franchise which emphasizes on ultra quality graphics and High end cars rather than ingame physics. Cars handles and feels realistic and the engine sounds are very similar to the ones in real life.\n\n\nBecause this is an old game, the multiplayer lobby mostly remains empty but if you are lucky, you will find a server with 15-14 players.\n\n\nDon't hesitate to buy it, the amount of ingame content is anormous and the modding community is still growing at an amazing rate. Cars, tracks feels lively.\n\n\nBuy this game and if you own any steering wheel controller for pc, it will act as chocolate syrup over the existing cake.\n\nGo on, buy it   :D\n\nThank you all for reading, and thanks to my friend for gifting me this :D","March 18, 2014","true","1.5"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","55","62","0","4"

( The actual game looks much better than the promo videos, believe me ) I do find that user made skins available at mod sites generally look superior to the stock car skins.\nCars have excellent physics and feel, controller set-up is easily customized to suit your style of controller and play, car setups can be finely tuned with many many variables which accurately mirror real-world tuneability. Alternately, pre-configured set-ups are available online.\nThere are a huge number of different cars and tracks to suit any skill level or particular interest, Everything from high-downforce open-wheel racing, to touring cars, minis, etc etc. I prefer the vintage sports cars myself, the Retro pack with GT Legends mod brings me back to the golden years of vintage sports car racing.\nThe modding community is still very active, there are too many user made cars, tracks, skins, and effects mods to list, which add a lot to the game, and are not very difficult to install and run.\nIn summary, if you are a racing enthusiast and you don't have this game, you are really missing the boat. Don't expect any "yo dude, that was so gnarly" as in, say, DIRT2. What you are getting here is pure racing, and nothing but. At this price, you're stealing it. So get it, and drive it like you stole it.\n\nIs it easy? No. Are you going to jump right into the most powerful car and dominate the competition? No. This is not an arcade game, it's a simulation. There is a learning curve. You may learn that you actually suck, at first anyways. Ever watch racing on television and think; "hey I could do that no problem"?

It is quite simply the best touring car experience out there. I've put hundreds of hours into this sim, most of which doing competitive league and championship racing at Race2Play.com. The features and details this sim has to offer, especially at the time of its release, were second to none. Comprehensive tire model, very rich setup with (most) cars responding very well to the setup changes, best FWD touring car or similar experience to date, windscreen and visor bug splats/mud with helmets having tear-offs, lots of good add-ons (particularly Retro Expansion!) which gave a variety of cars and more tracks such as the entire Green Hell and a barrage of GT1 - GT3 content with the GTREvo expansion.\n\nThe GT car physics are sub-par, I'll be honest. GTR2 was much better for these and GTRE fails to exploit the same GT experience. The formula cars are kind of a hit and miss. You really need to dive into the setup to get these feeling correctly, but the FMaster and FRR are really fun when you do. Unfortunately the Formula cars in this game use GT car brakes! Grand Prix length events with the FRR, even with full brake duct and lower pressure, will overheat and destroy the brakes. Because they overheat at 600C like the GT brakes, instead of overheating at the F1 range of 1000C, which they can easily reach with higher ambient temperature and heavy brake-load circuits. Unfortunately having my brakes fail in two Grands Prix cost me a very prestigious drivers championship at R2P so I remain bitter about that flaw.\n\nBut all-in-all the setup depth and complexity and telemetry coming off the car, the amount of cars and the detail put into the individual physics for each (even model-by-model in classes!) is amazing, the detail of the tracks including the bumps and undulations of the surface make driving a F1 or GT1 car on the edge in league racing incredibly intense, and just.. yeah. It's a sim, not an arcade game. If you take the time to learn how to setup each car, push yourself to be consistent and drive it like a sim - drive it like you would a real car - setup your FFB to really feel the front suspension weight transfers this is a driving sim experience like no other!","December 8, 2013","true","641.3"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","1"

That means to play it, it is recommended to have a gamepad or wheel. Trying to do anything without one of those is a waste of time.\n\nTo start off with there are lots of annoying things, the control setup is tedious (but it works), the settings are sometimes overly complicated, people online can be ♥♥♥♥♥ (if I had a cent for every first corner accident...) and the AI opponents are mentally challenged.\n\nHowever once you've set up everything correctly and connect to a multiplayer server (preferably with some friends) the game is great. For people who like 'real' racing the gameplay is great. Cars handle like they should and once you know what you're doing close racing is very much possible.\nAlso because of the driving aids people with different skill levels can easily compete with each other for fun racing sessions.\n\nFrom there on there is a myriad of tweaks and settings to change to get that extra bit of speed out of your car, I am not interested in that but for the simracing enthusiast it is great.\n\nTo conclude, there are some small issues with Race 07 but on the whole it is the best sim racing game available on Steam, period.","July 9, 2013","true","88.2"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

Though this game was released in late 2007, It is still very relevant and challenges many new games that are released. I have not a single complaint about this game. I would even call it one of the best racing simulators on PC when all of the expansion packs are installed.\n\nI actually received this game as well as the GTR Evolution Expansion as part of a Steam key giveaway a while back, but I can tell you that I would gladly pay double the price of the game because it is so good. I enjoyed it so much that I recently purchased the Mega Bundle that contains all of the expansion packs, which I definitely recommend you buy. I've already had hours of fun with this game, and I can assure many more are to come.\n\nThe physics are great, the AI is pretty decent, and I can't complain about the graphics. With a wheel, this game is even more realistic. There are dozens of preset controls for multiple wheels, including the G27 which I have been playing the game with. If you get bored of Single Player mode, there is always a multiplayer mode, which is still quite active for an older game. The drivers are sometimes sub-par, but you really get that in any online experience.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a bit of fun.

The choice of cars across all the expansions is perfect for online racing.\nThere really is something for everyone, from slow and nimble Mini Coopers, to high powered open wheel racers, to classic and modern muscle cars (Race On expansion).\nMy favorite part of this game though is it's single player section though. It's ability to play and create championships makes this a great single player game, along with the fact that the AI is actually rather smart to race against compared to other games.\n\nModding is also fairly popular with this game as is evident by sites like NoGripRacing and RaceDepartment, with various add-on cars and tracks all waiting to be played.\n\nSince this is a racing simulation, it is definitely a greater experience to use a wheel. I highly recommend getting yourself a wheel if you don't have one yet as it will change your experience entirely.\nIf you don't play racing games that often it's more than acceptable to use a gamepad, it's still good fun but not as good as with a wheel. The game is drivable with a keyboard as well, but that's a last resort.\n\nIn short, it's definitely worth getting the whole package: Race Injection, GTR Evo and Race On.

Get the game + all expansions, its one of those lifetime games, where you could play it in 10 years and still enjoy it. Easily top 3 actual racing games (I mean racing, with pits and 20 laps with a realistic full grid of cars and an actual season, with whatever tracks you want, using any car catagory) on PC and probably top 3 racing games of all time for me. As much as i love the graphics of GRID and GT and FORZA, this game I can race 20+ laps and have pits and feel like im in an actual race. Bumper to bumper and fighting for every corner, provided you put teh Ai high enough for your personal skill level. I'm not a bad racer and 95% Ai gives me a very solid hardcore sweat filled competitive race with asteering wheel. Whereas most racing games GRID etc, you have 1 race, have some fun, but theres really nothing else to it. There's no intense championship seasons in most of those games, accept Codemasters F1 and perhaps DIRT RALLY. Race 07 is like a slightly more realistic version of TOCA 3. With mods and V8 Supercar and DTM mods you can download from around the web , plus tons of other mods and a brutal Ai if you stick the Ai on 90% or higher, its endless intense racing , doesnt matter how old it is now.","April 7","true","184.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I managed to pick this game up and all of its DLC for about a buck each during a humble bundle, and I have loved this game ever since. Although it may not have the aesthetics of modern racing sims, the graphics hold up incredibly well, and can easily be optimized for any system. The many different cars in Race 07 feel completely different from one another, and handle much like you would expect them to. Open wheel F1 style cars can corner with ease, assuming you can control the massive amount of power they contain, while heavy muscle cars provide an interesting challenge in the bends. The controls can be fine tuned to your liking, whether you own a wheel or a gamepad or just have a keyboard and mouse. For only $3.99 (at the time I'm writing this) you'd be crazy not to buy this game if your a fan of motorsports. Just remember, your not buying a crazy, over the top game like Need for Speed or Burnout, your buying a game with a pure focus on racing.","August 18, 2015","true","48.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deaks25/recommended/8600/","deaks25","deaks25","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deaks25/","131 products in account","The 'Race' series comes from a little Swedish company called Simbin, not the most evocotive name. But when you take the entire series as a whole, they have created an absolute master piece of PC gaming.\n\nRace 07, the core game of the series, is primarily focused on the WTCC (World Touring Car Championsip) for 2007, along with serveral 'support' series you can race also. Having learnt leassons from previous racing sims, Simbin have just kept adding to the game, & despite the final collection numbering near double figures, the game is still stable, reliable & entertaining as day one.\n\nThe one thing that should grab the attention of serious racing-sim fans is the fact that behind the less glamourous series' is in fact nothing less than a licensed version of the rFactor engine, a sim that has gone beyond being a game, it is tool that is even used by top racing teams to train professional drivers!\n\nOnce you have the full works of the Race series, you can race everything from Caterhams, MINI Coopers, WTCC cars of various series, Formula BMW, GT cars, muscle cars... The number of different cars on offer is quite astounding.\n\nHowever, the real bonus to the Race series is that Simbin have left the game entirely open to being heavily modded, & in fact, have made allowances for making the game easy to mod, from car skins, to tracks, graphics tweaks to entirely new cars that have never existed in the game. Despite having added a huge number of mods of various types to my install, the game remains stable & utterly reliable, something that could quite easily be the make or break of a modding favourite.\n\nOn the downside, you pretty much need the whole hog to ensure mods will work, meaning you do have to commit to it. Also, given the quality of the 'sim' part, if you don't have, or never intend to, get a steering wheel, don't bother with it, you'll just be wasting the game & not getting the full experience.\n\nIt adds up to a game where you can race almost anything you want to, on pretty much any track you like. There are even online racing clubs who use the game.\n\nI've reached a point where I actually wouldn't even consider buying new racing sims as Race has everything I need, with all the quality & realism of a truly great game that could only be this great on a PC.","September 4, 2014","true","262.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It can thus appeal to both beginners and hardcore simracers.\n\nDuring Steam Sales, this game is simply the best value for money of the entire racing sim universe.\n\nWhat do I need to play a car sim ?\nRacing wheel is not mandatory.

But generally no setup is provided for the different car types. And it takes skill and time to create a good setup. But fear not ! Even if you stick to the vanilla game, you can enjoy hundreds hours of play thanks to so many tracks and car models.\n\nYet I want add-ons !

It's very good.\n\nThe amount and variety of content puts many later titles to shame, and so does the AI.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, I can race the AI without simply strolling through the pack or watching a single file of cars disappear over the horizon leaving me to hot lap alone. In addition, I have yet to be rear ended or shoved off the track by the AI, no matter where I am on track or how slow I am going. If you have track position, the AI will respect that as best it can, however if you try things like cheap late dives up the inside, they will hold their line and you will get clumped. This enables you to battle with the AI for fun under proper 'Queensbury Rules', which is how it should be.\n\nThe only other game I can think of at the moment that has AI close to this is Stock Car Extreme.\n\nIn addition, the AI cars also have their own little battles between themselves from time to time which helps greatly with the immersion and I have yet to see any AI cars get bunched up and stuck anywhere. (Quick Tip: Don't max out the number of AI cars when you race. Keep the AI numbers on the low side and this will further help to avoid congestion.)\n\nGraphics are fine, and with a little graphics card tweaking (anti-aliasing in particular) it can be made to look very nice - not photo realistic, no - but still nice looking. Smooth and and clean.\n\nForce feedback is also good if you take the time to tweak the settings to your liking. One advantage of being an older game is that there's plenty of information on the internet to help set up most wheels properly.\n\nKudos also for the clean and clear user interface. Everything is laid out logically, and setting up races and competitions (you can also create your own custom competitions by the way) follows a nice logical flow through track and car selection to get you to race day.\n\nSo, if you're at all frustrated whilst waiting for a fix or patch on your latest photo-realistic uber-racing sim, do yourself a favour - spend £2.50 on this and have some serious fun in the mean time.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nP.S. I've spent quite a bit more time playing this game than the numbers above would indicate, before writing this review. :)","February 3","true","5.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Now do take mention that this game is started to show its age. Its an amazing racer, the standard content is greater but the community really made it shine, there are thousands of mods for this game so you can have a car count which rivals that of even behemoths like granturismo. honestly there could be moments where you are just messing around looking at the different cars instead of actually racing. The online community has gotten a lot more bitter since this game was given away for free.\n\nFor the price tag you will struggle to get better bang for buck, maybe from gtr2 but personally i prefer this to the gtr series and the layout seems to be more friendly\n\nAnyways remember that this is a sim racer so spinning out, blood and tears will be things that you will encounter from time to time and there is a learning curve, some will enjoy that while others will headbutt a wall.\n\nThe graphics are dated as it came out in 2007, the main problem is that the anti-aliasing sucks big time. If you have a nvidia card throw that DSR on and downsample from 4k. Amds VSR works in a similiar way but as of this review it works only with the 290 series which is a shame as i have a 7870 xt.\n\nThe bottom line is that this great while great is started to lose its touch, the newer games of the racing world namely Assetto corsa, Iracing, Rfactor 2 and maybe Game stock car are the kings, they have great physics but also have great graphics and many believe that Assetto corsa will take the crowd and be the spiritual father of Race 07.\n\nIf you want a great racing game but are strapped for cash this is a uncanny deal, if you are balling and want to make it rain, get Assetto corsa.\n\n","December 16, 2014","true","4.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

People still play it and lag doesn't ruin the experience in case you were worried. You can race fine even with a few high ping players rushing to the finish line.\nSecond of all, Race 07 features an impressive physics system that makes each car handle differently. This is as close as a driving sim can get. Even more,the cockpits look phenomenal,adding to the whole driving experience. Last thing I will mention is the weather system changing the game's difficulty: rain plays a big role when racing,so with each turn there comes a risk,with each movement your car could slip.\nEven so,for casual gamers,Simbin Studios added the option to play this game in a more relaxing manner.  Each "safety" system of your car cand be turned on or off,so for casuals,this is a welcome feature.\n\nNow,about the things that didn't age so well:\n\nSee,the graphics in this game are a bit dated,but don't let that fool you! It's not a deal breaker. Sure,a few updated car models and textures would've been better,but Race 07 is far from being unplayable regarding this department.\nThe sound is still great for this time,even if the other cars don't sound that well compared to yours.\n\n\nThis is basically it,your daily driving experience. Trust me,this game will not gather dust on your steam library. Personally I play it daily because it truly feels like I'm driving a real car, and there are many real life players who run the tracks every day.\n\nIf Race07 is not your type,then you could try other arcade focused games like Grid 2.","January 22, 2014","true","30.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","3"

If you've got PCars, iRacing etc, get this as well, you wont' regret it.","October 26, 2015","true","59.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It does require you to use some sort of controller other than a keyboard and mouse, but can easily be controlled with the stuff you probably already own, like a Dualshock III or Xbox controller.\n\nThe expansion packs are worth it, especially GTR Evolution for us who need a bit more speed than what touring cars can offer.\n\nThe community creates a lot of free tracks and cars that are excellent for making the game last a lot longer.\n\nOn the downside of things, the force feedback in this game compared to earlier Simbin titles like GTR2 is horrible. You don't get that distinct feel of lack of grip when understeering, a vital thing in a game with mostly FWD cars.\n\nThe graphics are very dated by now, and no mod seems to freshen them up properly. Creating your own skins do help a bit though, something I do a lot.\n\nAll in all, for its age, Race07 is around an 8/10 because of the lack of proper FFB and lack of "fast" racing cars. GTR2 is better.","December 29, 2013","true","299.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not a ''Zoom through the city raising panic while swerving from bullets, and while I'm in a maxed out hot rodded Mclaren some guy in a Ford Model T passes me", rather, it's a WTCC (as you know from the description) racing game. It seems a little hard to find non street racing games that are good these days, but this is one I'd recommend.\n\nPros:\nQuick races for the less competitive gamers, where you can still make your own championships and such but there isn't anything to lose if you, well, lose.\nSuper fun and addicting\nCheap! The less money you spend, the better, right?\nUltra graphics settings works on old, slower computers.\n\nPro/Con, depending on preference:\nThe crash physics are a slight but strange, as sometimes you'll fly up into the air spinning faster then a top, but by the same token, it's super fun to crash into walls at full speed and wach the replay\n\nCon:\nThe graphics ain't quite Project Cars levels, if you get what I'm saying.\nThe graphics ain't quite Crysis levels either.\nOr Battlefront\n\n","January 8","true","100.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are pretty standard but far from bad, and can be  a very simple or complex game based on how you want to play. This is going to be my go-to racing game for now, and I even have games like Forza 5, but this is a very good and most important, enjoyable game.

The damage is fairly good as you can get suspension damage from minor contact but it is very difficult to take a wheel off.\n\nI definitly recommend getting the sinbin bundle as you not only get this game and all of the DLC you get every game simbin ever developed which include GTR 1 and 2 as well as GT Legends all of which feature the same engine as Race 07.\n\nThe modding community is large and there are endless tracks and cars you can install to make your experience even stronger adding from what is a great variety of cars and made better with the DLC which for the money is also great. Most racing games nowadays do not have the variety of cars that Race 07 has and adding more through mods is also simple\n\nThe developers also still care about this game as recently they updated the multiplayer servers to improve out online experience. As well as this the online community is stong and there are always people on there waiting for a race.\n\nOn the whole this is an excellent game and if your not sure whether to buy it I would as it is extremly cheap for what the game contains and after 7 years it is still going strong","June 28, 2014","true","144.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I haven't played many hours of the game yet, but I can already say if you should buy this game or not.\n\nThis game is totally worth it if you:\nA) Have a decent wheel with Force Feedback\nB) Have a computer that can run the game on high or max graphic settings (I have a gaming computer, not very good, but not bad either. Can run it with atleast high graphic setting and still have good FPS)\nC) Can drive realistic (you don't need to be a fast and good driver, but atleast brake at the braking points, hit apex and generally control the car you're driving. If you are a pro driver at Need for Speed it doesn't count)\n\nThe force feedback is fantastic in this game, and so is the handling of the cars. It feels like a game from this year if you ignore the graphics (graphics are good at high or max settings, but not the same as most games from 2013 and 2014). AI also feels nice. In this game you can't point the wheel in the direction you want to go and floor it. No, you have to fight it! It is a proper racing sim, you hear that?\n\nThis game is a masterpiece.\n\nEDIT: I would like to add something that might help you understand how good this game actually is.\nThis game is better than most racing sims released after this was released. Most of the realistic driving and racing games released the last years are worse than this. I am mostly thinking about the realism of course (AI, handling of cars, and so on).","June 30, 2014","true","12.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even for an experienced sim racer, this game can get really hard at times. It is as realistic as it gets. You won`t do drifting here as much as slamming into a concrete wall. Offline play doesn`t give much incentive to go on, though there are plenty of nice tracks and cars to drive on and in.\n\nThis game really shines in online leagues, where other sim racing fans gather.

The reason why I wrote it here is because everytime you run RACE Injection, Steam misinterprets it as RACE '07. Likewise, my total gameplay for this game is supposedly 1 minute (I actually played it for 9 frickin' hours).\n\nFix this ♥♥♥♥ right away, Steam.\n\n[BEGIN REVIEW]\n\nRACE Injection is pretty much like RACE '07 (because that's exactly what it is). What makes RACE Injection different from the series is that this game comes bundled with other expansion packs for the RACE series such as the WTCC Expansion, the STCC Expansion, the Formula RaceRoom Expansion, Retro Maxx Expansions as well as other expansions that exists in the Sim-Bin racing verse.\n\nAlthough not much good can be said about this game, there isn't really anything bad about RACE Injection. The game retains its sim-ish gameplay, along with various vehicles and teams to choose from as well as various tracks that still exist till today. Players can either join a singleplayer game and battle with a couple of offline bots in a race for pole position, or they can simply do the same thing in the multiplayer world, where things get slightly out of hand as the onlineverse of RACE Injection is littered with pros, amateurs, road rage drivers and those who just can't drive as well.\n\nThe variety of cars listed is a lot, and I mean a lot. Players can assume any car in any team in more than 14 different classes, ranging from the tame and puny like the Formula BMW and other Touring Cars to the much faster and wild cars like the Formula RaceRoom and the GT Touring Pro Series. What's good about this game is that this game lets you install any mods that you download online into your RACE '07 folder, pretty much like rFactor. Which means that as long as the modding community keeps making mods for this game, players will keep themselves glued to their seats as they test and enjoy every single mod the community has to offer.\n\nAs for the gameplay, RACE Injection counts as a sim-ish game, due to its availability of driving anaesthetics, its complex driving system and the overall realism that is implemented in the game. The features such as ABS, TCS, damage sensitivity, tire wear and all the little itsy bitsy details can be configured to the player's liking, either by turning it up a notch and removing the driving aids to increase the difficulty of driving in the game and thus increasing the challenge of placing in the podium finish, or nerfing the difficulty down a little and activating the ABS and TCS to ease the driving. Either way, even though the gameplay can be a little hard to master, the game does appeal to both realism addicts and casual drivers.\n\nSince the game is quite dated, it's no surprise that this game isn't as realistic as Assetto Corsa, nor does it have shiny graphics like Need For Speed Rivals. But if you're the type of gamer who has a lackluster system who wants to enjoy a slightly less serious racing sim game, RACE Injection is definitely for you.\n\nAnd the others? Well, it's a safe bet that they may not want to drive in RACE Injection. Unless they don't mind the shoddy graphics and slightly-less-serious racing physics.","December 21, 2013","true","16.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

All of them including this one are very realistic with excellent steering wheel and force feedback handling.\nMore so and better than most games I tried. I have both a F1 like wheel and a 900 degree typical wheel, both work very nicely and was easy to adjust in the game, both in handling and force feedback.\nSome well known sims try to increase the difficulty level by exaggerating greatly all damage the vehicle gets, like in overrevving for a second, there is no such nonsense in this game, it's all pretty realistic.\n\nThe graphics in this game are dated but the playability is high. The AI of other drivers could be better, they are overly and unrealistically agressive. The sound is fitting but not memorable.\n\nHighly recommended and good value.\n\nTip for beginners:\nMany people recommend beginners to use driving aids in sim games.\nI do not.\nIf you are, say in your forties and an experienced driver in real life, go for the most realistic, just choose cars in the beginning that are similar to cars you have driven for real.\nWhen practicing, go for better time than your last, but don't try to be an ace. Otherwise you might make to many mistakes, get disappointed and loose interest in the game..\n","December 4, 2013","true","5.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The online play is pretty good, but expect to be treated harshly or kicked if you aren't there to try to race properly and not ram into people and "forget" to use the brakes. 10/10 worth buying for any racing fan.

Honestly Forza is all I play on my Xbox. Period.\n\nSo a racing game on the PC should be even better right? Wrong…\n\nI have an Xbox360 remote for my PC, but its still completely useless in this game.\n\nAllow me to explain what I’m getting at.\n\nYou fire up your Xbox. Start Forza. And you pick a car and race. Its simple, you have your assists you can check on or off, you don’t have tons and tons and tons of little nitpicky options to chose from, and everybody you ever play with has the exact same controller as you. The same two stick, two trigger setup.\nEverybody is on even ground. And the physics in Forza are fluid, and while not entirely realistic, just FEEL right. You learn how to drift, how hard to apply the brakes, it starts to feel natural. And you know you lost because you weren’t as fast as the other guy, not because he had a better control setup, or ticked off a setting I wasn’t aware off…\n\nNow take Race007. You fire it up, pick a car, and your plumped onto a track. The engines shut off. Ok that’s neat, but how do I start it?  Duck into the settings and assign a key…  Ok great the motors started here we… ugh I stalled it, better assign a clutch button on my controller… Ok here we go, turn right to exit the pits… oh my god is that what it feels like steering in this game!? Your wheels will turn in slowly, but as soon as you centre the stick your wheels snap back to centre instantly. It feels horrible! There must be a setting to fix it… no… ugh… ok I’ll just have to deal with it. Try a race. The AI kick my ♥♥♥, executing each corner perfectly. While I’m flailing around the course, struggling just to take a turn without messing up… Why not try multiplayer? Sure why not. They should make the same mistakes as me. Nope. They all have $200 wheels and pedals. They can turn with ease and I’m left in the pits… assigning keys I wont remember because the settings changed because this server has different rules… SCREW THIS… I’m going back to Forza…\n\nSee the dilemma? No? Hey its your cash. Knock yourself out…","February 4","false","0.8"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kritigri/recommended/8600/","kritigri","Kritigri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kritigri/","475 products in account","When you start (I have no idea if you unlock more), there are four cars to choose from. The BMW  handles like a brick, the other two I tried spin out at the slightest twitch from sitting still (even with all the assisted crap on), and the fourth I didn't try because I didn't want to sit through another loading screen to be met with the same results.\n\nDeciding that I should probably work my way through a championship in order to unlock more content, I headed over to the screen and found that the championships available were ones you create yourself.\n\nI must admit that there are a nice selection of tracks, and that I did eventually manage to have some fun when I got into racing. I still, however, don't quite understand how that part works. I set it to five laps but ended up doing limitless amounts to a time limit of what I think was 20 minutes. The aim seemed to be to set the fastest lap time in the alloted time limit, but it also kept reminding me how far behind me the driver in second place was, making me uncertain of the actual goal. And although it seemed under the dialometer that I should visit pit stops at strategic intervals, when I did so I couldn't find any real way to repair my car (although I may not have looked long enough) and when setting off again, the first lap from the pits didn't seem to count towards a time. And also the guy in second place closed our gap by a lap. That was a little terrifying.\n\nAnyway, if you got this game for free, give it a shot because you might get some fun out of it. Despite what it says it actually does have 360 controller support. Other than that, don't spend money on this game.

I mention that only because the creators seem to think they have actually built a magical device that is a REAL racing experience. But it's not. It is a program on a computer, and frankly not a very good one either. The problem with so many of these "racing sims" is that the people playing them and the people making them will not acknowledge the fact that these are games, built for entertainment value. The view of the world from inside a car is a whole hell of a lot different from one sitting in front of a computer screen. The same rules don't apply. For instance, no matter how good a setup you may have you will never actually be able to feel the car tires start to lose grip. This is a very, very important part of driving that you cannot replicate. But let's be honest here; 99.9% of the people who play games don't have a wheel and pedals and a racing chair - it's just too expensive. Most people will be playing these games with controlers, and will only have a few hours at a time to dedicate to playing. It takes years to learn how to be a real race car driver, and frankly if the people playing these games could be racing car drivers they wouldn't be playing a frankly appaling port of their job. This is a game, but because the makers of this game refuse to admit that it is a game, it's not very good. Unless you are a harcore racing game fanatic, you will hate this game. if you are a hardcore racing game fanatic you will be playing something much better, like Project Cars. This is a game with no real dempographic, and it really shows. Lot's of technical detail, very little enjoyment. I paid $2 for a bundle of seven racing games and I guess this is a classic example of caveat emptor. I got what I paid for.","September 5, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","0"

As a long time fan of rFactor, I was intrigued by this game, especially given it's amazing price of £0.47 in the steam christmas sale, this was basically a free game for me, as all the money I used to buy it came from TF2 items and trading cards!\nThe game itself is an accurate and in depth simulation. It has almost all the options of rFactor, and some extras. The graphics are also nicer than rFactor, however, this is to be expected, given that it is a newer game. All the different game modes and cars that are avaliable feel smooth, and drive very well. The game even works well with a pad, although, wheels are obviously the better choice. The only problem I really have with this game is it's multiplayer communtiy, they treat you like s***, if you are new to the game, however, if you play some singleplayer for a few hours beforehand (like I am now doing) then you should be good. This is, however, something to be wary of.\nSo, in conclusion, the singleplayer on this game is simply fantastic, featuring great cars, which all feel well programmed and very nice to drive, good graphics (at least, for 2007) and great gameplay. The multiplayer is also well designed, however, some players could be a little less harsh, because, not everyone has 200+ hours on the game.\nOverall, I would reccomend this game. Partictularly when it is on sale.\nWell worth it!","December 31, 2014","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a wide variety of circuits and a very good championship career mode. There are many racing disciplines including: World Touring Car Championship (Official, Extreme & Classic), GT (Pro, Sport   & Club), Swedish Touring Car Championship, Road Cars, Camaro Cup, Radical, Caterham, Formula (F3000, Formula Ford, Formula Masters & Formula 1), and Retro (Max & Cool).\n\nThe handling is ultra realistic and has realistic tyre and fuel depletion, which can be increased. There can be up to 36 cars on track at one time. There is a number of championships and has the ability to make your own chamionships up! The menus are much better and are far easier to navigate than GTR 2's.\n\nOverall Rating: 9/10\nMust buy for any Sim Racing fans","December 27, 2014","true","40.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There. I said it.\n\nI'm not saying that it is the BEST way to get the MOST out of the game but the reviews I'm seeing posted that state the game is only playable with a steering wheel are misleading at best.\n\nThe only thing that will ruin this great game is a lack of patience. And it does require patience! If I flick the thumbstick too much the car spins; if I squeeze the trigger too much while trying to turn the car spins; one wheel off the track and on the grass? Guess what? The car spins!\n\nHowever, after a couple of hours focussing on one car (Mini Cooper) on one track (Brands Hatch) I eventually became accustomed to the physics of the game and began to put in some pretty decent lap times. Then, emboldened, I even started removing some of the driving assists. After more hours I became very comfortable and was putting in consistently quick laps.\n\nNow I've just got to learn how to handle the rest of the cars. And how to race round the rest of the tracks. And I can't wait.\n\nIf you have patience and either a gaming wheel or a gamepad, buy this game - it's all of £2.49! It is so much more rewarding than any other racing game I have played. Also, there is a modding community that is still very active and has done a great job professionally recreating pretty much every circuit ever raced on. So if you fancy taking a Touring Car or a Formula 3000 car for a spin (literally in my case!) around Snetterton, Aintree, Sepang or even the Top Gear test track then this is the game for you.\n","September 4, 2014","true","91.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I fell in love with the multiplayer aspect of the game from day one. I can't explain to you the satisfaction this game has brought to my racing experience. All for cost of nothing but my internet bandwidth which I pay for anyway. Gameplay is great and a lot different from other racing games that really sets this one apart. I usually don't write reviews but I MUST for this title. Race 07 really does a great job simulating its real life counterparts. I have the ability to tune my car the way I want just like I did in Gran Turismo back in the ps1 and ps2 days. I can race online with people on race tracks from around the world right here on my bed. It is essential that you play this with a controller or wheel to get best experience. I am not going to critique heavily on the graphics because for a 2007 release, they are just fine. I actually use sweetFX to enhance my graphics so it really doesn't bother me. I play on a 40 inch led lcd as a computer monitor anyway.  There is a dedicated amount of people that play this daily, but I would like to see more Race 07 population. All in all, I am happy about the hours I have put into this game.","September 1, 2014","true","61.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The base game is very enjoyable a nice number of cars and tracks. And the DLC there is free but the paid is very cheap so that's a plus. The AI can be set to different levels of difficulty, so the game is for new and experienced racers. The cars are great the small Formula BMW the bigger Formula 3000 and the DLC Formula RaceRoom, also there is a mini which is very fun, the caterham csr and the radical sr are 2 very challenging cars which can be a lot of fun if you know how to drive them. And the WTCC cars are very enjoyable the 2006/2007 will give you great moments, in some corners you could be sideways going full throttle and the '87 cars are very interesting.

This means you don't need a steering wheel to be fast.\n\nThe only downside is that community is slowly dying.

That's why it is great. Graphics ain't so fancy, screenshot previews are after-edited. On some DLC's screenshots look like next-gen game, sadly, it ain't.\nWhat it does not do great in way of graphics, SimBin sure does know how to deliver one of the most advanced car simulation mechanisms. The game may seem a little booring and somewhat like that, but the essence of the game comes to life in multiplayer. Don't get mistaken, this is an old and hardcore game, so, multiplayer is practially dead, except some tournament sites, which organise cups for this game. Mostly all servers run some kind of modifications, now, that's another thing to talk about.\nMods for this game - yes, they are. Some of them are very well made. Just search around in google for mod pages, basicaly, if you have modded rFactor, than you will find mods for this game too, at the same page.\nOverall, I like this game and enjoy playing it. The hours seem a little bit low for me, but I have played simbin games since I got my computer. One of the first I owned was GTR, I believe it was first game from SimBin, and it was madness. At that time, the game looked really cool, despite that, my machine was able to run it only on low-medium settings, it still was great. It thought me the simulation aspect of racing games, which I seek in every game, which involves racing in it.\nHope to see this game one day, facelifted.\n8/10","September 21, 2014","true","112.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The online community is quite alive , but its popularity starts to degrade as newer titles come up and. More leagues are organized in AC , rFactor 2 , and the still alive rFactor.\n\nAnyways , Simbin has a tradition in making racing titles and they cannot literally disappoint you concerning the fun you can have , instead they have set high standards so that people always expect more.

It has a wide variety of circuits and a very good championship career mode. There are many racing disciplines including: World Touring Car Championship (Official, Extreme & Classic), GT (Pro, Sport   & Club), Swedish Touring Car Championship, Road Cars, Camaro Cup, Radical, Caterham, Formula (F3000, Formula Ford, Formula Masters & Formula 1), and Retro (Max & Cool).\n\nThe handling is ultra realistic and has realistic tyre and fuel depletion, which can be increased. There can be up to 36 cars on track at one time. There is a number of championships and has the ability to make your own chamionships up! The menus are much better and are far easier to navigate than GTR 2's.\n\nOverall Rating: 9/10\nMust buy for any Sim Racing fans","December 27, 2014","true","40.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not the easiest game to learn, but it is very satisfying when you run a good race.\n\nRaces can be set to either time or laps. Select the class you would like to races, and even download mods or DLC to add even more classes of cars and tracks. Now this game does not have as many mods available as GTR2, but there is still plenty out there to add to your Race 07 experience as well as three DLC packs and a free add track on which is included with this purchase. I race with a mircosoft 360 wireless controler on my PC, and it is still a blast. Have a wheel and it gets even better.\n\nYou can adjust the AI skill to suit your ability, and have an enjoyable race, and don't forget that there are open wheel cars in this game which GTR2 does not include without a mod.\n\nThe price is very reasonable, and most computer can run this pretty well.\n\nIf you like racing games, do not be afraid to give this game a try. You will be doing yourself a diservice.\n\n(Note: My hours played is not a true record, since I owned the game on disc when it came out, and I gifted it to the boys and girls club, and I rebought it on Steam when I started to miss my racing games.)","December 28, 2014","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a long time fan of rFactor, I was intrigued by this game, especially given it's amazing price of £0.47 in the steam christmas sale, this was basically a free game for me, as all the money I used to buy it came from TF2 items and trading cards!\nThe game itself is an accurate and in depth simulation. It has almost all the options of rFactor, and some extras. The graphics are also nicer than rFactor, however, this is to be expected, given that it is a newer game. All the different game modes and cars that are avaliable feel smooth, and drive very well. The game even works well with a pad, although, wheels are obviously the better choice. The only problem I really have with this game is it's multiplayer communtiy, they treat you like s***, if you are new to the game, however, if you play some singleplayer for a few hours beforehand (like I am now doing) then you should be good. This is, however, something to be wary of.\nSo, in conclusion, the singleplayer on this game is simply fantastic, featuring great cars, which all feel well programmed and very nice to drive, good graphics (at least, for 2007) and great gameplay. The multiplayer is also well designed, however, some players could be a little less harsh, because, not everyone has 200+ hours on the game.\nOverall, I would reccomend this game. Partictularly when it is on sale.\nWell worth it!","December 31, 2014","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Level of control is great, adjusting control sensitivity is easy and you can get it exactly where you want it. Difficulty levels are fantastic as the % slider makes it so you can fight on exactly your level. So many racing games have easy, medium hard. In RACE07 if the AI is just slightly too challenging/easy you can make it anywhere from 1% to 100% easier or harder so you can find the precise difficulty you are looking for.\n\nThe game does has a few downsides but these do not stop it from being an excellent racer. The graphics are a bit dated (but certainly not bad) by modern standards, the car selection is a bit limited and for some reason spa francorchamps isnt in the game.

A massive selection of cars and to top it off you are allowed to do some under the hood work as well. So you are your own driver and mechanic. Great tracks, in fact the best tracks in racing games history and various rule sets for each of them. Multiplayer is fun and the community is great with everyone playing in they`re favourite leagues and sometimes diving in others just for a new experience.\n\nAnd this is what each race in this game is: an experience. This feels like the real deal and everyone should give it a try.","December 3, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a lot like GTR Evolution, a car game also on Steam and I presume it's made by the same people. One of the features I was suprised to see is the crowd ambience. The cheering is brilliant and really can push you on to drive well if you let it. One of the features I also love is the Practice feature, this allows you to choose any car and race around a track of your choice, fantastic! I recommend this game to all driving game lovers!
