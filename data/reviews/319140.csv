Scratches that upgrade-based progression itch, but isn't very substantial.\n\nGamefeel is pretty nice, but there's no variable jump height and you can't move while aiming up, which are both annoying.  Difficulty felt just right to me.  Like Super Metroid, exploration is generally fairly easy, with moderate difficulty bumps for boss fights.\n\nWeapon customization feels kinda pointless to me.  Using anything other than the two DPS stats just seems like a waste.  You also have to enter the menu to toggle your super blasty gun, and to swap gun stat presets.  Why not use LB and back/select for these?\n\nExploration is pretty simplistic.  Four small, fairly straightforward planets that you move between via a glorified level select screen.  Keeps up the pace, but really limits the trailblazer feel that makes Metroid so satisfying.\n\nOverall it's fun and well put together, but honestly kinda forgettable.  Grab it on sale and play through it in an afternoon if you're into Metroid.","June 27, 2015","true","3.0"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","33","39","0","0"

Fixed jump height. No. Stop. Wrong. There's no reason to make jump height fixed, especially in a game where you have to aim while jumping. Way too often I was jumping higher than I wanted to be and hitting my intended target was more trouble that it was worth.\n\nThe second is that the game is very linear. You can explore around a bit, but there's always only one specific spot of the game you can go to, regardless of the fact that it starts off with four planets to visit. It gives the illusion of freedom without offering you the slightest bit.\n\nThe third is the boss design. For the one boss. That you fight seven times. Sure, he gets new attacks. That suck. Aww yeah, shield attack that makes him invincible and takes 30ish seconds each time it occurs, great. Oh man, slamming attack that is hard to figure out how to dodge and can take an eternity as well (though he's at least not invincible). Oh good, spawning more enemies that fire 2-damage bullets.\n\nThe fourth is the artificial difficulty. There is exactly one save spot in the game; on your ship. The only other checkpoints are entering/exiting boss rooms. On all but the first planet, there's quite a distance between your ship and any given boss room. And there's very little in the way of healing; there are hidden full heals sparsely scattered around the planets, and enemies that drop health spawn right before the boss room. What this means is that you have to go a fair distance without getting hit more than a few times.\n\nAnd despite that, the game's still easy as heck. I cleared it in a few hours and 100%'ed it only a little while later. Hell, I didn't even go past 5 HP until right before the final boss and didn't really struggle much for it. The "secrets" of the game are all hidden passageways that give no real indication that they exist, and aren't even worth hunting down unless you're going for 100% completion. I couldn't be bothered to prod around the (not even that large) game map to find them all, because what's the point? They're no fun to find, there's no sense of discovery, you just have to poke at everything until you find what you're looking for. I got bored and just looked them up after a while.\n\nI don't think this game is awful, though. It's far better than Mutant Mudds. It's decently enjoyable. But it's nothing special; the only slightly original mechanic is the multiple layers one from Mutant Mudds, and while it's done better here than there it's not that special of a mechanic; swapping between two layers has been done before in many other games, it's just visually displayed as separate layers here. Other than that you have pretty stock powerups; submarine for water travel, dashing and rocket jump, a charge shot, and a short dash that lets you phase through walls, that you only need to use about 5-6 times anyways.\n\nI wasn't impressed. I don't hate this game but I'd say pass unless you're desperate for more vaguely-metroidvania-ish gaming, For an equal or lower pricetag you can get Environmental Station Alpha, Outland, Knytt Underground, and quite a few other better metroidvania-type games.","July 2, 2015","false","4.2"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","30","38","2","0"

I didnt mind so much, but it does take the tention away if you fight him more than once. I was way more prepared for the last fight and won first try. Personally it didnt bother me too much though\n- I think the asking price of 10€ is too much. The game probably took some time to make as it is very well thought out, but its still such a short game, you can get more out of that money on steam with a different game. I got it in a 75% sale and am more than happy that I picked it up.

Navigate mazes, get power-ups to access new areas, fight evil space monsters, and backtracking galore. Xenodrifter straddles the gorge with one foot on the side of neat ideas with the other firmly planted in unnecessary tedium. The major power-up and mechanical theme is lifted from an older title Renagade Kid worked on called Mutant Mudds, where the protagonist can warp from foreground to background to traverse the world. Another major feature is how you can customize the gun- the hero's main form of attack. Want the bullets to weave through the air? There's an upgrade for that. Faster Bullets? Got it. Spray and pray? Right here. You can allocate points to make your gun as “wavy” or “fast” as you like. As you progress through the game, the more of these upgrade points you find and the crazier your custom gun becomes.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is fairly dull. The stages have bleak layouts with no real threats besides the odd off-screen enemy ramming you. The game just has that “autopilot” feel. Jump up ledges, stand still to shoot the bouncing baddy, move on. No real hazards, interesting enemies, or challenging puzzles. The bosses are the same creature with different colors and more attack actions. This visually makes bosses anti-climatic and their patterns obvious.  Oddly, the game feature few checkpoints- only one at the start of the stage and when you face the planet boss. This can lead to some false difficulty and more tedium as you face the same enemies, the same layout, with the same stage all over again from the beginning if you get nixed. Snore.\n\nIf you absolutely enjoy these types of 2D action-adventure games then you've played much better and far worse. Xendrifter is in the middle- it has good bullet points to pique your interest, but nothing engaging to make you stay. If your interested in playing one of these types of games, Xenodrfter is not a good first choice. A nice second just to see what an “everyday” metroid-clone feels like.\n\nA sale, coupon, or bundle item- don't get it full price.","July 25, 2015","false","1.4"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","16","23","2","0"

Take them as you will. I will update this if/when I play some more.\n\nPROS:\n- Bright, colorful artwork that pops\n- Lovely underwater effects (sometime it feels like a tech demo for the effect - it's used a LOT)\n- Cute designs and easy to understand enemies\n- Great tone, mood, atmosphere\n\nCONS:\n\n- SET UP\n- It says "Alt + Enter" to Fullscreen. The first time I used it, the program crashed. Moving right along...\n- No controller support to get through the introduction is a real bummer. Also, there are no prompts telling you what to press to continue. So, I found myself just pressing buttons until something happened. "ESC doesn't seem to do anything. How about Spacebar? No, that didn't work either. How about...Z? Yes, it's Z."\n- Then is says that the A and B buttons have been calibrated, but pressing the A and B buttons do nothing. *sigh* So, I eventually went into configurations and set-up the whole controller myself manually. NOT the best of first impressions.\n\n- GAMEPLAY\n- Four planets to explore, and from what I can gather, there's only one checkpoint right before the boss (By the way, you fight the same boss multiple times in this game).\n- Health does not refill upon death. So, if you make it to the boss with one health bar, if you die during the boss fight and respawn in front the boss door, you still have one health bar. I found this an interesting (not in a good way) design decision because this means that to refill your health, you need to work you way all the way back to your ship - or exit the game to the main menu and try again from a previous save. Why not just spawn back at the ship after a couple attempts at the boss ?(you're going to have to start again from the ship anyway) I guess that would have been too straightforward.\n- There's no variable jump - just one big leap. This makes me feel like I'm less in control of the character.\n\nThat's all for now. Not really recommended at this time. Again, may update in the future.\n\nThanks.\n\n- EDIT -\nUPDATE 01.12.2015\n\n- Alrighty, I just beat the game so I thought that I'd update my thoughts. I have to admit: I was wrong. Xeodrifter is actually a very cool little game, but it didn't give me the best of first impressions. Complete controller support not working 'out of the box' is a major turn-off for me, as well as respawn time taking longer than I would have liked.\n\nRegardless, once I got into the game about an hour and a half, it really picked up. It went from difficult and frustrating to me BLAZING through it. I went from three heart tanks to nine in two hours. During this time the game was progressing so fast I wondered if it could beat the game the same night! So much fun! Discovering that the little enemies outside the boss room can be killed for heart points was an eye opener. I think I was at the fourth boss when I realized that. I was like, "What?! These things drop health? Nothing else in this game drops health." Haha! Love it.\n\nAll in all, a fun little metroidvania game with its share of surprises and challenge. As others have said, you fight the same boss seven times, but the boss adds moves each time, so it doesn't feel *completely* the same. >_< A fun little game that kept me coming back. Kudos to you, Renegade Kid. :)\n\nFinal Score: 7.5/10","December 26, 2014","true","6.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Everything that makes Metroid great is featured in Xeodrifter.\n\nMy Let's Play can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygvew8U9Fyo\n\nShooting, platforming, areas unlock based upon items/power-ups, and an emphasis on exploration.  What Renegade Kid has done is put their spin on it.  Please excuse this quick aside but it should be noted that if you were given a bunch of pixel art styles along a police lineup, It would be very easy to I.D. Renegade Kid's animation.  So, well done for having a unique and recognizable look with so few pixels.  To segue Renegade Kid's previous work in here, if you've played Mutant Mudds or are aware of it's notable feature, the multi-depth parallax platforming works  so amazingly well  in Xeodrifter that using the buzzword synergy is appropriate here.  There were a few times that the background just drifted off in the periphery of my attention, but thanks to brilliant game design, there are enemies or objects moving that punctuates the setting to capture your attention and give you that eureka "Ah-ha!" moment to make you feel like a genius.  There are also times when you just need to be paying attention because there are power-ups idly sitting.\n\nSpeaking of power-ups, Xeodrifter handles weapon upgrades as points to your gun that you can repurpose at will and even create up to three quick-slot configurations to deftly switch in between.  There are a few methods to upgrade your gun.  You can make your bullets larger, shoot faster, do more damage, spread shot or do a sine-wave pattern.  There are certain enemies, like Giant-Eye-Lazer-Death-Cube-Thing that can be dispatched quicker with the sinewave upgrade.  So figuring out what works best in a certain aspect and one that is entirely decided by you, works hand-in-hand with the non-linear exploration of the game.\n\nAlso I didn't mention it yet, but traversing to the four different areas of the game is done via a small little spaceship.  It barely plays any role outside of being a hub, but it's a very nice touch.\n\nOne thing that I find a bit lacking is the boss fights.  So far there is just one boss that is varied each event.  I am conflicted with this because there is enough variety, especially when you consider the parallax battling, and new "tells" that need to be learned to not feel stale.  However, I really wish there were more completely original bosses.  I can understand the amount of time to conceive and implement original bosses is non-trivial, so it is appreciated that the one boss continually finds new ways to make use of all of the power-ups. That is essentially the only negative thing I can say about Xeodrifter.\n\nLastly, the secrets.  Yes there is a grid-based map. And yes, after you've revealed a secret it is indicated on the grid-based map via a special indicator.  There are also a few easter eggs and funnily enough even though I would call Xeodrifter a Metroidlike as opposed to a Metroidvania game, there are early Castlevania Chicken-in-the-wall secrets to be found.\n\nAlso, I didn't know where to fit this so I apologize for that, but even the little details like the bullet particle effects and splashing in the water being dynamic is a great touch.  Love the little details.\n\nIf you like Metroid or Metroidvania games, Xeodrifer is a no-brainer.  You need to buy this.  It will make you happy.  I don't usually hand out guarantees* but in this instance, I guarantee* it.\n\n*guarantee offered is for humor purposes only.  I have no means of offering any sort of guarantee :)","December 11, 2014","true","1.3"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","29","48","0","2"

Unfortunately, it feels shallow to me - like a very fleshed out proof of concept. There is no real substance, you visit one of the four planets - go as far as you can go with your current equipment until you get stuck, then you visit the other planets and do the same. Rinse and repeat until the game is finished.\n\nIt's very bare bones otherwise, you fight the same boss over and over again (it gets gradually stronger and has more attack variety but it is basically the same). Equipment is based around nice ideas (transporting into the background or transforming into a submarine) but doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel. Leveldesign is pretty basic, but despite the small scale, backtracking became annoying fast (you got to get to a teleporter pad, go to your ship, fly to a different planet and teleport onto the planet - super-clunky!)\n\nControls are a bit floaty and imprecise, while the hitdetection is actually quite strict and unforgiving. Also, I am not understanding what the deal with the "customize your gun" feature is, you can find "pips" for your gun (up to 12) and modify various elements of your shot - but that seems awfully ambitious considering the scope of the game - downside to this is that most enemies take way too much hits and make combat a chore so I ended up bypassing enemies most of the time.\n\nWhile the game isn't exactly bad and visually quite pleasing, I didn't find it engaging - Enviromental Station Alpha was much more interesting and varied and would be my recommendation if you want something real pixely that has a bunch of clever designs and interlocking game mechanics. Besides, for slightly more money than what Xeodrifter goes for you could get yourself Shadow Complex or Axiom Verge here on Steam which are most likely more fulfilling experiences than Xeodrifter.","June 4","false","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

The abilities are unique and used to good effect with some inventive environment-traversal tricks. I liked the setup of moving between four different planets instead of having four different areas interconnected on the same planet. The weapon-upgrading system is excellent; being able to experiment with different weapon types by redistributing your upgrade points at any time is a great touch.\n\nThe game has its weak points, but they're more on the order of minor gripes than major flaws. At first I didn't like the way my character jumped (always reaching maximum height instead of varying depending on how hard I pressed), but I got used to it. You fight the same boss character repeatedly, which may be a little tedious, but the fight changes over time, and its recurrence plays a role in the (admittedly thin) story. I really wish I could have cycled through weapons without going to the pause screen; the left and right triggers on my controller were just begging to be used. I also wish I could have used the thumbstick for movement, because the absolute worst part of this game was my 360 controller's d-pad.\n\nXeodrifter doesn't overstay its welcome; my six-hour playtime is quite a bit longer than necessary because I spent some time jumping against every wall I could, trying to find a couple of secret passages that were eluding me. But despite it being a little on the short side, it felt like the right length to me, and made for a nice bite-sized weekend diversion. I have a big soft spot for Metroidvanias in general, so I'm predisposed to giving a thumbs-up here, but I found a lot to like.","May 3","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Xeodrifter hearkens back to the feelings you get playing Metroid, Metroid II, and Super Metroid, borrowing elements from all 3 of those games with many new twists and mechanics of its own.  The art, sound, and music are great, the controls are fluid and responsive.\n\nThe game takes place across 4 planets for you to explore and fight your way through, gathering power-ups along the way.\n\nPower-ups come in two formats: Health/Gun points that increase your total health or allow for customizing your weapon, and progression-based upgrades from bosses that allow you to explore new areas and bypass obstacles.\n\nBosses follow a very Metroid II-esque format, in that each boss builds on the previous one in a mechanical evolution style.\n\nWhile yes, the game is short at around 2.5-3 hours for an experienced gamer, it's an incredibly enjoyable experience.  I personally felt it was well worth it at the full $10 price-point, but for those that are wary I would absolutely pick it up if it's ever on sale, you'd be doing yourself a disservice to pass it by!","December 22, 2014","true","3.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The 5 basic weapon types can have points spent on them to combine their effects in different ways.\n-Dual-layered maps. Jumping from background to foreground to navigate levels is a mechanic I'd love to see more of in 2D sidescrollers.\n-Challenging, but not too difficult.\n\nCons: -Really floaty physics. No control over jump height and character will slide a bit when stopping & turning.\n-Lacks enemy variety. Most of the enemies are the same in each level and all the bosses are the same monster with different colors and newer attacks each time you fight it.  Could have used a bit more variety.\n-Health pickups and checkpoints are extremely rare.  While many might appreciate the challenge because of this, I found that it made parts of the game tedious and repetitive.\n-This game is really short.

The game is quasi-linear in that you can theoretically go to any of the four planets at any time, but you'll run into natural barriers demanding you go elsewhere to get the ability you need. The gun upgrade system is clever in that it lets you put points into any stat that you please so that you can get your preferred mode of fire.\n\nIt's rather challenging in part because the only checkpoints are before boss fights, so you need to be careful while exploring the worlds, as if you die, you can lose a lot of found items. It's hardly impossible, but it feels like it wouldn't be less enjoyable if the checkpoints were more generous.\n\nThe game was clearly built for the 3DS first, as it's got VERY chunky pixels. Not that it's a bad thing or that it looks ugly, it just looks like a handheld game blown up – which it is! You'll need to alt-enter to use fullscreen, and the options for gamepads and the like are only in windowed mode. 360 controllers work, DirectInput controllers should as well through the configuration, but as always, YMMV. I do wish that it was possible to use the triggers to switch weapon layouts, as particularly when fighting bosses I found myself switching weapons tactically.\n\nI certainly enjoyed my time with this, it won't replace Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night in the canon of Metroidvanias, but it compelled me to beat it in short order, and that's worthy of my stamp of approval.","December 13, 2014","true","3.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

That's not a knock on it all, in fact it's kind of refreshing since a lot of "retro" games are simply newer games mechanic and gameplay-wise with that pixelated outer coating masking the fact it's just another modern indie title.\n\nIt isn't anything too difficult, but you'll have to work a little bit if you die a lot because there are very few checkpoints within the worlds themselves, only back on your ship when you leave the planet or before boss fights. It's a decent enough throwback to the more difficult era of NES gaming all considered though.\n\nThe game itself *is* short, but again that's kind of dictated by how many times you die and need to replay portions of a world and how fast you game in general. I've played almost three hours so far and I'm not halfway done because I take my time. In all honesty though, this game would wear thin after the 10 hour mark, as most Metriodvania's usually do, so it's a logical choice to make it shorter. Having purchased this game for a discount on Humble Bundle, I feel it's well worth the price of admission, definitely one of the better and more fun games of this type currently on Steam.","March 13, 2015","true","2.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It just comes down to maximizing damage and then fire rate to increase DPS.\n\nWhat sentiment do I retain from playing this? Slight disappointment, as it is too good a game to be this short.\n\nIf the difficulty would have been extreme then I would understood. Kinda like VVVVVVVV being short and it not bothering me as much. But the game is fairly easy and straight forward. There's no back tracking unless you want to catch some extras and even that is not something that is going to make me go back.\n\nFor less than two euros I guess I could recommend it, but paying more and becoming disappointed of not having enough is just not worth it. As someone else already pointed out in a review. As soon as one is having fun, the game just ends. There is no time nor new environments in which to test the new found abilities for a satisfactory time.\n\nSum up:\n+Graphics: nice and neat old retro pixel art (loved it)\n+Gameplay: Nervous, adaptive, not frustrating, if it's game over there is only oneself to blame, abilities are well thought and fun to use, modular upgrades mechanic is a nice idea\n+Sound effects: great chip tune shooting and enemy sounds\n+/-Music: Good chip tune but not enough variety\n+/-Environments: Some are better than others, too linear though with 4 planets having one or two ability focused design. Maybe one big environment would have made for more backtracking and the metroidvaniaesque feel\n-Enemies: too little different enemies overall, varied ones could have required different upgrade builds, bosses are a joke of code copy pasting and color changing, could have used more creativity\n--Lifetime: too short for a good game, makes us want more\n","May 22, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

There's no other Metroid-like game where your character can turn into a submarine, or can switch between foreground and background layers. The plane shifting allows for great map design that often sneaks secrets right past you in plain sight. Just pay attention you goof!\n\nThe weapons system allows you to spend (and respec) points on different attributes, from rate of fire to power to... inaccuracy? That one's a little weird. You also get to store three different presets to suit whatever playstyle you feel like. Plus you get a charge shot, Mega Man X-style, which can help take out some of the tankier enemies (like that BAT. THAT STUPID BAT, WHY. GO TO HELL, BAT).\n\nIt looks good, the music is great, it's compact and doesn't overstay its welcome, the only downside is that the boss is recycled over and over (but it does gain new attack patterns each time).

I honestly wish I hadn't wasted $10 on this. It tries so hard to be a Metroidvania but fails miserably. There's no point in destroying any enemies unless they're in your way, and some enemies take a ridiculous amount of shots to kill. You get gun upgrades but they really don't help. The gun, by the way, sucks ♥♥♥. It shoots slow, and with each upgrade it increases the distance and speed by a little bit. Whoop-de-freakin' doo. There are special items you get that are actually kind of cool, like a phaser that lets you jump back and forth between the background and foreground. However, you will get lost. Constantly. Every upgrade you get just means more backtracking between the four planets, until you figure out or remember where you're supposed to use the new upgrade. Seriously, I regret buying this.

It's pretty damn good too, but extremely short in under 4 hours to beat.  The game offers hidden weapon upgrades, hidden health upgrades and the power ups you need to get to new areas are only provided from defeated bosses.  Speaking of bosses that's this games only weak point (minus the length of course).  There's only ONE boss throughout the entire game, but you fight this ONE boss 10 times or so.  Everytime you meet up with this guy he just gets a little tougher each time.\n\nOne really GREAT concept is the jumping back and forth between the foreground and the background.  I'm not sure if I've ever did that in a game before.  Either way, it was fun to do and a welcome edition for Metroidvania's that I'm hoping makes it to others games in the genre.\n\nIf you enjoy fun gameplay, a great soundtrack and Metroidvania style gameplay this game is for you.

A quick Snack in between all those other games you may be playing, and more of a break from the highly standardized world of mainstream gaming. The controls are nice, but the lack of creativity with bosses can feel rather dull if you were hoping for more varied fights. The game is tough for how short it is when compared to other metroidvania games. The lack of Save Points force you to become extremely adaptive in many of the situations you'll be put through in this snippet of a game. I will probably play this game again; but the progression is too linear in a sense of how you go from Power Up to place to power up. I was hoping for something more open than to be wardened off each planet that I did not have the prescribed power for. I can recommend this game for people looking for something short and sweet to give to a friend, or play for themselves on those long train rides.","December 23, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The movement upgrades are slight twists on the standard stuff you find in Metroidvania, but they were fun, especially the planar shift, which was definitely cool.\nInteresting map design - backtracking is necessary to get things that you unlock with powerups (this is a Metroidvania after all) and it never really feels boring to do so.  There are a few complex moves you need to pull off to cross some lava areas.\nNice retro asthetic.  The music didn't blow me away, but it was OK.\nBad:\nVERY short - This is basically a 3 hour game, if you 100% it.\nMonster variety is lacking, especially in the boss department.  You'll see what I mean.\nThe difficulty is pretty low.  If you want a serious challenge you probably won't find it.

I don't really care for elaborate reviews, so I'll keep it simple.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n-The soundtrack is awesome. These feel like tunes that would've been stuck in my head from 1991.\n-The weapon upgrade system is neat. It allows you to really tailor your approach.\n-The gameplay. This is pretty solid Metroidvania.\n-Linear difficulty curve. For an afternoon play, I got enough challenging spots without getting frustrated.\n\nTHE NOT-SO-GOOD:\n-The weapon upgrade system. 3 of your 5 upgrades are worthless. Faster projectiles, maybe. But the angled shots? Why bother. Wave shot was helpful for exactly 1 enemy in the game.\n-Storyline. There isn't one.\n-The backtracking. Metroidvania-style games are notorious for this. However, the upgrades you get are used in every single level. So it's essentially trial-and-error to find the level that you can progress the furthest in with the set of upgrades you have.\n-The same creature is used for every single boss fight. Enemies are recycled in every single level.\n-The levels look different, but ultimately play out exactly the same.\n-The game is very short. I registered 4.9 hours, and that's only because I spent a good chunk of that making dinner and watching TV with my girlfriend.\n-A lot of wasted potential.","August 16, 2015","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game runs smoothly and doesn't waste any time holding your hand, it just lets you get on with it.\n\nThe controls are very satisfying once you've unlocked the full moveset and mastered them and the world is gated in a quite satisfying manner, as the abilities you obtain allow you to over come the various obstacles of the geography in an organic way. Non of the usual ice-beam unlocks white doors, super missile unlocks green, gamey approach here.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the game is quite short, I have 6.5 hours logged and have completed the game with every achievement unlocked. The first 6 hours were spent on the initial play through and locating all the unpgrades, with the rest spent on a speed run.\n\nIf you're not sure $10/£7 is good enough value for 6+ hours of gameplay then wait for a sale; the game received a 75% discount during the 2015 Steam Summer Sale, so will probably be heavily discounted in the future.","November 21, 2015","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It did a good job of bringing back what I love about some of my favorite NES and SNES games.\n\nWhile being classified as a "Metroidvania" game, its redundant to say that it plays similar to Metroid, however there are also art and musical similarities to both Metriod and Super Metriod.\n\nEven many of the abilities obtained are similar to Super Metriod, though don't operate the same way.\nThe Phase ability was really neat, it really fit the game well and it probably the best implementation of a changing active layers feature/skill/gimmick that I have seen in a game.\n\nWhile similar to Metriod, I feel like there are also ties back to Blaster Master on the NES as well, starting with the main character himself and the way he moves/shoots, as well as the gun upgrades and functionality.\n\nThe game starts out pretty difficult as you have little health, and no abilities or upgrades.\nYou can also pick any of the 4 planets to start exploring, however you'll notice that some of those planets you will not be able to explore much until you have the right item/ability to progress, also some of the enemies on those planets are far stronger than you are at the start of the game.\n\nThis game has no hand holding at all, which is nice as I've always been the type of person who liked to explore and figure things out on my own.  The only thing that this game is is forgiving about, is giving you a check point before a boss fight, and having infinite lives.  Dying before a checkpoint however will send you back off the planet onto your ship, and you will have lost any progress you might have made.\n\nI played just over 7 hours of this game and obtained all the upgrades, map progress and finished the game.  While the game can be completed in much less time (less than 1 hour for speed run achievement), if it is your first time playing the game, it will good for several hours at least, assuming you are working for full completion.\n\nIf I had to pick anything to complain about with this game it would be that some of the gun upgrades categories feel fairly useless.  While you can put points into different catergories which change how your gun fires, I only found 2 of them to be of any use to me.  Since you only have enough points to max out 2 of the 5 categories, the other 3 were completely ignored.  Which made having an option to save upto 3 different weapon setups to quickly swap between also a bit useless.\n\n\nAside from that the game was really a lot of fun, the engine ran silky smooth, the visuals were just how I like my pixel style games to look, the music was fantastic and there were pleanty of abilities and hidden items.\n\nThe game's video does a good job of showing you what this game is all about, so if you like the video, then you'll probably love the game.","December 9, 2015","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game incorporates nostalgic Metroid art and gameplay, where you need to backtrack to access area previously blocked due to the requirement of a certain ability, weapons upgrades, bosses, hidden items, maps, puzzles, almost everything from Metroid is there!\nThe game is quite short (2-4hrs), but very fun while it lasts. The major problem I initially had with this game is that there are almost no save points, the only save point is your ship, and you can visit 4 different areas from your ship. The areas themselves are quite small, so if you run recklessly you will certainly die, since the game is a bit more difficult tham Metroid, and does not provide health pickups to restore your health (except for some secret ones), unlike in most Metroid-like games where you get health back from killing creatures.\n\nHighly recommended!","December 12, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A quick Snack in between all those other games you may be playing, and more of a break from the highly standardized world of mainstream gaming. The controls are nice, but the lack of creativity with bosses can feel rather dull if you were hoping for more varied fights. The game is tough for how short it is when compared to other metroidvania games. The lack of Save Points force you to become extremely adaptive in many of the situations you'll be put through in this snippet of a game. I will probably play this game again; but the progression is too linear in a sense of how you go from Power Up to place to power up. I was hoping for something more open than to be wardened off each planet that I did not have the prescribed power for. I can recommend this game for people looking for something short and sweet to give to a friend, or play for themselves on those long train rides.","December 23, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Mainly because it is a short game. That being said it does deliver a pretty good experience.\nGraphically there's not much to comment on, the game looks nice for the style they were going for. It runs smoothly and I haven't encountered any glitches. As the game is on the short side, the backtracking isn't that challenging. This, depending on your perspective, being both positive and negative. Positive for those who don't like the tedium of travelling back and forth the same segment of the game over and over, negative for those who like the challenge of finding that exact spot where a new power-up will allow you to venture further.\nThe boss fights are quite ok, even though not very varied.\n\nGood:\nGraphics (it's not the Witcher 3, but for what it is, the game looks good)\nDecent amount of enemy variation\n\nNeutral:\nSmall (if you, like me, know this beforehand it's not an issue)\nMusic is so-so\n\nLess good / bad:\nThe bosses and boss fights are not very inspired","January 6","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a certain charm to having such tiny graphics though. The sound/music seem to fit nicely as well.\nThe one thing I wasn't a fan of is the movement. It feels deliberately soft with the slight acceleration/deceleration, and for a game with such small graphics it could have done without that feature. Of course, that's just my opinion!\n\nIt's my understanding that Renegade Kid made this game in something like 5 months, and with that in mind, I think it's a really good accomplishment!

Let's make a quick list for you.\n\nGood:\n- Gun upgrades - They are kind of ambiguous, but it actually forces you to try out the different combos of how you can create your gun and allows you to choose really different build paths. Pretty cool feature!\n- Fun skills - You pick up skills as you progress through the game that not only help you through levels, but help you do them quicker and more efficiently. You can also manipulate them creatively to take on bosses!\n- Secret rooms - If you're anything like me, you'll love finding the secret rooms in here. The first secret room I stumbled upon was completely by accident jump-running into a wall. See what you can find!\n- Level builds (also see "not so good") - The level builds are creative and once you start earning your upgrades, you're going to really appreciate the way they are constructed. There aren't many levels, but you'll be able to revisit them with your upgrades to explore even more!\n- Achievements - GET THEM!\n\nNot So Good:\n- Short game - I don't have much time down on this game and once it was done, I found myself hoping there was more, like maybe some extra content once it's beaten.\n- Level builds - Some of the levels builds are pretty in-depth, which is pretty awesome while you're exploring, but when going back to look for secret rooms or upgrades, some of the levels can be really long and it takes a long time to get back to the spot where you would find the secret/upgrade. I found myself sort of annoyed that I had to go through that level and run all the way back just for 1 item. Having said that, it's not a terrible feature, just "not so good."\n- Boss algorithms don't change much - [Minor Spoiler]The bosses are pretty much the same boss, but a different color, which doesn't create a ton of variety. They do, however, (after this first boss) add on to the previous boss' repertoir, so while the algorithms do change a bit, there is a bit of familiararity of skills. I could be a cool feature, but by the end of the game, it wasn't hard to take down the last boss becase you pretty much know what he is going to use the whole time. Though I wouldn't say that it necessarily takes away from the boss fights being fun.\n\nOverall, 8/10. Wish there was more, but I was engaged and excited every time I was playing this game. The devs definitely get props for this one. They made this game so refreshing and fun.","May 29, 2015","true","4.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's well-polished and easy to get into, with solid platforming controls and pretty smooth presentation for a pixel-art game.\n\nCons: The game's biggest flaw is that it's ultimately fairly shallow.  I finished the whole thing, including finding nearly all of the optional power-ups, in under 4 hours.  There aren't that many enemy types, and you'll see the same basic behaviors over and over as you traverse the game world.  Worst of all, the boss fights are incredibly repetetive; every new boss is a palette-swapped minor enhancement on the last, right up through the end of the game.\n\nOverall, this game provides a decent if repetetive few hours' of amusement.

Espescially the feature to switch between foreground and background is awesome. Great level design. Great pixel art. Cool music. Very fun and rewarding.\n\nNot so good: Fullscreen mode does not work when having high DPI mode enabled in Windows. You only see the upper left part of the actual game. There is only one boss enemy that you have to beat 7 times. It does have some new tricks every time, but it is still the same sprite every time, just a different color. A little more variety would have been nice. Some overpowered enemies (the pink fly).\n\nBad: No save points, only check points before and after each boss fight. Because of that, you will have to repeat some sections very often because you cannot save and the enemies do not drop any health pickups. There are some hidden health stashes, but those a pretty rare and most of the time not in the place where you would need them. This is what bothered me most. I don't like repetitions, even if it was state of the art back in the 8-Bit days.

The gameplay is challenging but still fun at the same time. Sometimes it can be tough to figure out what to do next if you don't remember to backtrack to previously explored planets to use your newfound powerups, but that's half the fun. The bosses while visually similar keep employing new tactics to keep you on your toes and you will have to use most (if not all) of your powerups to succeed. It's a relatively short game, but well worth the $9.99 in my opinion.  It took me about 4 hours to finish and I missed two health upgrades, which I have no idea where they could be. There are several hidden areas in the game as well, so maybe they were hidden somewhere. If you figure an average movie runs you $20+ at a theater and you might get 2 hours out of it, you're getting double your value out of Xeodrifter for half the price. If you like Metroid style games, you'll like Xeodrifter.","April 11, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marccookie/recommended/319140/","marccookie","Revenant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marccookie/","499 products in account","Xeodrifter is a short but sweet Metroid-like game where the player must explore 4 unique planets to find new abilities and a number of power-ups in order to find their way home. Taking a page out of Metroid Fusion the map is separated into 4 different sections with a hub (the players ship) rather than the Super Metroid approach of a single interconnected world. Each of these levels has a number of routes which can be opened with new abilities and contain power-ups to give the player an easier time.\n\nXeodrifter controls rather well but does suffer from a slightly floaty feel in regards to the movement. Having only used an Xbox controller I found it intuitive but would probably advise against using a keyboard.\n\nOne of the power-ups the player can find is a Gun Mod. Each of these is a single point which can be used to customize the way your weapon functions. By mixing and matching these point (which can be refunded and re-added at any point) you will be able to increase the damage, firing rate and spread or even make the bullets fire in a sine wave. You can also save 3 varieties of firing modes for quick use in the future.\n\nThe planets are filled with a wide array of beasts which will try and impede your progress, many of which have attack patterns players which have experienced a Metroid game will recognize. All of them have different ways of hindering the player and there was rarely a time I found myself annoyed at their placement in the world.\n\nThe downside to this game is of course its length, you can probably beat this game in well under 3 hours. There is also only a single boss to battle. However each time you fight it there is a new move or 2 added to its library, making it slightly more difficult. Another variety of boss or two would have helped keep it fresh though.\nA final complaint is the construction of the fourth world. While all of the others have a few branching or looping paths this one is almost entirely linear. This planet just doesn't seem to have had the same attention put into its creation which is a bit of a shame.\n\nOverall anyone who is a fan of Metroid-like platform games should definitely check this one out and not be put off by the short playtime provided. Xeodrifter, while short, does not overstay its welcome and the abilities you collect from the bosses make revisiting old locations for new gear a joy.","April 26, 2015","true","3.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I also found the equipment system (or however you'd like to address it) very interesting and appreciated that I was able to customize certain aspects of how my character shot bullets at enemies.\n\nAs a warning, Xeodrifter only takes 2-3 hours to complete, so if you will feel shafted buying it for 10$ (or your regional equivalent) I would recommend getting it on sale.

I may just be naturally awful, but I kept wanting to do smaller hops by pressing the jump button quickly, only to fling myself face first into bullets, roofs and enemies. When struck by the aformentioned bullets and enemies I found myself flung back just enough to get hit again the second the invulnerability and stun wear off.\n\nI found myself dying quite often and felt cheated too many times.

After watching the trailer for Xeodrifter, I was hoping to play a well-crafted action adventure game that hearkened back to the days of Metroid and Blaster Master. I'm happy to say that is exactly what I got.\n\nThe premise of Xeodrifter is incredibly simple: your ship needs a new warp core and unless you want to be left stranded out in the depths of space forever, your only option is to explore four nearby planets and seach for a new core. As you explore each planet, you'll slowly uncover a plethora of health and weapon upgrades, as well as new abilties to help you on your way (rocket jump, submarine, etc.) There is no text in the game and that's okay: it helps immerse the player in the atmosphere of the game.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay pulls through and makes Xeodrifter a fun play. While the controls are slightly floaty, the game moves at a nice pace. You have a selection of upgrades to choose from in upgrading your energy shot which allows for a little customization. As you uncover more and more upgrades, the difficulty of the game slowly ramps along with your progression. This, and the integration of your new abilties, keeps Xeodrifter from becoming boring or repetitive; as the game is only a few short hours, it doesn't bog itself down or drag itself out.\n\nSo. The graphics are colorful, the music is fantastic, and it plays great. It covers all the bases well. Buy it. If you're fan of classic Metroid action/exploration, you owe it to yourself to get this.","April 27","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though perhaps unintentional, Xeodrifter seems to ride too hard on the "upgrade hunt" aspect of the game, because the package as a whole feels terribly monotonous. It starts slow, briefly shows a flash or two of brilliance, but quickly settles into running you in circles.\n\nFirst and perhaps most notably, combat is incredibly boring outside of boss fights. Enemies have static patterns they rarely deviate from. One moves back and forward in a straight line, another stays in place firing bullets in four directions, etc. The problem here is that most enemies rarely play "aggressor;" they don't change their bullet trajectories, they don't chase... they just carry on with their patterns indefinitely until you take them out. In fact, you could probably avoid and ignore half (if not more) of the enemies in the game and be just fine.\n\nAs a result, level traversal is a chore: move a little, defeat a bullet sponge, continue. It gets old fast. Further exasperating the issue are quirks like no variable jump height and the inability to aim up while walking. This can make taking down enemiess even more tedious. On top of all that, defeated foes don't give health drops (or at least not any that I've seen,) meaning you won't see many of them. Checkpoints are also infrequent. Admittedly, I can see where some people would consider this gauntlet-style trek a challenge worth accepting; however, with combat fairly unengaging and more of a literal roadblock than an actual fight, who wants to repeat it two or three times?\n\nThe end result is that the exploration the game is supposedly banking on ultimately falls flat. Especially early, it can be a constant stop-and-go firefight where impatiently trying to increase your pace can easily lead to accidental damage.\n\nNow, I did say that there were flashes of good. The weapon customization system is neat, and a welcome one at that. I was quite happy to beef up my gun for quicker takedowns and I particularly liked the "sine-wave" upgrade. Also, despite sharing some already mentioned repetition issues, the boss fights are decent enough. They are probably where some of the powerups see their best utilization, especially the plane shifting upgrade. True, bosses can be spongy and predictable like the grunts, but not even close to the same extent.\n\nBut its unfortunate to me that these pluses more or less made the game more bearable, not took it from good to great. As the game progresses and more upgrades become available, things still failed to pick up significantly. If that wasn't bad enough, the game is fairly bad at pushing you towards where you should go next. This wouldn't be so bad if not for the above AND later on it often seems to put "gates" too close to each other. There is literally one spot in the game where its practically four or five gates one right after the other, each representing the next powerup you should obtain. Why? What's the point? It gives this false sense of discovery when you can finally open that "locked door," only to find another one directly after it with almost no iterim material or reward. I feel the game misses some opportunities to reward that easy-going, poking around that usually comes with the territory.\n\nI stuck with it for awhile, but I'm just not enjoying it that much. I still kinda want to do due diligence and finish it (I hear its short,) but even so. Bottom line: it flatlined for me almost immediately and never made a full recovery. Quite a shame, as part of me really feels a great opportunity just didn't materialize properly.","May 21","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I stand by my complaint, but I feel I can give it a bit more direction.\n\nThe downsides:\n* The jump height is fixed. No feathering to shoot the badies. This is a gross oversight and not in line with classic NES style.\n* Slop in the controls. Not much, but enough to be frustrating. Platforming will just make you angry at the start.\n* The very first boss is absolutley unforgiving. They are all hard, but the first one is so outright unfair that it led to my initial bad review.\n* Boss methods are sometimes unclear, leaving you to do random things until something inexplicably changes. Good luck surviving through this. Thankfully, most of the boss behavior is random so he may not even do it next round.\n* The character's power is quadratic. As you gain more Health and more Gun, you quickly find the challenge taper off.\n* Some enemies are tedious to kill, not actually hard. There will be a pattern to learn, but do I really need to do it ten times to kill one thing?\n\nThe upsides:\n* Challenging, but doable. Bosses require reflexes and patience. It's a difficult mix to master.\n* Graphics are fantastic. It feels like the love child of my NES favorites Blaster Master and Metroid.\n* Music is great. (I'm biased, there's a nod to David Bowie on the soundtrack. Instant win.)\n\nSo with more negative points than positive ones, why am I changing this to recommend? Firstly, because there is no neutral, which is what I really feel it should be. This game is not for everyone, chiefly because the challenge is just too high at the start. With limited space to explore until you down that first boss, the gameplay value becomes about 5 minutes if you cannot proceed.\n\nA couple of things that would fix it:\n* Feathering. Many enemies need a mini-jump to line up the shot. Let us control our jumps. This actually matters.\n* Difficulty setting. A novice mode in which the bosses movements aren't quite so quick. Also opens the door for hard (bosses have twice the HP) and nightmare (bosses have twice the HP and faster reaction times). Think about it.\n\nIn the end, I am recommending the game. It's just a weak recommendation, with the caveat that if you are really easily frustrated, you might want to sit this one out (at least until it has a difficulty option).","May 19","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Scratches that upgrade-based progression itch, but isn't very substantial.\n\nGamefeel is pretty nice, but there's no variable jump height and you can't move while aiming up, which are both annoying.  Difficulty felt just right to me.  Like Super Metroid, exploration is generally fairly easy, with moderate difficulty bumps for boss fights.\n\nWeapon customization feels kinda pointless to me.  Using anything other than the two DPS stats just seems like a waste.  You also have to enter the menu to toggle your super blasty gun, and to swap gun stat presets.  Why not use LB and back/select for these?\n\nExploration is pretty simplistic.  Four small, fairly straightforward planets that you move between via a glorified level select screen.  Keeps up the pace, but really limits the trailblazer feel that makes Metroid so satisfying.\n\nOverall it's fun and well put together, but honestly kinda forgettable.

Fixed jump height. No. Stop. Wrong. There's no reason to make jump height fixed, especially in a game where you have to aim while jumping. Way too often I was jumping higher than I wanted to be and hitting my intended target was more trouble that it was worth.\n\nThe second is that the game is very linear. You can explore around a bit, but there's always only one specific spot of the game you can go to, regardless of the fact that it starts off with four planets to visit. It gives the illusion of freedom without offering you the slightest bit.\n\nThe third is the boss design. For the one boss. That you fight seven times. Sure, he gets new attacks. That suck. Aww yeah, shield attack that makes him invincible and takes 30ish seconds each time it occurs, great. Oh man, slamming attack that is hard to figure out how to dodge and can take an eternity as well (though he's at least not invincible). Oh good, spawning more enemies that fire 2-damage bullets.\n\nThe fourth is the artificial difficulty. There is exactly one save spot in the game; on your ship. The only other checkpoints are entering/exiting boss rooms. On all but the first planet, there's quite a distance between your ship and any given boss room. And there's very little in the way of healing; there are hidden full heals sparsely scattered around the planets, and enemies that drop health spawn right before the boss room. What this means is that you have to go a fair distance without getting hit more than a few times.\n\nAnd despite that, the game's still easy as heck. I cleared it in a few hours and 100%'ed it only a little while later. Hell, I didn't even go past 5 HP until right before the final boss and didn't really struggle much for it. The "secrets" of the game are all hidden passageways that give no real indication that they exist, and aren't even worth hunting down unless you're going for 100% completion. I couldn't be bothered to prod around the (not even that large) game map to find them all, because what's the point? They're no fun to find, there's no sense of discovery, you just have to poke at everything until you find what you're looking for. I got bored and just looked them up after a while.\n\nI don't think this game is awful, though. It's far better than Mutant Mudds. It's decently enjoyable. But it's nothing special; the only slightly original mechanic is the multiple layers one from Mutant Mudds, and while it's done better here than there it's not that special of a mechanic; swapping between two layers has been done before in many other games, it's just visually displayed as separate layers here. Other than that you have pretty stock powerups; submarine for water travel, dashing and rocket jump, a charge shot, and a short dash that lets you phase through walls, that you only need to use about 5-6 times anyways.\n\nI wasn't impressed. I don't hate this game but I'd say pass unless you're desperate for more vaguely-metroidvania-ish gaming, For an equal or lower pricetag you can get Environmental Station Alpha, Outland, Knytt Underground, and quite a few other better metroidvania-type games.","July 2, 2015","false","4.2"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","30","38","2","0"

Navigate mazes, get power-ups to access new areas, fight evil space monsters, and backtracking galore. Xenodrifter straddles the gorge with one foot on the side of neat ideas with the other firmly planted in unnecessary tedium. The major power-up and mechanical theme is lifted from an older title Renagade Kid worked on called Mutant Mudds, where the protagonist can warp from foreground to background to traverse the world. Another major feature is how you can customize the gun- the hero's main form of attack. Want the bullets to weave through the air? There's an upgrade for that. Faster Bullets? Got it. Spray and pray? Right here. You can allocate points to make your gun as “wavy” or “fast” as you like. As you progress through the game, the more of these upgrade points you find and the crazier your custom gun becomes.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is fairly dull. The stages have bleak layouts with no real threats besides the odd off-screen enemy ramming you. The game just has that “autopilot” feel. Jump up ledges, stand still to shoot the bouncing baddy, move on. No real hazards, interesting enemies, or challenging puzzles. The bosses are the same creature with different colors and more attack actions. This visually makes bosses anti-climatic and their patterns obvious.  Oddly, the game feature few checkpoints- only one at the start of the stage and when you face the planet boss. This can lead to some false difficulty and more tedium as you face the same enemies, the same layout, with the same stage all over again from the beginning if you get nixed. Snore.\n\nIf you absolutely enjoy these types of 2D action-adventure games then you've played much better and far worse. Xendrifter is in the middle- it has good bullet points to pique your interest, but nothing engaging to make you stay. If your interested in playing one of these types of games, Xenodrfter is not a good first choice. A nice second just to see what an “everyday” metroid-clone feels like.\n\nA sale, coupon, or bundle item- don't get it full price.","July 25, 2015","false","1.4"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","16","23","2","0"

Take them as you will. I will update this if/when I play some more.\n\nPROS:\n- Bright, colorful artwork that pops\n- Lovely underwater effects (sometime it feels like a tech demo for the effect - it's used a LOT)\n- Cute designs and easy to understand enemies\n- Great tone, mood, atmosphere\n\nCONS:\n\n- SET UP\n- It says "Alt + Enter" to Fullscreen. The first time I used it, the program crashed. Moving right along...\n- No controller support to get through the introduction is a real bummer. Also, there are no prompts telling you what to press to continue. So, I found myself just pressing buttons until something happened. "ESC doesn't seem to do anything. How about Spacebar? No, that didn't work either. How about...Z? Yes, it's Z."\n- Then is says that the A and B buttons have been calibrated, but pressing the A and B buttons do nothing. *sigh* So, I eventually went into configurations and set-up the whole controller myself manually. NOT the best of first impressions.\n\n- GAMEPLAY\n- Four planets to explore, and from what I can gather, there's only one checkpoint right before the boss (By the way, you fight the same boss multiple times in this game).\n- Health does not refill upon death. So, if you make it to the boss with one health bar, if you die during the boss fight and respawn in front the boss door, you still have one health bar. I found this an interesting (not in a good way) design decision because this means that to refill your health, you need to work you way all the way back to your ship - or exit the game to the main menu and try again from a previous save. Why not just spawn back at the ship after a couple attempts at the boss ?(you're going to have to start again from the ship anyway) I guess that would have been too straightforward.\n- There's no variable jump - just one big leap. This makes me feel like I'm less in control of the character.\n\nThat's all for now. Not really recommended at this time. Again, may update in the future.\n\nThanks.\n\n- EDIT -\nUPDATE 01.12.2015\n\n- Alrighty, I just beat the game so I thought that I'd update my thoughts. I have to admit: I was wrong. Xeodrifter is actually a very cool little game, but it didn't give me the best of first impressions. Complete controller support not working 'out of the box' is a major turn-off for me, as well as respawn time taking longer than I would have liked.\n\nRegardless, once I got into the game about an hour and a half, it really picked up. It went from difficult and frustrating to me BLAZING through it. I went from three heart tanks to nine in two hours. During this time the game was progressing so fast I wondered if it could beat the game the same night! So much fun! Discovering that the little enemies outside the boss room can be killed for heart points was an eye opener. I think I was at the fourth boss when I realized that. I was like, "What?! These things drop health? Nothing else in this game drops health." Haha! Love it.\n\nAll in all, a fun little metroidvania game with its share of surprises and challenge. As others have said, you fight the same boss seven times, but the boss adds moves each time, so it doesn't feel *completely* the same. >_< A fun little game that kept me coming back. Kudos to you, Renegade Kid. :)\n\nFinal Score: 7.5/10","December 26, 2014","true","6.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Everything that makes Metroid great is featured in Xeodrifter.\n\nMy Let's Play can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygvew8U9Fyo\n\nShooting, platforming, areas unlock based upon items/power-ups, and an emphasis on exploration.  What Renegade Kid has done is put their spin on it.  Please excuse this quick aside but it should be noted that if you were given a bunch of pixel art styles along a police lineup, It would be very easy to I.D. Renegade Kid's animation.  So, well done for having a unique and recognizable look with so few pixels.  To segue Renegade Kid's previous work in here, if you've played Mutant Mudds or are aware of it's notable feature, the multi-depth parallax platforming works  so amazingly well  in Xeodrifter that using the buzzword synergy is appropriate here.  There were a few times that the background just drifted off in the periphery of my attention, but thanks to brilliant game design, there are enemies or objects moving that punctuates the setting to capture your attention and give you that eureka "Ah-ha!" moment to make you feel like a genius.  There are also times when you just need to be paying attention because there are power-ups idly sitting.\n\nSpeaking of power-ups, Xeodrifter handles weapon upgrades as points to your gun that you can repurpose at will and even create up to three quick-slot configurations to deftly switch in between.  There are a few methods to upgrade your gun.  You can make your bullets larger, shoot faster, do more damage, spread shot or do a sine-wave pattern.  There are certain enemies, like Giant-Eye-Lazer-Death-Cube-Thing that can be dispatched quicker with the sinewave upgrade.  So figuring out what works best in a certain aspect and one that is entirely decided by you, works hand-in-hand with the non-linear exploration of the game.\n\nAlso I didn't mention it yet, but traversing to the four different areas of the game is done via a small little spaceship.  It barely plays any role outside of being a hub, but it's a very nice touch.\n\nOne thing that I find a bit lacking is the boss fights.  So far there is just one boss that is varied each event.  I am conflicted with this because there is enough variety, especially when you consider the parallax battling, and new "tells" that need to be learned to not feel stale.  However, I really wish there were more completely original bosses.  I can understand the amount of time to conceive and implement original bosses is non-trivial, so it is appreciated that the one boss continually finds new ways to make use of all of the power-ups. That is essentially the only negative thing I can say about Xeodrifter.\n\nLastly, the secrets.  Yes there is a grid-based map. And yes, after you've revealed a secret it is indicated on the grid-based map via a special indicator.  There are also a few easter eggs and funnily enough even though I would call Xeodrifter a Metroidlike as opposed to a Metroidvania game, there are early Castlevania Chicken-in-the-wall secrets to be found.\n\nAlso, I didn't know where to fit this so I apologize for that, but even the little details like the bullet particle effects and splashing in the water being dynamic is a great touch.  Love the little details.\n\nIf you like Metroid or Metroidvania games, Xeodrifer is a no-brainer.  You need to buy this.  It will make you happy.  I don't usually hand out guarantees* but in this instance, I guarantee* it.\n\n*guarantee offered is for humor purposes only.  I have no means of offering any sort of guarantee :)","December 11, 2014","true","1.3"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","29","48","0","2"

Unfortunately, it feels shallow to me - like a very fleshed out proof of concept. There is no real substance, you visit one of the four planets - go as far as you can go with your current equipment until you get stuck, then you visit the other planets and do the same. Rinse and repeat until the game is finished.\n\nIt's very bare bones otherwise, you fight the same boss over and over again (it gets gradually stronger and has more attack variety but it is basically the same). Equipment is based around nice ideas (transporting into the background or transforming into a submarine) but doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel. Leveldesign is pretty basic, but despite the small scale, backtracking became annoying fast (you got to get to a teleporter pad, go to your ship, fly to a different planet and teleport onto the planet - super-clunky!)\n\nControls are a bit floaty and imprecise, while the hitdetection is actually quite strict and unforgiving. Also, I am not understanding what the deal with the "customize your gun" feature is, you can find "pips" for your gun (up to 12) and modify various elements of your shot - but that seems awfully ambitious considering the scope of the game - downside to this is that most enemies take way too much hits and make combat a chore so I ended up bypassing enemies most of the time.\n\nWhile the game isn't exactly bad and visually quite pleasing, I didn't find it engaging - Enviromental Station Alpha was much more interesting and varied and would be my recommendation if you want something real pixely that has a bunch of clever designs and interlocking game mechanics. Besides, for slightly more money than what Xeodrifter goes for you could get yourself Shadow Complex or Axiom Verge here on Steam which are most likely more fulfilling experiences than Xeodrifter.","June 4","false","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

The abilities are unique and used to good effect with some inventive environment-traversal tricks. I liked the setup of moving between four different planets instead of having four different areas interconnected on the same planet. The weapon-upgrading system is excellent; being able to experiment with different weapon types by redistributing your upgrade points at any time is a great touch.\n\nThe game has its weak points, but they're more on the order of minor gripes than major flaws. At first I didn't like the way my character jumped (always reaching maximum height instead of varying depending on how hard I pressed), but I got used to it. You fight the same boss character repeatedly, which may be a little tedious, but the fight changes over time, and its recurrence plays a role in the (admittedly thin) story. I really wish I could have cycled through weapons without going to the pause screen; the left and right triggers on my controller were just begging to be used. I also wish I could have used the thumbstick for movement, because the absolute worst part of this game was my 360 controller's d-pad.\n\nXeodrifter doesn't overstay its welcome; my six-hour playtime is quite a bit longer than necessary because I spent some time jumping against every wall I could, trying to find a couple of secret passages that were eluding me. But despite it being a little on the short side, it felt like the right length to me, and made for a nice bite-sized weekend diversion. I have a big soft spot for Metroidvanias in general, so I'm predisposed to giving a thumbs-up here, but I found a lot to like.","May 3","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Xeodrifter hearkens back to the feelings you get playing Metroid, Metroid II, and Super Metroid, borrowing elements from all 3 of those games with many new twists and mechanics of its own.  The art, sound, and music are great, the controls are fluid and responsive.\n\nThe game takes place across 4 planets for you to explore and fight your way through, gathering power-ups along the way.\n\nPower-ups come in two formats: Health/Gun points that increase your total health or allow for customizing your weapon, and progression-based upgrades from bosses that allow you to explore new areas and bypass obstacles.\n\nBosses follow a very Metroid II-esque format, in that each boss builds on the previous one in a mechanical evolution style.\n\nWhile yes, the game is short at around 2.5-3 hours for an experienced gamer, it's an incredibly enjoyable experience.  I personally felt it was well worth it at the full $10 price-point, but for those that are wary I would absolutely pick it up if it's ever on sale, you'd be doing yourself a disservice to pass it by!","December 22, 2014","true","3.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The 5 basic weapon types can have points spent on them to combine their effects in different ways.\n-Dual-layered maps. Jumping from background to foreground to navigate levels is a mechanic I'd love to see more of in 2D sidescrollers.\n-Challenging, but not too difficult.\n\nCons: -Really floaty physics. No control over jump height and character will slide a bit when stopping & turning.\n-Lacks enemy variety. Most of the enemies are the same in each level and all the bosses are the same monster with different colors and newer attacks each time you fight it.  Could have used a bit more variety.\n-Health pickups and checkpoints are extremely rare.  While many might appreciate the challenge because of this, I found that it made parts of the game tedious and repetitive.\n-This game is really short.

The game is quasi-linear in that you can theoretically go to any of the four planets at any time, but you'll run into natural barriers demanding you go elsewhere to get the ability you need. The gun upgrade system is clever in that it lets you put points into any stat that you please so that you can get your preferred mode of fire.\n\nIt's rather challenging in part because the only checkpoints are before boss fights, so you need to be careful while exploring the worlds, as if you die, you can lose a lot of found items. It's hardly impossible, but it feels like it wouldn't be less enjoyable if the checkpoints were more generous.\n\nThe game was clearly built for the 3DS first, as it's got VERY chunky pixels. Not that it's a bad thing or that it looks ugly, it just looks like a handheld game blown up – which it is! You'll need to alt-enter to use fullscreen, and the options for gamepads and the like are only in windowed mode. 360 controllers work, DirectInput controllers should as well through the configuration, but as always, YMMV. I do wish that it was possible to use the triggers to switch weapon layouts, as particularly when fighting bosses I found myself switching weapons tactically.\n\nI certainly enjoyed my time with this, it won't replace Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night in the canon of Metroidvanias, but it compelled me to beat it in short order, and that's worthy of my stamp of approval.","December 13, 2014","true","3.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

That's not a knock on it all, in fact it's kind of refreshing since a lot of "retro" games are simply newer games mechanic and gameplay-wise with that pixelated outer coating masking the fact it's just another modern indie title.\n\nIt isn't anything too difficult, but you'll have to work a little bit if you die a lot because there are very few checkpoints within the worlds themselves, only back on your ship when you leave the planet or before boss fights. It's a decent enough throwback to the more difficult era of NES gaming all considered though.\n\nThe game itself *is* short, but again that's kind of dictated by how many times you die and need to replay portions of a world and how fast you game in general. I've played almost three hours so far and I'm not halfway done because I take my time. In all honesty though, this game would wear thin after the 10 hour mark, as most Metriodvania's usually do, so it's a logical choice to make it shorter. Having purchased this game for a discount on Humble Bundle, I feel it's well worth the price of admission, definitely one of the better and more fun games of this type currently on Steam.","March 13, 2015","true","2.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It just comes down to maximizing damage and then fire rate to increase DPS.\n\nWhat sentiment do I retain from playing this? Slight disappointment, as it is too good a game to be this short.\n\nIf the difficulty would have been extreme then I would understood. Kinda like VVVVVVVV being short and it not bothering me as much. But the game is fairly easy and straight forward. There's no back tracking unless you want to catch some extras and even that is not something that is going to make me go back.\n\nFor less than two euros I guess I could recommend it, but paying more and becoming disappointed of not having enough is just not worth it. As someone else already pointed out in a review. As soon as one is having fun, the game just ends. There is no time nor new environments in which to test the new found abilities for a satisfactory time.\n\nSum up:\n+Graphics: nice and neat old retro pixel art (loved it)\n+Gameplay: Nervous, adaptive, not frustrating, if it's game over there is only oneself to blame, abilities are well thought and fun to use, modular upgrades mechanic is a nice idea\n+Sound effects: great chip tune shooting and enemy sounds\n+/-Music: Good chip tune but not enough variety\n+/-Environments: Some are better than others, too linear though with 4 planets having one or two ability focused design. Maybe one big environment would have made for more backtracking and the metroidvaniaesque feel\n-Enemies: too little different enemies overall, varied ones could have required different upgrade builds, bosses are a joke of code copy pasting and color changing, could have used more creativity\n--Lifetime: too short for a good game, makes us want more\n","May 22, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

There's no other Metroid-like game where your character can turn into a submarine, or can switch between foreground and background layers. The plane shifting allows for great map design that often sneaks secrets right past you in plain sight. Just pay attention you goof!\n\nThe weapons system allows you to spend (and respec) points on different attributes, from rate of fire to power to... inaccuracy? That one's a little weird. You also get to store three different presets to suit whatever playstyle you feel like. Plus you get a charge shot, Mega Man X-style, which can help take out some of the tankier enemies (like that BAT. THAT STUPID BAT, WHY. GO TO HELL, BAT).\n\nIt looks good, the music is great, it's compact and doesn't overstay its welcome, the only downside is that the boss is recycled over and over (but it does gain new attack patterns each time).

The lack of Save Points force you to become extremely adaptive in many of the situations you'll be put through in this snippet of a game.

It latches onto you in the same way any metroid game would. However, the extremely low quality of the graphics as well as the short gameplay time of 3 hours and the completely retro elements make this one overpriced metroidvania game. It is worth it at a 40% sale.\n\npros:\n- real metroidvania feel\n- balanced difficulty\n- good soundtrack\n- relatively good controls\n\ncons:\n- retro graphics\n- all bosses use the same model, just with different colors and with increasing difficulty each time\n- poor level design in some areas\n- slightly overpriced","August 14, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Very simple and fun.\n\nBy what I am seeing, the game follows the same very principle. I think its built from the same engine, a lot of things savaged from mutant mudds.\n\nAlthough I think that 10 dolars is really too much to ask for the game. I'd say 5 dollars was enough, like I payed for mutant mudds on IOS. But I guess they charge 10 so they can get 5 when discount comes, right? Maybe it should compromise around 7 bucks.\n\nAnyway, congrats to renegade kid, I adore your games.

And a real Metroidvania in a sea of wannabees. Interesting powerups and enemies. The graphics are fantastic. The downside: Too short and not enough enemies. Also save/checkpoints can be frustratingly far away. As many people have noted, there's only 1 boss, but he comes at you with new patterns every time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnakekillerX/recommended/319140/","SnakekillerX","SnakekillerX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnakekillerX/","252 products in account","Really fun game.  It did a good job of bringing back what I love about some of my favorite NES and SNES games.\n\nWhile being classified as a "Metroidvania" game, its redundant to say that it plays similar to Metroid, however there are also art and musical similarities to both Metriod and Super Metriod.\n\nEven many of the abilities obtained are similar to Super Metriod, though don't operate the same way.\nThe Phase ability was really neat, it really fit the game well and it probably the best implementation of a changing active layers feature/skill/gimmick that I have seen in a game.\n\nWhile similar to Metriod, I feel like there are also ties back to Blaster Master on the NES as well, starting with the main character himself and the way he moves/shoots, as well as the gun upgrades and functionality.\n\nThe game starts out pretty difficult as you have little health, and no abilities or upgrades.\nYou can also pick any of the 4 planets to start exploring, however you'll notice that some of those planets you will not be able to explore much until you have the right item/ability to progress, also some of the enemies on those planets are far stronger than you are at the start of the game.\n\nThis game has no hand holding at all, which is nice as I've always been the type of person who liked to explore and figure things out on my own.  The only thing that this game is is forgiving about, is giving you a check point before a boss fight, and having infinite lives.  Dying before a checkpoint however will send you back off the planet onto your ship, and you will have lost any progress you might have made.\n\nI played just over 7 hours of this game and obtained all the upgrades, map progress and finished the game.  While the game can be completed in much less time (less than 1 hour for speed run achievement), if it is your first time playing the game, it will good for several hours at least, assuming you are working for full completion.\n\nIf I had to pick anything to complain about with this game it would be that some of the gun upgrades categories feel fairly useless.  While you can put points into different catergories which change how your gun fires, I only found 2 of them to be of any use to me.  Since you only have enough points to max out 2 of the 5 categories, the other 3 were completely ignored.  Which made having an option to save upto 3 different weapon setups to quickly swap between also a bit useless.\n\n\nAside from that the game was really a lot of fun, the engine ran silky smooth, the visuals were just how I like my pixel style games to look, the music was fantastic and there were pleanty of abilities and hidden items.\n\nThe game's video does a good job of showing you what this game is all about, so if you like the video, then you'll probably love the game.","December 9, 2015","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game incorporates nostalgic Metroid art and gameplay, where you need to backtrack to access area previously blocked due to the requirement of a certain ability, weapons upgrades, bosses, hidden items, maps, puzzles, almost everything from Metroid is there!\nThe game is quite short (2-4hrs), but very fun while it lasts. The major problem I initially had with this game is that there are almost no save points, the only save point is your ship, and you can visit 4 different areas from your ship. The areas themselves are quite small, so if you run recklessly you will certainly die, since the game is a bit more difficult tham Metroid, and does not provide health pickups to restore your health (except for some secret ones), unlike in most Metroid-like games where you get health back from killing creatures.\n\nHighly recommended!","December 12, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When struck by the aformentioned bullets and enemies I found myself flung back just enough to get hit again the second the invulnerability and stun wear off.\n\nI found myself dying quite often and felt cheated too many times.

Let's make a quick list for you.\n\nGood:\n- Gun upgrades - They are kind of ambiguous, but it actually forces you to try out the different combos of how you can create your gun and allows you to choose really different build paths. Pretty cool feature!\n- Fun skills - You pick up skills as you progress through the game that not only help you through levels, but help you do them quicker and more efficiently. You can also manipulate them creatively to take on bosses!\n- Secret rooms - If you're anything like me, you'll love finding the secret rooms in here. The first secret room I stumbled upon was completely by accident jump-running into a wall. See what you can find!\n- Level builds (also see "not so good") - The level builds are creative and once you start earning your upgrades, you're going to really appreciate the way they are constructed. There aren't many levels, but you'll be able to revisit them with your upgrades to explore even more!\n- Achievements - GET THEM!\n\nNot So Good:\n- Short game - I don't have much time down on this game and once it was done, I found myself hoping there was more, like maybe some extra content once it's beaten.\n- Level builds - Some of the levels builds are pretty in-depth, which is pretty awesome while you're exploring, but when going back to look for secret rooms or upgrades, some of the levels can be really long and it takes a long time to get back to the spot where you would find the secret/upgrade. I found myself sort of annoyed that I had to go through that level and run all the way back just for 1 item. Having said that, it's not a terrible feature, just "not so good."\n- Boss algorithms don't change much - [Minor Spoiler]The bosses are pretty much the same boss, but a different color, which doesn't create a ton of variety. They do, however, (after this first boss) add on to the previous boss' repertoir, so while the algorithms do change a bit, there is a bit of familiararity of skills. I could be a cool feature, but by the end of the game, it wasn't hard to take down the last boss becase you pretty much know what he is going to use the whole time. Though I wouldn't say that it necessarily takes away from the boss fights being fun.\n\nOverall, 8/10. Wish there was more, but I was engaged and excited every time I was playing this game. The devs definitely get props for this one. They made this game so refreshing and fun.","May 29, 2015","true","4.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I finished the whole thing, including finding nearly all of the optional power-ups, in under 4 hours.  There aren't that many enemy types, and you'll see the same basic behaviors over and over as you traverse the game world.  Worst of all, the boss fights are incredibly repetetive; every new boss is a palette-swapped minor enhancement on the last, right up through the end of the game.\n\nOverall, this game provides a decent if repetetive few hours' of amusement.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marccookie/recommended/319140/","marccookie","Revenant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marccookie/","499 products in account","Xeodrifter is a short but sweet Metroid-like game where the player must explore 4 unique planets to find new abilities and a number of power-ups in order to find their way home. Taking a page out of Metroid Fusion the map is separated into 4 different sections with a hub (the players ship) rather than the Super Metroid approach of a single interconnected world. Each of these levels has a number of routes which can be opened with new abilities and contain power-ups to give the player an easier time.\n\nXeodrifter controls rather well but does suffer from a slightly floaty feel in regards to the movement. Having only used an Xbox controller I found it intuitive but would probably advise against using a keyboard.\n\nOne of the power-ups the player can find is a Gun Mod. Each of these is a single point which can be used to customize the way your weapon functions. By mixing and matching these point (which can be refunded and re-added at any point) you will be able to increase the damage, firing rate and spread or even make the bullets fire in a sine wave. You can also save 3 varieties of firing modes for quick use in the future.\n\nThe planets are filled with a wide array of beasts which will try and impede your progress, many of which have attack patterns players which have experienced a Metroid game will recognize. All of them have different ways of hindering the player and there was rarely a time I found myself annoyed at their placement in the world.\n\nThe downside to this game is of course its length, you can probably beat this game in well under 3 hours. There is also only a single boss to battle. However each time you fight it there is a new move or 2 added to its library, making it slightly more difficult. Another variety of boss or two would have helped keep it fresh though.\nA final complaint is the construction of the fourth world. While all of the others have a few branching or looping paths this one is almost entirely linear. This planet just doesn't seem to have had the same attention put into its creation which is a bit of a shame.\n\nOverall anyone who is a fan of Metroid-like platform games should definitely check this one out and not be put off by the short playtime provided. Xeodrifter, while short, does not overstay its welcome and the abilities you collect from the bosses make revisiting old locations for new gear a joy.","April 26, 2015","true","3.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Xeodrifter is basically a mini-metroid game meaning it heavily focuses on exploration and backtracking to find hidden goodies.

I also found the equipment system (or however you'd like to address it) very interesting and appreciated that I was able to customize certain aspects of how my character shot bullets at enemies.\n\nAs a warning, Xeodrifter only takes 2-3 hours to complete, so if you will feel shafted buying it for 10$ (or your regional equivalent) I would recommend getting it on sale.

After watching the trailer for Xeodrifter, I was hoping to play a well-crafted action adventure game that hearkened back to the days of Metroid and Blaster Master. I'm happy to say that is exactly what I got.\n\nThe premise of Xeodrifter is incredibly simple: your ship needs a new warp core and unless you want to be left stranded out in the depths of space forever, your only option is to explore four nearby planets and seach for a new core. As you explore each planet, you'll slowly uncover a plethora of health and weapon upgrades, as well as new abilties to help you on your way (rocket jump, submarine, etc.) There is no text in the game and that's okay: it helps immerse the player in the atmosphere of the game.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay pulls through and makes Xeodrifter a fun play. While the controls are slightly floaty, the game moves at a nice pace. You have a selection of upgrades to choose from in upgrading your energy shot which allows for a little customization. As you uncover more and more upgrades, the difficulty of the game slowly ramps along with your progression. This, and the integration of your new abilties, keeps Xeodrifter from becoming boring or repetitive; as the game is only a few short hours, it doesn't bog itself down or drag itself out.\n\nSo. The graphics are colorful, the music is fantastic, and it plays great. It covers all the bases well. Buy it. If you're fan of classic Metroid action/exploration, you owe it to yourself to get this.","April 27","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I stand by my complaint, but I feel I can give it a bit more direction.\n\nThe downsides:\n* The jump height is fixed. No feathering to shoot the badies. This is a gross oversight and not in line with classic NES style.\n* Slop in the controls. Not much, but enough to be frustrating. Platforming will just make you angry at the start.\n* The very first boss is absolutley unforgiving. They are all hard, but the first one is so outright unfair that it led to my initial bad review.\n* Boss methods are sometimes unclear, leaving you to do random things until something inexplicably changes. Good luck surviving through this. Thankfully, most of the boss behavior is random so he may not even do it next round.\n* The character's power is quadratic. As you gain more Health and more Gun, you quickly find the challenge taper off.\n* Some enemies are tedious to kill, not actually hard. There will be a pattern to learn, but do I really need to do it ten times to kill one thing?\n\nThe upsides:\n* Challenging, but doable. Bosses require reflexes and patience. It's a difficult mix to master.\n* Graphics are fantastic. It feels like the love child of my NES favorites Blaster Master and Metroid.\n* Music is great. (I'm biased, there's a nod to David Bowie on the soundtrack. Instant win.)\n\nSo with more negative points than positive ones, why am I changing this to recommend? Firstly, because there is no neutral, which is what I really feel it should be. This game is not for everyone, chiefly because the challenge is just too high at the start. With limited space to explore until you down that first boss, the gameplay value becomes about 5 minutes if you cannot proceed.\n\nA couple of things that would fix it:\n* Feathering. Many enemies need a mini-jump to line up the shot. Let us control our jumps. This actually matters.\n* Difficulty setting. A novice mode in which the bosses movements aren't quite so quick. Also opens the door for hard (bosses have twice the HP) and nightmare (bosses have twice the HP and faster reaction times). Think about it.\n\nIn the end, I am recommending the game. It's just a weak recommendation, with the caveat that if you are really easily frustrated, you might want to sit this one out (at least until it has a difficulty option).","May 19","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though perhaps unintentional, Xeodrifter seems to ride too hard on the "upgrade hunt" aspect of the game, because the package as a whole feels terribly monotonous. It starts slow, briefly shows a flash or two of brilliance, but quickly settles into running you in circles.\n\nFirst and perhaps most notably, combat is incredibly boring outside of boss fights. Enemies have static patterns they rarely deviate from. One moves back and forward in a straight line, another stays in place firing bullets in four directions, etc. The problem here is that most enemies rarely play "aggressor;" they don't change their bullet trajectories, they don't chase... they just carry on with their patterns indefinitely until you take them out. In fact, you could probably avoid and ignore half (if not more) of the enemies in the game and be just fine.\n\nAs a result, level traversal is a chore: move a little, defeat a bullet sponge, continue. It gets old fast. Further exasperating the issue are quirks like no variable jump height and the inability to aim up while walking. This can make taking down enemiess even more tedious. On top of all that, defeated foes don't give health drops (or at least not any that I've seen,) meaning you won't see many of them. Checkpoints are also infrequent. Admittedly, I can see where some people would consider this gauntlet-style trek a challenge worth accepting; however, with combat fairly unengaging and more of a literal roadblock than an actual fight, who wants to repeat it two or three times?\n\nThe end result is that the exploration the game is supposedly banking on ultimately falls flat. Especially early, it can be a constant stop-and-go firefight where impatiently trying to increase your pace can easily lead to accidental damage.\n\nNow, I did say that there were flashes of good. The weapon customization system is neat, and a welcome one at that. I was quite happy to beef up my gun for quicker takedowns and I particularly liked the "sine-wave" upgrade. Also, despite sharing some already mentioned repetition issues, the boss fights are decent enough. They are probably where some of the powerups see their best utilization, especially the plane shifting upgrade. True, bosses can be spongy and predictable like the grunts, but not even close to the same extent.\n\nBut its unfortunate to me that these pluses more or less made the game more bearable, not took it from good to great. As the game progresses and more upgrades become available, things still failed to pick up significantly. If that wasn't bad enough, the game is fairly bad at pushing you towards where you should go next. This wouldn't be so bad if not for the above AND later on it often seems to put "gates" too close to each other. There is literally one spot in the game where its practically four or five gates one right after the other, each representing the next powerup you should obtain. Why? What's the point? It gives this false sense of discovery when you can finally open that "locked door," only to find another one directly after it with almost no iterim material or reward. I feel the game misses some opportunities to reward that easy-going, poking around that usually comes with the territory.\n\nI stuck with it for awhile, but I'm just not enjoying it that much. I still kinda want to do due diligence and finish it (I hear its short,) but even so. Bottom line: it flatlined for me almost immediately and never made a full recovery. Quite a shame, as part of me really feels a great opportunity just didn't materialize properly.","May 21","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
