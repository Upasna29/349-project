Anyone who is a fan of the genre should find this game enjoyable, and should be happy to have it in their library.\n\nThis game is a large improvement over the first one in the franchise.  All of the core gameplay from the first game is still evident in this, with many tweaks and improvements.  Anything you could find in the first game, you can find in this one— but better.  There is also significantly more variety to game modes and level design.\n\nGreat fundamentals are at the heart of this game; everything a good tower-defense game needs to do right, Fieldrunners 2 does right.  Also, the wide variety of game modes, map designs, and difficulty levels all contribute to the diverse and enticing core gameplay.  The lighthearted nature and cartoonish humor inherent in the graphics and soundscape encapsulate a charming identity that makes the game unique.  A ridiculously large amount of towers to unlock, random event bosses, and achievements add a satisfying amount of replay value.  Fieldrunners 2 has a lot of good things going for it.\n\nThe game can be quite difficult at the highest difficulty.  Normally, not a bad thing.  But some levels require an extremely specific solution that, for the average gamer, can take away some of the fun of trying to solve the levels via your own experimentation.  If you get stuck on a level and don’t want to look up the solution online, you can grind coins by playing the game and then buy items or unlock new towers to facilitate your victory.\n\nFieldrunners 2 is a good game, and a great tower-defense game.  There may be no groundbreaking features, but it does have a charming, unique identity and sound fundamentals.  Anyone who truly is an advocate of the genre should enjoy playing this.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 6, 2015","true","27.7"," 56 of 59 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","56","59","0","0"

I am really happy with the improvements. Its not just the same map with a different background. There is an actual campaign instead of just unlocking maps. The game does a really good job of instructing you and easing you into the game without forcing tutorial levels on you. The graphics and animations are also a lot better than the original game. The fun facts / tips make the game feel more alive. There are now items to use and you can pick your own towers that you'll be able to use.\n\nFieldrunners 2 is a very simple and shallow tower defense game with a cartoon look. The game consists of a campaign of several unique maps. You start with a certain amount of cash to buy your towers. You can place these towers anywhere, well almost anywhere. The enemies don't attack, they just run from their starting gate or gates all the way to your base. The game says your base, by base, I assume they mean your gate, because you don't see a base. These are basically open courtyards. If enough enemies get into your base, you'll lose the game. The limit is 20. I am very happy the game maps don't force you to do 100 waves, instead its 20, 30, 40 and so on waves. It makes the game feel much less of a chore when you can breeze through levels. There are other objectives too, like defeat X number of runners within Y time. The maps are really beautiful with a great art style. Far better and more diverse than the original game.\n\nYou're tasked with arranging these towers, making walls of towers, and making a winding path for enemies to follow. Basically make a maze of towers. Can you plug a gap and make an unsolvable puzzle? Nope. The enemies will plod through from left to right. If something blocks their way, they'll path around it, but not intelligently. They'll chose a path that can end up having more of your towers. Some maps have paths already predetermined. There is a wide variety of enemies, standard soldiers, a heavier soldier, they'll eventually get jeeps, motorcycles, tanks, helicopters and giant robots. What do they all do? Just walk. Again they don't attack you. The helicopters and planes will at least fly over your towers in a straight line headed for your gates. There are now troop transports that when they explode, the troops come out and keep running. Your job is to destroy them before they enter your gate.\n\nNow that we've covered the enemies, let's talk about the towers, there are a few types of towers based on what mode you're on. Before each map / level, you'll fill 6 tower slots with towers you've unlocked by buying them with coins you earn for beating levels. This was a great change from the previous game that forced you to have 4 or 6 specific towers. Gun towers with short range, goo towers, that have a longer range, but will shoot goo to temporarily slow enemies down, there are oil towers that do the same thing, but to multiple enemies and the effect doesn't last that long. Next up there are long range missiles, which are great to have, there are bomb spitters that I feel are too similar to missiles. There are new laser towers that don't have an attack radius, but rather can attack up, down, left, right in a line. You can upgrade each and every tower by right clicking it and selecting to upgrade it for a price. Do you want to know which towers do the most damage? The stats are in the help menu item, but they should be hover items that just appear when you go to select which tower you'd like to place. There are new usable items as well, things like air strikes and mines. They're a nice feature in the game. The tower guns turn, but the electro towers don't turn and you'll pay extra for it. You can hit the space bar to pause the game to plop down towers, but there are only two speeds, normal and fast.\n\nThe previous game had you type in your name for the high score, this game just uses your Steam name. There are 3 difficulties for every map / level and I think it just adds waves onto the difficulty instead of making the enemies more difficult. The achievements are more time consuming than they are difficult. Its pretty easy to get them, but you'll invest 2 hours for the first one, which is a far cry from the first game where you could achieve the first few within a few minutes of the game. I wouldn't bring up achievements if the game didn't have 50+ and the previous game had 90+.\n\nOverall, its a great upgrade from Fieldrunners 1. Its worth a try, and it might feel more like a mobile game than a PC game, but its still a fun little game.","June 17, 2014","true","3.1"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

Towers, enemies and special effects are unique, vibrant and can be easily distinguished from one another especially when a lot is happening on screen.\n\n+ 25 levels spread across different game modes and 3 difficulty levels. Each map provides a different entry/exit points along with different obstacles/hazards that you can use to your advantage.\n\n+ Multiple game modes: Survival is your traditional tower defense game. Time attack has you killing a certain amount of enemies before time runs out. Sudden Death pits you against a never ending massive wave of enemies, forcing you to kill a certain amount. Puzzle mode is a twist on the standard tower defense formula by changing some of the rules forcing you to think very carefully where you place towers on the map.\n\n+28 different tower types, 23 different types of enemies and 5 rare elite enemies that randomly show up in certain maps. Each tower is unique and has its own strengths and weaknesses.\n\n+The game has items that can be purchased with coins that you get by completing levels. These itmes are completely optional as every level can be completed on the hardest difficulty without them. The items are a good way to perfect your strategy and provide some help on some of the harder maps.\n\n+ The achievements are much more bearable than its predecessor. Only a limited amount of achievements require grinding\n\n+ Good difficulty balance\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe game is an ios port and that may turn some people off. In order to get items and some of the new towers you first must purchase them with coins. Coins are collected after every map. These however are strictly optional and are not required to finish the game. In app purchases have been removed from this version and the cost of each item/tower is significantly reduced over the ios counterpart. You will gain a lot of coins simply by playing the game and I never felt the need to grind for coins other than for an achievement.\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n- Does very little to innovate the genre\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a great tower defense game and makes some significant improvements over the first one. Anybody looking to get into the genre or is looking for a new game to play, this is a great game to check out just to expect anything new or exciting.\n","March 22, 2015","true","28.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Similar to how sanctum works, the enemy path is created by you as you maze your towers as effectively as possible.  Enemy re-pathing isn't always consistent and can lead to difficulty disigning mazes at harder levels that limit your design by introducing new level mechanics or obstacles.  Good fun overall and recommended for any casual td player.","October 22, 2013","true","54.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Another one spotted out on the perimiter.  A new base, a new siege, it never fails to happen.  I want to take a moment to tell my family that I love them very much.  I fire up the two lone sentry guns remaining and await further orders from base...if they still exist.\n\nDay 2 - More arrive, probably hearing the death screams of the first few shredded apart by the sentry guns.  I found some industrial adhesive out back - anything to stop them.

I am now typing with one hand.  I am so stupid sometimes.  Saving my flask of whiskey tomorrow.\n\nDay 20 - The blast from a missile hit me last night as I was drinking.  Two teeth lost and I dropped my whiskey,  Damn turret tracked on it and now I'm walking with a crutch.\n\nDay 25 - Tesla turret ate my mobile phonograph.\n\nDay 30 - I no longer care about my lost phonograph, as I am no deaf from the blasts.  I have the worst song stuck in my head now.  Why did I put that on there?\n\nDay 32 - I thought moving piles of dead clones would have been an improvement, but now they're beginning to rot.\n\nDay 34 - I guess I have no choice but to start burning the bodies.   Took out some of the pyro tower's fuel...hope it's worth it...remebering to keep my hands hand out of it this time.\n\nDay 35 - Regretting yesterday as I stupidly didn't check wind direction first.

Compared to the first game that was pretty mediocre, the developers listened to the playes and changed everything around: Towers now show where they shoot, so the Lightning Tower that only shows in 4 directions doesn't have a  circle but the 4 directions. You get informations about how much DPS the various Towers actually do and the maps are a lot more creative with bridges and trenches and the ability to make the Fieldrunners go in circles like idiots....there's nothing better than that.\nThere are a lot more weapons and the special weapons you need to buy with coins you collect, i don't think that forcing a player to "like" the game on Facebook and Twitter in exchange of coins is a good way, but you'll earn enough of them by playing the game regardless. There are puzzle maps too and a lot more story and special unique enemies like a legendary panzer and even the Hindenburg. It's way better than the first one and highly recommended to every one who likes Tower Defense.","January 11, 2014","true","9.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I was impressed with the original Fieldrunners and when Fieldrunners 2 came out, I was blown away. They took a great game and made it 1000% better and more enjoyable, which I didn't think was even possible. Once you get into this game you may very easily be hooked, as I am. The Heroic difficulty is challenging, but after gaining some experience (and unlocking more towers), you'll find they're not nearly as insurmountable as they seem at first.\n\nFor those concerned about having to buy coins (with "real" money) in order to beat all levels and earn all acheivements, I totally disagree. I started playing the game on iOS and have since unlocked every achievment in the game. I have subsequently started playing on Android and Steam (now my preferred platform--love the large screen experience and the convenient keyboard controls). I have never spent a penny on In-App Purchases (sorry, Subatomic Studios). You can earn plenty of coins simply through normal game play. As for the Steam version, I am only 1 acheivement away from collecting them all--and that one is just a matter of time since it's the "play once a week for 6 months" card. I'll have no problem there, because I can't stop playing. Even after seemingly accomplishing every challenge the game has to offer, there's always room for improvement so my current activity involves finding better strategies to get the highest score possible, and learning new and creative ways to use various towers.\n\nFor my tastes, this game is a good as it gets. I don't know if there are plans for a Fieldrunners 3, but I can't imagine improving much on what they've already done here (though I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it). I would just like to see more maps and challenges to conquer! I would rate it a solid 10 out of 10.","January 9, 2014","true","449.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike some other Tower Defense games, you can really influence the game because you have to make a path for the units. It's not liked the locations for the towers are fixed. Whenever a Tower Defense game makes use of this type of Tower Placement, it already scores a lot of points on my list.\n\nThe core of the game is very solid, the levels are very challenging ( Depending on one of the three difficulties ) and the amount of control you can practise on the battlefield is amazing. This can be done by making complicated choices between Quanitity and Quality. For Example: Do i want to build 4 more chaingun towers? Or do i want to build a tower that slows units down, thus giving the excisting towers more time to destroy them. And do i want to spread the towers out over the map or do i want a very dense 'killing zone'?\n\nI can certainly recommend this game. Even to people that aren't into Tower Defense games.

Obviously aimed at mobile money markets with microtransactions removed for PC, this is definitely the worst tower defense game I've played in several years. Generic cartoony graphics don't even attempt to hide the lack of originality or character (but still somehow the game has long load times even on 2500k @ 4ghz, GTX 780, 16gb DDR3, and SSD). The levels, characters, and art design are generic flash TD fodder and have not a single iota of verve, originality, or even competence.\n\nSeriously, I wonder if all the other products that this game rips off even realize it? For example I bet Valve doesn't realize that they stole the TF2 Heavy model and animations almost verbatim (plus the TF2 soldier model and anims, just to name two), and several other models and animations have been copied slavishly from other titles. There are almost no options in the game for anything whatsoever. As far as I can tell there is no hotkey to instantly restart a level, or to bring up the normal ESC menu with the normal options. Apparently you have to click on it, because if you hit ESC it instantly asks you if you want to quit the game. Clueless, greedy, incompetent mobile devs. Yuck.\n\nBeyond the simplistic mobile approach and total lack of creativity, competency, or imagination, the worst failing of Fieldrunners 2 is that it's built entirely around the worst TD grind mechanics you can imagine, and they're all hidden invisibly underneath a layer of flash/mobile simplicity. The waves are seemingly endless, randomly thrown together without thought, and invisibly leveled in HP while still using the same models and animations, with no indication that the enemies are gaining massive amounts of HP. There is no "next wave" button or indication of what the next wave comprises. One of the earliest levels has 50, yes FIFTY equally boring and generic waves, most of which comprised identical looking enemies whose HP scaled invisibly up to the moon. Who likes that? Maybe someone on mobile who has never seen a tower defense game, but even then only for the first hour or two.\n\nI get that the game sucks and grinds purely to drive microtransactions, but I rebel against this negative approach to game design. It creates enemies out of your customers and generally makes people hate you. -I- personally hate you, Subatomic Studios, for this game. You created an enemy out of me, and I will make sure to track your company in the future purely to avoid your products and warn people about how much you suck. This game should have never been released on PC, or anywhere. It is trash.

I assumed that after the developers even confirmed the bug that it would at least be fixed in the sequel, which is not the case.\n\nSecondly, the sequel plays more like a traditional Tower Defense & the game has veered away from the original path of allowing users to path/maze their towers.  While there are still some maps that allow this, it appears the majority of the maps have turned towards traditional TD gameplay.  The ability to maze your towers was what attracted to me to the original game, which has been hugely downsized in this version.\n\nOn the plus side, the issue with stuttering is no longer around in the sequel & many of our suggestions for the original game were heard & used in the sequel.  The ability to choose your towers on each map (one of my suggestions) as well as the addition of single-use items has been an improvement over the original game, but the requirements to gain each tower are very steep & you'll be playing for an extremely long time before you can afford them.  Not to mention if you're using a lot of items, you end up spending a lot of coins for those items & may never reach your goal of that new tower.  The ability to gain free coins through Facebook & Twitter was a nice touch, but unfortunately not all of us can take advantage of these (I don't use Twitter & don't use Facebook much as it is).\n\nWhile I can't say that my disappointment with the game will keep me from playing it, I can say that I don't enjoy the game as much as the original.  Sure it's more interesting, but very time consuming & the lack of what got me interested in the original game (or at least the extreme downsize of it) just doesn't catch my fancy as much as the first game.","January 22, 2013","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Diese Türme können dann noch aufgewertet werden.\nZwischendurch können noch Sonderziele wie z.B. Der rote Baron erscheinen, die zwar\nkeinen Malus geben, wenn sie fliehen können, ansonsten aber Abzeichen freischalten.\nEs gibt noch ein Sammelkarten System, wenn man dort die gestellten Aufgaben/Abzeichen\nerledigt hat, bekommt man Coins/Gegenstände.\nJeder der Szenen kann man in 3 verschiedenen Schwierigkeitsgraden angehen.\nJe höher dieser, desto mehr Münzen und bei Lösung natürlcih Sterne bekommt man.\n\nDas Spiel macht Spass. Und es ist lösbar! (Selbst für einen solch alten Knacker wie mich)\nEinige der Aufgaben sind allerdings dermaßen verzwickt......vor allem weil in höheren Leveln\ndie Runner enorm viele Hitpoints haben und zudem sehr schnell sind.\nDa hilft dann nur der Einsatz der Spezialtürme.....aber für die braucht es wieder eine Menge Geld....\n\n","April 25, 2015","true","147.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
