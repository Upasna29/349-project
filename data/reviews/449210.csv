"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emsk8/recommended/449210/","emsk8","eM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emsk8/","211 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nVerdict Guilty is a fun, 90's inspired fighting game with aesthetically pleasing pixel art and a great, fast paced soundtrack.\n\nOnly Arcade mode is available to play at the moment with training, survival and story mode currently in the works and planned for release.\n\nGameplay is relatively simple, health bars are low and matches are quick.\n\nThere's eight different characters to choose from each with special moves such as whipping out a machine gun to shoot down an opponent or calling on a police dog to come to your aid.\n\nVerdict Guilty is good casual fun, which is easy to jump in and out if you have 10 minutes to waste. I found the game enjoyable and I'm excited to see how it develops.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/OaUlxx9KX3M\n","March 24","true","2.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

However, as of right now, the combat is extremely bland and if you wanted any competitive depth, it'd be solely off of footsies. I hope to see that a super bar gets implemented, character specific special moves involving joystick motions, a longer health bar, and a simple block mechanic be put in to make it a very nice fighter. The art is amazing, the music is kickass, it's immersive, and hopefully we can get a training mode and netplay added. Buy this game because it will most likely turn into something amazing, and support the developers here.\n\nThanks for reading!","March 19","true","1.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I've bought the previous game from this dev, Super Trench Attack, and the artstyle is similar. The characters are vibrant and unique, there are some very intesting mechanics especially with the bullet/fireball mechanic. It is a WIP but the developer so far has shown he is willing to accept feedback and has already taken alot of good advice under consideration. For 3$, if you love indie games, AND fighting games, this is a must. An interesting entry into fighting games. I think there is a real hidden gem here.\n\n8/10","March 20","true","0.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's like those old Street Fighter clones back in the SNES days. Some basic things are missing though like throws and super moves. Damage scaling needs work. Really it is the things like this that hit all the nostalgia buttons. It literally has all those old fighting game problems. But the game has character. And the developer seems to really be making progress and taking suggestions seriously. There is even an ongoing thread with a steady flow of updates. Looking forward to following this games development.","March 21","true","0.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It seemed like the base games that the other fighter clones were copying were either Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, at least through my perspective.\n\nNow what this game reminded me of right off the get go was the original "Fatal Fury". The screen\nshots of this game and the price alone were enough to pull me in and make my purchase. I'm not\ndisappointed.\n\nThe gameplay itself really good. The Fighters move fluently and the combo system is standard but does its job well. A variety of moves per fighter are at your disposal, including gunplay. I love the animation in the backgrounds. The soundtrack is also excellent. It fits the gritty feel of the game.\n\nVerdict Guilty is still in "early access" so I can't wait to see what else the developers have in store for\nthis game.\n\n5/5\n\nGameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ7SKv_xs04","April 3","true","2.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It's three dollars, after all. I had some fun with it and decided to give the first review. Maybe some of the negatives will be fixed when the game goes full release.","March 16","true","0.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","1"
