The developer is MIA and the game is full of bugs.\nThe game is a direct ripoff of Game Dev Tycoon.  The developer is apparently MIA and no updates have been done since November of 2014.  The developer (and/or moderator) doesn't allow any constructive criticism of the game on the boards.  I, like others, were permantently banned in the early goings of the game for bringing bugs to the attention of the developer.  They were done politely, but the moderator/owner takes criticism personally for some reason.\n\nLook at this strange exchange between a moderator and a guy asking to change his review from negative to positive:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198029818396/recommended/314320\n\nThe same moderator also actively engages the community negatively by starting ridiculous topics designed to incite:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/314320/discussions/0/35221031615875135/\n\nand:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/314320/discussions/0/35221031614566266/\n\nThe forum for bugs has the title "you break it, we fix it."  That's an AWFUL mentality for a developer.  Bugs are not mistakes make by the user playing.  They are made by the developer.   That doesn't mean that they aren't expected.  Of course they are.  Especially in an Early Access game.  But even insinuating that the bugs in an early access game are the fault of player is insanity.\n\nAnd, no, being in the same genre does not mean you're automatically ripping off a game.  Some people in the comments have argued that I'm saying being in the same genre makes it a ripoff.  It doesn't.  But the game play and graphics are nearly identical.  Whereas a game like Mad Games Tycoon is in the same genre but completely different in graphics and function.\n\nThe developer promised an update was coming soon this last October (2015).  No word from the developer since that time.\n\nIf you like these types of games, give Mad Games Tycoon a try.  The developer constantly updates the game (it's early access, but he takes advice from the community and updates his games often).","January 25, 2015","false","34.9"," 214 of 256 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","214","256","4","16"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/recommended/314320/","murderbits","murderbits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/","2796 products in account","I bought GamersGoMakers based on reviews stating that it is a more complex Game Dev Tycoon.\n\nIn my experience, the only added complexity is in the reviewable detail like spreadsheets showing current trends and company history.\n\nEverything else, however, feels less polished than Game Dev Tycoon (which I also found to be a far from ideal game).\n\nFirst, the user interface is sometimes confusing. Does that green checkmark mean I need to click it to activate it? Or does that mean it is activated? Oh, okay, that means it *is* activated. On other dialogues and interfaces -- oops, wait, come back! I didn't mean to skip that question or step! You're also forced into full-screen. For casual simulation games like this, I'd prefer to use a small window while I do other things. With GamersGoMakers, you can have full-screen or windowed mode. Both will take up your entire screen (in my case, on a 2560x1600 screen). Yes, there is a lot of information in the interface, but there are far more complex data-driven presentation games out there that I can play at something other than full screen, if I wish.\n\nSecond, the game play itself is essentially the same as every other iteration of this genre. Research tech, train skills, name a game, select genre and focuses for game, click button and watch while the money rolls in (or doesn't). Repeat and rinse until you're bankrupt (no way to take bank or private loans or anything else - when you go negative for a year, you're toast) or until you have enough money to invest in a bigger building and more employees and advertising campaigns.\n\nThird, and what kind of drove me nuts over everything else, are the incoherencies. The game starts in 1980 and can be started in the 80s, 90s, or 00s, if you prefer. In the beginning, the only graphical technology which exists is "text based". You'll see something like the current 1980 trend being "race simulators". So, you might create a race simulator using the currently available technology. The game will bomb -- probably because you didn't invest enough focus in graphics (as per the game reviews for your product). You know, those sexy text based graphics that really drive racing simulators of 1980.\n\nIf you play through production of a few games (which feels like it is always based around entirely random generation of events and desires, no matter how senseless) you'll reach the point where an ESRB-style ratings board appears. Only, not so much like the ESRB, because while the ESRB has no legal authority and are a voluntary industry ratings system, the ratings service in the game apparently has the capability to legally ban a game in America, for "excessive language".\n\nThat's right. A game developed in the US for a US market is banned in the US by a ratings service for its language. For those unfamiliar with the first amendment and repeated court decisions over the decades upholding it, let's put this into context: Only two games have ever been "banned" in the US. Ever.  One was an adult title in 2005 which, due to an under age (17yrs) model being revealed, was taken off the market and the other was an arcade game which was "banned" due to defective peripheral parts which were potentially dangers and therefore recalled for safety issues. In other words, neither was technically "banned" and certainly no game has ever been banned due to language or violence or legal representations of sexual situations. While this may seem like a small thing, it's an annoyance and representative of countless incoherencies in a title which otherwise asserts itself to be an engaging simulation of an industry, sectioned into characteristic decades.\n\nOver all, it is not a terrible game. I just can not suggest it over Game Dev Tycoon at a full $10. Frankly, I can't suggest Game Dev Tycoon at its full price, either. Both are very lack-luster games; GamersGoMakers more so. I would really like to see someone put in the work to produce a high quality game of this genre and subject, with the depth and complexity and coherence that it really deserves. As it is, every one of these that I've encountered are little more than a cheap mobile phone quality distraction.","August 12, 2014","false","1.9"," 253 of 334 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","253","334","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Emperor60/recommended/314320/","Emperor60","Raptor Jesus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Emperor60/","265 products in account","I was curious of the other Game Management games out there. I started out with Game Dev Tycoon (Throughly enjoyed that game with 200+ hours), then I tried Game Tycoon (Which is absolutely dreadful, don't waste your time and money. You're better off wiping your butt than spending it), I tried GameBiz 3 (Enjoyed it for its gameplay but hated it for its extremely poor UI and sales restrictions), and I played Game Dev Story on iOS (Which is great for on the go. I enjoyed it for its simulation, but not very much for its management and lack of interaction). So one day, I came upon this game and I decided to give this a shot.\n\nPros:\n-Very detailed! I like how they really invested into what goes into a game; such as system design, content design, sound design, game writing, network, ect. The list goes on.\n-Game Reviews appear like actual reviews.\n-You can create your own Casing! This is honestly my favorite part of the game, hands down. None of the other Game Dev games ever did this!\n-Competitors; more specifically they affect you in so many factors such as affecting your game releases, console releases, ect. You can even buy them out and have them develop their own projects but still receive an income or you can have them help you out in your own projects!\n-More indef development. You can have voice actors, stunt devils, and so much more!\n-This game has a lot of humor! The names of the actors are reversed in such a great fashon!\n-Sales Charts are detailed and give you great statistics.\n-You can choose your starting location! With each starting location, you get seperate perks!\n-You can choose your own price! This should already be a given to any GD game!\n\nCons:\n-If you do poorly in the game, the reviews will just tell you "You should focus on so and so more," It doesn't give you a plus minus system like GDT does. What makes it even worse, is that when you develop another game of the same genre, it doesn't tell you what was something you weren't suppose to do, you have to pull up another menu to do so.\n-The UI is very much confusing and requires so many menus to open for information. If you wish to replace another employee you have to basically write down the levels of each employee and what they are good in. It should automatically tell you this instead of menu hopping.\n-Graphics are very uninspiring. Everything is basically a still image.\n-The notifications takes up about 1/5th of your screen. It doesn't need to be that big. Whats worse is that if you wish to look a previous notification, you are bombarded by what other notifications of irrevent games from irrevent companies. You also can't go back very far in time.\n-Upgrading and researching are such a time consuming waste. You can't unlock the publishing office until the early 2010s. To make this seem even more terrible, you can't unlock your hardware lab until the 7th gen (X360, PS3, WII), around 2004-7ish. You can't make a retro console. The game won't even tell you if you can even research more technology due to the bombardment of the nofications.\n-Buying new offices are basically the same as the last bullet point, half of the stuff you wish to create are locked off until the later 2000s.\n-Early game start is virtually impossible unless you know what you're doing. There are no wiki's or any source of information from what I looked on the internet about what makes a game good. I had to revert to the steam forums for an JPG about what you invest your points in.\n-Custom Consoles sell COMPLETELY POORLY! It took until my forth console to even get to a 10% marketshare whereas my competitors are at 25-35%. Which also makes no sense, the marketshare exceeds 100%, how is that even possible!?\n-By later game, around 2000s, it slows down tremendously and begins to feel repeatitive.\n-Genre and game selection is confusing. You can pick an Action Genre but you have to pick a sub-Genre. EX: Action-Beat em Up. Then you create a story with it. Then those stories are locked for the genre specific game. If I wanted to create a Military Action RPG, I can't. I can only use Military FPS.\n-------------------------------------------\nFinal Verdict: Better than Game Tycoon at least!\n\nI do absolutely love the details this game gives and the constant updates from the developers! This game has a LOT of potiental, but it won't reach it's peak unless it continues to receive patches and updates. The UI DEFINITELY needs some work. Although points of the game felt repetitve, I never really felt bored. I was interested by how the market works and the constant interaction you're doing. The case designing is by far the most innovative feature of this game; its what should be EXPECTED in a Game Dev game. But it needs to be more interesting, a bit more dynamic!!\n\nI'd recommend giving this game, at the very least, a shot or a try. It's well worth its price point of $10 USD. It's not a game for everybody, but you may find it very enjoying.","October 8, 2014","true","39.8"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","38","50","4","8"

More depth, more atmosphere, more feel.\n\nIf you're into tycoon game, if you're an old fart, if you love games where you build a business from the ground up, if you're competitive by nature.\n\nHeck if you're one or all off the above, buy this little gem and spend countless hours releasing one game after another.

They were large productions and sold well, creating such stars as Sid Meier among others.  I bring that name up because, it seems to me, that that is the only franchise that has been able to survive to this day.  A true simulation about the creation of your civilization.  Your choices mattered and numbers behind the curtain were calculating the outcomes of various action or non actions.  It gave you so many paths to victory or loss.  Yes my friends, you could actually LOOSE a game back then.  I know...hard to believe!\n\nSince the rise of the tablets and smart-phones, something strange started to happen.  I'd go to the video game store and I'd see a 'Tycoon' game here and there and everywhere.  I would read in my PC Gamer magazine just how horrible these particular 'simulations' were.  This was back when game names that had 'Tycoon' in the title actually meant you were going to be getting a detailed simulation.  Not just a simulation of how Baribie's new haircut worked at the fashion show.  Games like the Railroad Tycoon series (another Sid Meier brainchild), Transport Tycoon done by Chris Sawyer who had earlier blown our minds with the infinite possibilities of a truly infinite universe as seen in Eliete II and later taking over the reigns of the Railroad tycoon series where you have virtually all the control and choices an actual person running the show would have.  He later moved on with the successes of Rolercoaster Tycoon, that still survives in one form or another to this day.\n\nNow I can go on my phone and go to 'simulation' games and they give the option of a simulation on baking cakes and pressing the pad at the right time, or stir on the......Wait?!!!  WTF am I simulating here??!!!\n\nThere were always a few bastions of hope that popped up here and there, for example the GameBiz (Excellent game series, not on steam, very text heavy but quite complex)series but by that point the word 'simulation' was such a dirty word...a stupid I-pad game for kids.  One game that actually had a bit of traction as being a little more in step with the simulation games of old was Game Dev Tycoon.  It spent some time on tablets and cell phones, then made a crack at a Windows 8 Marketplace for purchase.  (CORRECTION:  Was only for sale on the Microsoft Market for Microsoft devices, as far as I know.  Thanks DOWNPHOENIX!)  Even more time passed then the unthinkable happened.  They ported it to Steam!  Hooray!  Simulations are coming back!  And it was good.  It was a good game for a I-phone, great in fact.  It was great for that demographic.  Us Simulation game players were put off by the arbitrariness of the whole thing.  But again....it was something.  We had a little bit of fun, for a little bit of time.  But it was not the game we sought!\n\nSummer: 2014, almost out of nowhere a challenger entered the ring.  It kind of looked similar, was a bit rough around the edges but it was calling itself a simulation.  Heck, they even offered a free demo.  After the first3 minutes with this demo, I knew I was dealing with a different beast entirely!  I felt that the executive decisions actually had a direct impact on the 'thing' I was tring to create.  For the first time in years I felt the bonds that held me away go loose and let my imagination.  I needed to think like a business person, I needed to care and experiment and figure out what worked and what didn't.  I failed!  All the time!  And felt it was a victory to just make it to the end of the demo!  Every company I founded was like a child that you needed to nurture and guide, and a loss was tragic and heart breaking.\n\nNeedless to say I purchased it for the horribly high price of $10 <Please note the sarcasm> on launch day.  I couldn't wait to delve into the things the developer was offering that would take me far away from Candy Crush, and Sally's Stable or staring down the sights of an AR-15 as some 12 year old called my mother fat among other things.\n\nI played....lost in the game's trappings eluding to older times where these things mattered.\n\nAs a matter of fact I'm still playing my first company.  Hard to believe, but I do hop on and check out what's going on at headquarters, just like a real boss would.  I think of inspiration for my next project as I walk to the corner store for milk and bread.\n\nThe fact that this game could draw in a hardened veteran of simulator games going back to the early 80's was astounding to me.  I found out that the game was mainly developed by one young man.  And he was excited!  The ideas of free patches and cheap DLC expansion packs...it all just kept coming!\n\nAt the end of this lengthy review, I must say this:  Potential\n\nThis independent game has so much potential from a young and fresh mind that KNOWS the difference between fluff and a true simulation, I can honestly say that if this game see's any success, the entire genre will flourish yet again, thanks to such efforts that come from developers willing to push each other forward.\n\nGamersGoMakers is a seed, and I can't wait to see her blossom the way she deserves to...","August 13, 2014","true","176.7"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","24","39","2","8"

It’s not, but let’s concentrate on the game at hand.\n\nGamersGoMakers (not a great name, I know) is made by a small indie development team, and graphically the game is simple and cartoonish, which is to be pretty expected.  The graphics do the job enough, though, because pretty graphics are not the most important thing about management sims, which is basically what this is.\n\nYou can start your game from several points through history, but I think you’ll get the most out of it by starting back in 1980.  You begin your career as game developer as a one-man/woman team.  Over time – with success and no small amount of luck – you’ll expand into larger premises which enable you to open specialist departments, such as a design office, a development office, a sound studio, etc.  You’ll have to hire staff to fill the positions, who help you to make your games.  Your staff – yourself included – have skill stats, which you can improve by doing training as well as through the act of making games.  The higher their stats, the higher their wage, but if you want to be churning out those big AAA games then you’re going to need the best you can find.  Don’t be afraid to fire people so you can hire better staff members as they become available.\n\nYou can choose from an increasingly wide range of game genres, such as action, adventure, strategy, etc, most of which also expand into other options, such as ‘action, shoot-em-up’.  You need to decide where to place your emphasis with the game, such as graphics, game play, AI, sound, etc.  For example, shoot-em-up actions don’t require a lot of emphasis on writing, but game play and graphics are very important.  At first, you’ll be making games with the wrong emphasis in the wrong areas, but as you gain experience and can hire a producer, you’ll have a better idea of what to do.\n\nAfter you’ve finished your masterpiece, you release it to the world, where you’ll get your all-important review.  You’ll get rated out of 10 for your game play, graphics, writing, etc.  The higher the better, of course.  But you’ll also get a percentage score out of 100.  Anything over probably 70% you can consider you did okay; anything under is a swing and a miss.  Lastly, you’ll get some comments on the pro’s and con’s of your game.  A few dud games in a row early on in your career can send you bankrupt very quickly.  Consequently, the early years are the most difficult and precarious.\n\nAs of the current version – which I believe is version 1.1 – there are definitely bugs in the game.  But it’s not just bugs that are the problem.  It’s not very intuitive or informative in telling you what areas you need to be emphasising and what areas are unimportant, even after you’ve made games in that genre a few times.  For a comparison, “Game Dev Tycoon” reveals more and more information on a genre the more times you do it, until you have a very good idea indeed on what you need to do.  It not only tells you what’s important, but what’s not important.  GamersGoMakers doesn’t make that clear enough in my opinion.\n\nThe good thing, though, is that the developers have expressed a desire to release patches and even DLC’s so I’m hopeful that the worst of the problems will get ironed out.\n\nIf you’re like me and played “Game Dev Tycoon”, liked it a lot but also found it a little frustrating because of how limited it was, then you’ll like this.  If you’ve never played “Game Dev Tycoon” but are interested in the idea of becoming a game developer bigwig then you’ll like this game.  It’s not perfect but patches will certainly go some way towards this, and even as it is, I find it a lot of fun and rather addictive!","August 9, 2014","true","34.1"," 34 of 60 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","34","60","0","0"

I would say this game has amazing potential by offering a more indepth game dev than most of its rivals, however some of its ideas are either not necessary, overly complex or too bunched together in the dev cycle.\n\nOverall I like the idea of having a more indepth game dev product, I just think the game needs some kinks ironed out and some features adjusting or possibly being removed for instance box art. Sadly in its current form I cannot recommend it to anyone, but I have faith that it can become a true rival in this genre in time.\n\n(sorry if I was too harsh)\n\n**I may do a new review if and when my opinion changes or get much further into the game than I currently am**\n\np.s.. sorry again devs.","August 8, 2014","true","12.6"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","19","32","0","0"

Yes it does seem to be heavily influenced by GameDev Tycoon, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. GameDev Tycoon was a fun game, but the game never gave proper in-game feedback on why certain games were popular/unpopular, and players had to resort to the wiki page to figure this out. In GamersGoMakers you get useful feedback on games that you develop that allows you to alter and improve your strategy as you play.\n\nThe user interface is a bit clunky, especially once you have hired staff. There is also less animation than in GameDev Tycoon. The game could be a lot better if the developers improves and streamlines the user interface some more and includes a bit more animation to make the game feel more tactile.\n\nOverall it is a fun game and probably worth the 10$, if you really like tycoon/management/simulation type games.

However GGM's complexity surpasses GDT's own - there's much more to do and much more to consider, wrapped up in mechanics not following the known paradigm in many details.\n\nDirect competition (which you can buy out later on to let them either continue developing their own games or support you with yours in certain aspects), detailed and helpful reviews, boni depending on where your company is founded, a lot of different room types like sound and motion capture studios and a lot of other differences and improvements indicate how much thought the devs put into their game.\n\nThe UI however doesn't live up to the expectations. So many things are happening all the time that it is either not able to summarize everything in a well arranged way or it makes it a chore to actually get things done - want to train your employees? Open the staff window, click employee, click train, close window to do other stuff, wait, open window again, click next training option, rince, repeat. Finally everything trained? Don't worry, the game will throw several new training options for half of your about 14 emploess at you a minute later. A training queue for example would be a welcome addition.\n\nAlso, the difficulty seems to be a bit unbalanced. The game is way too easy at the lowest setting, while the next level already gives you something to gnaw on your finger nails. Note: I don't mean the game is too difficult in the normal settings, I just think that the gap between easy and normal is too big - figuratively spoken you're thrown into cold water and almost nothing can prepare you for what the game suddenly has up its sleeves (I'm looking at you, 1985+ reviews D:).\n\nHowever these are flaws or issues I can perfectly live with. GamersGoMakers is a game that really surprised me with its quality. If you like this kind of games, go for it - you won't be disappointed!\n\n\n\n","August 22, 2014","true","24.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I am only playing it in EASY mode, so maybe in harder modes these features, like marketing, the box art, etc. have some effect.  But even if it doesn't it's kinda cool to design a basic product box.

Yes, if you love GDT you will love this, especially if you are craving more from GDT and didnt find it in depth enough. Also if you found GDT to be pretty annoying in the late game when the performance can chug or that the game's feedback on how to make your games better to be lacking, you will find plenty to like here. That said, GGM does have one fairly significant flaw, and that is the UI.\n\nThe UI is actually pretty nice as far as being simple and easy to figure out, but it does have some issues that take a while to get used to. It took me a couple hours of play before I really got it down, and I still on occassion have an issue with some tasks like assigning developers. Also, I dont particularly care for the graphics style of this (or GDT for this matter) and was hoping that this wasn't so similar to GDT in the graphics front. I realize it may be too late for them to change it now without having to do a drastic overhaul of some elements of the game, but I do find the graphics to be pretty dull and boring to look at. That said, this game is a rock solid sim, it works very well and has enough of a challenge and randomness to it to keep me coming back, I can see myself playing this for a LONG while (like I did with GDT and GDS).","August 16, 2014","true","20.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately there were a few areas I felt that Game Dev Tycoon lacked in that the customization of your games was lacking.\n\nThis is when my attention was turned to Gamers Go Makers. This is a new title which takes the same route as Game Dev Tycoon but puts more emphasis on the products which the player creates, allowing them to be customized and tailored much more than Game Dev Tycoon.\n\nit comes down to it the two games look very similar. They feature a similar art style and camera angle on the player’s avatar. Trends are highlighted and both games allow the player to progress through the various generations of consoles from the 1908s way up to the current generation of today.\n\nWeekend is here!\nWhere Gamers Go Makers shines though is in its much more in depth customization. The starting player is allowed to specialize themselves in certain areas of games development, allowing for more focus on team building of individuals with complimenting skillsets. This means that a team of people can make a well balanced game rather than one person making a game which shines in level design but lacks in the auditory department.\n\nGamersGoMakers Game plan!\nThe game is a nice expansion from what I played when I was playing Game Dev Tycoon but when it comes down to the final crunch it all depends on what you like in your Tycoon games.\n\nGamers Go Makers provides a more in depth look at the world of games development while still giving you the same enjoyment you can get out of Game Dev Tycoon.\n\nGood Game GamersGoMakers\nGamers Go Makers is currently in development and is set for release in Summer 2014.

It may not be pretty or have a great sound track but ithas the depth and bredth that Game Dev Tycoon lacked.This game does have a few minor issues but they are completely patchable and so minor it will take a while to notice them. One thing i like about this game is the abundance and usefulness of information you get when making and releasing games! Another thing to like is no sliders, just definitve icons bars, unlike in game dev tycoon! Also this games tutorial and tooltips are super helpful! The tooltips mean you don't have to check the wiki every five seconds like in GDT to figure out if the game is gonna bomb! Another things to love is competition. Unlike in GDT where you play against yourself, which gets progressively less appealing as time goes on. Another good thing is that you can only do training ONCE so that empoyee skills largely come from skill and experience, not infinite money and training. The technology branches in this game also make good sense but do not require pesky research points like in GDT. Also, when hiring staff you dont have to spend 200k looking for excellence. The employee pool can be seen and examined easily in the hire staff menu. Another thing i like is that employees can only work in one category so you don't have to deliberate over the proper roles of potential hires for 5min on the wiki. A nice feature is the competitive awards of the month/year etc which i feel are better implemented in GGM than in GDT. Another nice thing is that all the topic options are unlocked for the genre you slected so that one employee isn't always occupied researching new topics. Overall this game is an excellent competitor to GDT and represents a more competitive and player friendly approaoch than in GDT.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/macangusthebangbus/recommended/314320/","macangusthebangbus","Frarmer Jawn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/macangusthebangbus/","272 products in account","The primary complaint I have seen with this game is its similarity in visual style to Game Dev Tycoon.  This sort of complaint really doesn't make any sense, as the content of these sorts of games is often more important than the presentation: so long as the presentation is relatively easy-to-navigate and allows for a good workflow, it's acceptable if it appears lifted from another game that has done it well before.  But does GGM add anything to the genre?\n\nNot really.  On the surface, it appears to be much more complex, with much more player control, however: a bug-ridden experience, clumsy UI, and lots of window-dressing all contribute to an illusion.  The reality is that the game is, at its core, a clumsier version of GDT that does right what it's lifted from its predecessor, and does wrong what it's contributed to the genre.  Therefore, the following won't be about what it does well, because you can read a review of GDT for that - it will be about what the game does poorly.\n\nThe first major complaint, the one which will be most readily apparent to players, is the clumsiness of the UI.  Even before expanding to a new office, the player will have hurdles to overcome in unresponsiveness, incoherent navigation, and unnecessary obscuration.  The main office is cluttered with interactable props which serve no purpose but to give a secondary measure to accessing data which can be accessed by the player menu, except for one or two: even then, accessing data by the player menu is hit-and-miss, with mouse clicks sometimes not responding, and other times unreasonably delayed.\n\nThe UI clears up somewhat at the development options, at least before you hire other workers to help you in your enterprise: relatively easy-to-manipulate areas of focus for the games, sliders for 'Violence' 'Profanity' and 'Sexuality', story genre picker and story budget; these are all options which present little-to-no difficulty in manipulating (though the story budget can be slow in response, and defaults in increment.)  The marketing screen is also straightforward and simple, and surprisingly the buttons click rather easily: at this point, as well, the game sale price per unit can be set.\n\nOnce the player takes on extra workers, however, a further screen for work allocation is added.  This screen is a nightmare to manipulate: removing workers from a certain area of focus requires double-clicking on the worker's name, which shouldn't be a frustrating action, but is made so by a general lack of responsiveness as seen in other menus.  Allocating workers to specific areas of focus is even worse: you click, hold, and drag the worker's name to the area of focus, and need to hit the right spot (often not even where the box for the area of focus is) in order to allocate the worker.\n\nPerhaps, though, this clumsiness in UI could be offset by a wide plethora of options, giving players an unprescedented level of control over the games they develop?  At first, it appears so: there are multiple areas of focus that you must balance your time between - starting off with only a few options (Gameplay, Engine, Graphics, Sound, Level Design, Content Design, Sound Design, and Writing), but quickly conflating with the additions of UI, Scripting, World Design, UI Design, and Networking.  With 13 areas of focus, it may seem that the development of each game will be a complex process of determining where sacrifices can be afforded, and where they must be avoided.\n\nTo some degree, it is: at the beginning, before you figure out the 'magic formula' for your genre of choice -- which changes as you add the further areas of focus, so that's something -- you will make mistakes and have to change your approach a couple of times.  After that, though, you'll find you're spending the majority of your focus on 1/3rd to 1/2 of the game development, which is hardly different from GDT.  Put simply, the thirteen areas of focus are unnecessary divisions for which there is little necessity, merely more content for the illusion of complexity.\n\nSimilarly, worker allocation appears, initially, to be more complex than GDT: there are a lot of different areas of focus, so management of human resources appears to be something which may change on a case-by-case basis.  The only problem with this is that your areas of focus, especially if you stick to a genre (which is adviseable, as genre-switching is largely punished in a passive manner by the game), will not really change, so neither will your worker allocation.  The only added flexibility which this provides is that each worker specializes in specific areas of game development, but this is also something which occured in GDT.  Through real estate, though, you can hire enough workers to have specialists in each category, but after the costs of these human resources is offset by profit, one no longer needs to truly manage their employees in a meaningful way -- there is no room for compromise and challenge in that system.\n\nSurely, though, the greater flexibility in story, content, and pricing/marketing make up for this?  Not in the least.  The three sliders for violence, profanity, and sexuality seem like an interesting subdivision of 'E', 'T', and 'M', except that ratings largely have little to no effect on maximizing profit, and you will nearly always be pushed toward developing 'M' or 'Ao' games.  Further, once you translate, there's the potential for necessitating player creativity in balancing the desires of the puritanical, but ultraviolent English demographic, and the trigger-shy, but perverted German demographic.  This doesn't exist, as the content largely does not affect the sales to a huge degree, unless you go overboard.  You can leave half the demographic wanting 'more', and they'll still eat up a game over 75% like hot cakes.\n\nStory budget and story topic are unnecessary divisions from the 'topic' selection and 'story' slider in GDT.  The story budget has little to no effect on how well the reviewers will receive the story -- that comes from focus on the written content, at the areas of focus screen.  The topic selection is simply in a different place, and even following a current light or strong trend only results in a small discrepancy between profits from not following a trend.\n\nAfter story and budget, one can decide how the game is packaged: really, it's just a choice between what terrible set of 2000s flash-grade art you'll force on your customers, and the casing increases costs of distribution but has either little to no effect on sales -- this can't be confirmed, really, by the player, as there is no feedback given on what seems to be a largely aeshtetic choice without any necessity.\n\nThe only feature that has been added which truly impacts gameplay is the pricing per unit option: this influences the profit margin and how well the game will sell.  Even this is done rather poorly, as the player will always be able to sell under average list, make a decent enough profit from distribution, and never have any incentive to play the market above the list price with a superior product.\n\nFinally, there are multiple bugs and poor design decisions in user interactivity.  Switching between rooms to access your employees is a chore at best, and breaks the UI for critical amounts of time at worst.  Employees will often bring up concerns or suggestions with the player: this would be fine, except that when two content windows pop up, the employee one is lost and relegated to the news sidebar, which is a pain to navigate.  Multiple offices impacts the UI lag even further, making the game a sluggish and unfun exercise.  There are several one-off training and upgrade options, but these have little impact on gameplay as a whole.\n\nAt its core GGM appears to be a new, complex addition to the game development genre: when fully analyzed, it's little more than a badly-implemented clone, which would feel more at home in Early Access.","August 11, 2014","false","5.2"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","19","37","0","1"

Which is true, because you can see what parts of the design are important for which genre, if you happen to develop a second title in the same genre.\nWhat is also fairly nice, is that you can compare your game to the competition.(The little dreamer in myself would wish a real leaderboard with games which other people made on it, but this is just wishful thinking)\n\nYou start off the same way as you do in Game Dev Tycoon. You are alone and develop your way out into a bigger building. Since you have seperate rooms now you can choose wether you want an additional developer room or a design room. Here comes one of my complaining points into the game. Since (early on) you only have 2 types of employees(designers and developers) you have quite a limited pool in terms of employees. As it happened in my first playthrough, I built a developer room and as I went on to hire a developer, the only employees available were designers, which i cannot put into a developer room.\nIf this restriction would be loosened in any way(for example give penalties on the performance of the worker), I would find that good.\n\nThere are also differences in the way leveling up characters work. Instead of training a certain treat, you level up generally and distribute skillpoints afterwards.\n\nWith that said, we come to the question: Is it worth it? Yes, it is, but there are some restrictions from my side:\nGenerally I think this game deserves it space, but in my opinion I don't see enough novelty in this title that jsutifies the purchase, when you already have Game Dev Tycoon.\nSince both games have Free Demos available you can even take a look for yourself, which I would do, if I didn't have neither game.","August 8, 2014","true","2.6"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","20","41","2","0"

I have been watching for many months to see the progress and here are my impressions.\n\nIt's similar in graphics to Game Dev Tycoon but it is NOT Game Dev Tycoon! While I was a big fan of Game Dev, there were a lot of things about that game that I kept on thinking would be great to have in this type of game. Well GamersGoMakers delivers in a big way!! It's got a wonderful "feel" to it. You start out small, and sell your first copies of your first game and you might be lucky enough to crack 1000 copies sold! Up to 10k copies, it keeps track of exact numbers and then rounds them off which doesn't bother me at all. After that, you can start to do a little bit of research and open up a few new options as you go. Your second game might be a hit, or it might totally tank! I made a game in the same genre and people had high expectations because I was doing the same genre again, and I totally failed. The game got higher scores but I made a lot of people upset because of my previous experience earned in the genre, it should have been better!\n\nMy 3rd game ended up being a hit! 10K copies sold and I entered a new genre and it put me on the map and some money in the bank so now I was able to purchase training and researtch options! This was all in just the demo! I made a few more games and I found the pacing was excellent, you weren't rushed to get things done asap, you can take your time. Only want to make 1 giant game each year? Go ahead! Want to make 3 or 4 games quickly your first year and each of your first few years to get on the map? Go ahead! It's really up to you. You have so many options to choose from, even the country you want to start in each with it's own perks and bonuses.\n\nI did enjoy in Game Dev being able to make your own engine and while it's nice, it's not totally necessary. You have many skills which level up and I actually think the leveling up system in GGM is much better. You don't have skills level up very quickly, it takes a long time. I made 6 games and only a few skills had gone up by 1 level which is awesome. It makes you really focus on what you want to do as a company. Do you want to be a specialist in game design and sound? Go ahead! Prefer graphics, game engine and gameplay? Go ahead? Want to be well rounded? Keep it focused on spreading out points evenly!\n\nAfter 6 games I had marketing options and extra genres/sub genres open up. You don't choose the ones you want, they just open up over time which I actually quite like too because it's exciting to see which topic comes along next. I love the way you get to "write" your game story and you get to choose what the actual game will be about.\n\nYou also get to design your game cases before you release and choose your selling price! There are lots of helpful indicators of how much games in your genre are worth at the current time, which ones are trending right now, you can choose to release in many languages if you want, you can risk a higher price if your game is trendy right now and it even tells you how many similar games to yours are on the market currently!! I can't even begin to describe all the content in this game but it's amazing and there's so much depth to it!\n\nYes there will always be things people aren't happy with and there's always room to improve in everything in life but this game has really captured an amazing feel and I will be ranking it very highly! I love sim games and this to me has delivered on everything that I was hoping for!! VERY impressed with the game and the people that made it! I am giving it a 9.5/10 Simply amazing game!","August 8, 2014","true","48.9"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","17","35","0","2"

I received feedback that my FIFA World Cup licensed game didn't have enough sex in it, for example.

This is definetly a early release.","August 15, 2014","true","29.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game at least once can play more than 4 hours, a variety of settings and events for the game player feel is a game developer! Of course, "GamersGoMakers' still needs a lot of improvement, such as the vulnerability of normal game start interface as well as the picture and some implications.

It also allows you to pick the box design that your game is going to be shipped in. The gameplay is pretty good. eventhough the sprite player doesn't move. It allows you to pick what you spend more time on. Graphics, sound ect. The reviews let you know what you could of improved on.

The tutorial was excellent and thorough. I love that you can create more offices so that you create more advanced games. The reviews, after you make a game, are realistic and are multiple comments. So for the writing and scripting, this is a good game.\nHowever, I'm giving it a thumbs down because it gets somewhat confusing at some point in the game. For example, you have to keep track of which factors fit the genre of the game. (Ex. Adventure=High quality writing, Graphics, Level Design) It doesn't keep track of that; you have to do it yourself. I literally have scratch paper and writing down what each genre needs. Later on though, I feel like that doesn't matter. I developed a game in ACTION genre and you need to concentrate on Graphics, Sound, Gameplay and Level Design (around the beginning). So of course I concentrated on those fields and less in the other factors. Then when the game came out and judged me on the REVIEW SCREEN, it showed that my character didn't pay attention to the Graphics or Level Design. It's almost as if this is by chance.\nIn conclusion, this game definitely has potential, but with bugs like that, it would kind of tick off a guy and make you take a break. I'm probably not going to play it for another day or two. I really felt like those notes I took meant nothing. You're better off trying to use your judgement alone as a gamer.","June 7, 2015","false","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are so many things to do, of course developing games, sequels, making new editions of older games, addons, MMOs, consoles and many more!\n\nThere are 15 available rooms to build, everyone is upgradeable, and for example in GDT and GDS you could have 6 employess (In GDT it was 6 + You), there you can have 6 workers in one room!\nThe real estate system is really cool.\n\nThere are so many platforms and TONS of researches and trainings available!\n\n45 Years (From 1980 to 2025) is like 18 - 20h in real life, and you can play after 2025, it's satisfacting.\n\nAs Cons I would mark the UI, it looks cartoonish, and doesn't really fit in game's climate, thought you can acclimate to that.\nAnd as an small con, the fact that all games sell for 90 days.. it just doesn't make sense..\n\nBut don't forget about modding!\nIt's really easy, to make a new platform just make some image of it, then add 1 line of "code" (it's more like an list of variables), and done!\nYou can do the same with EVERYTHING else! Epic!\n\nAnd the game is still growing! There will be really cool stuff in next updates!\n\nThe Audio and Visuals.. who cares!? It's an Strategy! But anyway, those platforms look really great. Music is a bit repetitive, but It perfectly fits in this game.\n\nOh yeah, the reviews.. great!\nYou don't just get the 2/10 rating and don't know what's wrong.\nYou have everything described, so your next game can be bestseller!\n\nMy suggestion: if you liked GDT, or you just like this kind of Startegy, [b[buy it[/b]. The game is pretty cheap, I would say that 9,99$\nis not enough.\n\nDon't forget to check the Forums and Wiki, many usefull informations can be found there.\n\nPS: I haven't played only 3h, I had non-Steam version before.","August 8, 2014","true","25.6"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","0"

If you look at it as that then there isn't any point in buying it as it is a completely seperate thing all-together.\n\nGamersGoMakers is a game-development game: a few of many in this genre. It brings some interesting things to the table: organizing all of your employees, filling their needs, the ability to have a bunch of rooms in one giant building, and all-around a very in-depth micromanagement system that has you very involved in making your own game.\n\nThere are, of course, some downsides. No.1: it's not in early access, which can be misleading to people who think it is a fully relesed title; I don't condone early access anyway so it's not that big of a problem.\nNo. 2: The art style is pretty unimaginiative. Nothing really stands out: the textures and colours are pretty lackluster, and don't pop out of the screen at all. (maybe perhaps not the console/game box designs) No. 3: The UI could definitely do with some improving: the buttons look reflective and horrible, some of the text has spelling mistakes and the overall screen just feels cluttered once you get into it. But, these are pretty minor discrepancies depending on how you look at them.\n\nOverall? I would give this a 7/10. It's a very in-depth game-making simulator where you can realistically go through periods of time and develop a wide range of games for each generation of consoles. Perhaps some general touching up all-around could make this a brilliant little game.\n\n70 hours spent well.

However, this game only gets a low score of 5/10 since they are quite wierd (looks like they just used Clip Art for this game). The rooms look cool (and change over different time periods), the attention to detail is very high and it's clear how much time the spent re-making different cosoles, game ect.\n\nCustomization\nYou can customize a ton of different things in this game from the games packaging to different buildings. The game packages are terrible, they have just searched through Google Images or Clip Art for some pictures that feel just 'crammed' into the game. But apart from that, I'll give this topic a high score of 8/10. The only downside is that it's quite hard to get 100% on any game as you usually can't remember what skills your team is good at, so you might pick extra points for what skills your squad is good at which will give you a lower score. But you can change tons of things in your game such as Graphics, Gameplay, UI, AI, Level design, World design and much, much more. You can also choose what rooms in your building have what purpose, such as making a Research lab. After you progressed enough into the game, you can make your own Game engines, they will help make your games better and speed the entire game making process up, however you'll need to make new ones every 2-10 ingame years to keep up with the latest technology.\n\nGameplay\nYou can create games, make Game engines, make consoles, basically you can make a lot of stuff. Your team will upgrade over their time in game developement, as will you, however it gets a little bit slower at the endgame section of GGM. You have rival companies and you have to either buy them out (only available after the year 2000) or be bought out! If you're a newcomer, it is frustrating to see your rivals getting high scores of 75% or more, while you are getting 60% at most on your games. Another problem is going bakrupt after only a few years (especially if you start in the year 2000). Other than that, it's a very fun game with lots of jokes and references.\n\nPros VS Cons\nPros:\nCustomization is very nice\nOne game lasts a long time\nFun\nReferences\nLots of jokes\nYou can do a lot of things\nCheap game\nMore features than Game Dev Tycoon (a very similar game)\n\nCons:\nGraphics are not good at all\nThe game case creator is just... a big no.\n\nIs it worth the money?\nThis is a hard question as it's not for everyone. However is you are a hardcore gamer, this game is a straight up yes, especially since it has so much jokes.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:   Follow Original Curators Group\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

If you have played Game Dev Tycoon you 'll have to skip this one cause although different in some points and gameplay aspects, it's way lesser polished than GDT. The thing is that i wished that there was a game with more depth and details than GDT. When I found GamersGoMakers i hoped that the game did just that. Well to a point it does since there are many more ways to develop a game and to manage your team, you can design your game cover and do a bunch of fun stuff that GDT lacked.\nBut, GamersGoMakers seems more generic and lacks a certain sense of nostalgia and soul that GDT had. In GDT you got messages for each upcoming console that were actual homages to the history of gaming. In GamersGoMakers you receive some generated messages that just fill in the blanks with the console name and some stats. Your stuff interacts with you in a generic, dull way and even the reviews that are a good part of the game, based on genre points, feel totally unrelated to the game you created at times.\nGameplay wise, GDT managed to create a challenge and a sense of progress, GamersGoMakers gets too boring after a while since you feel that you are playing a randomly generated sandbox game.\nIf you haven't played GameDev Tycoon and can't decide which one to pick, i strongly recommend GameDev Tycoon even though the games are quite different. GameDev Tycoon is just more honest and complete as a product much as it lacks stuff that GamersGo Makers feature but fails to use properly.","October 11, 2014","false","2.7"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

In fact, just early on as soon as you develop certain technologies like A.I and User Interface, it will be almost impossible to develop anything just above the average.\n\nGamersGoMakers also feels a bit unfinished and rushed and there’s no sense of progress throughout the game.\nThe best is definitely the soundtrack – nice and cool soundtrack that fit the game perfectly.\n\nI would say that Game Dev Tycoon is still better as the user interface is more interactive and simple and despite not going so deep, it is simple and ends up being a better experience.\n","August 9, 2014","false","8.7"," 20 of 44 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","20","44","0","2"

Thats partly true. But the developers did add a few new twists to the game. Unfortunatly those new twists are bad implemented or just an illusion of impact.\n\nIn this whole type of game it's natural to have randomness as a keyelement of the game. Though in GamersGoMakers it's the only element.\n\nYou don't have the feeling of development as you had in GDT. Here you'll always make games with  scores of 50-70% and so you're bound to keep doing Publishing Contracts to grow. Publishing contracts will give you an income of 600k and producing an 70% Title without publisher will give you about 30-50k.\nThat makes no sense. How does the publisher make any money with the 60% games I've developed for them for 600k.?\n\nI've created about 40 games and all 40 were about 50-70% and one game got a 90%. Tough it seemed really random as I used the exact same settings as the game before that got 70%.\n\nShort: The game gives a big illusion of complexity and choice and after a while you get behind it and realise it's just pure dice rolling of the PC. That + the really bad UI leads to a boring game.\n\nI sinked about 60 hours into Game Dev Tycoon and I easily get hooked by these types of games, but GamersGoMakers is a bad Tycoon game.","February 4, 2015","false","5.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It's nice when you want to play through a game and have fun.\nIt's customisable, and when I say this I don't mean a little bit, it's very customisable and is definatly fun to customise it all.\nIt's extremely fun at first, when you begin it's fun finding the best things and milking them.\nCons:\nIt's grindy! There are little upgrades, for what I thought it could do and what you could upgrade. For now, it's develop a game with 80% or higher, and then completly milking it. I got up to my 78th game of just ONE series and they still earned me millions. As for the consoles, they're extremely OP. I fineshed the game with about 50billion. Meaning there was no risk at all.\nAgain, it's either make an amazing game and farm it and never risk debt, or live it by the wire and most likely instantly go broke.\nThe soundtrack is repetitve, I've heard the songs SO MANY TIMES. Uhg!\nThe UI is often glitchy, and prioritys are mixed up. By this, I mean when you're scrolling through all your floors and places in your building, and then suddenly something pops up asking about your game or console or something, and you have to move your mouse, click accept, move it back down, up to the top and then over the home icon again. It's a pain.\nGraphics are repetitive.\n8/10, Nice game, quite innotavative and advanced. Plenty of options, just there are some things that can be done in a patch. It's also quite sad when you really think about it, how time REALLY flies by, and when everyone you know starts leaving and abandons you. It's quite sad in my opinion. Either way, great game, quite easy once you've started and just like spore it gets ridiculously grindy and almost pointless at about 2015.","April 5, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are similarities between Battlefront and Call of Duty, and I don't see people saying one is the rip off of the other. Game Dev simulations is a very small genre, as far as I know, only a handful of games have been made that have been successful.\n\nI really like the, it has a lot more depth than Game Dev Tycoon, which is more of a casual game. GamersGoMakers I believe is a much better game overall, though the UI isn't as good and the name is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥. (Really, GamersGoMakers was the best thing you came up with?). I hope the developers of this game make another game, or add on to it. There are some cons that can be a bit annoying. The game doesn't completely shut down, so if exit the game, it wont restart unless you completely shut down steam. While there are tutorials that pop up, the game has no manual/tutorial that you can pull up whenever you need help, so if you miss a popup or forget something, you have to figure it out yourself.\n\nAnother annoying feature is that games are only on sale for 90 days (up to 120 if you extend it), but that is it. That kind of limits a lot. Maybe I haven't gotten to that point yet, but I'd love to see the option to make multiple games at once. I think that is something that both this game and Game Dev Tycoon got wrong.\n\nBut overall, I really like the game. I'd recommend it to anyone who liked Game Dev Tycoon, or anyone who likes business management in general. Very well done. The developers earned my respect and my money. Hopefully it goes towards making better games.","April 6, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it does sound a lot like Game Dev Tycoon, a fantastic game, GGM does differ in it's own ways, like Game Reviews that help you improve your games, Movie/TV Liscenses, More consoles, Game Covers, a different approach to how to make your games, and etc.\n\nThe High Points (pros)The first thing to note about Gamersgomakers is simple: it's addictive. It starts out pretty quickly, with no set-up needed, and remains that way throughout. This game also has some inventive ideas that I really haven't seen in other games since, like a mock ESRB. The reviews are also really nice, too. Finally, and I believe this is what hooked me the most to this game, the awards. While other games have done this mechanic before, I believe GGM does it justice with more than just a 'GOTY' award.\n\nIn Summary:\n-Inventive ideas\n-Addictive\n-Reviews\n-Requires no real set-up\n-Awards\n\nThe Low Points (cons)Sadly, while this game is grand, there's a fair amount of low points to counter the good parts.\nFor starters, the ability to have your games banned.\nYou can make Adult's Only games in this game, but DON'T do that, because 9.5 out of 10 times, if you are to make one of those games, it gets banned in a certain country almost instantly. This is an annoying mechanic that makes an interesting idea pointless, and it really sucks. Another thing that sucks about this is that, for a game that tries to mirror in a bit of realism, this is not realistic. Remember Hatred, or the original POSTAL?\nSure, some people wanted these twisted games banned, but guess what...\nthey weren't!\nAnother thing that sucks is simple: this game is practically a bunch of timers. In Game Dev Tycoon, making games was investing because it was quick & simple, and in most cases, you were on the edge of your seat, hoping it wouldn't be a flop. In this game, that's non-existent. Making a game is long and tiresome, and will almost never have you on the edge of your seat. This game also has no animations... it's odd, and I just wanted to point it out.\nOn the topic of short things I dislike with this game, custom covers.\nIt sounds good on paper, but it's executed terribly. Basically, you have the option to chose a background, and a certain image, and there aren't many good images.\nThe final nail in this coffin?\nIt's buggy, full of typos, and has been abandoned by the developer. Sure, a group of people are trying to buy the license to update it, but... that campaign isn't going too well.\n\nIn Summary:\n-Mechanics that ruin other mechanics\n-Making games is mostly uninvolving\n-No animations\n-Terribly executed "custom" covers\n-Abandoned by the dev\n-Buggy, and full of typos\n\nIN CONCLUSION (verdict)GGM, at heart, is a decent game, with high ambitions. However, some of these ideas don't work so well, and the game suffers because of that. Making games is mostly uninvolving, takes too long, and will make you want to go elsewhere. Character animations are practically non-existent, and the custom covers aren't very good off paper. The saddest part is that the dev will no longer be supporting this, which is in need of support due to a tsunami of typos and bugs.\nGet it on sale if you really want to try it,\nbut don't pay $10 for this like I did.\n\nFINAL GRADE: D+","May 17","false","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
