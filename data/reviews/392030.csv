"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_wwwwwwwwwwwwww/recommended/392030/","_wwwwwwwwwwwwww","Taro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_wwwwwwwwwwwwww/","216 products in account","Before starting I should mention that I have had more time with this game than my total playtime would indicate as I have played the Japanese version prior to the Steam release.\n\nThe game is described as a hybrid shmup/puzzle game- but, I personally feel that it becomes something entirely unique by combining elements of the two. While some skills from other shmups will carry over to this game- if you try to play it too much like a classic shmup then it's easy to quickly be consumed by the onslaught of enemy projectiles.\n\nRather than firing a constant stream of bullets the player only has a single bullet that can be fired once at a time. This bullet can clear weaker enemy bullets from the screen- but it's mainly used to hit blocks that spawn around the level. By knocking these blocks into each other the player is able to create explosions which can clear the area of bullets and destroy enemies. This means that rather than confront enemies directly the player must use the bullet to set up explosive combos and clear a path before they become overwhelmed.The game is designed in such a way that it's able to retain the high intensity and do-or-die nature of a shmup while also including the intricacy and deliberation of a puzzle game.\n\nMuch like the developer, Tetsu’s, other games- this game also features a few secrets and a clever way of presenting the narrative through the design of the game. Combine this with Watson’s amazing music and you end up with an intriguing somber atmosphere that’s difficult to find elsewhere.\n\nI could talk at length about this game and the developers other works- but I’ll keep it short.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fresh take on a classic genre then I would highly recommend checking this game out- and if you’re in the market for even more underappreciated niche titles then go and give Demon King Chronicle and Irisu Syndrome a try too!","May 13","true","19.9"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeugziumy/recommended/392030/","zeugziumy","Zeugziumy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeugziumy/","223 products in account","Murasaki finally gets an English release on Steam. The original game was in Japanese. I originally played the Japanese version (without understanding a single word) and later on I saw it would get a release on Steam with English version. I'm a fan of Wtetsu's work, so I bought, even if I had played the Japanese version previously.\n\nThis is a bullethell game with some puzzle mechanics (borrowed from his other game, "Irisu Syndrome!, which is free-ware by the way"). You can shoot directly through the enemies (only one shot on screen, but they don't take long to vanish), or make chains with the red squares and blue circles. You can also use bombs in case you have too much stuff on screen. On bosses, sometimes a "kano" (red thingy) drops it and you can catch it. If you manage to beat it, you'll receive a brief part of the story on the Collection, along the time it took for you to defeat that part of the boss.\n\nThe idea of shooting on other objects that aren't necessarily the boss works pretty well. Dodging the boss bullet's and doing something else while doing so.\n\nYou have two characters in your disposal on the beginning (I don't know if you can unlock more later, I haven't beat it completely yet, but by seeing the store page, I don't think so). Each one has their own abilities. Kairi which is a more balanced character and Satsuki which has more power, but more difficult to use. Each character has different dialogues as well (on bosses), and you need to play as each to unlock certain information about the story (unlocked on the collection).\n\nSpeaking of collection, you can unlock various goodies (like music, character information, and such) while you progress in-game.\n\nI just feel a little pricey for a simple game like this. Another problem is there is no way to "slow down" your character to dodge the bullets more easily, especially how the character moves kinda fast in this game. May be a good or bad thing, depending of your skill level.\n\nSmall bug: For some reason, the game seems to disable the Windows key (Running on Windows 7, 64-bits).\n\nPros:\n- Good soundtrack;\n- Interesting gameplay;\n- Multiple routes (two characters to play as with different dialogue, and both of them unlocks specific features on the collection and your main story);\n- Portrait artwork is pretty good.\n\nMiddle:\n- Sprites and effects are ok.\n\nCons:\n- No button for slow down the character (may not be a con, actually);\n- Kinda pricey right now.\n(Note: Game purchased on Brazil. The price on your location can be cheaper or more expensive).\n\n(I may update this review when I beat it or something).","May 13","true","1.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amaterasv/recommended/392030/","amaterasv","Toucan Rumble","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amaterasv/","57 products in account","Murasaki does a good job of introducing higher difficulties for its original mechanics; you're not going to play bullet hell game the same way again(And luckily for me, I don't play other bullet hell games that much since Touhou 9).\n\nBeen playing since first day release in its original Japanese version, and I still haven't beat 6th stage. it is increasingly difficult like every stage is more than twice the difficulty of the previous, but it is learnable with low-moderate frustration when you're new. The tolerance between complete failure and perfection gets tighter, but this is where its 'puzzler' element comes in and rewards perfection and better play satisfyingly, something I don't really feel it could ever come up from a Bullet-Hell game(usually normal enemies would come out, spit you patterns to dodge while hitting them and enemy patterns would just be forgotten, but not this one).\n\nThe minimalistic(when compared to other Bullet-hell) concept is what it is and you have to overcome them as its featured mechanics(Otherwise it might not be your cup of tea)\n\nGot the OST in CD and its always a treat for me to listen to T_Watson/MusMus(The soundtrack creator) works, A mix of genres here and there keeping the experience fresh(Yeah I still have to pay for the dlc to show that I own it don't I?)\n\nPrice point? I tend to support and ready to be a fan of what I'm paying for, otherwise I'm not buying; I'm not sure anyone need to buy then complain a perfectly working game that is fun to play.(Someone had already 100% Murasaki with hard mode on all stages, so its not 'untested' incompletable game). If I had it for free before and have to pay for localized version, given the chance to support the dev for making original concepts that works, why not? (Or maybe its because I've spent so much effort in the fanbase basically $5 means nothing)\n\nThanks for listening to my wish that this game has made its way into Steam! that was unexpected, but I've been using steamoverlay for Murasaki long before this game is even announced for localization, for screenshotting my way trying to read the Japanese version. :D","May 13","true","37.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"
