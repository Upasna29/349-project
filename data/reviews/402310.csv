"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rueya/recommended/402310/","rueya","Rueya","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rueya/","379 products in account","Overfall is a fantasy turn-based rpg filled with tons of lite questing as you forge your own destiny by leading two heroes on a path to unite a single race of your choice torn by faction and conflict. Here are some of its most prominent features to give you the gist of it:\n\n\nPROS:\n*High replay value due to ton of unlockables from Classes, to Companions, to Trinkets, to Weapons, to new Skills/Spells.\n\n*Neat turn-based battle featuring the usage of a 3 step action-point system consisting of Movement (Step 1), Utility (Step 2), and Attack (Step 3). This allows tons of combo and synergy between classes and companions!\n\n*A dynamic world where each race is in constant conflict with their arch rivals. Picking sides will further improve relations with one but at the expense of a deteriorating relationship with the other. This will reflect in the World Map (Seafaring) where they will chase each other with their ships, and you for helping their enemies.\n\n*Tons of questing variety based on the different factions you can interact with for further replay value. Numerous dialogue bubbles will emerge during your quest for you to select with differing results based on your hero class composition.\n\n*Tons of variety from how a character looks, with a character aesthetic that grows on you, from the heroes, to companions, to npcs, to enemies.\n\n*Despite the familiarity of the races, many of these have their own backstory and lore, unique to Overfall. These races consist of a nemesis system involving Orcs vs Forsaken, Elves vs Hollows, and Dwarves vs Goblins, with a wild card consisting of the Vorn who is the aggressor, the Undead who populate razed territories, the Everguard who are somewhat neutral, and minor factions like Pirate Ships, Merchant Ships, and Guild Ships.\n\n\nNEUTRAL:\n*A single play-through can be done in a relatively short time (1-3 hours). Quest are lite at best and does not have a strong narrative. This suits multiple playthroughs but does not reward players looking for a long and deep narrative.\n\n*Buffs and Debuffs in turn-based battles are a huge part of Overfall with icons to symbolize them. Tons of strategy can be garnered from it, including combos from the stacking of buffs and debuff effects, offering greater depth. This might or might not be your cup of tea as you will need to diagnose its various status effects very often.\n\n*Enemy AI during turn-based battles are punishing and does not hold back to ensure that the weakest link, health and defense wise comprising of your support heroes or companions are targeted with every opportunity the AI can get. Due to the rather medium to small battle layout combined with relatively high enemy movement, strategies to protect your supporters will be a challenge.\n\n*Healing can be done at the world map by food consumption, at Inns where you can sleep and heal, and during turn-based battles in small portions via timed spells (for the most part) where healing will only commence on the next turn. You will need to plan ahead to ensure your party maintains a feasible health count before and during a battle.\n\n*Personas which have positive or negative traits are a huge part of Overfall. Your heroes will aquire traits when you fulfil a certain requirement in-game which may completely affect your party stats either via benefiting or downright screwing your play-through to a certain degree. There is an option to remove all Personas at the Inn.\n\n*Only two heroes can be selected at the start with extra slots for an additional two companions that will gradually join later on in the game. If both of your heroes die (permadeath) despite your companions being kept alive, the game will be instantly over. There is an option to resurrect a fallen hero, but at a cost.\n\n*Unlockables are done from fulfilling various requirements from a mixture of hero composition, hero traits, and island types which will then trigger a questline where rewards can be unlocked once the game is over.\n\n*The only manual control you will get (apart from combat) is via the world map where you control your very own ship. Upon landing on one of the many islands, a quest will ensue which happens via fade-in and fade-out sequences as it changes scenery from one location to the next. While this is somewhat linear, it will fare well for creators to contribute their questlines to the Steam Workshop.\n\n\nCONS:\n*The map layout consist of randomly generated islands within a simple sea setting. Despite the heavy reliance of seafaring, the boat you are in is non upgradable and is merely used as a vessel for transportation between islands. While this is not its strong suit, it can be understood due to practicality purposes.\n\n*You will constantly be in a race against time as the Vorn (Antagonist) increase in forces while you rally a racial faction under your banner via doing quest. Things will get a little hectic and the world dynamism will be heavily skewed in the Vorns favor if you let the timer run its course.\n\n*Shop offers only basic upgrades in the form of upgradable skills and buffs. There are no buying of equipment. (The only way you will be able to change weapons, trinkets, and skillsets is by unlocking it in your play-through and selecting it from the character creation menu when you begin anew).\n\n*You are unable to customize the way your hero looks. You can however rename them.\n\n\nIt is pivotal to take note that I heartily enjoyed Overfall, including those under "Neutral" and would definitely recommend it. However, I do feel it is important to list these prominent features down so one could make an informed purchasing decision based on their sole preferences.","May 18","true","108.0"," 56 of 57 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","56","57","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/402310/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1198 products in account","From a single thread, many destinies are woven.\n\nTo begin with, I'd like to dully note that I'm not really a fan of the rogue-like genre. In all RPGs, I'd very much prefer being able to save my progress, 'cause I mainly play these kind of games for the story and the high probability of losing all my progress to a silly mistake that I may make in any given time is pure dread to me. But I'll make an exception and recommend a rogue-like today, considering it's story-driven part has overcome all my distaste towards the genre. Overfall, and everything that this game may offer are wondrously intriguing and fully enriched with countless things to stumble upon and discover.\n\nAs there would be a beginning to any story, our story begins with an old war. As the human armies manage to claim their utmost victory against orcish hordes - don't worry, this won't turn out to be the millionth orcs vs. humans tale - the wise Everking foresees a greater threat in the threads of future. He summons two heroes to his citadel and sends them on a quest to a foreign realm inhabited by the Vorn, a nation of ruthless barbarians. As ordered from them, these heroes overcome the challenges of the realm and steal the Disc of Ages, an odd artifact with immense power and questionable origins. As they manage to steal the artifact and go back to their native realm, hordes of Vorn follow them to retrieve the artifact at all costs. As if all this chaos is not enough, our heroes find their native realm in turmoil, ravaged by the endless war between other inhabitants of the realm: dwarves, orcs, elves, goblins, hollows and the forsaken. As informed by a messenger of the oracle Ezel, we are to take on a quest to prove ourselves to the leaders of this realm, gaining favor from their races. Only then, may we find the Everking and put an end to the Vorn invasion.\n\nThe tides are rising... They are coming.\n\nPhew, as you can see we don't have a scarcity of action in this tale. Lots to do, to discover, to wage war for and claim. Let's take a closer look on the game dynamics though. As I have stated before, Overfall is a rogue-like RPG. If your party is to perish during combat, you start a new game. But with each playthrough, you possibly unlock a series of other upgrades, various companions and talents which could be chosen during your new playthroughs. We take the role of two heroes - a fighter and a cleric as we start, but there are many other unlockable classes to pick as we progress - and lead them in their journey. We travel with a ship and visit different islands or cross paths with other ships which will all contain various well-written random encounters that we may pursue with either diplomacy or pure combat. Through these encounters, we collect heroes, allies, materials, abilities; and progress our main story by choosing a side in this conflict of many nations. As time passes, the Vorn invasion takes a progress also, changing the tone and the difficulty of the travelling map equally.\n\nDisplay options are incredibly good with countless unique cartoonish character designs and beautifully arranged background arts. The introduction cinematic is a triumphant beauty with ink swirl art and strong narrative depiction. As we rarely stumble on the rogue-genre, the whole world is living and it is more than possible to discover an encounter that you are yet to see in your 20th playthrough or even furthermore. All encounters that you may pursue carry well written script and appropriate choice options to deal with given problems. The subtext of most encounters are weaved out of both humorous and fitting homages to the fantasy genre itself.\n\nI wouldn't know much about an appropriate rogue-like gameplay, but RPG options are better than most RPG games out there; both with encounter variety and character ability customization through unlockables. Your characters will gain random treats that will affect their abilities through their experiences, yet using your environment and choosing your battles carry utmost importance for any encounter you may stumble upon. Dying is a natural part of the game, and it's fine as you may use all unlocked abilities in a new playthrough anyhow. The default difficulty has been a tad bit cruel for my own gaming abilities, so I'm glad that there has been a recent patch to arrange difficulty. Now I can actually play the game and enjoy the story with an easy mode!\n\nI've been following this one from Early Access and I'm not usually in favor of promoting those since you'd never know if it would actually worth it, but the attentiveness of the developer crew has been not only promising, it's briefly exalted! The game gets a minor update here and there nearly every day; and a major one once in a week to either add a new option or improve gameplay with countless fixes. Their reply rate in the community and their manner of addressing every little detail gracefully are all welcoming changes in this market. I strongly hope Overfall to get a lasting place among all-time favorites of all roguelike and RPG lovers alike! This is a journey worthy of taking any day!\n\nDisclosure: A key has been provided by the developer for the purpose of this review.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","April 10","true","36.6"," 50 of 53 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","50","53","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/recommended/402310/","el_kemosabe","El Kemosabe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/","1115 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAnother Human/Orc settlement needs your assistance!\nOverfall is a story-driven rogue-like with turn-based combat from developers, Pera Games. You play as two adventurers who have been stuck in a mysterious portal for three centuries. A lot has changed in three centuries and you now face a world being ravaged by a faction called the Vorn. This group of experienced and ruthless raiders are not only incredibly dangerous, they are expanding incredibly quickly and it is up to you stop them!\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.\n\nAs you can see from the store page, Overfall is a good looking game (and it’ll only ever look that good since the game’s graphics settings are limited to resolution). The combat animations are all very good as well, sometimes they felt a little over-the-top but nothing too bad. However, Overfall’s audio is currently a bit hit and miss. This is because, while the sound effects are great, there quite a few actions which do not have sound effects. Again, it’s not a huge issue and I imagine they’ll be added in later since it is an Early Access game but I did find it a little jarring when some characters/actions made sounds and others didn’t in combat.\n\nYour goal in Overfall is to stop the Vorn. As you’d imagine, you’re not going to be able to stop a huge faction of raiders on your own, you’re going to have to help the game’s other factions to gain their support. The other factions are:\nHumans\nOrcs\nEverguards\nGoblins\nElves\nDwarves\nForsaken\nHollowImproving your relationship with these factions high enough will make them view you as a friend/ally and so they’ll help you with your mission by giving you any resources you need when you visit their homeland. These missions generally entail helping the factions with issues in their settlements. Since most islands are home to two factions, such as Human/Orc, many of these missions have something to do with decreasing the tension between the two factions. You travel between the islands on your boat and as you travel, time passes. As time passes the game’s ‘doomsday clock’ progresses, meaning the Vorn grow in strength until they eventually win, unless you stop them of course.\n\nYour relationships with the game’s factions are improved by completing missions which help someone from one of the factions. Completing missions will also increase your worldwide recognition. As well as the Vorn, you are also unable to improve your relationship with Humans or the Everguards. Humans are always friendly and will still give you missions whereas the Everguards are more of an enemy faction, you can choose dialogue options to avoid fighting them but they aren’t the most likeable faction going so you’re probably going to want to kill them all! Once you’ve completed enough missions you’ll have high enough recognition to recruit up to two adventurers to help you in combat. Adventurers can be found all over the world and will ask to travel with you once you complete the missions associated with them. If you have a slot available, you can recruit them then but if you don’t, don’t worry! You can find adventurer ships travelling around which will allow you to recruit any of the adventurers you’ve found before (even from previous runs).\n\nStaying with unlocks, there are also main character classes, weapons, utility skills and trinkets to unlock. New classes are unlocked in a similar way to adventurers, you’ll come across a special mission where (from my experience) you will fight alongside the character with the class and when you win the fight they will be unlocked for any subsequent runs. As for weapons, skills and trinkets, I haven’t found any myself just yet but they are unlocked through completing special missions with very specific unlock requirements. New weapons come with new offensive skills, utility skills should be self-explanatory and new trinkets grant you certain bonuses such as “Weapon attacks have a 15% chance to heal self by 3”.\n\nCombat has three different phases: the movement phase; the utility phase and the combat phase (in that order). As it stands, once you end a phase you cannot return to the previous phase, however the developers are working on adding a way to return to the previous phase if you end it accidentally. In the movement phase, you can either move normally or use your character’s special move ability (with a two turn cooldown). These vary from character to character but they range from a massive leap dealing damage to adjacent enemies to leaving a healing aura on adjacent tiles while you walk to heal allies. The utility phase lets you use your class-specific skills. These skills are mainly focused on applying buffs to allies/yourself or applying debuffs to enemies but there are some skills that do other things too. The combat phase is where the real action happens, you can use your weapon-specific attacks to deal damage to your enemies. Melee focused classes can generally only attack targets adjacent to them but magic/ranged focused classes can attack from afar. One thing I will say, combat is tough as nails to begin with. Early on in a run you’ll want to avoid combat for the most part as pretty much anything can kill you, don’t pick fights you can’t win because believe me, you will die.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Overfall is actually a story-driven game, surprising for a rogue-like. You’d think this would have an impact on replay value but the game has two key features which, when considered with the game’s unlocks, mean the game does have a fair amount of replayability. First of all, your two main characters have special dialogue options during some conversations. Choosing one of these will make a difference to how the story plays out, even choosing different ‘normal’ dialogue will change how the story plays out. While these options aren’t enough to create an entirely new story, there’s enough variation (especially once you start playing with new classes) to prevent them from being tedious when you encounter them again. The stories themselves are generally very good though I did notice quite a few grammatical/spelling errors in the writing, not a huge issue but something worth mentioning. The other feature which helps keep things fresh is a built-in Story Builder with workshop support. This allows players to create and share their own quests which can be added to the game to supplement the quests already there. I haven’t played around with it too much but it does have a tutorial to help you get started and it does look reasonably straightforward to use.\n\nVerdict\nWith interesting stories, excellent turn-based combat, lots to unlock and great aesthetics, Overfall is a thoroughly enjoyable story-driven rogue-like.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","April 10","true","7.4"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","45","50","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/402310/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOpen world fantasy RPG\nOverfall is an open world fantasy RPG that was successfully funded on Kickstarter. It has a turn-based combat with a focus on party encounters. The game features over a hundred different locations and dozens of NPCs, party companions and enemies.\n\nThe game starts off with a small introduction and after creating your two starting characters you are tossed back into the world. The story is pretty simple, you were sent on a quest to another world by your king and while you were there, centuries passed on your homeworld, while to you it was only a few days. Now, on your return, you find out that your king has gone missing and that your world is in chaos with various factions fighting for control and supremacy.\n\nOn your quest you’ll be traveling by boat from island to island and you can board any ship you find at sea, and they will react to you depending on your reputation with said faction. During dialogue you can choose to either trade, attack or persuade the enemy.\n\nCombat will feel pretty familiar to anyone who has played any turn based tactical RPG. However, instead of having a certain number of moves per unit, Overfall arranges the combat in an interesting way. Each turn is divided into different phases: movement, utility and attack. During the Movement phase you can either move your character or use a special move ability such as leaping to get closer to your foes. On the Utility phase you can use abilities that don’t directly damage your enemies but still affect them in some way such as stunning or bleeding. On the last phase you get your chance to use offensive abilities to actually make some real damage to your enemies. I find this combat scheme to work rather well and it opens up many tactical opportunities.\n\nSome characters that you find on islands or ships will let you know about certain events, such as humans that require assistance on an island. Completing tasks such as these will raise or lower your reputation with the various factions. The thing about these random quests is that they are not linear, you can either attack the other party straight up or you can try talking your way out of a fight.\n\nCompleting these random events will reward with either reputation or one of the four resources that are in the game. You have Food which is used to heal party members, Dust which is used to upgrade Utility Skills or increase the speed of your ship, Rune that is used to ressurrect or hire new companions and Frag which is the currency in the game. Completing quests is necessary to upgrade your weapons and make your party stronger.\n\nPros:Simple yet challenging combat\nStory creator, which creates the possibility of infinite replayability\nGorgeous art style with beautiful backgrounds and some neat particle effects\nGreat and moody soundtrack\n9 different classes with full customization of skills, trinkets and weapons. You only start with a few, and it is fun to unlock more along the way\nFeels pretty complete for an early access game\nReputation system with six different factions: Orcs, Elvest, Dwarves, Goblins, Hollows and Forsaken\nNeutral:Permanent death, once you lose a character they are gone for good. If you lose all characters you have to restart into a new world. While I think that this will appeal to a lot of people, I feel like having the option to continue a previous world would be nice for players that don’t like permadeath\nCons:I feel like there are some balancing issues. You might end up running into a combat scene early on the game which you can’t beat but still, I guess this is reminiscent of the “roguelike genre”\nSome attacks/abilities have no sound effect but I figure this will be “fixed” on the final release version\nNo way to check what a certain buff or debuff actually does before using a specific skill. You’re only able to tell what each buff or debuff actually does after applying it, which will show a small icon above the character and if you move the mouse cursor over it you can see a small description of that status.\nOverall thoughts:\n\nOverfall is a great game and I was really surprised by it. The game by itself has a story mode with random encounters and several different classes and skills to choose from which makes the game perfect for multiple playthroughs. Not only that but the Story Creator only adds up to the replayability, even if you don’t fancy writing your own story to play, you can still check other peoples stories and download them on the Steam workshop. The combat is simple and easy to understand but yet, it requires thinking. Overfall plays great, feels great and runs great! Other than what I mentioned above, I believe I have no other complaints to make at the moment and I highly recommend this game to any fans of turn based combat RPGs or to people who are looking for a very replayable game.\n\nRating:\n\nI would rate Overfall a solid 8/10.\n\nWant more recommendations?

The story is solid. The dialogue is often quite hilarious and witty. Exploring islands is a lot of fun, and when you have died and started again.. and you run into an identical situation... it does not go as planned. Love that. Pretty refreshing.\n\nThe learning curve and advancement is also a lot of fun, some battles in the early game you must simply avoid (I got pwned so hard by running into a ship, on purpose, after only visiting two islands; 4 pirates vs a Cleric and a Fighter = doomed). The combat is so much fun with the bad-azz music that seems to crescendo at the right times. Awesome spell animations/fight animations.

A code was provided by the developer for review purposes.\n\nOverfall is a fantasy RPG roguelike game that sees two heroes begin a quest to save their king. They have just come back from stealing loot from the Vorm, but forgot to close the portal behind them, allowing an army of Vikings right into their kingdom through the backdoor. Your task throughout Overfall is to amass an army big enough to push them back through the portal that they came through.\n\nAt the start of the game, you are allowed to choose two heroes. Only two classes will be available at the start, warrior and cleric. Throughout the game you will unlock new classes to use on your adventure. There are 9 playable characters in total, with 36 combat companions to find. The game is completely non-linear – right from the start of the game you choose exactly where to go and when. You navigate around the world using a boat, sailing between islands which have unique events, quests and enemies to explorer. Everything in this game is completely procedurally generated, so much that anything can change depending on the make up or your party or depending on what actions you took in previous events. The aim of the game is to raise your reputation with enough different factions and races in the world to be able to band together with said factions and races to push back the Vorm army. Raising your reputation with these factions can be done either by completing quests, killing the races’ arch enemy in battle, or following through different random events throughout the world.\n\nOverfall’s combat system is one of the game’s flagship features. The turn based hex based combat system is extremely in-depth, but not so complex that you can’t pick this game up and start playing immediately. Although the game doesn’t have much of a tutorial system, you soon are able to pick up how to play the game to its full potential. Each character has three phases to their turn, a movement phase, utility phase and attack phase. The utility phase and attack phase is where most of the tactical advances are made. You are able to create combos between your party member’s different attacks. The game has a very strong emphasis on status effects, and boy is there a lot of status effects.  Almost every action apart from your regular movement will cause either a positive status effect or a negative effect. How you combat these effects is completely dependent on how well your tactical knowledge of the game has become.\n\nGraphically Overfall uses a unique art style, with all of the characters having a bobble head look to them, with some really detailed cartoon graphics along with them. All of the characters have their own interesting look as well as some nicely animated movement and attacks. The environments throughout the world are all diversely created that allows for different weather effects dependant on what type of island you have found yourself on, from snowstorms on mountains, to sand storms in the desert.  The sound effects are a little to be questioned about though; the majority of the effects are there and done to a high standard, but I did come across times when there was just missing sound effects. This detracted me from the immersion of the title and were a little off-putting a times unfortunately.  The soundtrack is definitely something this game should be proud of though. It is so beautifully put together with different instruments such as violins and harps. Combined they make a classical soundtrack that adds to the game’s atmosphere which almost makes up for the missing sound effect issues.\n\nA good rogue-like has plenty of replay ability, Overfall is no different. Whilst the game does feature perma death for your characters, your failed runs aren’t for nothing as you will end up unlocking different abilities, weapons and characters to use on future runs. This is what makes the difference between a good roguelike- and an amazing roguelike. It gives you another reason to keep playing after you fail. You will more than likely die a lot to begin with, as the opponent’s AI is extremely well tuned to add a sufficient amount of difficulty. Although the game play can sometimes feel repetitive, you are able to change your characters around so much at the start of a run, that you can get a completely different feel to the gameplay quite easily after you’ve unlocked a few extra options.\n\nOther than the missing sound effects problem, I didn’t really have any other technical problems. I would have liked to of seen controller support included as this sort of game really benefits from being able to use a controller and sitting back in your chair but you can’t have everything I suppose. The game supports most high end resolutions but sadly not up to 4k. There aren’t any graphical options as hopefully this game should run at a steady 60 fps regardless of what setup you are running.\n\nOverall I am absolutely having a blast with my time in Overfall, the game’s unique art style, and highly addictive nature of the gameplay just keeps making me want to jump in for another run here and there. The high replay factor will also swing this game into more people’s libraries as you can quite easily rack up twenty hours of gameplay before anything starts to become too stale. The game is perfectly priced as well; some may even consider it too cheap for the high production values on offer here!\n","May 17","true","4.2"," 57 of 82 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","57","82","3","6"

All in all this game is great, but what will make it amazing is the story creator mode, which needs a lot more work.\n\nNow, i feel the base game is already worth purchasing, which is why i did a review of the title. But the story builder as well as the PC options need a ton of work still.\n\nFull review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lN2BSDlRE\n\nBreak it down:\nThe core gameplay loop is interesting and mostly complete (barring balance issues). There are a plethora of encounters that have remained fresh through several (dozen) tries. The game has plenty of unlocks that are persistent even when the actual run at the game fails (much like many rogue lites these days)\n\nThe dialogue is pretty nice! with quite a few options i didn't expect. Also, the combat is very strategic using a hex-based turn system where each characters turn consists out of 3 actions, giving it all a pretty nice mix of Strategy & RPG elements.\n\nGraphically it looks and performs fine, but the options are threadbare (need work for SURE), missing everything but basic sound and resolution options.\n\nBUT the bread and butter will be the story builder, and while the base idea is implemented the story builder is 100% what they need to focus on to build a successful title that will provide the modding scene with the tools to take this game from an interesting FTL-on-a-real-boat into a truly amazing title that will give players many many hours of playtime.\n\ni do recommend viewing the full review on youtube as it goes quite a bit more in dept than this summary.","March 1","true","19.5"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","33","43","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamesear/recommended/402310/","gamesear","Gamesear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamesear/","31 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOverfall is a charming turn based RPG with many roguelike elements and tongue-in-cheek humor mixed that will have you explore a wide-open ocean filled with various factions to befriend, quests to solve and monsters to defeat in glorious battle.\n\nThere are over 50 playable classes each with their own spells and abilities, numerous monsters and individuals to fight or chat with, randomized quests that can all be solved in multiple ways as well as plenty of characters, items and spells to unlock for future playthroughs. In short, Overfall has a ton of replayablity and some very nifty features...\n\nPositives:\nStyle\nOverfall has a rather unique art style that combined with some excellent audio/visual feedback results in a very compelling world to explore and to do battle in. Special mention goes to the character design which combines simple faces with highly detailed armor resulting in memorable and cool looking characters, especially the plate wearers that look like they came straight out of a WoW raid.\n\nSimple but Complex Combat\nThe combat in Overfall is done in three phases: the movement phase where you get to move your character and cast movement based abilities such as teleports, the buff/debuff phase where you get to cast non-damage orientated spells such as heals or curses and finally the combat phase where you get to capitalize on all the prep work by smashing enemies over the head.\n\nWith each character having 8 spells dived between these three categories you will never be overwhelmed when it comes to combat options but don't make the mistake of thinking the combat in Overfall is simple, or even easy, because if you do you're going to find yourself on the wrong end of an Orc's blade and starting from the very beginning since Overfall has permadeath.\n\nQuests & Choices\nLike all roguelikes out there Overfall features many randomized quests and events, ensuring that each new playthrough doesn't end up feeling the same. Where Overfall differs from the rest is in the fact that seemingly every single encounter has multiple ways of being resolved: either through combat, diplomacy or even character specific abilities such as hypnosis. What this means is that even if you run in to repeat events on your subsequent playthroughs you can get a whole new experience with them by choosing a different path than you did the last time.\n\nQuestion/Encounter Editor\nBut no matter how complex or expansive a roguelike is it will always end up feeling samey if you play it for long periods of time. Luckily, the developers behind Overfall opted to include a fully featured quest/encounter editor that allows you to create your very own stories and share them with other people over Steam Workshop. So if you think, for example, that Overfall is a bit on the easy side you can simply go in to the editor (or the Workshop) and draft yourself some challenging quests and set them to appear only in the areas you feel are lacking.\nI cannot overstate how awesome this feature is and how important it will be for Overfall's long term appeal!\n\nNegatives:\nDifficulty Curve\nOverfall is at its hardest point early on because you can sometimes get locked in to encounters you simply cannot defeat with your two initial heroes which means a trip to the graveyard and a quick restart. On the other hand, once you build up your party and bling out your heroes you are almost indestructible as long as you play it safe and keep those heals rolling.\n\nRequirements to Unlock Certain Items\nThis is a minor complaint but one that's well worth mentioning. Overfall doesn't explicitly tell you what you need to do in order to unlock new characters and items, instead what you get is a short riddle or poem hinting towards the solution. For the majority of the unlocks this is completely fine but for some of the more complex ones which rely on timing, skill and annoyingly a bit of luck it becomes somewhat of a burden. Again, not much of an issue but if you're a completionist don't hesitate to look up a Wiki if you get stuck on some of the more obscure ones.\n\nCombat Targetting\nIf two enemies are standing one above the other its sometimes very hard to know which one you're targeting, especially if the enemies are big fat guys such as trolls. This is once again a minor issue but it will draw out a few curses from you when your execute spell fails because you casted it on a full-health guy standing behind your target.\n\nQuest/Encounter Editor Performance Problems\nWhile the quest editor is an amazing addition to Overfall it isn't without its issues, most notable is the fact that it starts to really, really slow down the game when you're messing around with complex quests filled with branching and interacting choices. It doesn't affect the main game but its still something I would like to see fixed in the near future.\n\nMy Recommendation\nOverfall is an extremely solid blend between turn based strategy and roguelikes that kept me engaged and pushing for more even after hours and hours of play. It does have a few annoying issues but they so easy to overcome when the game itself is this enjoyable.\n\nIf you are interested in some stylish turn based combat, slightly cheesy humor and numerous roguelike elements then I fully recommend you give Overfall a try, it has managed to accomplish everything it set out to. And most importantly, it is really fun.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8t6fzE3JZI","March 1","true","15.7"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","24","30","4","0"

I've spent a good amount of time in game so I believe I have played enough to give an accurate yet solid review.\nI will be dividing it into sections. Basic points being the guts of the review and then generalized sections (Good, Bad, and the ugly) Scroll through the review to get to the parts that you are looking for.\n\nBasic points- Graphics are fairly solid in all aspects. (Character design is odd yet cute, Skill animations are simple yet satsifying, the background textures are fresh and rich with color)\n- Game world is active and extremely dynamic on very rare occasions it can be linear.\n- Main story consists of multiple smaller stories that don't occur in a specfic order. The player's choices grant access to certain stories.\n- The npcs are most of the time in motion doing their own thing (fighting their own battles, farming resources, sailing, and conquering islands)\n- The open world aspect consists of the player sailing across a decently sized map with so many different islands that change depending on which race is the current one that dominated it.\n- Perma death is a key part to this game. If you die with both your characters you have to restart but once you restart the world itself is different. Previous perks, characters, events carry over to this new playthrough\n- The combat consists of Movement (moving and one ability), utility (which are most cases buffs/de buffs), Attack which is self explanitory.\n- There isn't to many skills to choose from before you begin your adventure. There is enough though to form different builds.\n- The combat is fairly smooth. It's simple yet complex at the same time. (You can't bring potions into combat, a good amount of the time you are out numbered, In most cases you can out play the enemy if you just adapt)\n- There are I guess you can call them "passive effects" that occur are key moments after fighting. Example say you have a character that has been taking a lot of damage throughout the fight and you've been healing him. Once the fight is over he may get an effect that will stick with him for the rest of the current play through. This effect would be something like saying that "He's taken to many blows to the head. Evasion is down by 4, accuracy is down by 2".\n- Then there are those same "passive effects" that occur doing certain feats that give you a buff for the rest of this character's life.\n- There is a good number of companions to unlock that will aid you on your adventure but they to can suffer from Perma death.\n- Once the combat is done your character doesn't heal so you have to eat food. Which heals a small amount, food is rather expensive to get once you first start (Frags are moderately tough to come by at the beginning)\n- The game wants you to die so you can expierence more of it's features which is interesting but can be frustrating ( I personally don't mind I've died 17x. Mainly to Vorn hoes -_- (Vikings). But I was able to get new stuff to play with in the next playthrough)\n- Encounters with npcs are random in a good way. It could be a combat one, humourous conversation, a game within a game, a few other surprises I won't spoil.\n- The choice system is interesting in this game your choices have more instant effects compared to other games. Most of the time you'll see the consequence almost right after making the choice (Whether its positive or negative).\n- There is a story builder which you can well... build your own story. I don't know much about this feature since the tut was the only thing available for it.\n- You will only run into a few dull characters that lack personality in this game.\n- I've run into just half a handful of bugs in the 40 hours i've played this game. I have to say that is pretty impressive.\n\nThe Good\n- Lush yet odd graphics\n- Story within a story (Storyception!)\n- Dynamic world\n- Simple yet tactical combat\n- Interesting characters\n- There's always something to do\n- Expierencing something new after each death (You will die at some point)\n- The global passives or traits I guess you can call them that you can obtain\n- A decent skill/trait customization system\n- Small amount of bugs\n- Companions are actually useful\n- A great homeage to classic Rogue like games\n- Only $9.99 (It's well worth the $9.99)\n- Story Builder is fully functional\n\nThe Bad\n- The rate you get the currency to get food at the beginning.\n- Adventuring into vorn (vikings basically) by mistake from the start of the game (Most cases they have 4+ people that will attack you on site)\n- Most cases the Vorn will use dust to increase their speed to chase you in the boats.\n- Food rationing (Depending on the player) is bad because it heals so little, and is moderately hard to obtain which leaves you vulnerable if you have low healthed heroes.\n\nThe Ugly\n-Perma Death (That depends on the player). I for one feel that this feature is good and bad since I don't mind restarting the journey with a new twist added.\n\nScore\n8.7/10","March 1","true","48.5"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","22","27","2","0"

On every island you go to you will encounter a little bit of a story, sometimes just a few lines of dialogue, sometimes a whole murder mystery. Most of these encounters are little self-contained stories, sometimes funny, sometimes serious. And often ending in a fight. What's even better, many of them will only unfold the second, third or even fifth time you encounter them, as with playing other characters, your choices and options change.\n\nFor those of you, who are looking for cohesive story lines and lore, don't wory. There is a main plot and each of the different races has a major questline, each of which portrayes the races in a different light, depending of who you decide to side with.\n\nOf course, you can only side with one faction in each play-through, but that gives extra reason to play the game over and over again. As you can see, I have nearly a hundred hours in the game and I'm looking to crack them soon.\n\nThe reason being the amazing re-playability. A full play-through might only last two or three hours (if you manage to win at all), but there is something that makes you come back: The unlocks. This game has a lot of unlocks (don't ask how many, way over a hundred), ranging from weapons, trinkets to playable starting characters and companions to join you on your journey. And these weapons aren't (only) cosmetic, they can change the whole role of a hero on the battlefield, making a normally melee focussed monk suddenly a ranged critter or giving a healer suddenly surprising offensive capabilities.\n\nDue to the amount of choice you will have as you progress in the game, you will be able to change party and weapon compositions to use a sheer endless amount of combos.\n\nSpeaking of combos: The games buff and de-buff system offers increadibly good ways to combine heroes' powers to dish out lots of damage, as well as avoiding a lot of it. Juggling with these buffs can be crucial and enable weird attacks like the druid's, which deals 6 damage, but also heals 6, to do massive amounts of damage or healing your guys by considerable amounts, if used correctly. I dare say the combat system as a whole offers a lot more than your initial impression might show and contributes to the game's great replayability.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention the story editor! This is a very cool tool, which allows players to create their own adventures, may they be complex or short, dark or light-hearted. I have already posted two items to the workshop (easily done with one click) and it is even easier to download them and have them use them in game. Did I mention the re-playability? The workshop makes this even more important of an aspect.\n\nI know this is getty quite lengthy by now, so I will end here.\n\nBottom line: I would not hesitate to buy this again.","May 18","true","117.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

It has enormous potential in terms of story, innovative turn-based combat, replayability, unending possibilities and is a world full of different procedurally-generated floras of islands. Also, there is permanent death. Thus, once you fail you start again.\n\nFrom my experience, as for closed-beta builds, there are no current game-breaking bugs and the devs are constantly updating the game.\n\nYou start the game by running away from some mysterious Viking-like horde called the Vorn which seeks to find an artifact you've been stolen from them. Literally, this is the main menu scenery. After you hit the start, you see the character creation. What I really like about character creation is that there are huge amount of combinations, but they must be unlocked by going through many playthroughs(as like many other roguelike games). In a regular playthrough, you’re almost guaranteed to unlock some stuff you can try at your next one.\n\nBest part is, you choose two heroes instead of one to start the game. You get to choose their weapons(each weapon has 3 skills, but we’ll get to that later in combat), utility skills and trinkets(passive abilities). Apart from the starting gear, all of these include a lot of things to unlock within them.\n\nOnce you choose your combination and hop into the game, an old wizard-like man welcomes you at the entrance and says your arrival has been foretold in the prophecy, and that they’ve been waiting for you for ages. Gives you a little bit of introduction to the basic lore and sends you out to the ocean to reach your king. The main goal is; you must find your King who sent you through the Portal to steal the “artifact” and deliver it. But since it has been hundreds of years(probably because of some cosmic stuff done by the portal’s cosmic structure), nothing stayed the same as you left them. Your King is missing, there are conflicts all over the place and as if that’s not enough, you brought some nasty invaders with your arrival.\n\nThe game consists of “scenes” or whatever you call them all the way through. Every scene includes a beautifully painted and animated background image, your party members at the left side of the screen, thought bubbles as a reaction to the current situation, and responding situation at the other side the scene or NPCs to conversate. The bubbles are your clickable options and the way of choosing a response to what’s going on was implemented in such a cute way like I’ve never seen in a game before. There is also a narrative bar at the top of your screen that tells you about what’s happening in short sentences like a GM in D&D games. The scene with the old-guy who enlightens you about what’s the current situation is first of these scenes.\n\nThe “prophecy”’s advice to you is that you must activate 2 of the 6 beacons who are under control of the races of Dys.\nWhat are beacons? Great question. The Beacons are magical wells who were given to the six main races, by raising your reputation and activating two of these magic beans, you break the invisibility spell of your king’s Citadel and reveal it on your map. This is the main progression of the game if your desire is to finish it.\n\nReal conflict is, the Vorn somehow know about the beacons as well and are seeking to find them. Before you do… The progression of the reputations, beacon activities and the Vorn invasion are shown to you very clearly within the UI and it’s like a real time race-to-end combination of FTL and Risk of Rain, because the game gets harder as the invasion grows.\n\nThe Vorn constantly raze the islands they encounter to gather resources. They use these resources to establish a base, build officer ships, their King’s ship and by using all of that power, they start to invade homelands of main races to actually unlock the beacons you’re looking for.\n\nAfter hopping to your ship, you start to visit the islands one-by-one. Encountering different adventures, gathering resources to upgrade your skills and weapons, adding new members to your party, raising/lowering reputations are few of the things you can expect in these islands.\n\nAt the moment, the game has limited amount of encounters but as I said, it’s an unending growth in terms of development.\n\nAs of encounters, the devs used a system where each character you include in your party might have a different opinion to what’s going on. Apart from that, there are multiple outcomes to each decision you make. This increases the chance to see different situations in an encounter every time you play.\n\nSo, the combat. Even though at first you may think that it looks like a regular turn-based RPG combat, the uniqueness of it is really convinced me that they like to innovate a lot. What’s the difference, you say? They didn’t use action points.(I personally hate that mechanic) instead, they added something called the “Phase” system at the bottom of the classic turn-round cycle. Each character goes through 3 phases. “Movement”, “Utility” and “Weapon”. And the other thing I really liked is “Conditions”.\n\nConditions include tons of buffs(good) or debuffs(bad) that you can apply to your foes, allies or even to yourself. Instead of getting used to each individual skill in the game, they compiled everything you can expect from an RPG game to these conditions. Once you get through the learning curve and master these conditions, It becomes an intense and evenly fun experience.\n\nBack to the those “Phases”; Movement Phase consists of simply moving your character to an hex or a unique Movement Skill suited to the each character that alters the positioning of the characters in the battlefield. Which could be the Fighter leaping or the Cleric pulling an ally towards herself for protection.\nUtility phase is where you “utilize” the battlefield in a larger scale with your 3 skills. Only thing is, you can do anything except dealing direct damage in this phase. It may include applying/removing/transferring conditions, healing, pulling/pushing etc.\n\nLastly, you get to use your mighty weapon within the “Weapon Phase”. Each unique weapon has 3 skills based on it’s capabilities and lore. All of these skills deal direct damage and are aimed to weaken your foe with conditions as a side-work. The thing to remember is these skills are not your character’s, but the weapon’s. Your character is just the wielder.\n\nThe skill effects are really cool, some sound effects are still missing though. Combat balance changes between patches, but is OK and kinda hard(which is good) in my opinion. Combats are always a part of the encounter you’re going through with a little story behind them, which makes it more memorable.\n\nAfter each combat, your characters have a chance to earn “Personas” - a part of the character progression and can change character stats or act as a passive ability with a trigger that pops up during the combat. These could be both negative or positive ones. For example, your characters can become “Brain Damaged”, or “Avenger” during the combat depending on what happened. Apart from these, you can unlock new things, earn/lose loot or increase/reputations with a race after a combat.\n\nParty size may increase up to 4 depending on your reputation level with a single race. But once you lose a companion in battle, you can’t hire him/her again in the same playthrough, so they’re gone for good. With their hardly earned Personas.\n\nConclusion : Overfall","March 1","true","70.4"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","24","31","3","0"

It's very similar to Battle Brothers except there is magic and various classes aside from just badass merc character (both are also really good games). In Overfall, you create your own characters (start with 2) and you explore a world that is primarily water with scattered islands throughout (think Wind Waker). On each island you will run into quests, races, aggressive and nonaggressive beings that all seem to offer an interesting little story or quest for you to complete.  Combat is all turn-based in this game and operates similar to games like Heroes of Might and Magic or again, Battle Brothers. However, this game is noticeably different as each combatant has 3 phases to their turn. The movement phase (where they have two moves they can perform but must pick 1), utility phase (3 moves, pick 1) and combat phase (3 moves, pick 1). Skills vary from bleeding effects, AOE effects, skip phase effects or just healing/buff effect. Every fight requires intricate input from the player and even lower level enemies can kick your tail if you're not careful. Also, this game definitely has permadeath and a random map seed every time you play so it's definitely got elements of a Roguelike. Your goal is to make it further each time and try to beat your previous scores.\n\nAesthetically, this game is great. It's got a strong, adventurous soundtrack that blends seamlessly with the open sea areas but also keeps you invested in the combat. Graphically, the game has a nice artistic style... while nothing especially unique it is definitely a very beautifully designed game.\n\nIn summation, this game is looking good for an early access game. While it doesn't feel like it's done anything particularly new, a whole bunch of the quests that are featured in the game are very well woven... for example, the Deceiver's Questline. Really, really enjoyed that one and that alone makes me put this game a head above the other roguelikes I've played lately.\n\nGameplay Footage (first impressions):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEmj7ICb_24","April 2","true","3.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","15","17","6","0"

The graphics are well-designed, being two-dimensional, but it gives a very small impression of 2.5D, in my opinion. The atmosphere is pretty much basically a bunch of islands, and a lot of water, and you must explore the islands, as well as the ships.  The audio has some well-made ambient soundtrack, as well as synchronized SFX. The gameplay is about, in the begging, 2 pirates, and further, 4 pirates, which need to fight their way to save Everking. They explore islands, as well as talking/fighting to other pirates on ships. The engines are solid, I haven’t met any bugs/glitches/lagging/frame drops. The controls are very simple, you must move your character with the mouse, then attacking the enemies with the mouse as well. Mostly, this game is just mouse-needing, I rarely used the keyboard. Overall, it’s a very relaxing and simple game, I recommend it to any RPG/Rogue-like gamer, and not only.\n\nStrong Points\nWell-designed 2D graphics\nAmbient soundtrack and synchronized SFX\nChallenging gameplay\nMany areas and environments\nOpen-World gameplay\nMany features in the gameplay\nWell-optimized engines\nIt’s a pretty long game\nInteresting story\nWeak Points\nNo saving option, a big disadvantage\nThe controls are a little too simple\nThe loading is a little too long\nGeneral Ratings\nGraphics: 8.5/10\nAtmosphere: 9/10\nAudio: 8.5/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nStory: 8.5/10\nEngines: 8/10\n\nPersonal Rating: 8.4/10","April 25","true","1.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

The Everking gave our two incredible heroes a mission to retrieve the “Disc Artefact” from another world, through a particular portal. Day by day, our two heroes venture deep into this strange world and finally obtain the artefact. Upon using the portal to come back and deliver the artefact to the “Everking”, they find out that their beloved king has been missing and the most astonishing aspect of this saga is the fact that they have been gone for over three centuries. . .\n\nOverfall is an RPG/Roguelike/Strategy with turn-based combat game where you take control of two heroes who are searching for their lost king. At the start of the game, you will be choosing what classes your two heroes will be; there are nine classes to choose from but upon your first game, you will automatically be a fighter and a cleric. The other classes will be unlocked throughout the game. Each character has five weapons to choose from (one available and four to unlock) with three special moves, eight skills sets to choose from (again three available and five to unlock) and twenty-five trinklets (abilities, if you like) of which five are granted to choose from on your first game. Then when you are ready, just go through the portal and you will be back in the realm of Dys!\n\nIn Dys you will meet your descendant; do not be surprised by his old age when he greets you. After a quick chat and an exchange of family tales (nah . . . just kidding), you will jump on a boat and start exploring the world of Dys. There are plenty of islands to visit and other ships to accost. In the realm, you will notice different types of islands, how they look on the map. That is because you have six races who co-habit this world: Goblins, Dwarves, Elves, Orcs, Hollow and Forsaken. At the start of your game, your reputation will be neutral with all of them. As you go through your journey, you might help the goblins and receive a point towards a better reputation with them, but decrease your reputation points towards other races who are not on friendly terms with the goblins because of that. You can find quests on Island and ships too, and as you successfully achieve your missions, you will receive recognition within the world, which will enable you to unlock a spot to grow your party, and you will be able to recruit another character to join you.\n\nEach time you achieve a positive outcome in a quest you will be rewarded with Frags (the currency), Runes, Dust and/or Food. With frags you can upgrade weapons at bazaars, trade for food with merchants or trade for runes. Runes are sacred stones and are very important in Overfall. When you find and visit an Altar, you can use these stones to either resurrect a fallen character or give protection to several of them, if you carry more than one stone with you. You will also need runes to hire a companion. Dust is a magical ingredient that can be used to learn skills and give a short boost for your ship. As for food, well you have to feed your heroes, my friends, or they will die!\n\nYour heroes can die in combat too; either on a boat or on land. The combat phase is simple and very good. It is a turn based setup but each of your heroes will have three phases per turn - movement, ability and attack. Just a quick word of advice for you - try to get one of your characters to be someone who can heal in battle, or your game will be fairly short. I do like the characters in this game; they have a slightly larger head than their body. I know it is a little thing but it makes it fun!\n\nGraphically, the game looks good. The soundtrack vaguely reminds me of a well-known TV show which is also set in a fantasy world. Good and simple to follow combat system. This game comes with a story builder so you can create your own story for all of us to enjoy!\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	100’s of locations to visits\n-	9 classes to choose from\n-	Plenty of abilities and characters to unlock\n-	Easy to use turn-based combat\n-	Interesting story\n-	Good replay-ability / Story builder included\n-	Achievements and Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	No tutorial (not necessary to have one but it would be nice)\n\nOverfall is a brilliantly combination of RPG/ Strategy/Roguelike with endless replay-ability! A must have!\n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

There are a huge number of unlockables and many different party set-ups. You start with 2 characters, but during the game you eventually get two additional companions from a very large selection.\n\nThe combat is based largely on conditions and I quickly learned that various combos are incredibly powerful. Vulnerability increases damage taken from each attack by 1, meaning that damage over time effects (bleed, poison, agony, etc.) do 2 instead of 1. Vulnerability + DOT = Awesome!\n\nTormented is a condition that damages enemies for each tile they move...fear is a condition that forces opponents to move 5 squares at the start of their turn. Add vulnerability to the mix and you have 10 damage before they even start their turn...then if it's a melee unit, it probably won't be able to get back in the fray without dying.\n\nThese are just some examples. I'm still learning the intricacies of gameplay. It's very fun, and I highly recommend it!\n\nThe only downside I can think of is that most things need to be unlocked before you can use them and that might not be everyone's cup of tea.","May 21","true","31.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The game satisfies me in many ways; quests, exploration and faction system being the most prominent ones. Huge chunk of quests have excellent writing, which may include some nice twists. Various lands or NPC ships tend to lead player to riches while unexpected ones become graveyards. More customizable character creation system is probably being developed as there are far more class choices and traits grayed out.

Then you will sail from island to island in search of your lost king, new unlocks (weapons, trinkets, skills, new classes, etc) for your characters and other general permanent unlocks (e.g. new companions that you can recruit in game).\nYou will encounter a bunch of races, including dwarves, elves and undeads, which have their own troubles and fights. And you'll be able to interact them based on your reputation with a specific race.\nThe cool thing is you'll (almost) always have a choice whether to fight, or just ignore the situation in front of you.\nThe game does includes some amusing writing, so it's pretty cool to read the encounters (well, at least the first time you get into them).\n\nI have not noticed any game-breaking bugs during my playthrough - the game's pretty solid.\nThe only issue of early access version is essentially limited number of encounters - after some time you'll start getting into same ones again and again.\nThis is something that can definitely be improved over time by the developers themselves.\nThe addition of the Story Builder that allows anyone to create their own random encounter using a simple editor and put it into Steam Workshop with one button push will definitely add even more variety to the game later down the line.\n\nIf you like the idea of rogue-lite RPG with turn based combat - definitely have a look at Overfall. It's pretty good.\nI'd say it's one more example of early access done right. And it's actually pretty cheap for a game of that quality right now (just $10).\n\nIf you want a more detailed first impressions, you can find them in the video below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM0i9IM2K9A","March 7","true","3.1"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

The idea of a story driven roguelike intrigued me. I've so far sunk nearly 4 hours into this game and yet I feel I've barely scratched the surface of all it has to offer. The graphics are cute and fun. The gameplay is solid if difficult(adjustable difficulty for those wanting an easier experience). The music and sound scheme is enjoyable.\n\nOne of the neatest features of the game is the ability to make and share your own added quests and story lines to the game. It has a relatively easy to use and well documented built in mod maker to add your own content and the steam workshop makes adding others creations very easy. So not only is every playthrough a little different, but the game will only continue to grow in content. There is already an active community of folks making lots of additional story lines and quests for you to enjoy. What's even cooler is seeing the developer playing and providing feedback on the user made content!\n\nMy gripes with the game are minor and few.  I think my biggest gripe is the speed of the battles - they are entertaining to me but feel a bit drawn out at times. Would love a 2x or 3x speed option to get through them quicker. I honestly can't think of anything else worth mentioning at this time in terms of a complaint.\n\nFinal conclusion? I very much recommend this game. It should appeal to fans of tactical rpgs and rogue-likes. Also, my wife enjoys watching me play it and she is not a big fan of games in general. I think there is a bit of something here for everyone to appreciate.","May 18","true","4.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

This game really caught me by surprise. I hadn't heard anything about this game before seeing it featured in the store shortly after it's release. I spent the better part of the next two days debating if I should buy it....and man I am glad I went for it!\n\nFirst off, the art style is incredibly unique and charming. I love interacting with whomever my adventurers would cross paths with, and it was neat to discover that the same encounters would play out differently depending on who/what you chose for your adventurers, followers, or conversation arcs.\n\nThe writing is also top notch, not every line of dialogue lands, but when they do....it's comedy gold. I don't want to spoil any of it but there is some expertly crafted references to mashup the game universe with our own (if that makes any sense).\n\nNow, don't get the wrong idea about this game. It is most certainly a rogue like game, and a difficult one at that. It took me several playthroughs before I REALLY understood what I needed to do, and if you want to complete the Story successfully, you have to go into this with a plan of what races you're going to befriend, etc. Time is the true enemy in this game, because as time passes more and more of the enemy hordes will begin to populate the game world, causing untold amounts of havoc, and making your task that much harder.\n\nAlso, you'll find after several attempts that whether or not you succeed has a whole lot to do with simple dumb luck. For you to gain reputation with any of the 6 different races in the game, you'll have to do things that will earn points with whichever race you are attempting to befriend and eventually ally yourself with to combat the hordes of evil. Well, the way you go about earning said points is by visiting islands that correspond with whichever race you're trying to become BFFs with. Easy right? No. Not when you can visit island after island without getting lucky and getting the random acts that will allow you to gain/lose reputation. I don't really mind it too much myself, but I know that this may be something that could possibly agitate some people.\n\nThe trading/upgrade system is fairly simple, almost too simple...but yet I think it fits perfectly here. Each of your two adventurers is allowed 3 Class upgrades that you can purchase from any of the corresponding Class ships (Fighter, Cleric, etc). Class upgrades cost you 5 "Dust" per upgrade, adding up to a grand total of 30 Dust for you to fully upgrade your Class skills. Then you are allowed to visit a Bazaar where you can further upgrade your chosen adventurers with Weapon upgrades. Now this also follows the same rule of 3. Each adventurer can upgrade their Weapon Head, their Weapon Hilt, and then you can roll for a random enchantment to complete the upgrade boogaloo. Now these Weapon upgrades cost "Frags" with each of the Weapon upgrades costing 12 Frags each, and the random enchantment costing 5 Frags per roll. Now BE CAREFUL...Don't be a dummy like I was and roll an awesome enchanment and then forget to apply that awesome enchantment. BE SURE TO CLICK APPLY ENCHANTMENT AS SOON AS YOU FIND ONE THAT YOU WANT. Also, when you're in the screen upgrading Weapons at the Bazaar, you'll have to select which hero you are upgrading by pressing the corresponding button underneath their character portrait. Otherwise you might pimp out one adventurer, while leaving the other one left hanging.\n\nWell...what more can I say...If you like Rogue like games, or games with great art and tremendous dialogue that will at times cause you to roar with laughter then this game is for you...buy it...like now. It's awesome and you'll get an excessive amount of replay value from this game.\n\nIf you enjoy games that hold your hand, and wipe your bum, as it compliments you and hands you a "Good Try" Participation Trophy...well this game isn't for you Sparky. Move along.\n\nIf you fancy yourself as one of those creative types and would like to make your own story with this games art style...well then you're in luck. I haven't used the Story Builder myself, but I know its an option and I know I'll eventually get around to seeing what I can put together with it...after I play...just one more try\n\n\nFinal Verdict: 5 out of 5 Gibblets","May 22","true","12.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The combat seems simple at first, but once you become more familiar with the combat mechanics and unlock new things, you are rewarded with some deep and satisfying gameplay.\n\nIf you enjoy turn-based RPGs, definitely give Overfall a try.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kittemple/recommended/402310/","kittemple","Kit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kittemple/","25 products in account","A great roguelike RPG game with a very nice upgrade system.  You play games sailing around islands and doing mini quests, and they give you the chance to unlock new characters, new weapons for the character, new skills for the character and new advantages for the character.  Additionally the skills themselves can also get upgraded.\n\nIt's a low-stress game where you don't care too much about dying - a lot of different quests to do.  Since there is a quest creator in the steam workshop I'm hoping that the developer will make a free DLC with all the high quality ones in there.\n\nA lot of games, you take a break for a week and you can't really bring yourself to carry on playing.  This one feels like a game that will be easy to dip in and out in the future.\n\nThe only extra I would have liked would have been a bit more joined up effects from each quest.  There is an effect of increasing your reputation with a race to get special big quests with that race - but I was hoping to unlock special achievements through being totally good or totally evil in a game (which currently doesn't seem to happen).","May 19","true","20.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","3"

Not only that it looks good, has great soundtrack and a good atmosphere it also is a lot of fun to play and quite challenging. If you die ... well you're dead and have to start over again!\n\nYou choose two heroes in the beginning and start your adventure on the seas. Over 190 randomly generated islands of different flora types are waiting to be visited and every island triggers quests, offers events and opportunities to gain reputation with one of the 6 races. The dialogues are scripted entertaining and funny. There actually is also a story builder where you can script your very own story and events - awesome! The mission is to fight the Vorn ... or the Everking ... or both? You will have to find out on your own! Once you have enough reputation you can hire companions that help you fighting your enemies in increasingly more difficult battles.\n\nI love the battle system! Every turn has three phases (movement, special action, attack) and there are lots of weapons and abilities to choose from. There are several different tactics you can use for fighting and you can combine skills to increase your damage output. With every run you can unlock one or more of the hundreds of items, skills, weapons, companions and heroes this game has to offer.","March 30","true","183.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonaswinterberg/recommended/402310/","jonaswinterberg","Jonas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonaswinterberg/","247 products in account","Summary\nOverfall is a turn-based rogue-like exploration game with a vast selection of discoverable classes, skills and upgradeables - Darkest Dungeon meets Renowned Explorers.\n\nThe gameplay is similarly addictive as the traditional "just-one-more-turn"-feeling, hours feel like minutes. A price under 15€ for an expected 40-50 hours to master the game and unlock most content sounds fair.\n\nGameplay\nDuring the story mode, the player switches between a real-time ocean map and quest encounters. Most quests are solved through grid-based combat although some also offer diplomatic approaches. The writing gets repetitive rather fast although user-generated content could fill this gap soon (a quest generator is included and first results are already in the workshop).\n\nMacromanagement in the form of four different exchangable resources (food, money, trophies and runes) is required to survive and further develop the party. Furthermore, a reputation system for the "neutral" factions allows to choose between different main quest lines.\n\nThe harsh story doom timer (viking invasion) can quickly turn first approaches into frustration and leaves no room for extensive exploration. Expect a steep learning curve. A full story run takes about 2-3 hours depending on party composition.\n\nCombat\nDifferent party combos keep the combat refreshing and diverse. The combat system itself will feel familiar to anyone used to turn-based games. Each unit turn is split sequentially into movement, utility and lastly attack. The developers refrained from strong healing abilities and set the focus on avoiding damage by utilizing buff/debuff and cleanse abilities.\n\nThere is no prepositioning of units and initiative is predefined for all units (no turn saving). This sometimes results in deaths before being able to move, e.g. double trolls charging... :-(. The AI prioritizes buffing/healing over attacking and often behaves suicidal/stupid when accompanying your group - just using them as decoys works fine.\n\nProgression\nThe group size starts with 2 of the 9 customizable main classes. While progressing through the story, the party can be extended and refilled with 2 from 36 unlockable companions (encounters seem to adjust to either group size or doom timer stage by adding more enemies to quests).\n\nRandomly generated positive/negative "personas" similar to DD's quirks and a small selection of upgrades for the core heroes replace traditional level-ups. Death for companions is permanent, a lost core hero can be resurrected if the other survived the fight.","May 17","true","23.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

It's still in early access but there is more than enough content and polish to warrant a purchase at this stage. It's a rogue-like (in its use of permadeath and procedural world generation) with deep tactical combat, nice artwork and tons of replayabilty. But what really sets Overfall apart from the rest is the way it uses story. There is an overarching story that has a sort of timer (invading forces gather strength each day and it's up to you to unite the various races against the looming threat); but there are also self contained narratives delivered via the many small islands of the world. Overfall includes a robust story creator that will teach the player how to put together events or quests that often involve branching choices (it's a really cool feature that allows for alot of creativity, however, story creation is completely optional and the vanilla game would still be great even if this feature wasn't present). The strength of Overfall is that every facet of the game feels well thought out and not watered-down (every part of the game is good enough to stand on its own). Worth mentioning: there are a small amount of bugs still in the game (I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs though) and some of the sound effects are still missing. Also, there is the art style which might turn some people off but I think it looks great. *The price is really good right now and I'm pretty sure it will be cost a few bucks more for the final release. I don't think it'll stay in early access for more than a few months so if you're interested I suggest you buy it while it's still a bit cheaper.\n\n","March 16","true","18.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The mission stories are interesting and play with some pop culture references re-told for a fantasy setting and the combat is adequately difficult making you have second thoughts even if it is an even fight. If you like rogue-lites with a solid combination of story based and combat based missions then Overfall is definitely worth a look.

Spent a lot of money and time finding a lot of crap and some decent games and some pretty good, but just not awesome games.  I am in total love with this game.  Just buy it, you won't be sorry.  Is it perfect?  No.  Is it great and on it's way to awesome, I think so.  By the way, this is the first review I think I've ever given on a game on Steam.  For early access, it's in incredible shape.  I'm not that far in and have failed to beat the game yet (I've come close).  I've unlocked a couple weapons, three characters, about half dozen or so trinkets, and about 40% of the champions.  Lots of replay value here with the endless possiblities of changing out all these things.  The permanent death thing is hard to take at first, but you realize the replay is huge due the randomness of quests and events.  The Vorn are axxholes and you will hate them early on. This game is definitely rogueish and it will give you many, many frustrations.  Stick with it, you get better as you learn the game and achieve more unlocks.  Watch the youtube videos out there, and check out the official wiki, they will help you a lot.  In fact, I would jump in once, and then watch a couple basic youtube guide videos and they will save you some frustration.  I get mad at this game, a lot, and take a break and come back and fall in love all over again.  Balance is quite strong, but still needs tweaking, which obviously they will continue to work on over time.  The devs are hard at work, and want our feedback, so give it.  I look forward to the game growing, multi-player, and more evolution so it doesn't become a game that you tire of when you hit endgame.\n\nDying, getting really frustrated and swearing it's too hard most the time, taking a break and coming back 30 mintues later after you thought of some changes to make and just addiction to the game.  I did find one quest chain that was incredibly long and unrewarding.  If they were going for rogue with that baby, they hit it on the head.\n\nI need food.\n\n10/10\n\nNevermind, as of right now I hate this game.","March 31","true","85.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

The battle system and the classes, which there are a lot of to choose from, are pretty fun to play. By changing up the party along with the multiple skills that you are able to unlock you get a lot of different strategies to imploy on the battlefied.

Obviously a lot has change since then, and they now face a word that has been ravaged by a faction named the Vorn.\n\nGameplayOverfall is a very fun gorulike RPG that uses turn-based combat throughout the game. With the two adventures that you play as it shares a rather interesting a fun story to hear. Basically these two adventures that you play as have been trapped in this 'mysterious' portal for about three centuries. Since you have been trapped in this portal the whole word has changed, with a new faction called the Vorn that have ruthless raiders and are ever expanding at a fast rate. It is up to these two adventurers to stop them. This is the basic of what the story tells, as you play through the game you will uncover more of the story and find out who the factioon got together and such.\n\nAlthough the story seems to be simple and easy to accomplish, the goal to stop the faction Vorn really becomes a challenge on your own. So as you can imagine your going to need some help to be able to stop them because they are such a huge faction. So you are then forced to go and ask for help from the other factions for their support, the other factions include Orcs, Goblins, Elves, Everguards and more that I have yet to find. Improving your relationships with these factions high enough will make them turn their view to be a friend or ally so they will help you on your mission. They will give you resources you will need to visit their homeland and such.In order to improve your relationship with these other factions will you will have to do missions that will help with their settlments in return for their help with your mission. Sometimes the missions that you are given to do to gain allys with other factions you will be asked to do something to decrease the tension between two factions that are on the same island. I really like the way that they made you have to help other factions to gain their friendship to help you with yor mission.\n\nSomething that will worry you throughout each run that you will do on this game is the 'doomsday clock.' This clock will tick down indicating that time has passed as you travel between different islands on your boat. When the clock is out of time then Vorn will have grown to their maximum strength and will win unless you can stop them in time. This will limit the travels that you can have on your boat and make you think where you will be traveling before you actually go there.\n\nBeing a RPG game you would expect there to be a variety of different abilities and collectables for you to get whilst you play through the game. You would be right, this game is really good when it comes to the characters ability customizations through unlockables you will achieve throughout the game. The characters that you will aquire on your mission they will gain random affects on their abilities through their experiences. Something that is rather important to take note isthe envirmonet and choosing which battles you carry out and that you may stumble upon.\n\nSomething to take into consideration is that this game is also consider to be a roguelike, which menas you will die a lot and therefor will learn by your past experiences. This may want some players not to purchase this game as the intimidation of dying time upon time again just to learn about the way the games work may push them away wanting to buy this game. Although the game does feature a difficulty setting the game can still sometimes be cruel and unpredictable at times. The game does lack in tutorials, meaning you have ti learn from experience and get to grips with the mechanics and how the games work quickly.\n\nThe graphics of this game are superb. Just from seeing the screenshots above you can tell that this game will have some really nice graphics that work with the type of combat this game has. The sprites and attack animations of each of the enemies and characters seem to be well animtated and have a nice variety of attacks and abilities that have their own animtations.\n\nPros+ Decent story line\n+ Able to help factions and gain allys with them\n+ Doomsday clock system is cool\n+ A very nice RPG game\n+ Trading cards & Achievements\n\nCons- Roguelike is not everyones taste\n- Sometimes the game can be cruel and unpredictable\n- Lack of tutorials\n\nResult / Final thoughtsAll in all in it's current state, Overfall is a fun roguelike RPG turn based game that focuses heavily upon the combat system and the way that you are up against time before the Vorn take over the world. The game has some issues with the lack of tutorials, and sometimes cruel and unpredictable gameplay but other than that this game is really fun and addcitive.\n\nRating: 7.6/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow ReviewExperts curator group here.","April 16","true","4.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

Its hex-based combat system is easy to learn but surprisingly deep, the art style is charming, and the encounters are varied, but where the game really shines is its dialogue. It's always entertaining and often delightfully referential.\n\nIn my favorite one so far, an orc tribe asks for help with one of their members, who hit is head and will only speak a few nonsense lines... such as "zug-zug," for, as it turns out, he has become a peon. If you tell the tribe this, they are delighted and ask you to protect him while he builds their base.\n\nCheck out my first impressions video to see it in action-- and I'll definitely be posting more content for this game, as I cannot recommend it enough:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHG3XH3jSsA","March 2","true","2.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

The combat is fun but challenging and requires you to get stomped a few times before you figure out just how strong you really are, and the right ability combinations. The dialogue is pretty good, with some references to things to Team Rocket that I stumbled upon. There does seem to be a limited number of encounters that you can run into and some of the quest are a little boring and generic. That is not a problem though becuase of the Story Builder mode. This lets players build their own quest which can be shared through the Steam workshop. This tool will basically help this game live forever since people can make endless content for it. I would recommend getting the game if you are into RPG type games and enjoy a challenge.","March 2","true","6.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

For £6.99 you get so much.  Just scroll down the reviews and look at how many hours people are putting into the game and for £6.99???  It kind of reminds me of something like Sunless Sea (narrative rich) but with Darkest Dungeon combat. Both of these games I like and this mixes the 2.  A lot of love has been put into this game and the devs are keen to hear what the community have to say.  The game has a finished feel so for me the whole "early access" thing is just the devs wanting to make the game even better with your feedback.  Great debut for Pera games.\nAlso worth noting that the game runs very well on my very basic laptop which only has a 1.33ghz processor and 2gb ram.  No issues at all.\nSeriously if you are a fan of Darkest Dungeon/ Sunless Sea style games then dont hesitate.

However, when I go to bazaar, it appears that I have no upgrades. Not sure whether upgrades are proccing either, but it seemed like they werent.\nAlso, you can become champion by winning fewer than 5 matches, I believe this happens if you had a previous run in the arena (2 matches and end, then 3 matches yields champion).

You travel the sea, visit various islands and fight a different aray of enemies (which costist mostly of humanoids of different classes), all because space vikings want to f*** up everything you know... or knew?\n\nThe story starts when the king decides he wants some bling and sents you to an alternate dimension in order to retrieve an ancient disc. This does not provide a challenge for a couple of great adventurers as yourself and you quickly return, only to discover 300 years have passed since you embarked. Not only that, the space vikings that reside in the other dimension aren't pleased with your little trip and start sending ship after ship after ship of warriors, which basicly means you're screwed... but not just yet.\n\nCombat is focused mostly on different buffs and debuffs. It is played out in three phases. First comes the movement phase, then you can use different non-combat abilities and in the end, you can use an aray of combat skills. You have to plan ahead and know your characters, which gives the combat a nice, tactical feel to it.\n\nThe thing that I loved the most is the amount of option you get in most conversations. There are multiple things you can say and if you aren't carefull, you can quickly find yourself in battle with the previously friendly residents. Different classes sometimes get aditional options, which is also a wonderfull edition. It allows the game for stay fresh despite the fact conversations eventualy start to repeat themselves. But hey, it's impossible to have an infinite amount of new stuff to do.\n\nThe aestetic is certainly interesting and unique with a lot of lively colours. The soundtrack however, isn't anything special, at least I didn't think much of it. It does a decent job, however I didn't even remember it after not playing for a couple of days.\n\nTo sum it up: Overfall is a game which is definately worth a look. If you don't believe me, take a look at the steam rating. A must buy for everyone who likes the idea of roguelite games and one of the best games I've played this year.\n\nFinal rating: 8.6/10","June 6","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It lacks the basic dynamic feeling that gameplay of this sort requires to stay enjoyable.  Unlockables (alt classes/trinkets/weapons) that might add some variation to gameplay are difficult and extremley time consuming to acquire. Character progression is non-existant in any traditional sense. Upgrades are instead purchased or aquired through traits (as often bad as good). Consequently, the steadily increasing difficulty curve gives no heightened sense of achievement, just consternation on the players part. Some classes/races are clearly superior to others, only, you don't have acces to those.\n\nAs the end game approaches, players are faced with a need to constantly feed (heal) thier troops, to a point of tedousness and extreme in-game poverty. This is just as well as there arn't many other things to buy. Units do not heal outside of battle, meaning the 'strongest' builds are ones focused around low damage high healing parties, which extends the length of any given combat inordinatly. It seems as though the player is on the wrong end of the developers practical joke--when you manage to recruit a 3rd unit, the enemy has 4. When you manage a 4th they field between 5 or just add additional rounds, between which you are unable to heal.\n\nEventually you are forced to conclude that combat is a dimintioning return reward system. Random quests which feature no combat often provide greater rewards. Faced with a quest I chose to face down two elit units (trolls), which was likely suicide, but I did it for the apparent oppurtunity to aquire two full trasure chests (pictured in the backround and commented on in the dialogue section). Having won, against high odds, I was promptly cutscene defeated/cheated (described as 'suddenly blacking out') and was then forced to leave the island with nothing, except my wounds (which cost money to heal). Why bother with such loose story telling/gameplay?\n\nBottom line: Gameplay is in linear in the extreme, reminicent of some oldschool flash games you used to played, and not much more. Balance is needed, but likely won't enrich the fundementally flawed core of gameplay.","March 3","false","10.3"," 39 of 77 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","39","77","3","0"

Even with the lack of progression, I was able to beat the campaign on my first attempt, it just felt kind of tedious not getting any more powerful yet fighting monsters with more hp and stronger attacks.\n\nThe writing is also sub par. The conversations don't flow right; it seems almost like someone who has English as a second language wrote all the dialogue.

You can tell there's been put some love into this. The Turn & Grid-based Combat feels inovative, mostly relying on a ton of buffs and debuffs (some of which are unfortunately different in name only). I'm not the creative type, so the encounter-builder isn't really for me, but it's great for the longevity of the game to involve the community like this.\n\nSo there is a lot to like here (it's cheap to boot) but I still wouldn't recommend this game to anyone intrigued by the store-description alone: As a modern rogue-like this game is kinda useless. It takes too long to assemble a more powerful party every run, just to get unluckily crushed by a good enemy composition or a couple of bad encounters in a row. You can unlock a handful of classes, items, weapons and companion-types, but not enough to help you out in the early stages of every new game. Now if there was some kind of pick your perk system based on the Score of your last run or something similar, this game would probably feel much more rewarding.
