Right now there are 6 tracks and 6 cars which seem kinda unbalanced. There is also only one race mode, quick race, right now. If this games expands and gets better I will change my rating accordingly.\n\nIf you want to support the devs and the potential of this game buy it now - if you want a finished game and you would give up when you see some bugs, please wait and come back later.","April 3","false","34.6"," 48 of 60 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","48","60","0","8"

Unfortnately there's no singleplayer mode and finding other players can take upwards of 10 minutes. Controls can feel unresponsive, but gameplay is genuinely fun. Online community feels dead and the game lacks varitey and customisability.\n\nI imagine they'd also be rolling out more updates in the future for more content, as it is there are 6 tracks and 6 different cars. When you start out you have no cars theres 6 to pick from and you have a choice of the first two as they are under 200K which is what you're given when you start out. The car models do look pretty good and was impressed with the details they were able to put into the models. After buying the car you want, take it to your garage and with whatever spare cash you have left you might be able to get an upgrade. The upgradeable aspects of your car are the brake, ECU, Exhaust, bodywork, suspension, KERS, spoiler, cooling and a few others. Upgrades will change the car in terms of fuel economy, top speed, accleration, drag, braking power and do matter. For instance the car I was using was kitted to last only about 25km's without pitting but I had constantly more power to use and ended out on top. Most races won't be longer than 50km's, also note drivers can be more fuel economic whilst driving.\n\nOnce you're actually in-game it's pretty fun, you instruct your AI driver around and tell him when to use KERS, push harder, when to change the car's fuel map, pitstops and block. Controls can feel like they are unresponsive at times but that's due to driver stats which can be upgrades with experience points.\n\nExperience points can be used to increase the speed of certain aspects of your pitstop, increase the skill of your driver; how confident he is with braking and overtaking and how much speed he can carry through corners. You also have a manager who handles all your sponsorship contracts, you can give him greater chance of securing a contract and he can land better contracts for you aswell.\n\nContracts themselves aren't overly fun to handle. You're given 10 time units and every action uses a certain amount of time units, time units are replentished after each race. Pretty easy mechanic but monotonous is a good way to describe sponsorship (10/10 immersion there). To actually land a deal you need to call up the sponsor which you might or might not get through to. Once you're in you can invite them out to dinner, send them gifts, give a presentation on your raceteam few other options I've forgotten. Each option will better the relationship between you and whomever you're chasing up.\n\nOnce a you manage to squeeze out a contract offer you can change the aspects of the contract, how much you get paid, for how many races and what position you need to come in to adhere to those conditions of receiving the funds.\n\nAll up I would recommend this game if they added more varitey and the online community was bigger, it's a fairly niche market so this game may never live up to it's full potential. In it's current state I wouldn't recommend this game.\n\nApologies for the length of the review, it all got a bit out of hand. Cheers.","April 2","false","2.5"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","37","49","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tosterx/recommended/348030/","tosterx","TosterX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tosterx/","968 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIn this game you become the manager of your own racing team. You won't find here popular car brands like Ferrari or Maserati but just a fictional racing cars.\n\nOverview\nAs a team manager you can sign new sponsor offers and help the driver to drive around the track. By earning money out of every race you can then upgrade the car or buy a new color design. The racing itself is from 3rd person perspective so you see a very small cars. As a team manager you can instruct the driver to: overtake, overload, block or tail the following car. The second set of options is: KERS button, changing the engine's ECU fuel mapping or requesting the driver to make a pitstop. Instructing the driver to overtake the following car can be from the left or right side and it works pretty well but sometimes the AI fails causing strange situations. The rest of the options work pretty well.\n\nGame modes\nSingle race or cup mode - new in the game. In the cup mode you also have qualification lap which i felt lacking before. Cup mode provides you also some more fun because of strategy, because there are 3 races that are longer and therefore you can go on one pitstop or two.\n\nBalance\nThe game is all the time on the same level. When you start there are many cars faster than you and some of them are slower. It means that after you do the upgrades to the car your car becomes more competetive and heads to the front of the opponents. After you upgrade your car to the maximum you fight for the first places. It means that after you do it your car is always in the front so if you don't have real players as the opponents, you almost always fight for win. There should be some racing categories or one type of car races to make it more interesting.\n\nMultiplayer\nIt's the first issue - because the game doesn't have singleplayer, the game is always looking for online players. Sadly almost all the time you compete with the bots and maybe 1-2 real players.\n\nGraphics & audio\nEverything looks very nice, has good sounds. The music becomes a little boring after 5 or 10 races but you can turn it off. Some optimalizations must be made to the game because of the high cpu/gpu usage, but so far it works nice.\n\nSummary\nThere are still some bugs like for example disapearing wheels, lapped cars still fight like they were racing while they shouldn't. The game needs some work but the direction is so far very good and i can recommend this game. If you like racing games, you'll definetely like this one!\n\nTake a look at the stats of my profile here http://www.trackdaymanager.com/profile/?order=totalScore&nationality=Poland&teamID=1888","December 21, 2015","true","22.0"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","3"

Was not exactly what I was expecting, but I am still enjoying it. This is not a hardcore management/simulation game, so know that before buying. To me, it feels more like an arcade game with a light management twist on it.\n\nPros:\n- Lots of time to be sunk into this\n- Can be played when you only have a half hour or so (low single sitting commitment)\n- Quite a good looking game\n- While you don't directly drive the car, the "skills" present a highly engaging play style that doesn't have you just "kicking back and waiting"\n- When you are against bots, they seem to have a nice range of skill\n\nCons:\n- Low level of content (currently)\n- Have not seen more than 2 players in a race thus far\n- A bit too casual for a management, or a simulation, game (not sure which it wants to be, but leans towards casual for either category)\n- Have run quite a few races and only seen 2 of 5 tracks, making the content level feel even lower right now\n- Based on income rate and car cost, your "team" looks like it will be a single car/driver for longer than many would be willing to play the game (assuming you even can get another car - looks like you can)\n- No apparent way to "party" with someone\n- You don't know which track you will be racing ahead of time (randomly selected when you join a race) so you have to setup your car in the garage to be an overall setup\n- Pre-race setup consists of just choosing your tire type (3 basic choices, no fine adjustments)\n- In-game pit options are fuel refill level and tire type (again, no fine adjustments)\n\nOther Thoughts:\n- Price might seem a bit high right now with the lower amount of content. I am assuming that more will come. Regardless of the low content right now, if you can get into the game, I could see a very good hours/$ return.\n- A few small issues/bugs, but not bad for an early access and quite a lot better than many other games on early access (and even full release for that matter).\n- The in-race management is where you spend most of your time. Front office stuff takes a back seat in terms of time spent in game, and front office complexity is quite low.","May 28, 2015","true","13.3"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

You'll be constantly doing math to figure out if you're under or exceeding your fuel quota and you will also be watching the tyre wear so you don't burn them out too fast and make the wear eat into your lap times.\n\nTo add to the mix you can monitor what actions and strategies the opponents are employing throughout the race, this will sometimes make you rethink your strategy - will you let him pass and tail him or will you run your car at 100% and try to outrun him and if so, for how long? Keep in mind that running the car at full throttle eats into fuel and you'll finish most races with 0% - 5% fuel remaining so choose wisely.\n\nThe tuning aspect of the game allows you to buy newer and better parts, some more suited for speed and power while others are suited better for handling and fuel economy, the challenge is to build a car that is well adapted for most situations and having strengths that can be used to secure wins. Your team can be upgraded too which consists of a Driver, the Pit Crew and lastly your Marketing Manager who is in charge of obtaining sponsorship deals.\n\nThe game is still early in development phase and has numerous errors or design faults but it still brings a lot to the table, races are randomly selected and sometimes you will be put into a race where your cars setup has almost no chance of placing within the top 5 not even looking at first, this will be ironed out down the line but can detract from the experience. Pitstop bugs have happened before as well and I've had a few bugs with tyre selection costing me races in the past but I'm willing to overlook them for the time being while the developer fixes then; the developer is very active and open with progress on the steam forums so help is never too far away.\n\nAnd lastly a piece of advice for the people who are considering or have just bought the game and have yet to choose a car: buy the Raptor if you want an easier experience, buy the Avalanche if you want to grind your face into the wall but learn a lot more about strategy and have a greater challenge on the managing side of things. This game is ideal for those who know a lot about racecraft but are looking to expand their knowledge on race strategy.","April 4","true","34.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

I am not a big review writer but I think this game definitely requires a review.\n\nIt is early access but in saying that the content we have now is extremely entertaining and well worth the money. I cant wait to see what they add in to it.\n\nSo i have now been playing this for over 30 hours. This game is a great game and I love that the devs are active and listening to feedback. They have patched it every day so far to make it great. It now has a quick tutorial for new players so that is a great thumbs up.\n\nI love the idea you can upgrade your drivers skills as well as the pit stop crew. You also are able to upgrade the car to make it perform better than the stock vehicle you start off with.\n\nAnother thumbs up for this game, is that it doesn't matter what position you come in. As long as you finish the race you are guaranteed cash and skill points. After the race you also get badges. Badges come in the form of 'Top Speed', 'Longest drift' etc. So no matter whether your playing with those with upgraded cars or not, you are still able to get at least 1 badge. Each badge is worth a set number of skill points, so worth getting.\n\nCons to this game is that it is in early access so there is lag and server time outs. However what features are in the game and the fact you have so much fun playing out weighs the lags you get. The community is great and we all have fun chatting whilst racing.\n\nSo overall I would say, BUY IT. You cant go wrong and I believe you will absolutely get addicted to it like I have.\n\nIf you don't buy it now, then you are missing out on a great game with devs that play the game as well and listen and patch the game daily.\n\nMy name ingame should you buy it is TRAPFIRE.

I was surprised to find that, although related to the managing genre in the various tasks you attend to when not actually racing, this is actually a deeply rewarding real-time pvp strategy game.\n\nThis is how it works. Up to 16 players compete in races where you control the various strategic and tactical tasks that go towards running a racing team. Pitstop and tyre strategy is, of course, key to your success and winning a race on the last lap because of your fresh tyres is a thing of pure joy. But there's more still - you actually control a lot of your drivers actions. Engine mapping, KERs deployment, deliberately tail-gating to save fuel, whether you want your driver to attempt an overtake (and which side to try it on) or whether to drive defensively - all these things you control in real-time.\n\nHowever the real gem here is the multiplayer element. I've owned this less than a day and already I have had some amazing duels with budding team managers from all over the world. The community is fresh and happy with the game right now, which is always nice to be a part of.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is clearly a rather niche title as well as an independent one (so not without it's annoying quirks or balancing issues) but for someone who spends every Sunday glued to the telly screaming at Ron Dennis that I could do his job so much better this is absolutely perfect and I love it.","April 5","true","86.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

Pitstop and tyre strategy is, of course, key to your success and winning a race on the last lap because of your fresh tyres is a thing of pure joy. But there's more still - you actually control a lot of your drivers actions. Engine mapping, KERs deployment, deliberately tail-gating to save fuel, whether you want your driver to attempt an overtake (and which side to try it on) or whether to drive defensively - all these things you control in real-time.\n\nHowever the real gem here is the multiplayer element. I've owned this less than a day and already I have had some amazing duels with budding team managers from all over the world. The community is fresh and happy with the game right now, which is always nice to be a part of.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is clearly a rather niche title as well as an independent one (so not without it's annoying quirks or balancing issues) but for someone who spends every Sunday glued to the telly screaming at Ron Dennis that I could do his job so much better this is absolutely perfect and I love it.","April 5","true","86.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

Online stability is pretty iffy, and there isn't a whole lot of content just yet. I’d be interested to follow up with the game over time to see how it’s shaping up, as the devs have been dropping patches frequently. If they can manage to eliminate most of the server issues and add a bit of content, this game has the potential to become genuinely special.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that the game is being developed by a small studio of six people, and it already looks fantastic. The in-race lighting effects, especially during nighttime runs, are impressive, especially among its Early Access peers. Taking into consideration that cooperative racing teams are in the works as well, allowing for you and your friends to take on races together in your sponsor-covered customized cars, Trackday Manager might be one of the most compelling racing experiences to grace PC gaming in a long while. Easy to learn, but bloody difficult to master, this is definitely one to watch.\n\nIf you'd like a more in-depth first-impressions article, come look at my shameless plug!\n\nhttp://www.firesidefrag.com/going-the-distance-trackday-manager/\n\n\n(A review copy of the game was provided for the article)","June 11, 2015","true","14.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

No race craft involved of staying by side without touching.\n\nAgain the AI will randomly stop at points in track forcing you to hit them, stopping your car dead destroying your race. (if these are planned "accidents" they need to be animated better as the AI literally looks like it hit a brick wall and then started going again once you hit them)\n\nThe game crashes if someone leaves the race.\n\nMost of the grids are filled with AI as human players seem to be a rare thing\n\nI can list more and more issues, but overall I'm done with the game.\nWish I'd gotten a refund straight away but I thought I'd give it chance, maybe I'll return to it in the future but right now I wouldn't recommend this game.\nBetter off buying Motorsport Manager on your iPhone or Android as that game may not look as nice but it has more depth to it!","April 1","false","19.1"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","15","24","2","0"

Since Ridge Racer for PS1 I am addicted to good racing games. I played season and season in F1'97. Gran Turismo 1+2, of course. Weeks of playing Ferrari F355 Challenge online on SEGA Dreamcast. F1 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 from Codemasters. Project CARS, iRacing and many many more. I would say, over 10000 hours all together.\n\nMore practise in virtual racing than every 'real' driver on track. So what do I think about TDM?\n\nI've bought it in early access phase, 29th May 2015. Played a lot and helped sorting out the bugs. Giving some ideas (like the qualifying in cup mode). It was very nice. Eating in front of the PC was a regular meal.\n\nThen there was release day. Everyone was online. Matches filled with up to 12 players. Most of the time lag-free. Very great races.\n\nHow does it feel in comparison to project CARS, for example?\nBoth are competitive racing games. In TDM you don't need a steering wheel, don't have to learn the basics about racing or 30+ tracks. You just buy your first car and go on track. Very few buttons to play the game. But very addictive gameplay, if you match up with competitive players.\n\nAfter the release, they changed something and you don't match up to a lot of players, even when a lot of players are in-game. But we communicate over steam and invite each other for cup races. And if you want to farm money for a new car, just go for bot races. You will need $14.000.000 to get all cars with all upgrades.\n\nLong-term-fun?\n\nYes. I did it (buy all 6 cars) for three times now (2x early access and after release).\n\nIs this game for racers?\nYes, and like every racing game, it is JUST for racers. Managers will go away very quickly.\n\nWhat is the graphics like?\nIt suits the game. And the price. Go on YouTube and check some videos.\n\nTell me about the bugs!\nWe had a lot of detected bugs in ea and I have to say, the worst bugs are gone. And you can work around the most existing bugs. Which expands the gameplay (where to overtake at pit entry, sponsors patching and so on).\n\nHow much is it worth?\nThat's your own decision. I've read bad reviews with 2,5 hours of total play time.\nI've played 1000+ hours now. And at the actual state it is worth €20-25 to me.\n\nMaybe you should see this game as a slot racer. With 6 available tracks and 16 cars in race. Overtaking isn't easy and you have to stay calm even when a bot blocks you for half a lap - and then pits!\n\nSponsors aren't fun, but you have to make more money!\nAnd please forget about the management part. It is just, but a very different racing game.","June 4, 2015","true","163.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It's like a collaboration of a few games I've played over the years.\n\nI began my interest inside arcades around the late 70s/early 80s.  There was a mechanical racing game -- in which you put in 2pence or 10pence (memory!), and the mechanical cars zoomed around a scaletrix-like track -- the cars were colour coded -- and if the car you bet upon was on the finish line -- you won some moolah!  Well, it wasn't moolah -- but it felt like it at the time!  I loved it.\n\nFlash-forward, and this game also reminds me of super sprint.  Another arcade release, which this time got ported over to various computers of the day.  I was a spectrum guy, but I liked my friends C64 version better.\n\nFlash-forward quite a few years later -- this game also reminds me WRC Powerslide.  I played this on XBOX360,  of which I've been a gamer, or rather, a racer for quite some time.   I really enjoy rally, and this different perspective was fab.\n\nOnward we go, and deciding upon an XBox One or PC Gaming has been a tough choice.\n\nI went for change.\n\nTrackday Manager is my first game on steam -- and I'm super-impressed.  Although, it must be said -- it was probably an easy sell given my history.\n\nThe game is under early-access, but I don't have any perspective of this -- so I'm just giving the game a battering and not trying to be overly critical of any bugs and such.  On the flip-side to Steam in-maturity stands a laid-back, it will get done when its done kind of guy.  But let's work towards getting it done in an efficient manner.\n\nI'm sure there's things cropping up which the developers didn't think about, didn't consider, didn't think were possible -- but then -- this is why they are developers -- development takes time.\n\nThe game can be simple.  The game can be intricate.  Track position can be king.  Strategy can rule.  The possiibilities are endless.\n\nMy name is razzitGT.\n\nI'll see you on the track.","June 3, 2015","true","105.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dasherk/recommended/348030/","dasherk","dasherk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dasherk/","160 products in account","Spent about an hour with it here's what I got:\n\nPros:\n1) cars look good (but theres only 6)\n2) for the few tracks I tried, they seemed interesting and challenging\n3) I did enjoy trying to strategise how I was going to get past cars, and it felt satisfying when you passed someone\n4) wait times were around 1:30, 2:00 min max. That might seem high to some, but it's not bad for a new game. The maximum is that you will be pitted against bots; so your not stuck if no one is available.\n\nCons:\n1) Not a fan of the sound track\n\n2) Hoped for more detailed car modding rather than "packages"\n\n3) 2/4 races failed for one reason or another. In one my car got stuck trying to pit and just didn't move. In another the race never started. Had to quit to menu.\n\n4) In another race I did not finish because I ran out of fuel... Now I may be wrong here, but why couldn't I just take a time penalty to get more fuel? Seems silly.\n\n5) Watching the cars felt a bit like watching RC cars race... Steering felt a little rigid.\n\n6) There's a NOS-like feature that fills up after every lap. That's a little 'gamey' if you ask me. (EDIT: I've been corrected that this is a real thing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy_recovery_system)\n\n7) You collect experience to spend on your team, but I never found a way to do that.\n\n8) You can lobby sponsers for contracts, which is neat, but it feels a bit arbitrary to build a high enough chance to get them to sign. I realize this was a simple way to simulate going out and getting contracts, but it's not terribly immersive and feels more like a mini game that is artificially handicapped by the 'TU' (time units). So its sorta like the TU are quarters and the contract 'game' is a bit of a slot machine you handicap in your favor over time.\n\n9) No camera controls. The follow cam stays on one side of the car, making it difficult to see where the car is going. You could zoom out, but that works dyanmicly so the camera is constantly panning in and out. That's not a huge issue... the main issue, is not knowing when a turn is coming to strategise your abilities (which side to overtake, when you might want to use your boost or overcharge..)\n\n10) I could be wrong, but it felt like you were racing against whomever was available regardless of skill level. That's fine, but it should be spelled out clearly that you might be up against someone with a tricked out car and a number of wins or fresh n00b. It's a little unfair to not know your competition. I expect that will get ironed out in the future, but again, its out of EA so who knows?\n\nI could go on, as I noted far more bugs and oddities than I listed, but I'm trying to be fair. All in all though, this game though I got it on sale wants me to believe its retail price is close to $30CAD. So I will compare it other games I've gotten at that pricepoint - and it really, really is not there. Mainly I was looking for a more serious racing manager... But as one reviewer said, whos warning I really should have heeded more strongly.. This is a game that would work better as an iOS app than a desktop racing manager.\n\nOne thing is clear from looking at the game, it's clearly a work in progress. A number of modes for example are "coming soon", and there's also only 6 (albeit highly detailed) cars that are clearly modeled on real life cars. So one expects that in the future one will see more tracks, more cars and probably more features. This makes me think that someone of the game mechanics may simply be placeholders for future, better versions.\n\nIn the end though, this isn't EA anymore. What you see, is what you get right now and for a game where the retail price is close to $30. or multiplayer only plus the severe bugs (pathing errors and non-starts are like getting uncooked food at a resturant. Unacceptable in 2016 at this pricepoint). That's too rich for me.\n\nI've requested a refund.\n\ntl;dr;\nNot a serious racing manager. Lacks content. Heavy on the bugs. Clearly a work-in-progress still. Priced too high, when it's current version would compete better with App Store games than other titles.","April 1","false","1.2"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","19","32","0","9"

It's not fully management as you can see your race unfold for the good or the bad and YOU have the control to make or break a race. It's definitely not for someone who can't think things through, this really does test your perception and strategic techniques. Arctic Hazard have caught onto something which really appeals to the car enthusiast, or even anyone with an interest of racing in GT3-like cars. Creation is currently limited but I am sure there will be some extra ways to customise your car in the future.\n\nOne complaint are the servers and the fact that a basic computer can barely run the game. It's a great game for sure and the game is well optimised but once the servers improve and it registers information, it truly is going to be one of the great indie titles on the market to be verified through Steam Greenlight.\n\nEDIT: Since writing this review, the game has come a long way. The servers have improved drastically and are working fantasticly. This game hasn't been out long and the developers have listened to their fans and fixed what needed fixing. However, as I said in my earlier review, you need an above average PC to run it. A simple run-of-the-mill i5 laptop (Which is what I'm using) just won't cut the processing needs for this game without a hitch. This is the bare minimum you'd need to even think about playing the game. It is a fantastic game and with more game content due out soon, you can expect great things from Trackday Manager and a bright future for Arctic Hazard.","June 5, 2015","true","189.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I like managing the team, upgrading the car and the race, even though I still don't  understand whether the choices I make in race actually make a difference. I would like to be able to choose the driving style of my pilot (aggressive, stay back, conserve the tires etc.).\n\nAt this stage the biggest problems are of performance of the software itself. I've watched races in which I placed really well and then the system froze, losing all my hard work. The last race ended with a server error when I had finished 4th. Bugs need to be squashed and performance needs to be worked on and improved.\n\nAll in all it's a good game that I would recommend to my race loving friends.

A year or so on, I feel I am at the same stage where the game has now been released and it's as enjoyable as ever but you get the feeling it left EA a month or two earlier than it should have.\n\nOverall the game is a great game and has that one more go appeal. I won't go into the specifics of what the game is about as there are many other reviews covering that aspect. I guess some of my thoughts may have been covered on the forum already, but I haven't read through each comment, so bear with me if I have said the obvious which has been covered.\n\nPros:\n- I can't think of any other game like this on Steam\n- Great racing and your strategy can really make a difference.\n- Nice weather affects which really do change a game mid race.\n- Graphics are ideal for this type of game\n- Developers all be it small are in constant comms with the players and seem a dedicated bunch who have a proper passion for the game\n- The AI could be better but not bad either.\n- Able to play when there are not enough people online\n- Good community so far, bar the odd disconnector which I gather has now been patched\n- If you're a stoner, it's an ideal sit back and veg type game, with tiny mouse inputs throughout :)\n- Other race modes look great, but no dates on when they will be ready\n\nCons\n- Matchmaking leaves a lot to be desired. New players are already faced with meeting the 'new' cars and the issue becomes worse if you meet someone with a flying time as the AI will then also follow the fastest persons time, thus making it nigh on impossible to get anywhere.\n\nI understand the concern of matchmaking would make less people per race at this present time, but racing against bots your own level would help their progression for new players.\n- Lag, but I'm not sure if it's just me but it seems to be getting better?\n- Certain tracks suit certain cars. Not being able to make at least a change or two at the lobby stage to suit the track does hinder your chances.\n- Oval track (Sorry I hate this track)\n- Other car modes and cup features not being ready on launch.\n- Some bugs from EA are still here a year on.\n\n\nRecommendations\n- I know there are 2 sides to this one, but reverse grids in Quick Race as well as Cup to try to balance the game out. otherwise we're going to keep losing new players to refund which I have discussed on a previous post.\n- You should have the option when being slipstreamed to shake the car off rather than just have him tail you to save fuel and there is nothing you can do bar pit.\n- Reverse tracks to vary the races\n- More tracks and to balance out the tracks for speed and also handling of the cars\n- Make race distances varied with Sprint, normal and enduro distances.\n- Sort out the matchmaking\n- Try to introduce another compound for a tyre, medium? This will again add more strategy to the game. For me the game is more enjoyable from a strategic point of view than the actual racing.\n- Giving the player the option to make 1 or 2 changes max when you find out what track your on in the lobby would help things as there is nothing worse than having a handling set up to then find out you are on the oval. Obviously works the same way vica versa.\n- It needs more upgradeable parts to vary things.\n\nOverall I still stand by and give the game a positive review. I've been here since day one and have seen it when we had no servers for days and bugs that made the game totally unplayable.\n\nWhat we have now isn't perfect by any means and there is a long way to go, but give the devs a chance as this game could be a great game if we keep the number of players up and it ever improves.\n\nAnyway, that's my tuppence.","April 5","true","129.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It just isn't ready for primetime yet.  I think only one mode is currently available, because Cup mode is broken and disabled. A couple of other modes are listed as "coming soon", which is another reason it should have stayed Early Access for a while longer.\n\nCheck back in a few months to see if they've gotten it working properly, or wait for a sale.\n\nThe concept is good, but it can often be a bit boring sitting back watching your driver do his thing against an entire field of bots, because there aren't enough human opponents.\n\nIt was a good feeling to win my first race, which didn't take too long to acheive.  However it feels like it's going to take forever to be able to afford the next step up in cars.

Finally on release i started playing and have to say, that i really do love that game! The tension in the races varies for sure, but all those close races do push up your adrenaline and overtaking the leader of the race shortly before the finish line due to better tires in the end is an awesome feeling!\n\nThere are definetly some issues at the moment that need to be fixed, but i am sure the devs are working hard on it. Their feedback and experience from EA prove this. The races currently get stucked sometimes, but it has become less already. And you have to consider that some issues regarding lags or networking instability is always an issue for online games at the beginning. Even Blizzard had to struggle with it. Of course in a larger scale, but also with much more resources on their side. Just a few more days and some fixes and adaptions by the devs and races will work smoothely. Eventhough the game restarts are currently necessary, it is still lots of fun, because the general concept of giving your driver some high level instructions is fun and is not getting boring during races. You always have to consider so many different things. Can i push further or do i have to save some fuel or tires? Should i stay out one more lap and therefore choose soft instead of hard tires? Will there be some rain?\n\nOne last thing to mention is the player base is currently already ok. During the main hours you get 5 or more real players into the races.

Having observed the game's development and at times being it's harshest critic. I am finally amending my review to reflect some of the progress and improvement that is TrackDay Manager today. There are still some glaring issues to be worked out, but the game is about 85% there after final release. Which is to say, I'm about 85% towards giving this title the thumbs up. I advise deciding yourself about this title. That said, here are some of the Pros and Cons of TrackDay Manager.\n\nUpdate Per Live Launch: 5 May 2016\n\nPros:\n\n1: Overall concept and premise of the game is great.\n\n2: Graphics are solid and suit the concept and focus of the game.\n\n3: Customization of race cars (Not 100% of this content is ingame), both paintschemes and sponsor placement.\n\n4: Online Multiplay, with AI fillers when lacking enough human players.\n\n5: In race chat, allowing folks to chat pre-during-post race.\n\n6: Straight forward Upgrade and Skill system, easy to understand.\n\n7: Tons of Achievements that actually unlock useful and cool ingame content.\n\n8: Highly interactive and communicative development team of 4. So yea it's small but very dedicated team.\n\nCons:\n\n1: Laggy netcode( Peer to Peer), resulting in lag spikes and sometimes adversely affecting race mechanics. Let me make clear, there are folks from all over the world playing this title and unfortunately the sheer distance between say North American players and European players often results in  laggy races. As of now, you are lucky to see another human player 1 out of maybe 10 races. Sadly MP is pretty much broken.\n\n2: Lack of Career mode, MP Racing Leagues, League Management Tools, etc. There is a Leaderboard, which tracks National, Regional and Global Ranking. The lack of League Management tools really misses the mark in allowing folks to set up (In a convienent fashion) their own racing leagues. There is a "Cup" format newly added, which is a 3 random tracks mini-race series, queued up for just like single quick race. ***Edit*** Custom races have been added, which will allow leagues to form and manage themselves externally. Though there are plans for alternate mode and Reward Cup Series coming to the game in trhe future.\n\n3: Limited amount of vehicles (6) and tracks (6), albeit there is more content incoming, no ETA.\n\n4: Microtransactions where mentioned at point, seems this may be a dead issue and no longer in this game's future. We hope.\n\n5: Rudimentary Matchmaking. New(er) Drivers are not matched with Drivers whom have Max Skills and Maxxed out Cars for 50 races. After that, time to dine the freshbloods.\n\n6: Absence of an Open Game Lobby, where folks can hangout chat, swap strategies, ask advice, arrange races.\n\n7: Inability to preset custom setups for each track, like real race teams would in real life. One setup and random assigned race tracks, so you end up using the same setup for road courses and ovals alike, etc.\n\n8: The New GUI has some work to be done, as it does error and give improper information.\n\n9: This game should have been developed as a iOS/Android Application.\n\n10: Since launch the Developement team has been slow to patch and often breaking more than fixing. Which was a problem during Early Access also. Communication has also all but dried up, the Devs seem to be paying less attention this newly launched title.\n\n11: Arctic Hazard Games did little to promote this title, barely a whisper on any social media and ignored Early Access Player advice to ultilize Twitch and other Social promotion venues.\n\nIn the End, avoid this already dead title. Was a great idea, implemented poorly.","September 15, 2015","false","715.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

Before this edit I gave this game a huge thumbs up for the reasons below but I have to point my thumb down now until the game is at least tweaked if not fixed.  Please continue reading.  Here is a list of things that make me not want to play this anymore.\n\n1.  The AI is not competative, it's a prick.  It will push you sideways down an entire straight completely ruining any chance you or it has of winning.  On the otherside of the coin, YOU make the smallest contact and YOU will slam on the breaks letting half of the pack pass you by.\n\n2.  No matchmaking.  Not only does it throw you and your slightly upgraded starter car into a race with highend cars, but it rarely finds other players.  There can not be that small of a community.  It leaves you with an offline feeling without an offline mode.\n\n3.  Last but not least.  THIS SHOULD BE IN EARLY ACCESS!!!  I had great faith about these guys from the beginning but it seems like they might be stalling out.  No race car pun intended.  The last patch gave us cup mode (the 2nd game mode promised).  This is just like the single races just with 3 times the fruastration.\n\n7 out of 10 people found this helpful before my edit and I hope they're not trying to find me because I DO like this game.  Hell, I want to love it so much but until this is fixed I have to give a thumbs down.  The original review is below so you can read it covering the good.  This needs fixed.  It is, at its core, a good game.  We just need what was promised on release and hopefully an AI with a little more sense.\n\n\nI've been looking for this style of game.  You are not the driver.  You're the Crew Chief and Spotter for your Driver.  You give your Driver commands such as overtake either left or right, draft, block a car behind, or pit.  This is the stragety.  What tires for what weather or track.  How much gas to add.  All of your team can raise thier skills.  Your Driver can raise different skills to better his abilities as well as your entire Pit Crew and your Marketing.\n\nPros\n\n-descent graphics.  Defenitly not top notch but ok on the eyes.\n-the interface is simple to use, easy to learn\n-additictive gameplay once you get the hang of it. (Top five finish and you just have to do one more race)\n\n\nCons\n\nSOME OF THESE ARE DEAL BREAKERS...PAY ATTENTION!!\n\n-Doesn't feel complete...because it's not.  There is only one game mode available right now which is quick race.\n-lack of cars.  There is only six cars at the time of this review.\n-camera controls.  Maybe it's just me\n-lack of tracks.  I haven't seen many different tracks and I have a feeling as you progress to higher tiers they'll be the same tracks with faster cars.\n-Small Community.  I'm hoping it grows as the game is out longer, but for now a quick race wait time is about two and a half minutes.  Once the race starts it fills empty positions with bot cars.  I've actually raced a few with all bots.  Sad.\n\nSome reviewers are mentioning crashes but I haven't experienced any\n\nSo why did I give this a thumbs up when I see twice as many cons?  Because it's fun.  I bought it on sale and I have no regrets.  I only hope the Developers keep up the work and don't vanish like so many Indie Early Access Game Companies do.  Also, once the community grows the intensity will too.  It was pretty exciting trying to hold first with two players drafting behind you.  Followed by fourteen bots of course.\n\nCome on!  Lets go racing!!","April 5","false","96.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Admittedly the netcode seems to, for the most part, be able to account for lag and so rather than missing content, everyone experiencing lag instead experiences constant skipping. One race my game just stopped in-place due to lag: my connection was fine and the client still responded but the race refused to continue so I had to leave the race.\n\nThat brings up another issue: there are very few players; the most populated race I played had 4 other players and the rest was AI.\n\n\nSo while I've enjoyed my time in this game, I wouldn't recommend it until:\n1) Content is further added\n2) Glitches/bugs fixed\n3) Single player added\n4) Lag\n5) Possibility of choosing whom you race and/or friends features\n6) Deceptively lacking content -- a "released" game with only 1 of 6 race options available is a joke\n\nThese are the most glaring issues but there are certainly other areas that could be improved that other reviewers have touched on.","April 4","false","74.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game is completely unfinished and very buggy.\n\nThat being said, this is actually a really good racing manager game that fills a niche where no other game really has.  It will be worth the 25 bucks they're charging when it actually has full functionality.  As of now there are only 2 racemodes:  Single Race & Cup Race.  There are 4 other modes which haven't been fully developed and are therefore not released yet.  Single Race mode is really the only option right now as the Cup mode is being developed and is incredibly buggy.\n\nIn approximately 1/6 of my races the game crashed, so that can be pretty annoying.  It only takes about 3 minutes max to jump into a game too, don't listen to this 10 minute stuff other people are posting.\n\nRight now this game is worth about 5 bucks, but that may change in the future.

The whole game is online, if there are no players you race against the AI.\n\nYou then earn money from racing which you spend on upgrading parts, each which has pros and cons. You also can get sponsors and display them on the car to earn more money.

It is very laggie (even with a 3Mbts per sec connection), the game play is really clicking a couple of buttons to increase speed and remembering to re-click before your engine overheats. I was doing really well in races until I upgraded my car, and now performance is worse than the starter car - so very quickly this game has become "not fun". There isn't much to do outside of racing, except upgrading your car, accepting contracts (one click wonders), and assigning experience points (which seem to do nothing). This game frequently crashes, and can lock up whilst you are at the starting grid, and once it unlocks, your car is halfway round the track having being passed by everyone during the time the game locked up. This happens frequently during round the track often too.\nThere are only 3 cars to choose from at this stage, the models are nice, and you can either have a top down view of your car, or go first person and see the race from the passenger seat - which is nice also.\n\nThe developer has stated that the races favour the player but the AI seems to be able to come from half a track down, to zoom past you (or knock you out of the race) which is just stupid.\n\nThere are no penalties, so bad driving gets rewarded heavily and cars don't seem to suffer any damage even when they have been endoed by some rogue AI car.\n\nFor frustration, I give this game a 10/10, otherwise:\n\nEarly Access Score: 4.5/10\n\nBuy it, if you don't mind waiting for alot of fixes and additions to be made.","June 28, 2015","true","20.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You can give orders to the driver such as pass on the left/right, floor it, and tail the guy in front of you, but you don't actually drive the car.  Money and XP to improve your car, driver, pit team, and manager (used for negotiating sponsorships==more money) from racing (EVEN IF YOU COME IN LAST PLACE!!!).\n\nFYI, game is also multiplayer only with races of 16 people, but if there are not enough people available it will fill the slots with pretty competent bots.

If this were an early access game I'd be accepting but still disappointed.  As a release title this simply isn't good enough and Steam ought to suspend sales until it is actually works.\n\nI've held off posting my review to give the development team time to make the promissed updates.  Despite the latest patch this game remains broken, full of bugs and unplayable.  Features such as the 3 race cup series have been removed - apparently to create stability so there are currently only quick races available.  If other human races are in the room - the whole point of this multiplayer game - races now freeze at the start.\n\nThe main problem is the instability of the game and frequent crashes at start or mid game.  There are many other bugs but even getting to race is a lottery, actually racing with other humans is highly unlikely to work.\n\nIf you do manage to find a race and see it through to the finish there are a whole host of game breaking bugs which remain in the game:\n\n- Worn tyres fitted to the player car at the start of races.\n- Dry tyres fitted to the player car for wet races - after selecting wet tyres from the pre race menu.\n- Race finishing positions are incorrect.\n- Race payouts either do not add up correctly or do not work at all.\n- AI performance is erratic, the AI can often perform impossible feats.\n- Incorrect race statistics - my race statistics say I have completed over 90 races at a track I have really raced on less than 10 times.\n- Achievements unlocking randomly without any reference to what happens in the game.\n- Random sound issues, the sound seems to become a mixed up drone by mid race.\n\nEqually worrying is the fact the devs remove comments from the community hub.  The removal of my feedback on a recent test is one of the reasons I have decided to post this review today.  If the devs are now removing comments about the broken nature of the game this is unnaceptable.\n\nThere is a great basic game idea here but at this moment this game is broken and not release ready at all.

While still in Early Access, the final release seems... promising. While the game's graphics aren't amazing (maybe good for 2006 up to 8) the core game is pretty good. When I got the game I was given instructions on how to play (via private message from developers) and the game is pretty fun at times. I haven't played too much, and the lack of content isn't immediately spotted. The game is worked on by just 6 people, and if you compare this game to something like Big Rigs (with 12 developers) this game is like a masterpiece to that.\n\nSo, if you would like to support the developers I'd say get the game in Early Access. However, if you want the most out of your buck, wait for the game to come out of E.A.\n\nSo I would give it maybe a 7/10 or less.","September 12, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Or, at the very least, a diamond in the rough.\n\nAfter several hours of more fun than I had ever expected (man, those hours flew by fast) I decided it was about time I broke out of my shell and popped the review-cherry on Steam. And I'm not even a petrol head!\n\nThe pros:\n- The races are fun!\n- Car customization is solid, with paint schemes, sponsor placement and may other details to tweak.\n- Weather and day/night cycle adds a lot of both tactics and atmosphere.\n- Skill system for driver and pit crew is simple and logical.\n- Online matchmaking system is good. I was a bit sceptical about this at first, but the solution to add in AI controlled vehicles to fill in the empty seats is very elegant as it completely eliminates queue times.\n\nThe cons:\n- Would like to see the "management" part get expanded upon, for instance with more detailed control over the driver and pit crew (finding replacement team members, sending them to training camp, etc). This could also add some personal connection to the team, instead of just managing a car.\n- Skill system is a bit TOO simple. Some more advanced skill customization options wouldn't hurt. Although I guess that would probably be a result of more advanced management features (if we get individual skills for each team member for instance) so technically not a "con" on it's own, but deserves mention.\n- Not enough content. Should have more cars, more tracks, more everything. Leagues, tournaments, random events, counting the days in a season, calendar marking races and event you have signed the team on for, etc, etc.\n\nSo, considering most of these Cons may be addressed before launch (this game is still in Early Access after all), I'd say this is looking mighty promising!\n\nAll in all: Recommended!\n\nAnd a tip for those of you just getting started: Go to options and enable tooltips - that will help a LOT. And save you a lot of time trying to figure things out blindly, like I did. *cough*\nSeriously though, turn those tooltips on!","September 17, 2015","true","17.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Trackday Manager is in a niche where I'm looking for a goodgame since a long time. A niche where I culd spend 50 € eyes closed for a really good game.\n\nBut right now, the game is only on a very very early state. Had lots of crashes with my laptop (i5-4200U/ GT 840M/ 8GB) some very annoying bugs like cars teleporting (now fixed tough).\n\nThe most annoying thing is that it seems that if you want to win, you don't have many options : you HAVE to play with your throttle pedal. Push it to the max when your engine is cool, when its about to burn, release it, make it cool and then repeat. If you do that, you'll end with a 30-40 Kph advantage over your opponents in the straights and an more powerful acceleration than the one granted by KERS.\n\nIf you try to save fuel, to use your KERS smartly, and don't do like every other guy : you'll end outside of the podium, everytime, even if you do one pit stop and they do two. So, where is the strategy point if only one strategy seems to be working ?\n\nAfter 110 minutes of playing, i'm wondering about asking a refund. But I will not because I want to see where this game is going. So, I truct you guys, don't disappoint me in the next months and we'll be cool.

After playing today I just can't see myself recommending it to anyone due to bugs and poor matchmaking. I played in one Cup and was unfortunate enough to get a bug where my car would not pit which resulted in me running out of fuel and getting a DNF. The second Cup I tried to play after that, the first race was going well then halfway through the last lap with plenty of fuel. My position turns DNF with 8% fuel left, I was set to cross the line with about 2-3%. Then it says I finished 4th but I received no points for the Cup. On top of all this, every single Cup race I play in, I always end up being placed in races with other drivers who have cars that are much more upgraded than mine. This isn't a surprise, you can see it in the pre-race lobby where it shows their fastest lap times on that track. At that point I realize that I won't win the race except if they disconnect or run out of fuel or get hit with a bug. There is no way to race without other players to help give yourself a better chance to compete against the AI and not just get destroyed by other players and then increase the amount of time it takes for you to become competitive with parts they already have.","April 20","false","52.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","2"

I have so much fun playing its unreal. If you can't deal with server issues and bugs and sometimes not getting stuff you won or whatever, then don't buy it until launch. That still happens on the reg. But it is so fun to play already. The gameplay is great and the racing is incredibly balanced and fun. When this guy is ready for launch (literally I don't even care if it takes forever) as long as the key features are tight this game has so much potential. If they give it even more depth as they plan to....\nOMG Becky!\n\nI love this game (If i change my mind later I'll repost, since i have played thirty hours in like two days.... Wait? Three days?

It has a lot of promise.  Currently their are a few lag/bug issues after release, but their have been numerous patches since release day, that make things better.  Finding a quick race still takes about 5 minutes, due to not too many people playing, but when you do get a race, man it is fun.  If you like SIM games, you'll like this.  If you like Racing games and SIM games, you'll spend hours in your garage making your best car.

Game was developed for Europe and is completely unplayable in other continents as the entire game is multiplayer. This is the most disappointing early access I've ever been involved with, and that's saying something.\n\nI CANNOT SAY THIS LOUDLY ENOUGH: DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES PURCHASE THIS GAME IN IT'S CURRENT STATE. THE DEVS ARE CURT AND DISMISSIVE OF ISSUES AND CONTINUE TO DENY THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEMS THE GAME IS CURRENTLY FACING.\n\nThis a copy/paste from a forum thread where everybody is having the same problem(s):\n\nI had the same issue. Server can't connect and then I end up with a max cash stack.\n\nUpdate: I reloaded the game and my cash had normalized and the sort of tutorial thing restarted correctly, but I got into a race that my car wasn't in. And then the camera just stayed zoomed in to the starting point, even after all the cars had left. I have no idea what any of this was about.\n\nI'm all for early access, and I have backed a couple games that I'm really happy about. Sadly this game is getting added to the list of regrets for now as it is completely unplayable. I'm all for working out bugs, but there are several game breaking issues that can't be played around at all.\n\nI would highly recommend holding onto your money for now as there is no way you will get any entertainment value out of this game in it's current state.\n\nI am very interested to see where the game goes as I thing there is a huge amount of potential. The multiplayer aspect is fantastic and I love the core concept of the game, which I think is executed well. Again, sadly there are just some general  software issues that are preventing the game from really being playable.\n\n5/30 Update:\n\nGame still hugely buggy and devs refuse to admit it. Yes I understand they are working hard yadda yadda... but they refuse to admit they are wrong... No hope in hell of getting a refund. The community also seems to be full of victim blamers who claim that it's my fault that every race bugs out.","May 28, 2015","false","17.6"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

The graphics are fine for what you need to do in the game and I am comfortable recommending the game even at this early stage though obviously like and early access it needs some work.\n\nUPDATE: So back to not being able to recommend the game. Log in and there is no car there... there was before, now there is not. Ok let's start over, it's early access, I made some mistakes, maybe start with the only other car you can start with. Nope, I see no way to start another career.\n\nSeems to have promise but wait until it's done before you buy it. I have fallen in the the early access pay for alpha trap and it is my fault.

Its not perfect but I get the impression a successful launch and focused devs could make this an amazing game.\n\nI'm addicted but and its a BIG BUT the development of this game will have to focus on real gameplay for me to stay addicted. Too many of these management games dedicate time, effort and ultimately my computer memory to periferal things that in truth are needless niceties. The Sponsorship element fits this category and whilst I wouldn't remove it I think the development should focus on a more balanced list of competing cars (I read someone else commenting on this), more in play commands (the current ones are good and pretty satisfying), a set up module and a practice mode which allows you to gain more understanding over the effects of things like tire wear and ECU settings.\n\nI would also suggest the option of longer races (obviously not 24 hour but maybe double the roughly 10 minute current run).\n\nFinally I would just point out a lot of the in game play is a process of trial and error as there isn't much in the way of detailed guides or instructions. I quite like this but thats why with this ommission a practice option is pretty much essential.\n\n","March 11","true","56.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"
