"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uhhhmmmmmmm/recommended/386080/","uhhhmmmmmmm","Captain Ineptitude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uhhhmmmmmmm/","425 products in account","I bought this game since I knew the developers could create great games based on their phenominal previous title, Ziggurat, and since I wanted a side scrolling Action RPG, and this looked to scratch the itch that I had.\n\nThe visuals in this game are absolutely top notch, with a great art style and high quality graphical fidelity. Very well polished and it's very obvious that a lot of time was spent getting the feel right for the theme.\n\nSound design is mostly good again, although I do wish some of the enemy soldiers you fight early on didn't have the same voice as I chose for my character, as it sometimes made it hard to distinguish who was getting hit in the middle of a fight, and caused me to die once or twice. Although, since only a few of them shared my voice and it is mostly my fault for not paying attention to the low health indicator, it's not a big issue at all.\n\nMusic is good overall, but I don't really remember any of the tracks that I heard while playing once I'm done playing. That doesn't mean it isn't good, as it fits the game excellently.\n\nLevel design is slightly different to other games in this genre, as the game takes place on lots of small but fully fleshed out 3D maps, and you navigate them in 2D. Taking turns up or down roads moves the camera round, so you can always see what you are doing.\nI like this system for the level layouts as it doesn't make them feel like massive corridors and enables you to see areas that you haven't reached yet. It also just helps to make the views behind the character more interesting.\n\nThe HUD is simple, but gives you all of the information you need. One addition I was very pleased to see was an indicator that shows when you are low on health or stamina. It flashes above the player's head in two colours; red and green. Red is for low health and green is for low stamina, and they match the colours of the bars in the HUD.\nThe HUD is unobtrusive and implemented well.\n\nIn terms of gameplay it borrows liberally from the Souls franchise, which was the intention of the developer, as it is stated in the store page synopsis.\nYou have your weapon in one hand, shield in the other, and can wear armour on your head, arms, chest, and legs. You can also wear rings which give you a small passive buff\nWhen you die, you lose some experience, but if you can reach that point again without dying, you get it back.\nThe amount of stamina you have is effected by the weight of the armour and weaponry you have equipped.\nWhen you die, you respawn at the last shrine you prayed at.\nWhen you pray at a shrine, it respawns all of the enemies in the area.\nYou are able to block incoming attacks directly using your shield or your weapon, or can dodge out of the way. The dodge movements all have some invincibility frames.\nYou get a certain number of health drinks which can be refilled by praying at a shrine.\nBut, it does differ in some key ways:\nSince it's 2.5D, dodge-rolling can be done through enemies, to reach the other side of them.\nIt is quite a lot easier to be cornered than in any Souls game, so aggressive attacking can be more viable.\nParrying an enemy only seems to break their block (This might not be correct,but I haven't had it work in any other scenario)\n\nOverall, this game absolutely deserves your attention for the price. The game has clearly had a huge amount of care attention poured into it and it shows in the visuals and gameplay.\n\n\nTL;DR The game is really damn good and 100% worth it for the price.","April 29","true","5.0"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","35","43","4","0"

The studio has printed its personality once again in a development, paying attention to the finest details and bugs. By the way, the only bug that I encountered so fast was in the settings menu, but restarting the game solved everything without problems. It runs fast even on a mid range PC at highest quality settings.\n\nFrom the game point of view, the action when fighting is really focused. The 2D movement allows you to easly think on the combat. Parrying is a bit hard, and I seem to have problems avoiding some traps, but feels fair most of the time (anyone said Dark Souls?)\nMaybe the only -personal- minor drawback I can see is the setting. Im not a big fan of Ancient Egypt mythology, although there are really interesting enemies in the game (not a place for spoilers ;)), and the developer has done its best putting you in place. Travelling through this incarnation of Egypt is rewarding nonetheless.","January 30","true","16.2"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","21","30","3","0"

If you're having a hard time avoiding a certain trap rest assured that there is a way to avoid the damage, you just have to think a bit.\n\nFor its current price I'd reccomend getting it, as long as you don't mind dying about as much as you would in Dark Souls.","April 29","true","5.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","0"

The combat is fairer than most Souls-like games but also challenging and fulfilling.\nGood quality-cost relationship, very replayable. For me, the money best spent this year.\n\nThere are many combinations of weapons, armors and magic powers to try and this makes the title very replayable.\nYou can make your own combat style by changing weapon length, weight or speed or armor lightness and the game seems to allow you to try a lot of builds without blocking your progress.\n\nGraphics and sound quality are professional-level, and art and design is superb, colourful and very appealing. I liked a lot the models of enemies and final bosses (i want a bestiary).\n\nStory is simple but fine, background lore however is more developed and shows an interesting setting to explore and learn about.\n\nWorld is intrincate despite it's linear appearance in the screenshots, there are alternative paths in each of the regions of the game, and region themselves are interconnected through secret shortcuts often defended by mini-bosses.\n\nAnd about bosses: Main bosses have personality and you are told about its story and background by NPCs when approaching the combat. That builds an unique feeling of the boss being in the right place, where you are breaking in as a hunter, and makes combat meaningful.","April 14","true","30.4"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SwaiN/recommended/386080/","SwaiN","Fuji","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SwaiN/","156 products in account","While I had some fun with this game, I can't recommend it as advertised.  The game is pretty, but the core gameplay of combat is festering baby-♥♥♥♥ garbage.  Engaging in combat is the only thing you can do in this game.  Let me be clear, I don't like puzzles or platforming.  I bought this game because it seemed right up my alley, but it doesn't deliver.  This game failed miserably in trying to draw inspiration from Dark Souls.  For a game that is all about combat, it lacks a lot of polish, attention to detail, & suffers from poor design philosophy.  I wish I hadn't read all the positive reviews who think this game is anything like Dark Souls, or praised silly ♥♥♥♥ like "beautiful art" and "tight responsive controls".  It's a video game, your inputs ARE SUPPOSED TO BE RESPONSIVE.  It is SUPPOSED to look nice, though not absolutely required nor even necessary.\n\nCharacter limit reached on review, excuse the shorthand:\n\nCombat:\n\nGood:\n-Nothing\n\nNeutral:\n-It's plentiful\n\nBad:\n-You can't run by/thorugh/around enemies you've killed multiple times.\n\n-Hitboxes.  Absolutely atrocious.  Attacks that should hit you don't, attacks that shouldn't hit you do.  Likewise with your attacks on enemies.\n\n-Why are there so many enemies?  Why do I have to redo ambushes?  Why do the enemies overlap models (can't see ♥♥♥♥ captain!).\n\n-Attack patterns.  In Dark Souls, big weapon enemies telegraph attacks & they can't swing large ♥♥♥ weapons 100MPH.  In this game, enemies randomly flail huge weapons at lightning speed.  Some attack patterns include 10'  leaps with cross-body backswings that end 270 degrees from main hand side to behind the body, ~ another 5' behind their body.  Honestly, the attacks enemies make are just dumb, unrealistic, & unfair.  Sometimes the enemy will taunt you for 10s, just spam light attack & kill it.\n\n-"Invulnerability frames".  Anyone who's played Dark Souls knows what I'm talking about.  There are no invulernability frames, if I had to guess it's merely timing related & the game calculated if a ray from the weapon or projectile passed through you.  Sometimes you're in the middle of dodging & you still get hit, sometimes you don't dodge & attack passes right through you.  See hitboxes.\n\n-Parrying.  This is the worst.  Perhaps if parrying was not completely ballsack I would recommend it.  First off, there are no half parries.  A parry hits or doesn't.  Your shield will clearly be going through a weapon swing & you will get hit. Often multiple times from one miss.  There's no explanation for how parries work either, except for the information I'm giving you right now.  Veterans of Dark Souls like myself (I have an all-dialogue all-solo speedrun on YT) aren't scared of enemies.  We are up in their face at all times.  Parry doesn't work if you're too close to the enemy.  Even if you're not too close, your parry still might not work if the enemy uses an attack that has him step into your hitbox.\n\n-More about parrying.  There's no reward for parrying.  Parrying takes stamina, & all parries are performed at the same speed regardless of shield, which might be a neutral point for some.  You can stun an enemy for two seconds by parrying, but it makes more sense to either block the hit & not risk the garbage parry system not working, or just backpedal constantly as enemies whiff.  That's right, the best strategy isn't even to block, or parry.  It's  to bait an attack, walk backwards a bit, then wail at the enemy with full stamina, rather than wasting stamina & health trying to parry or block.  Only a handful of attacks that "can't be dodged", but hitboxes are so garbage you CAN dodge most of the attacks that "glow blue because they can't be dodged".  Poor design.\n\n-Weapon dynamics.  See items below.  What happens when you swing a big ♥♥♥ axe at a lightly armored archer's face?  Nothing.  You MIGHT do 30-40% of his health with one hit for 50-100% of your stamina.  The fact that double hits exists is unacceptable.  Let's be real, if you hit something in the face with a weapon so heavy you can barely wield it, should you get stabbed by his dagger after he gets hit?  AFTER HE DIES?!  You will get hit by attacks from enemies that are already dead.  Hit them in the face with a hundred pound axe, they won't get sent flying back, they won’t even flinch FFS.  Sometimes attacks pass through models & they won't even take damage!  Wow!\n\n-In summation, is this game hard & unforgiving?  No. Whether or not you get hit, or hit the enemy is 50% skill & 50% luck.  It’s a tedious grind for more health & the next checkpoint.  Like I said earlier, most of the time you just have to backpedal & then smack the enemies after they whiff.  You can block, but it's a waste of stamina & health & you run the risk of having your block broken by some random ♥♥♥ double hit on a backswing.  You can parry if you stay far from the enemy.\n\nPlayer Character:\n\nGood:\n-You can characterize him (or her), a little.\n\nNeutral:\n-Classic silent protagonist.\n\nBad:\n-The skills you get are dumb.  There are no special attacks, no special bonuses, & no differences between the skills.  Each one reduces stamina penalties for cetain types of equipment.  In the case of weapons the skills sometimes increase the speed at which they swing by a whopping 10-20%.  The skills are basically just grinding rewards. They offer nothing unique.\n\nItems:\n\nGood:\n-There's a barely acceptable amount of items.\n\n-Some items have neat flavor text.\n\nNeutral:\n-The lore of items is lacking compared to Dark Souls.\n\n-You get a lot of duplicate items.  I've gotten 1 "boss weapon" out of 5 bosses.\n\nBad:\n-There's only 3 basic weapons.  The differences between weapons are the skin & the damage, all else negligible.  There's heavy weapons, spears, swords, & smaller swords.\n\n-The weapons don't have unique movesets that alter your playstyle. None of them have any special effects.\n\nStory:\n\nGood:\n-It's semi-original.\n\nNeutral:\n-Tidbits of lore from NPCs.\n\nBad:\n-I can't tell you who my character is (except the Grand Vizier to the Red Pharaoh)\n\n-You kill a bunch of stuff because some random lady teleports away from you while you're in prison & collect a bunch of keys because, um, well that's not explained yet.  Just because.\n\n-Named characters are bland & have no impact on the game.  Neat part where you kill someone's son.\n\nDesign:\n\nGood:\n-Barely acceptable world size.\n\nNeutral:\n-The maps given are accurate, but purposely ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Thx for trying to maintain immersion, but can I have a map that doesn't look like dogshit next time?  It would be nice if I didn't have to press 8 buttons  on my controller to look at the map.\n\n-You'll probably die enough & the levels are very small so the map is obsolete.\n\nBad:\n-The "bonfires" & steles are placed really inconveniently.  The game isn't "hard" because of the lack of steles or bonfires - tedious & grindy.\n\n-NPC interaction is beyond dumpster quality.  Most of them gesticule wildly, flail, and talk to themselves.  When you turn in a quest, they repeat themselves.  It's embarassingly hideous & bad.","May 1","false","7.0"," 51 of 93 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","51","93","5","9"

This is no button masher.\n\nOf all the things this game has (and it has a lot) what I love the most is the RPG elements.

As other reviews and the store page have noted it plays like a sidescrolling 2.5D Souls game. Pharaonic also reminds me of Apotheon, a sidescrolling action game with a little Souls influence as well. The Egyptian artstyle is lovely and there are a wide variety of locations to enjoy - it's not all just sand and pyramids here. The combat has weight to it and rewards forethought and knowledge of enemy attack patterns as you block and dodge about, juggling your stamina to attack without overextending yourself.\n\nMost of the gameplay takes place on the one plane but lately I've had to deal with archers and spells flung at me in other planes; time will tell if the game does anything more with the 2.5D view to elevate it from a style choice. My only real complaint so far is a lack of variety in playstyles like the Souls games and other aRPGs offer - namely no archery, steath/backstabbery and a lackluster magic system that is really just a backup or supporting tool, no way to  play as a caster here. Beyond that it is a highly polished gem of a game (haven't encountered a single bug so far) that I keep going back to in favor of the small pile of games in my backlog.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend picking this title up.","April 30","true","19.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I don't mean it's a Souls-like, although it is, but there are *blatant* references. Like every time you use a shrine, the animation looks oddly familiar.\n\nWhen you beat a certain boss and you're stood on a bridge, you can 'pray'...and you form a Y-shape towards the sun.\n\nIs that a bad thing? No, not really.\n\nPharaonic brings enough to the table, both known mechanics and unique twists that allow the game to stand apart even while being counted as a Souls-like game.\n\nWeapons are not upgraded (at least not that I've seen), but there are different tiers of weaponry, requiring a level up in a skill to use either light or heavy weapons of a particular tier without penalties. If you invest 2 points in Light Weapons, you can use level 0, 1, and 2 Light Weapons without penalties, and you even get a bonus if you're using level 0 or level 1.\n\nThe same applies to armour.\n\nThe presence of 3 healing chugs that recharge is quite punishing. There are places to recharge your canteen without respawning enemies, but they're rare enough to not be able to rely on them.\n\nThe overall feel of this game is polished and smooth, and definitely an enjoyable purchase for a good price.","May 21","true","3.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/recommended/386080/","raixel","raixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/","495 products in account","Pharaonic is good. Plain and simple.\n\nWhat is it? Some people say it reminds them of Dark Souls. I dont know. I haven't played Dark Souls because I heard the PC port was terrible, and I dont do consoles. So I won't be making any Dark Souls comparisons. What it does remind me of is Bushido Blade or the swordfighting of Prince of Persia. A *real* swordfight. 3-4 hits and you're toast. Long story short. Its set in Ancient Egypt, but the story desn't follow history - its its own thing, You pick your char, choosing from skin, head, gender and voice. THANK YOU DEVS for creating as many options for females as males. Nothing gets me more as a chick gamer then when theres half as many portraits/models for chick PCs and they're all running around in chain mail bikinis no one in their right mind would actually wear (seriously? Chain links and pubes? OW). Then you're off.\n\nIts 3d images on a 2d plane, although at certain areas, you can hit up or down to take a path heading in that direction and the camera effect as it swoops around to put you back on the 2d plane is well done. It does slightly suffer from that "accidentally go back and forth between rooms effect" that games like the old Resident Evils did when your perspective suddenly changes, but its really minor and not a big deal, only happened a couple times so far.\n\nEnemies come, and you fight. Theres a hard attack, fast attack, dodge, shield bash, block, and later you get magic.\n\nYou fight the bad guys as you do sidequests and go on your main mission to defeat the evil Red Pharaoh, plain and simple. Sometimes they are one at a time, sometimes you got groups.\n\nEverything you do in battle takes stamina, which refills quickly. But run out from attacking or dodging too much, and you stand there like a doof for a second wuntil you can dodge or attack again. Theres plenty of awsome items, both found in chests, looted from enemies, and bought at shops. Lighter stuff is faster and takes less stamina to use, but does less damage or has less defense. Heavy is the opposite.\n\nYou have 3 healing potions you can refill at certain areas once per save point, and also save statues which refill everything, health, magic, healing potions. Thing is, when you use one, all enemies respawn too. So its the choice of "do I continue, and maybe die, or go back and heal knowing I have to fight my way back.". Death isnt that big of a deal, you lose some of your XP, which if you make it back to the spot you died you can reclaim, but you get to keep your equipment and you dont lose quest progress.\n\nIts a good thing, because youre going to be dying. A lot. This game is hard, but really fun. When you die, *you* did it. The one complaint i have is that once an attack animation starts for you, theres no way to pull back. You're committed to whatever move you do until the animation has ended. You have one interrupt you can do against an enemy, but it takes a lot of stamina, and it better be timed perfectly or you're going to be nailed. And you cant take many hits, so making mistakes are going to cost you. I like the fact that it makes you think though and is more realistic than 99% of games out there. Really, how many spears through the chest could one person take?\n\nAnother thing that I wanted to mention is that the controller is fully mappable. Again, THANK YOU DEVS. Not all of us have 2 fully working hands, and a game like this would be unplayable for me if I had to use the default controls.\n\nThe graphics arent great, but they are decent for an indie game. Every type of weapon and armor you equip looks different, and I love games that do that. One funny thing is that the female model's hands are exactly the same size as the male's, although she is overall smaller. It looks ridiculous and I have no idea why its like that. Other than that, the graphics are well done and appropriately ancient Egyptian.\n\nOverall, if you like action RPGs, this is great. Yes, its hard. Yes it can be frustrating at times. BUt its still really really fun.","May 15","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Love the art style and gameplay. Need to play more so say more.\nSome general comments. Combat is great, but needs a better tutorials. Some icons (status effects) didnt have immediate meaning. Also some practice on timing the parry wouldnt go amiss.\nIs it just me or is the frame rate a little weird. A lot of people are saying it ran fast, but i ran into sub 20 fps. Ill try it again to see if it is consistent.\nEDIT: Running on 1080p immediately tanks the frame rate. running on 720p works. None work well on any graphics setting over very low, but i assume that is by design during early access.\nOverall, looking forward to the finished product.","February 3","true","1.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
