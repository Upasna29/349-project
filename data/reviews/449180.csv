I got into this game really quickly. Certain levels will really have you think out your moves. But if you are like me, getting all 3 stars for completing level is oh so satisfying and leaves you feeling like a genius. Two really great parts to mention, if you do get stuck on a level, you can get another power up to support your way through it. So for me, it never got frustrating or have to rage quit. It is always a great brain teaser. Secondly, there is a level editor for other people (and you) to make new levels to try, so there are always new levels.","May 13","true","4.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

The game started out very simply as the game eased you into controlling the various mechanics of the game, however the difficulty curve rose sharply around the 25th level. If you're looking for a more challenging puzzle game I would certainly recomend this, but more casual puzzle game players might be turned away at the overall difficulty.\n\nThe biggest boon to the game is the built-in level editor. The replay value for this game is extremely high thanks to being able to access user-created levels from around the world. The editor is nice to use and does give players a lot of freedom when designing their own levels.\n\nI would love to see a mobile release in the future, a platform where I believe a game like this would shine.","May 12","true","2.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

At least that is true for the first 20 or so levels, then it suddenly gets pretty difficult, and you have to start planning out your paths before you even make the first move.\n\nThe built-in puzzles are great and challenging, and the level builder is made in a way that you can make levels with all the features as the built-in ones, which is a rare feature in games with level designers.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for something to play for a few minutes at a time while waiting for matchmaking, then I would say this is perfect.","May 11","true","1.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It's a nice puzzle game. It's not too easy nor is it over the top in terms of difficulty. There are unique mechanics that are easy to pick up. Using the logo of the game to help with the color changing is clever. There's a large variety in levels as well as custom designed maps.\n\nThe only other thing I can say is that I feel that I would be more compelled to play the game if it showed up on a mobile platform though.","May 11","true","0.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Looking forward to see what they come up with next.\n\nStart following this Dev folks. No really, DO IT.\n","May 13","true","5.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The levels are not so easy that you get bored and not too hard that you want to pull your hair out (at least not that I've seen yet). Meld has so many different power-ups and each level can be completed a number of different ways so you can always go back and try something new. I really love the level design feature for this game. It allows anyone to be able to create a custom level and upload it for everyone else to enjoy. This is genius! The level design feature opens the possibility for infinite replay value which I think is pretty awesome.\n\n10/10 will be playing this game again.","May 11","true","4.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The first set of levels are pretty easy while it is teaching you how to play...but the levels get very challenging after a short while. I like how there are multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.  The gameplay is very multi-dimensional, you really have to plan your strategy out ahead of time, deciding which colors to meld together, what power-ups to use and what route to take.\n\nIf you like challenging puzzle games, I definitely recommend Meld.  I love when I finally figure out a puzzle that I have been stuck on, great job with the level designs!","May 11","true","1.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
