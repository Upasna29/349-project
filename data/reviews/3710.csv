That classic Dredd humor with some surprisingly decent shooting. Arresting perps is satisfying beyond belief. Unlawful posession of a hamster? It's the cubes for you, criminal scum. A cool primary weapon with all of the weapon modes from the comics and some great cutscenes with Dredd being badass as usual.

I got it on a Steam sale and it is worth full price.\n\nSure there are flaws, acknowledged.    One of the levels stopped giving me hints and I got stuck.  Exiting the game and reloading (not reinstalling) it brought back that levels hints so I could proceed. BTW that particular map was a little different that it required some thought to figure out how to defeat the judge.\n\nBut the game is FUN, not frustrating and I kept going even after sometimes dying a lot.\n\nTHIS not the average shooter where the whole world is a free fire zone;  where any sighted  sprite or actor, is likely hostile, and you shoot it.\n\nIn DREDD, indiscriminate killing  has bad consequences.  There are citizens that may appear suddenly in your face and , after years of computerized  "shooter training;" instinct is full-auto to THEIR face.  OOPs, reload save.  Even while blasting identified bad guys, one has to be careful of citizens, allied judges or the surrendered nearby.\n\n--some actors are your allied judges.\n--some actors are criminal scum but can be disarmed / arrested (for me more satisfying than head splats)\n--the arrested /surrendered criminal scum are helpless and you have the moral obligation to avoid having them killed by errant gunfire; most likely coming from your own barrels.\n--some actors are citizens and you do not want to see them harmed, and in many cases you are trying to rescue them.\n--you can ambush criminal scum to gain a tactical advantage, but it counts against you.\n--you can challenge criminal scum and lose tactical advantage, though some will surrender; giving you the opportunity for that oh so satisfying arrest lingo ie "YOU JUST EARNED YOURSELF xxxxx Time IN THE CUBES."\n\nAnd there is a level where you VISIT these cubes.   Jump off a catwalk on a container then into the iso cube, if curious.  A bunk, a toilet and print across the wall, CRIME DOES NOT PAY.\n\nUnlike Fallout 3, your pockets are not deep.  You can only have two weapons which requires some decisions.   Firefights may use up your ammo of your preferred Judge Gun; and that's another thing, setting  criminal scum on fire with the incendiary round is inadvisable.  You overreaching cop, you. There are plenty of vampires and zombies to try it out on.   Your Judge Gun has all kinds of ammo types which replace gun variety in other games.  There is even some kind of grenade (I have yet to use).\n\nSome levels you can go through Judge Gun ammo quick and there are other found weapons to try.  Once ammo is used up, these found weapons can get you through the level. Depending, although, on how things go, you may be trading them out for different found guns.  The grenade launcher may not be the best choice as blowback bites.   To save ammo, some adversaries can be tackled in melee mode with little risk.  Yes, health can run quite low and it may  require several save reloads to get through a level.\n\nThe voice acting is hilarious, reminding me of Duke Nukem 3d, arresting a perp yields "tough cop" howlers such as  "throwing away the key," or "there's an iso cube with your name on it." or "you're taking the big ride;"  to name a few.  Tone quite close to the 2012  movie Dredd. Let's just forget about that Stallone attempt.  I think even Stallone wants to forget.\n\nThe bizarre fashion world of Judge Dredd  can take some getting used to. For example, there are  numerous fatties with bellywheels to help prop their enormous bulk.   Apparently though, they are not an aberration as one might expect to see in a singularly unique character;  but a conscious citizen  lifestyle.  Wikipedia explained them  as "Bored citizens who have turned to gluttony as a means to pass the time."\n\nViews  from rooftops and other outside areas can be breathtaking. Mega City One looms in the background, an architectural metropolis.  The skyline is packed with elaborate skyscrapers and futuristic aircraft ply the skies.  For a few minutes at least, I would take in that scenery marveling at its artistic skill.  I like to take a look around at the aesthetics of the environment and not just blow through the level.  There is a nightclub that had some interesting decor, for example.\n\nI'm playing this on an IMAC 27"  WIn8.1, bootcamp with an old USB Logitech gamepad not updated past WinXP  but it works fine on 8.1.  Like all other games,  I just have to re-import the profile after computer reboots and insure the profile is set to persistent (no there is no option to install the gamepad outside the program fldr).\n\nI'm sorry this game was not more popular, it has a lot of good things in it I'd like to see in other games; you do not have to kill the entire world to win.\n9/110\n\nA good look at what the game is about if you are still reluctant to give up the cheeseburger cash:\n\nhttp://superadventuresingaming.blogspot.com/2012/01/judge-dredd-dredd-vs-death-pc.html","October 12, 2015","true","14.6"," 84 of 91 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","84","91","9","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Valerie-Valens/recommended/3710/","Valerie-Valens","~★PetSquirrel★~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Valerie-Valens/","647 products in account","First off, let me get this out of the way : This game is objectively bad, but the following is why I think you should pick it up anyways.\n\nThis game is an arcade shooter where the campaign is a means to unlock the more challenging ones. This game is based on the comic book dystopian future of Judge Dredd, where you play as the franchise' namesake Joseph Dredd. In this game's camaign, you fight through levels where you have to not only take down crooks by shooting their guns off or injuring them a bit before arresting them, you also have the dark Judges to contend with, as well as vampires. Exact plot details are lost on me as it gets really stupid.\n\nThe game shows signs of brilliance and potential to be a great comic book video game franchise like the Batman Arkham series, but Rebellion ran out of money, and what we are left with is a 3 hour campaign that is pretty unpolished and unoptimized, even on more modern systems. And that's where a lot of the problems with this game come from, lack of budget and time. It doesn't have any great widescreen or FoV options, the enemy AI can sometimes glitch out and do stupid things. As such, I can understand how many could be put off by this game.\n\nOn the other hand, this is a budget shooter that costs less than a Cheeseburger combo at McDonalds. Not only that, there are plenty of arcade style challenges that are unlocked when playing through the campaign, and they are actually quite fun. For a budget shooter, this one has a surprising amount to offer in terms of replayability. Not to mention, Rebellion did put in the effort to try to make it feel like a Judge Dredd game. If you are bored and are looking for something quick and inexpensive to chew through, you can definitely do worse than this game. If you are a fan of the series looking for something extra to add to your collected curios, this should at least amuse you.","December 27, 2013","true","10.1"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","39","45","0","2"

Your Dread quips are terribly enjoyable (just keep hitting e). Arresting people is fun, the list of charges is amusing. The gameplay is smooth. It's easy to play.

Which is ignorable mostly. My main gripe is the scacity of goodie drops. Ammo isn't hard to comeby, but good luck getting a health drop.\n\n\nI haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I'm looking forward to it.\n\nBut for a Judge Dread style shootfest and a good laugh.

The graphics look very dated, the animations are jerky, the AI is stupid, the vampire and undead enemies are poorly coded and animated, the level design sometimes feels very obtuse, and there's a plethora of weird bugs.\n\nHowever, if you're a fan of the comic book, there's certainly fun to be had here. Rebellion nailed perfectly Judge Dredd's unique sense of humour and the rendition of Mega-City One is spot on. It's violent, gore, stupid, hilarious at times, and pure mindless fun.\n\nThe headshots are awesome (instant bloody decapitation!). You can immolate people. Kill by ricochet. Fire homing bullets. And even reliably disarm perps by shooting their weapons off their hands, allowing you to arrest them, instead of killing them. You can also kill your allies and civilians. It's funny that you can abuse of your authority to arrest innocent civilians, while listening to their complaints make it all the more hilarious.\n\nAside from the solo/coop campaign, there's a survival mode and many LAN multiplayer modes (you can replace humans with bots too). The multiplayer games, being fast and violent, can be very fun to play with a group of friends.","November 26, 2013","true","1.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

That being said it is a lot of fun to play, the shooting mechanics are solid and you are a non Dredd fan you might as well pick it up during a sale. also the low price makes it a perfect way to treat your friends at christmas without going out of pocket or resorting to buying bad rats. Now as a Judge Dredd fan I can say that in my opinion the Dredd universe is faithfuly represented, the storyline covers Dredd's general duties for example foiling bank robberies, arresting perps for low level crimes and generally applying the law to the means streets of Mega-City-1. The storyline also covers the more radical elements of Dredd's universe, the dark Judges escaping for example; this is the main plot point, hence the name Dredd Vs Death. Other threats Dredd will have to tackle are zombie and vampire infestations, dark cultists and the mad scientist Dr Icarus. If you are a fan of the comics you will likely notice many references to them in the game. The other part of the game aside from the main Dredd focused storyline is arcade mode, this pits the player in a challenge map pitted against infinitely respawning enemies usually with a time limit or number of kills that have to be reached as the win condition, although these aren't as fun as the main storyline they lightly reference the comics, such as playing as DeMarco P.I in one map. Overall I would say buy it if it's a sale and you want something to give your friends which is inexpensive, fun to play and most importantly, not bad rats. On a side note this is probably the most faithful recreation of the Dredd universe in video game.","February 26, 2015","true","15.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

You do get AA options and AF options to increase the fidelty to polish away the jaggys.\n\nIs the game fun? YES, if you enjoy dumb shooters with quirky mechanics and hilarious at times early day ragdoll physics this game is for you, the npc's give off hilarious dialogue as you arrest them for stupid things such as 'Possession of a goldfish without a license'. There is also co op mode (Not sure about online functionality however split screen works.), and an arcade mode (Not sure about online functionality also) as well as a challenge mode which allows you to unlock cool cheat codes for the main story. As of the time of this review this game is on sale for £1.24 and I think it's pretty fun for an old solid fps with 3-4 hours (Not counting other modes) of classic gameplay. Just don't go into this expecting a triple A masterpiece, it's far from it.\n\nEdit: Split Screen apparently is non existant. Arcade mode is the challenge mode, and I think 'Battle' is the arcade mode with bots or multiplayer.","January 14","true","3.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

You get to wield Dredd's famous Lawgiver gun (complete with six modes of fire) and the control scheme includes a "You're under arrest!" key that gives your enemies a chance to surrender. The game awards you for doing Judge-like things such as arresting criminals and rescuing civilians while you blast your way across Mega-City One.\n\nThe campaign isn't all that long, but completing it does unlock lots of side challenges, which in turn also unlock additional content for the multiplayer modes, which include your standard Deathmatch variations (and yes, they have bots) as well as a Dredd-inspired "Judges Vs. Perps" gametype.\n\nThe campaign had a few frustrating parts, sure, and the jump physics feel a bit floaty, and the reloading animations seem to go in slow motion, but despite being rough around the edges, I felt that it delivered on its promise of making you feel like Judge Joseph Dredd himself, almost to the point of shouting "I AM THE LAW!" at your screen.","March 22, 2014","true","9.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It'd be difficult to argue that it's objectively great from any perspective, but my history with first-person shooters led me to have a good time.  However, playing the game is this odd mix of attempting to arrest as many lawbreakers as you can while not taking damage.  There are rules that a new player must parse out, such as which enemies to kill first to make others surrender, or if it is possible to make certain enemies surrender.  Obviously, you could play the game in a "scorched earth" capacity and murder everyone, but that's a bit dissonant with the theme.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/recommended/3710/","the_baka","Powersocke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/","227 products in account","You know, it's kind of a shame this game exists and kind of not. On one hand it's a big bunch of lost and wasted potential which is really kinda sad but on the other hand it does a lot of things really good, speaking of its setting and all.\n\nBut first things first: the story.\nRemember the movie? Yeah, neither do I, but what I do know is that the game's got nothing to do with it except for the fact that there's Judge Dredd in it. But since it originated from the comics it's fine.\nYou are Judge Dredd, a badass cop in Mega City One who's trying to bring law, order and justice upon a chaotic world in which the line between crime and not-crime is blurred. The thing is: Some time ago the Dark Judges Judge Death, Fear, Fire and Mortis, who tried to kill everything in this city (they go by the motto "The crime is life, the sentence is death") were banished by Dredd and his associates but the local death cult of Mega City One now tries to free the Dark Judges and succeeds. Your quest is clear: Stop them at all costs.\n\nBut what can I say, it's a short game. Once they're loose everything goes down pretty ♥♥♥♥ing quickly. I mean, really quickly. It's something like this: You're on patrol screwing up the bad guy's operations when suddenly: Problems at the Dark Judge containment facility. Then the Dark Judges escape, then there is a mission which completely unexpectedly leads you to the heart of the death cult of Mega City One, then you do some other ♥♥♥♥ and then come the last five missions where you are ordered to go to places where the Dark Judges try wreaking havoc. But I gotta say: the world fears 'em but srsly, the Dark Judges are weak. Three of them can't be killed by convential means, sure, but luckily there are conveniently placed things in each area that make defeating them possible. So all of the fights are pretty damn boring. Especially the last fight against Death. Because it wasn't even a fight. So the boss fights are terrible and in every sense hilariously awful.\n\nWhile we're at it: what about its gameplay?\nThe gameplay of Judge Dredd: Dredd vs. Death is pretty much your standard FPS from that time. But it's got some unique features. The first one being the ability to arrest people. You know, the first couple of missions you are running through dark alleys and stuff with a lot of perps to arrest. So you shoot a bunch of guys until the others give up and then you arrest them. You can also kill them but that decreases your law-meter and hwen it reaches zero some other guys will hunt you down so you better don't do that. The arresting precedure has some kind of humour I must say. If you can read everything the perp is guilty of and how long the sentence will be. It's a pretty unique, if useless, feature but I liked it.\n\nAnother feature is your main gun. It's not your standard issue pistol. With this thing, you can change ammunition types on the fly with the press of a button so that you can choose between several "shot types". For instance: Ricochet, explosive, incendiary, heat seeking or standard. It's a nice feature but also pretty much useless because I used the standard ammunition all the time anyway without even thinking about using something else.\n\nIf I wanted to use something else I switched weapons. There are a couple of weapons in this game and you can carry two at all times. There aren't a lot of weapons, but there's some diversity. Two different pistols, two different shotguns, a machine gun, a sniper rifle which also can function as a light mg, a grenade launcher and a laser rifle which can also function as a sniper rifle. And you can hit people with your fist of course. And yeah, since it's a linear shooter, you can only have certain weapons in certain levels.\n\nSpeaking of levels, let's talk about the modes in this game. There are two modes: Campaign mode and Arcade mode. The campaign mode is what you'd expect. A campaign with the story (that goes on for about maybe 4.5 hours tops) and all that. The arcade mode is different in that its missions are focused on mostly killing things (with the exception of the last few) and that it has nothing to do with the story whatsoever. In arcade mode, you initially have one mission out of twenty (I guess) unlocked and the missions unlock with progression through the main game. "Why is that?" you might ask. Well. Some arcade missions let you unlock cheats upon completion. The game developers wanted to make sure that you play through the game at least once before you can have each and every cheat.\nEach completion of a campaign or arcade mission grants you a rank of how well you did and either an arcade mission (campaign mode) or a cheat (arcade mode). Or it grants you a playable multiplayer model.\n\nOh yeah, that's what I forgot. The multiplayer. Wanna know why I forgot it? Because the game's got no servers and multiplayer is virtually impossible via the internet. Just ignore that mode, you won't be able to play it anyway.\n\nNow, if we look at the game mechanics and ♥♥♥♥ there's really nothing new here that's outstandingly amazing and the enemy types are also not all that thrilling. But the game runs well on modern day systems (it should), it's got no bugs I would've spotted and it didn't crash a single time. That's an A+. Maybe. Sorta kinda.\n\nSo, to wrap this up, let's look at the setting.\nAnd I wanna say it now because it's true: the setting is really cool and I love it. There aren't a lot of redeeming things about this game. But if there is one thing that I really liked it's the setting and the little bit of dialogue you can listen to while traversing through some areas.\nIt's a dark, dystopic world which has a sense humour to it I really enjoy. Postal 2 was really great at conveying this humour to the player. If you wanna spot that humour on more occasions than the obvious dialogue in Judge Dredd: Dredd vs. Death you have to read between the lines. But still, it's great.\n\nIt kinda shows in what world we might live a few decades from now. I had to laugh at lines like "Grot Pot: With a snack THIS delicious, who needs nutricial value? Warning: may cause death". Or "All terminal patients are to remain in their beds. I mean, what's the point?" upon a zombie apocalypse in a hospital. But that's not all. The NPCs you'll see and the areas which you will go through are awesomely designed. The big mega mall with tons of unhealthy food and other consumer goods and the rampant consumerism in that world which is conveyed to the player. Or the Smokatorium, a place for all nicotine addicts since public smoking is prohibited. And then the message "We are legally obligated to remind you that tobacco is very, very, very bad for your health. But that nicotine sure is a rush, huh?". The world and its design are great and this is where the wasted-potential-part comes in. With a setting this good the game devs could have made something better than this.\n\nBut anyway. That about wraps it up. It's not a great game. If you think about it, the gameplay and story are pretty damn boring tbh. There aren't any game mechanics that are really "cool" so to speak. But the setting is really ♥♥♥♥ing great if you ask me. If it's cheap on sale I'd recommend you buy it. If it isn't on sale however you should spend your money on something more fun than this game. Still, I'll give it a "recommended".\n\nI myself played it because of its nostlagic value. Had a demo when I was a kid and now I found that game on Steam so I bought it during a sale. Was kinda worth it.","January 12, 2015","true","4.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSadTruth/recommended/3710/","TheSadTruth","QETC™Crimson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSadTruth/","4153 products in account","Dredd vs Death is a short, dystopian fps where you go through the levels helping the citizens of mega city one until inevitablly you are sent somewhere else to help people and fight punks, cultists and undead until you eventually learn that 4 boss characters have escaped from prison and then you help the people where the boss characters went and beat the bosses, until you beat the final one, Death.\n\nThe fps gameplay is mostly standard, you get to have 2 weapons maximum and you have to keep the pistol that all judges use. The judge pistol has several ammunition options such as explosive. flammble. and ricocheting options, but I found that they werent particularly useful or even detrimental; lighting people on fire didnt seem to do much damage and if they run towards you then you risk being burned. The high explosive mode doesn't have a huge radius for hitting enemies and most of the time its not worth the time required to change ammo from the normal ammunition. Additionally, on some levels you don’t get much of a refill on the judge pistol and usually have to rely on using an alternate weapon and these alternate pistol modes use your limited ammo faster. There is also some unneeded fluff such as  a reputation system where reputation increases when you arrest people and help citizens not get killed and decreases when you attack friendly targets and people who have already surrendered to be arrested; but this only matters for ratings unless you have the lowest reputation by killing friendlies, then the game will cause a mission failure. At some times there were bugs such as me sniping off some enemies that were set to be killed by a script and that caused a mission failure. Something that can get annoying at times is that its not clear where your next objective is, but the gameplay is fairly passable fps gameplay once you get past the bugs.\n\nThe music in the game wasn't particularly memorable to me, but the dystopian setting and various advertisements for dubious fictional future products added to the atmosphere of the game. Given the short length and dated graphics in this game, I wouldn’t go out of my way to pick this up, but it was in a bundle and I got my copy from trading so I figured why not. Unless you really love the Dredd universe no matter the implementation, there are better games for your money.","May 25, 2015","false","5.9"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","18","34","2","0"

It captures Judge Dredd pretty well and the universe created from the 2000 AD comics. Don't expect modern graphics but this game doesn't feel all that dated and the gameplay is very well done. You are given your personal lawgiver with a myriad of ammunition choices based on the situation given at hand. You can't go all psycho on the perps as there is a law meter which keeps you in check. This makes you arrest those who surrender and any other action gives you a penalty on your overall performance which makes sense given you are a Judge. The soundtrack is top-notch. The city and its environments gives you a feel of the overall universe based around its source material. Based on my playthrough this is either a hit or miss but I would definately try it out if you are a fan of Judge Dredd or want to have a feel of what the world of Judge Dredd is all about.

Don't expect a masterpiece, but it's nowhere near as bad as critics claim it to be. Most gunfights are quite fast paced and satisfying, and that's what FPS games are all about. The control and handling is smooth, and most weapons are very fun to use. Graphics might've aged by now, but they do a decent enough of a job to make a believable sci-fi setting and to make you feel like you're in it.\n\nThe game spans 10 story chapters. The first few levels have you fighting and arresting the perps, and the latter levels are more trigger happy and mostly have you fighting hordes of zombies and vampires. Some of the levels are done really well (The Docks, The Lab, The Hospital, The Undercity), whilst a few others were more of an annoyance than anything (The Training, The Smokatorium). The training level should've been completely optional and isn't a very interesting way to introduce new players to the game. However, if you can stomach it, the game really picks up from there.\n\nThere isn't much of a story there. The dark judges escape and you spend most of the game hunting each one down. The boss fights were somewhat disappointing. 3 of the 4 of them simply involved you walking around the level and pressing switches, and only one of them was an actual full-on battle where you had to shoot the baddie down. Having said that, most FPS games tend to have very badly done boss fights, so wouldn't be fair to single out this game specifically.\n\nThe game also contains some arcade levels, but they lose their appeal very fast as you realise most of them is just you vs a big group of enemies with too little health. The (5-6 hour) story campaign is the only reason to play this game really, so if you're up for some fun sci-fi gunfights, you should have a good time playing this game.","April 9, 2015","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unless you get it that cheap, you're not getting a good price. It's just funny to read some of the signs and arrest some people. Lots of great satire involved in both. However, once the shooting starts, it all falls to pieces. There are various gunshot types for the handgun, such as incendiary rounds, armor-piercing rounds, heat-seeking rounds, explosive rounds, ricochet rounds, burst normal rounds, and maybe something else I'm forgetting, too. Anyway, it's really impressive for one gun when this game came out. However, the enemies you encounter on the latter part of the first stage and during the second stage are easier to kill with punches...slow, wound up punches. The gunplay simply isn't fun. Despite all the ammo options, actually shooting the enemies just isn't enjoyable for me. The difficulty is pretty high on Normal and I can't be bothered to try it on Easy. I probably -could- do it, but aside from the satire, there's nothing fun about this game so far to make me want to keep playing it instead of ignoring it or just watching for the satire portions on Youtube.","March 29, 2015","false","2.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The Graphics are old, but not unplayable, this game isn't just using the name of Dredd to make a shooter, it would fit the comic. It sounds like what Dredd should sound like, the Lawgiver feels like the Lawgiver, with changable ammo for it(Normal, AP, Ricochet, High Ex, Heat Seeking) at a click of a button(actually you scroll with the mouse wheel to do so). The NPCs like Fatties offers funny dialogues, but humour is also given by the reasons for arrest: The game generates sentences which includes real crimes like rioting, assault, resisting arrest, and also owning a fish/hamster without a license which earns you a month in the cubes.

Nice open colourful levels to explore and find hidden resources or complete optional sidequests.\n\n3. Great sound track that thumps along to the action in the game.\n\n4. Decent voice acting for Dredd and some of the other charcters.\n\n5. Additional side content of arena fights an multiplayer is available.\n\nCons:\n1. It's short, you can complete a Normal casual pace playthrough in 5 hours of the single player campaign. Once you've dealt with the hospital the game races to the finish. Specifically it feels like levels are missing, in the later half of the game, perhaps due to the developers running out of time or money.\n\n2. The boss 'fights' are really lacking in excitement or challenge. I realise that you cannot really kill the dark judges, but they needed to come up with more interesting engagements.\n\nIn the end I still recommend the game, because I had an enjoyable FPS experience mostly during the first half of the game and due to a lack of an alternative Dredd game.","December 26, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However... It may be linear and feature the most obvious choice of a Judge Dredd universe villain as a main villain, but it's also fun and bug-free (as far as I can tell), doesn't have bad controls, has nice soundtrack and doesn't overcomplicate. Don't expect Half-Life 3 and you'll probably have a couple of hours of good fun. I recommend.","December 14, 2014","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally, I love FPS games and Judge Dredd, so I had a blast playing through the campaign.  I'm not a nitpick every little detail Dredd fan, but I've got a couple of the "Case Files" books full of early Dredd comics and some other Dredd comics, so I know about Dredd and the world he comes from.\n\nLooks wise, it won't win any awards, not even by 2005 standards.  It's not photo realistic, nor do I think it's intended to be.  Since it's based on the comics, I think they were going for a comic look and they succeeded.  Still, it's not an ugly game.  It's got decent graphics and the recreation of Mega City One is pretty fantastic.  Plus, since it is from 2005, I'm able to play on nearly max settings and it looks really good on those settings.  The only thing I wasn't able to max was the AA (anti aliasing) because 8X won't work on my system, for some reason.  But, I got it working at 4X AA.\n\nPlot wise, it's pretty simple.  Obviously, you play as Judge Dredd, the super cop, prosecutor,  judge, jury and, if necessary, executioner of the future.  The story is simple, Judge Death and the other Dark Judges have escaped (again) and it's up to Dredd to hunt them all down.  The campaign takes you all over MC1 and even into the under city, old New York and to the Deadworld, home of the Dark Judges.  You fight street thugs, zombies, vampires, cultists and, of course, the Dark Judges themselves.  Mostly, it's run and gun, with fast paced action and levels.  I don't think any level took more than 30 minutes, the shortest was less than 10 minutes.  I have 7.2 hours in the game, but not all of that is in the campaign.  I've also played Arcade Mode some.  The array of weapons is nice.  Of course, you have the standard Justice Department sidearm, the Lawgiver, with its variety of ammunition.  You can also pick up secondary weapons.  There are other pistols, rifles, shotguns, machine guns, grenade launchers and even laser weapons.  One of the most fun aspects of the game is the ability to arrest and sentence people.  Some are enemies that surrender, others are people off the street that you sentence for whatever "crimes" they're committing.  Loitering, parking violations, possession of a hamster or goldfish without a license, smoking, whatever.  Also, if they talk back, you can add on 10-20 years for resisting arrest.  In some levels, I had over 3,000 years total sentences given out.  And, once the campaign is over, there's always Arcade Mode, which adds to the replayability.\n\nThe game does have a few issues, which is why not taking things too seriously is necessary to enjoy it.  I understand there were some issues with development, so the campaign isn't what they were hoping it would be.  Still, it's fun if you take it with a grain of salt.  There are some AI bugs, like enemies that "fly away" after being shot.  But, that stuff is actually pretty funny, in my opinion.  None of it really makes the game unplayable, in my opinion.  If all of this doesn't have you already pushing "Add to Cart," wait for it to go on sale if it isn't already.  I got it on sale for a little over a dollar during the Black Friday sale, and it was money well spent.  Still, I'd say it's worth the asking price, but that's just me.","December 16, 2014","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mashedapples/recommended/3710/","mashedapples","MashedApples","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mashedapples/","244 products in account","-The game is based on the 2000ad Dredd strip, NOT on the movies. So expect a lot of the cheesy dialog, one liners and the satire usually found in the comic.  What you should not expect are high production values, the game not being a very consolized shooter or a long single player campaign. I found some (mostly from melee based) enemies just stand between obstacles like pillars and irregular terrain without reacting to the player. Same thing if you stand on high ground or similar situations, so the AI isn't a high point either.\n\n-The enemies are varied at the start but in the end you'll fight pretty much the same type of bad guys in the last 3 levels making it a bit boring if it wasn't for the ammo constraints due to the fact that in story mode you can only choose your secondary weapon and all the Lawgiver modes  share the same ammunition.\n\n-On the good side it has a lot of references to the strip and its many iconic stories and characters, an arcade mode with short levels you unlock as you complete the story mode (with some interesting cameos) and a funny, but really short campaign. The game is fast paced and doesn't pull any punches when it comes to difficulty unlike most modern shooters released during these last years, containing also enough flavor and variety to compensate for its flaws.\n\n-I recommend it if you have nothing else to do with the "hard earned" money you got selling cards, and I strongly recommend it if you like the comic strip Dredd. Stay away if you only watched the movies or if you don't really want to play what it  was a budget game when it was released.","December 2, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Patricks day and i can say now that most of the negative reviews are fairly wrong, or are just out there to bash an old game. I personally admit the game does look pretty dated after 12 (kinda important to remember that) years. Please allow me to repeat that, this game is actually 12 years old. Give it a little slack on the graphics part. Overall the graphics arent the worst ive seen but im guessing they wanted gameplay over shiny looking walls and the like.\n\nFor actual gameplay, i quite enjoyed it actually, combat feels a little challenging, enough to keep me focused, not enough to make me feel threatened once i get use to it. Also yeah, you can only have 2 guns at a time. Would you prefer a ton of guns that are boring and poorly fleshed out or a good couple of guns that feel how one would think they would? The Lawgiver pistol in particular is a fantastic weapon you will always have with you and can do its job pretty well. Personally speaking i honestly dislike the none Judge weaponry but there is probably one that fits your play style.\n\nPerformance, my office laptop that runs on windows 8 can manage the thing so im pretty sure people having problems with it are using something the game hates. To be fair for whatever reason my laptop seems capable of running anything short of AAA titles from 2013 onwards, everything prior and after (that isnt an AAA title) it can manage with ease. Back to the game, its overall pretty good if a little short, the Civilian AI is pretty stupid and often will just stand around and get brutally murdered if you leave them there.\n\nFinally the whole thing on the whole is dated (12 years old, i shall never stop pointing that out where relevant) but by far and away not the worst game, and certainly good for some fun, plus it has bot support in multiplayer (i think, actual multiplayer is probably long dead but you can setup multiplayer games with bots when you solo it) as i said before the guns and gameplay are great and all but sometimes you'll be a little (at least) frustrated with the civilian AI, and occasionally your team mates, had one of them get stuck on the stairs and i had to go back for him. I would rate the game about maybe 8-9/10 on the whole, only things i objectively dislike is the civilian AI, occasionally the health system as its kinda weird, and i did have the weapon ammo counter go weird and i couldnt tell whether i had ammo or not, and because i was curious (and quite stupid) i wasted my last magasine finding out, though id put this down to simply not being able to see the ammo counter clearly.","March 18, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played this game since I was 9 (I'm 17 now) and probably completed it over 60 times but man, I still love every second of every mission! Dredd's hardcoreness is perfect in this game! The arcade missions are also lots of fun, working to unlock all the cheats so you can play campaign again and have fun with cheats like infinite law meter and touch of mortis! Multiplayer is also a lot of fun with bots and friends over Lan (I think you can still do online??)\n\nWhen you play this game and read the comics, you'll see why you could be left expecting more from the films. The Stallone film is a bit naff and not true to Dredd's personaility but the costumes and sets and props etc are on point, but the 2013 film catches Dredd's personailty greatly like this game does, but the costumes are a bit eh. You'll think to yourself "Where were those damn vampires, zombies and dark judges?????"\n\nAll in all, buy this game right now!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/3710/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","A licensed game that doesn't suck. Makes you feel like Dredd.\n\nStory and voice acting are simple and cheesy. Music is upbeat and catchy to match the gameplay. Visually, you can tell it's old. It kind of looks like the first Halo, perhaps with slightly better textures, but the art direction helps this a great deal. It's also filled to the brim with humor and a bit of product placement.\n\nNPC interaction is neat. You can arrest just about anyone, for obvious crimes of course, but you can also get the people who look completely innocent and see the ridiculous sentences they get for the most trivial of crimes. When taking care of violent perps, you can shoot weapons out of their hands to see how they react. It's all pushed along very well by Dredd's commentary.\n\nGunplay is smooth and responsive. There's a good assortment of options on top of the various firing modes of the Lawgiver pistol, but I rarely found myself using everything available, except on hard difficulty; Still, it's nice to have an option.\n\nThe game is fairly easy. Enemies do quite a bit of damage, but the game is very liberal with its checkpoint system and lets you save anywhere you wish. Levels are straightforward, often taking place in large corridors with only one way to go. The only time a challenge really pops up is when it refuses to give health and ammunition, or when you are faced with enemies who have explosive weapons. Most of the enemies are melee-based and slow enough that you can usually just run past them.\n\nA problem I've run into is the collision detection. The hitboxes work well enough, but trying to jump might as well be a throw of the dice. Ragdolls sometimes fly all over the place, even when the enemies are killed with the smallest of weapons.

Multiplayer skins are next to useless because the multiplayer is dead. The game allows you to go up against bots in a multiplayer setting, but that quickly gets old as well due to their predictable behavior.\n\nYet, even with its problems, the game is decent fun for a cheap price. If you like FPS, if you like Judge Dredd, if you just want to live out a power fantasy of arresting everyone and blowing away hordes of the undead, this is for you, but get it on sale.","April 12, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played this game since I was 9 (I'm 17 now) and probably completed it over 60 times but man, I still love every second of every mission! Dredd's hardcoreness is perfect in this game! The arcade missions are also lots of fun, working to unlock all the cheats so you can play campaign again and have fun with cheats like infinite law meter and touch of mortis! Multiplayer is also a lot of fun with bots and friends over Lan (I think you can still do online??)\n\nWhen you play this game and read the comics, you'll see why you could be left expecting more from the films. The Stallone film is a bit naff and not true to Dredd's personaility but the costumes and sets and props etc are on point, but the 2013 film catches Dredd's personailty greatly like this game does, but the costumes are a bit eh. You'll think to yourself "Where were those damn vampires, zombies and dark judges?????"\n\nAll in all, buy this game right now! If we can get this game some exposure maybe we will finally see a sequel or remake, so get buying and raving!

Makes you feel like Dredd.\n\nStory and voice acting are simple and cheesy. Music is upbeat and catchy to match the gameplay. Visually, you can tell it's old. It kind of looks like the first Halo, perhaps with slightly better textures, but the art direction helps this a great deal. It's also filled to the brim with humor and a bit of product placement.\n\nNPC interaction is neat. You can arrest just about anyone, for obvious crimes of course, but you can also get the people who look completely innocent and see the ridiculous sentences they get for the most trivial of crimes. When taking care of violent perps, you can shoot weapons out of their hands to see how they react. It's all pushed along very well by Dredd's commentary.\n\nGunplay is smooth and responsive. There's a good assortment of options on top of the various firing modes of the Lawgiver pistol, but I rarely found myself using everything available, except on hard difficulty; Still, it's nice to have an option.\n\nThe game is fairly easy. Enemies do quite a bit of damage, but the game is very liberal with its checkpoint system and lets you save anywhere you wish. Levels are straightforward, often taking place in large corridors with only one way to go. The only time a challenge really pops up is when it refuses to give health and ammunition, or when you are faced with enemies who have explosive weapons. Most of the enemies are melee-based and slow enough that you can usually just run past them.\n\nA problem I've run into is the collision detection. The hitboxes work well enough, but trying to jump might as well be a throw of the dice. Ragdolls sometimes fly all over the place, even when the enemies are killed with the smallest of weapons. NPCs and enemies can get stuck on waist-high objects,other NPCs, or thin air, and this can get very annoying when you aren't supposed to kill said character. I had to redo the hospital level because Mortis stood still and wouldn't run away after I beat him. Not even resetting the checkpoint helped.\n\nIt isn't a very long game either. Even with the above gripes included, it only took me about 4 hours to beat the game, and I was really taking my time. There are multiple difficulties, as well as a lot of extra content to unlock: "Arcade" missions, cheats, and multiplayer skins.

Prowl the streets of Mega City One as the cities greatest judge as you punch up and arrest perps and civilians, Lay down the law on Zombies and Vampires by blowing them way with your Lawgiver and dispense justice to the sinister Dark Judges, vile undead from another dimension that fully believe life itself is a crime and that the sentence is death.\n\nI'll say it up front, This game is really for fans of the Judge Dredd comic book seires as this little gem from the early 2000's can be described as very true to the source material. Meaning its NOT like the Sylvester Stallone movie from the 90's and it is NOT like the Karl Urban "Dredd" movie from a few years ago. Think of it a mix of both. Its cartoony and campy in some places while it still has a bit darkness to it.\n\nAs a game on it's own there isnt really anything spectacular or innovative about it when it to the point that one can easily compare it to Halo: Combat Evolved that came out two years prior. The game runs well on PC and in terms of comparison the only things i can say about DvD that's really different than Halo would be the following:\n- The world itself (of course)\n\n- A points system where if you manage to obtain a high ranking after you complete a level you will be rewarded with extra game content such as new skins for multiplayer (which has a VS Bots mode if for whatever reason you wanted to play some Dredd pvp) and mini games a for a bit of extra new game plus.\n\n- The lack of vehicle use. There's not even a level where you can ride on Dredd's iconic Lawmaster bike.\n\n- Your primary weapon, "The Lawgiver" is going to be your main weapon in the game. While there are some other weapons availiable to you such as shotguns and grenade launchers, you will find  yourself using the Lawgiver alot more as it multiple firing modes (e.g. Rapid Fire & Incendiary rounds) are the best response to the varity of threats in the game.\n\n- And that you have bosses.The four bosses in the game, The Dark Judges: Fear, Fire, Mortis and their leader Death are not your regular boss battles, since they are undead they cannot be killed by traditional means and sometimes the boss fight requires you to do something different in order to win and to achive a higher rank at levels end. For example in order to defeat Judge Mortis at the hospital level with the most "brownie points" you will need to rescue all the hostages he has with him and yes they too can be killed at the slightest touch.\n\nIn conclusion. This game as i mentioned is not for everyone except for those who either are fan of the comics this game is heavily based on and those who are looking fora cheap FPS to help pass the time. I recommend this game as the former but as the latter do not expect too much from this game.","June 2, 2013","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story mode is short, I clocked in at about 5-6 hours on normal difficulty, but the atmosphere of Mega City One was immersive and well varied enough to make it an enjoyable experience. In addition to story mode, there's also multiplayer (vs bots and vs players, have yet to try the latter though), as well as an "arcade" mode comprising several short scenario missions. Both these modes, as well as the extensive list of unlockable multiplayer skins, give you more to do after completing the story. Sure, the AI is dumb as bricks, and graphically its dated, but if you're a fan of simple, straightforward, classic FPS', and can look past its flaws, then Dredd might be worth a purchase for you, especially if its on sale.","July 9, 2015","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The physics engine on the npcs and overall floatyness of Dredd made this game feel more like a source game than anything else (except no one has ported the models to Gmod yet). And a game that feels like Half-Life is okay in my books.\n\nThe story for a Judge Dredd fan is pretty good. I love the comics and thought the feel of the narrative was spot on.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty good but as a comic fan I kind of really dislike Dredd's voice - needs more Kevin Conroy.\n\nOnly buy this game cheap - it is pretty good but not for more than $3 or so.","November 30, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But, this game is great.\n\n\nThe graphics are alittle vibrant, but there were times where the atmosphere was creepy and I got jumped afew times.\n\nHas an interesting machinic with the arrest feature (which was sad that after a while it becomes unused and unnecissary) which still made you feel as if you were a copper arresting litteraly EVERYONE because EVERYONE is shooting at you.\n\nRagdoll was GREAT! It is someones point of view to look at ragdoll and judge, for instance, someone might be mad that the ragdoll takes away from the realism of the game.  But for me, it was freakin halarious.  Watching a body spasm after getting shot with a shotgun never gets old.\n\nStory line was good and (I think) well thought out, and even though I wanted to quit when it got encreadibly hard, I was interested to see what would happen next.\n\nVoice acting was alittle strange, but ok. One-liners were cheesy but will stick with you forever (update: every time I read a Dredd Comic now,  cannot read it with out Dredd sounding like the game voice actor)\n\nDon't expect to play this with anyone other than yourself or a friend, cause the servers dead.\n\nOne very agrivating thing though was the autosave locations and the OPness of EVERY enemy in the game (friendly advice: see a zombie or vampire? Stay the hell away).  You'd get super far into the fighting, nearly almost done with the objective, then get cornered by a zombie who could get one lucky swipe, and be forced to restart all the way back from the start. This gets VERY agrivating\n\n\nIn General, you'll get a few hours (around 3-4 hours) of Gameplay, and if your a fan of the Judge Dredd comics, chances are you'll like this.\n\nwith accordance to gameplay, and Dredd comic book accuracy,\nMy overall rating:\n8.5/10","March 22, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Dark Judges were dissapointing laughly beatable, For supernatural creatures that are unkillable, they sure were easy to defeat and we got barely anytime with them, the build up was good, but the executuion was terrible. The story felt shallow and non canon, the satire and crude humour of the comics is here, but thats it, its there, but nothing else. After beating a level, you will be awarded with multiplayers skins, but there is no incentive to go back and get them all, because the online mode of this game is shallow and boring, it might have been interesting back in its inception, but compared to todays standards, you are going to get bored....FAST!

The level at the start can seem bizzare and unintuitive but they get better the further in you get.\n\nEnemies actually have fairly good AI. Gang members hide behind cover, run away from yoiu, run at you and in many cases are better than many games AI from today.\nYou get to see Mega City One, Undercity, Docking yards, Smokatorium, A Hospital, the famed Reclamation where meat wagons go.

Works a treat with the XBox 360 controller for Windows and this game.","November 29, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was released generally in the early 2000s and therefore, more modern advances in video graphics (i.e. DirectX9, shaders, HDR and volumetric lighting) and subsequent assumed conventions and expectations in games are not present. The game is short compared to a typical average epected singleplayer FPS and the the user interface is clearly venerable.\nThere's too little variety in the characters. A fewe citizen archetypes, singular enemies. The storyline, despite being classic Dredd and with the Dark Judges, fails to truly hold my interest - the plot progression and game level objectives seem too separated and distinct from the main events unfolding and the results of success or failure are only visible as survive to the next level or game over.\n\nThat's the negatives out of the way. If you're still reading, you might want to know that this game truly captures Judge Dredd, Mega City 1 (complete with fatties, scrawlers, Isocubes, Surfing and more) given the time of release and the technology employerd, the game does an excellent job of recreating the city environment faithfully to Bolland's artwork from the comics, and a typical cast of characters to boot.\n\nAt the time of the game, Judge Hershey is CJ, Judge Anderson of course makes an appearance, but also there are the medics, Tek-Judges and mentions of the SJS (who investigate you if you don't uphold the law well enough). The voice-acting is hilarious and I am still unsure if this is intended or kitsch, but it certainly doesn't spoil the fun.\n\nDespite the short completion time for the main storyline singleplayer game, there are alternative gamemodes which promise a little extra replay value, and a multiplayer aspect, but unfortuantely, the internet multiplayer relied on GameSpy network and so is no longer functional, but if you have LAN connections you can play with others.\n\n\n\n","April 17","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
