Because the storyline has a huge twist at the end, that will make you go back to Ravenhearst Manor in the fifth installement of the series.\n\nYou're now visiting a fair, along with people: you'll have a number of items to find in order to access to the future of the employees (doomed, doomed and doomed.... anyway). Each scene contains also beyond objects items (changing appearances) that will unlock special places where you can gain time - mainly if you're in the normal mode where you have a timer.\n\nWhen visiting an employee, you'll have a puzzle of words to solve, each time different in the thematic. Then, there, you'll have to find specific items (5 clubs, 10 moons, 15 jelly beans, etc...).\n\nAnd when you want to reveal their fate, well, you'll have a puzzle to solve - an elaborate one as sometimes, it's hard to see what to do.\n\nAs you understand, Madame Fate, while being in the first era of hidden objects games, has a tendancy to orient itself towards modern "hidden objects" games: beyond objects, puzzles, and hidden objects scenes in a scene.\n\nHowever, I felt the game being long for a simple reason: you have many employees to check AND some objects are so well hidden that you'll need a magnifying lens to see them. Also, as the game is in English only, I had an hard time for the puzzle words (I don't know all the fruit in English or even the feelings) and for some items, like a dolly, where I was searching for a doll when it was something else (a tool used to carry boxes or crates). So in other words, Madame Fate isn't opened to everyone, at least on Steam. If you want a multilanguage game, you need to find it elsewhere or in retail.\n\nMadame Fate's ambiance, however, is between cynism and dark humor. It's perhaps less creepy than Ravenhearst, the previous game, but there is still evil lurking around and the fair Madame Fate owned isn't the most joyful in the world.\n\nAnyway, it's still a good game, a good moment to pass just to know the fate of the employees and who wants to kill her. I spent 10 bucks that I'm not regretting, however, you should prefer a discount on it, that will perhaps happen one day, as Ravenhearst and Return to Ravenhearst were during this sale!","December 27, 2015","true","9.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"
