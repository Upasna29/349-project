It being one of the cheapest games on steam with trading cards I bought it thinking I would just get the cards and uninstall it into the deep unkown realms of my game library.\n\nHowever out of boredem (and a lack of internet connection or power) I gave it a shot and I must say this truly a fun game. At first I was like DA FUQ ARE THESE CONTROLS, AINT NO ONE GOT TIME FO DAT. But then I switched the controls to keyboard and it was much better and I reccomend anyone who plays this to use the keyboard instead of mouse.\n\nAs soon as I got the hang of it I was hooked. Yes the graphics are 2D and not anything worth mentioning but it played very smooth and the controls were very responsive.\n\nThe goal of the game is like a reverse tower defense; you hae to destroy turrents and capture land by creating squares of land until you reach the turrets. Along the way (higher levels) things such as dragons and bats are introduced which invoke a feeling of "♥♥♥♥ I thought I was good at a game for once" or "Damn ♥♥♥♥♥ I JUST ATE". But let me tell you that as annoying as these ♥♥♥♥ers are (particulary bats), they add alot more dynamic gameplay to the game.\n\n1st hour of playing I liked it.\n2nd hour of playing I loved it\n3rd hour my ♥♥♥♥ was out and hard\n4th hour Cops called, I left my shades up while masturbating vigoriously.\n5th hour I got ♥♥♥♥♥ by some black dude named Truck\n","September 25, 2013","true","3.0"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","38","46","2","0"

That sounds like it would be a bad thing, but the truth is that Qix was a rad game when it released in 1981, and Fortix 2 truly feels like what would happen if the developers of Qix had time-traveled 30 years into the future at the start of development.\n\nQix featured a simple mechanic, slickly implemented, with a presentation that was unremarkable but serviceable for its day. The exact same thing is true for Fortix 2. This is not a complicated game, but it is a great implementation of a simple mechanic. The difficulty curve is pitch-perfect, making finishing a level without losing any lives achievable but challenging.\n\nFortix 2 isn't going to blow anyone away, but it does an excellent job of filling that spot in your Steam library for a game that doesn't ask for much in the way of investment, and can be consumed in 5-minute increments while still feeling rewarding, and for $2 or less, you can't really ask for more.","August 15, 2014","true","5.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Well, no -- it's more accurate to say that Fortix is a Qix clone.\nThat's not a bad thing, though. I had been looking for a quick Qix fix for a while, and didn't find much save for an extravagantly priced "update" on XBLA (£11 with DLC, and it's ugly and short to add insult to injury).\n\nIn Qix/Fortix, you move on the periphery of the game arena. Leaving that periphery leaves you vulnerable, but that's how you conquer terrain: once you have traced a line dividing the non-conquered map in 2, the smaller half becomes yours. Basic risk/reward system: the payoff for tracing a long line is potentially high, but getting greedy is how you'll die most of the time.\nFortix 2 brings some variation to that classic formula and wraps the whole thing in cute graphics. I recommend it to fans of the classic Taito game or anyone looking for a chill arcade game.","August 31, 2013","true","5.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

I like the fact that you can actually "Run" in this game rather then the first one. They also added keys, sheilds and New power ups. I understand that a "New" company took it over, 'I get it', i'm just a little sad about that. I love the first one, but not so much the second one. I myself wouldn't recommend this game.

On the other hand, the temporary spikes of input lag feel a little worse than I remember them being in the original Fortix, and I kind of preferred the "Ye Olde Fantasy" art style of the original Fortix to the generic cartooniness of this version. Still though, the gameplay is as engaging as ever, and the addition of keys and locks introduces a number of new strategies. Definitely worth a play.","July 3, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Upon using a small 'trick' in the main menu, you also unlock the Zombie mode in which you have to fight your way through the levels by capturing zombies (Duh!).\n\nAdditionally you can chose between 5 different (partly unlockable through earning achievements) playable characters such as a hooligan, a tank or the original knight.\n\nOf course the game features an online leaderboard where you can compete with other people and your friends for the best highscore.\n\nThe playtime to finish the 30 main levels (when going for a 'Perfect!' run) should be around 6-8 hours. The revisited levels, Zombie mode and other difficulty levels provide a huge replayability, so you can easily spend dozens of hours on this game.\n\nGreat fun!","March 4, 2012","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Compared to Fortix there's a few improvements e.g. some new creatures and better level design. Also, if you're going for perfect you can replay a single castle instead of doing all 2-3 again (well, perhaps it doesn't make that much sense then to group them but it's still nice).\n\nI thought the price of fortix was a bit expensive since it was pretty short (NOTE: the price has been droppen to 0,99€!!!), but, imo, the 6,99€ price tag for Fortix 2 fits pretty well.\n\nOne last note: impossible difficulty might not be the hardest mode in this game, but you'll need to discover that yourself ;-)","May 17, 2011","true","26.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Things will shoot at you and move towards you too fast to let you do anything clever, and the inching forward process is very boring, at least to me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beep23/recommended/45450/","beep23","beep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beep23/","635 products in account","Once upon a time (1981!), there was a famous arcade game called Qix. More than 25 years later, a Hungarian indie team of developers used Qix as inspiration to make their own game: Fortix. As it was successful, the devs released a sequel called Fortix 2. Today I made a review of it.\n\nI'll explain gameplay for those people who haven't played Fortix 1/2 yet or don't know what the game is about, if you've already played them feel free to skip this paragraph. Gameplay is simple; levels are boxes, inside of where you must draw lines (and complete shapes) to capture terrain, and this way you must capture all the dark badges in the level to complete it.\n\nOf course it's not going to be that easy, and, as the levels advance, you'll have to face cannon-bullet shooting turrets, different kind of dragons, ogres, and more. The guys that already played Fortix 1 (like me) will find that the number of enemies has grown for good. There are also new game mechanics, like having to capture a key to open its door, running faster (if you are in the border lines), having a power-up that lets you fly or capturing flowers to get some extra points and things like that.\n\nLet's move onto visual aspect. This second game has got by far better graphics, animations and sound than the original. Levels look full of life, and music helps to feel that too. Everything is beautiful, even the main menu.\n\nThis game starts 3 years after the end of Fortix 1. Back then, we fought bravely against the evil Xitrof, defeated him, and put him in a place were he shouldn't bother us anymore. But, disasters happen, and he escaped and sailed to a foreign island, where the new levels are set; you'll have to fight him again.\n\nGetting all the achievements in Fortix 1 was a challenge, and this sequel brings almost twice the number of achievements that the first one had. You'll have a good time trying to unlock them all.\n\nIf you've already played Fortix 1 and you enjoyed it a bit, give it a try (same goes if you really liked it). But I can't recommend the first game to someone who has already played the second, as Fortix 2 is a much better game.\n","March 9, 2013","true","2.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It is a descendant of Qix and Jeezball. Qix is a fairly old game that dates back from the 80s. Jeezball also dates from around the mid-80s. I wanted to like this game. You hope for some form of game progression that just never seems to develop. The levels get more difficult, but you stay the same. Of course, I do understand the point of this. It keeps the challenge up in the game. I am not a fan of the 1-hit-1-kill mechanic in a game like this. Yes, it is meant to be a press-your-luck type game, however there were times where I swear the hit detection was off. It seemed like the hitboxes were squares and not per-pixel collisions. Being wiped out because the box crossed your line is just irritating.\n\nThis is a difficult game to rate. Either you enjoy this type of game mechanic or you don't. I know this is said about a lot of games these days though, so I wonder if it should even be said at all. Graphically, the game has a nice aesthetic. The enemies and artillery are easy to spot. The sound is pretty basic though and easily forgotten. Overall if I had to give it a X on ten rating, I'd give it a 6.5.\n\nI don't know when anything below a 8 or 9 meant a game was bad. It just means it is average. If you can pick it up on sale or in a bundle, I say go for it. However, be warned that the game play while varied due to the layout of the different levels does become monotonous.","August 9, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nice visuals and sound, essentially no story. Keyboard is pretty necessary for refined controls though mouse is an option.\n\nThere are plenty of levels but the game is simple enough that you can brute force many levels by just bisecting the map in half. Since you're immune to most enemies/projectiles while not capturing new territory you can play it safe and take lots of tiny chunks until you reach the other side. Later on walls and gates often make it impossible to halve the map but it feels good when you can eliminate a bunch of things at once.\n\nThe things that change your approach are enemy locations, slowing terrain, impassable walls, locked gates/keys, and magic orbs (you can't capture land with one inside). There are also some timed powerups that can make levels a lot easier if you get them at the right time (like the ability to fly over walls).\n\nThere's also a zombie mode that I believe uses the same level terrain as the main mode but has the spin that you can be killed on the line and that zombies continually spawn from the gravestones (so you can get overwhelmed if you wait too long).\n\nI haven't played this kind of game before (outside of maybe a Mario Party minigame?) so I found it fun enough to play through. Worth a look if you like action puzzlers although here you're mostly thinking about your route and the rest is execution.","August 11, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't change what made the first one so oddly enjoyable, even with its limited budget, keeping the "capture territory to win" mechanic, which acted as an interesting organic puzzle structure which allowed for many solutions, but is further built upon with more challenging layouts and obstacles to figure out. The main mechanic functions as thus; you're safe whenever you're running on your territory's border, but the moment you venture out, you become vulnerable to any projectiles and monsters roaming the land, including the borderlines you've drawn that have yet been connected to your territory. It's definitely unique, and there is a surprising amount of challenge and forethought that goes into each movement.\nThe artstyle has also come into its own, going away from the generic medival color pallete in the first game to have a more distinctive flush of primaries and a sharp art direction that adds serious identity to a series that was lacking in the first iteration. Whereas the first was muddily pixelated and blocky, the new 2d models and landscapes have a more cellshaded and smoothed look that is much easier on the eyes.\nFive times the amount of content is provided here as well, including all the original levels of the first game, which basically negates a need to purchase the first one, and since this game is generally 2 dollars, there is no reason to feel a big risk in diving.\nThis game is not without its frustrations, as there are cheap deaths to be had and a lot of chance involved with making a perfect run, especially in later levels. It's not very involved either, and is easy to play while watching a show as well, but it keeps it from having any replay value once you've played through a level. It's always interesting to start a new level and facing their challeges, but once you're done there's very little to go back to. Ultimately, that is Fortix's downfall, but it is still a great bargain, and a charming little indie game to boot. Definitely check it out if you have some spare change and want something different for your gaming pallete.","January 12, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course you do - you grew up in the early 1980's arcades like i did. Fortix is a  lot like Qix, but about three or four levels of evolution beyond that. Your avatar's goal is to claim areas by moving (drawing lines) around them, while avoiding monsters and artillery which attack him. So long as he's on a claimed area, he's invulnerable, but claiming new areas requires sallying forth into danger. Played through the whole thing in only 2 sittings, but it's still got 3 more difficulty levels to get through. Playable with a single hand, though i highly recommend the keyboard for movement (arrow keys), rather than the mouse.\n\nPS: was Linux support removed?

Not that it's a complicated puzzle game but they just fine tuned it. Also the graphics are somewhat nicer.","October 19, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With more objectives than just clearing the area past a certain percentage, Fortrix 2 is a simple puzzle game that is pretty easy to complete without too much trouble.","May 31, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In Fortix 2 you are a single knight who bravely captures forts on his own by running around in circles, and while you are at it, kill some Ogres and Dragons too.\n\nOverall it's just a fun game, it feels nice and responsive. I have not encountered any bugs my play. For the current price of €1,99 I would definitly would recommend this if you like Qix.","July 31, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course you do - you grew up in the early 1980's arcades like i did. Fortix is a  lot like Qix, but about three or four levels of evolution beyond that. Your avatar's goal is to claim areas by moving (drawing lines) around them, while avoiding monsters and artillery which attack him. So long as he's on a claimed area, he's invulnerable, but claiming new areas requires sallying forth into danger. Played through the whole thing in only 2 sittings, but it's still got 3 more difficulty levels to get through. Playable with a single hand, though i highly recommend the keyboard for movement (arrow keys), rather than the mouse.\n\nPS: was Linux support removed? Though i have it on Linux, the Store Page is no longer showing the system requirements for Linux. There's no indication of such in the product history.","February 27","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
