If you buy the game today, you get a crafting tool with a complete and functioning engine. The store page clarifies pretty well what the game is offering at this point, so make sure you understand what you are about to buy.\nIt is neither a survival nor a story game - at least not yet.\nI'm going to tell you a bit about the different modes to give you a better idea about Alchemist's Awakening:\n\nSingle-Player: You're most likely going to start playing alone and offline. There is no story mode yet but the developers promise to implement it prior to the official launch. So by generating your first world, you get a couple of quests to make you become familiar with the crafting system and building objects to gather resources. It is supposed to work as a little tutorial and introduction but lacks of clear explanations - hopefully that will change in the future. Other than doing the quests, there is no real goal to follow. However, by exploring the procedurally generated world/s, you will often come across new resources to craft new items. The 4 main elements wind, fire, ice and electricity are the most important ones and especially ice is not easy to gather in the beginning but I don't want to spoil too much.\nEnemies make your life a little harder - and with little I literally mean little. Basically something such as AI is non-existent and as far as I know you don't even get loot after killing one of them. I'm not sure if the focus is on simply testing your weapons and playing with them (since you can craft awesome unique attacks such as electric balls) or if there will be more about them during the development progress.\nIf it bores you to explore and collect rare items and you just want to start crafting what's on your mind, try the Creative or Build A Skin Mode. These modes give you an infinite amount of all blocks, there's no limits. Very notable is the Steam Workshop support that let's you easily share your buildings and skins with the community right from the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658150941\n\n\nMultiplayer: There's three different ways to play with your friends: Either you join a public server with them, create your own server or invite them to your single-player session. To protect your house (or whatever you choose to build and protect), the game gives you a totem to place on a 16x16 grid. Other than the totem feature, playing on a server is very similar to Solo Mode just that it's a lot more fun to visit creations of others, chat with them, kill them.. The newest upgrade comes with the option to invite friends to your own offline world which is amazing since you're not restricted to 16x16 and can build whatever you want without being afraid someone is going to loot and break down your houses.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game is great if you like sandbox games. The price of 15.99€ is a bit too high for what it is right now in my opinion. But it will raise along the way, so either pick it up now and enjoy the constant new updates or wait until it's released and on sale. I ended up spending much more time on this game than I thought in the beginning and enjoyed it a lot.\n\n★☆━━━━━━━━━[RATING: 6/10]━━━━━━━━━☆★\n\nPositive\nGraphics: The look of it is pleasing ones eyes. Flying around and looking at the landscape is relaxing and fun. At times it's a little too blurry but overall satisfying. The day/night cycle works and looks good, too.\nOpen World: New worlds are free to explore and will always be unique. Go wherever you want, fly to other islands, build bridges to connect them, explore new types of enemies, hidden treasures, rare items... Do what you want and don't be restricted to stay in certain areas!\nSandbox Experience: Creative minds will love this game. Endless opportunities to craft and build objects as well as living objects. Giving life to your own shapes is a nice feature on top of it all.\nDev Activity: The developers listen to the community, fix bugs very quickly and are there for help. In and out of the game. I have a good feeling about the game and its development as the devs seem to be working on the game with all their love and joy.\nWorkshop Support: It's truly amazing that a game launches in Early Access and offers Workshop support. Share your skins and buildings with the whole world and use the works of other players. It couldn't be easier to publish your art.\nMac / Linux Support: Both available, which is awesome. I played it on OS X and didn't encounter any abnormalities compared to the Windows version. Even updates are pushed at the same time, I'm very happy about the support!\nNeutral\nGameplay: As hinted on in my review, there's not a goal to follow and we will have to wait for the Story Mode. However, this will not keep you from spending hours and hours in the creative modes.\nBugs / Crashes: I would list the bugs in the negative section of my review if it wasn't an Early Access title. It's not surprising that the game crashes sometimes or you will notice weird bugs and glitches. The developer is working hard on fixing all bugs and pushing new updates which is laudable.\nSteam features: Workshop support is great but achievements and trading cards would be pretty sweet as well. I understand that since there's no story, there's not much to achieve, but I'd definitely like to see achievements when the game launches.\nNegative\nCombat: The fighting system is boring and not rewarding. Enemies are weak and not smart at all. In addition to that, there's not many different types of mobs.\nSoundtrack: It's okay, for the first hours. It won't vary much though and if you intend on playing for many hours, it gets incredibly annoying despite its relaxing sounds. I really had to turn off the music in the game after some 12 hours which is a bit sad but easy to fix (more different tracks, please!).\nPrice: The current price of 15.99€ is too high, especially since it's that early in development. There's many other sandbox games that are free or cheaper if you want to mess around and build things. Maybe it will be very worth the money in half a year, but not right now.\nHardware Information\n\nHardware Windows Mac   CPU 2.2GHz Intel Core Duo 2.6GHz Intel i7  GPU GeForce 9100M GeForce GT 650M    RAM 4GB (only 3 in use) 16GB   OS Windows 10, 32 Bit OS X El Capitan   Resolution 1920x1080 3840x2400 (Retina)   Controller Steam Controller Steam Controller\nI played this game on my Mac.\n\n\nDisclaimer\nA free key has been provided by Osaris Games for review purposes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HelloDahl/recommended/431450/","HelloDahl","Dahl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HelloDahl/","2405 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs of May 4th 2016, my recommendation is buy on sale.\n\nIf you are a fan of supporting early access, indie games and open world sandbox keep an eye on Alchemist Awakening as it looks very promising with a unique spin on the inventory, crafting and ability to give life to your builds. Other than that at this stage it's pretty standard for an open world sandbox…explore, gather then get creative.\n\nExperience\nTo start my journey I opted for single player to get my bearings. Having a cougar pet immediately was awesome. But then I had no idea what to do so started destroying things ːDː. It’s a bit trial and error without a tutorial but there is a short series of Quests that give the basic concepts of how you can use the alchemy screen and tool ‘Make Useful’ to turn resources into useful products as well as gather elements from them. The rest is basically exploration, gather, and build with no story to discover. I read that this is something to be added in the future so that’s another thing to look forward to.\n\nFeeling sort of at a loss for things to do I went to see what was happening on Multiplayer. The first time there were 2 people talking and they seemed friendly. A third had apparently destroyed their home and they were repairing it. Saw some pretty creative house builds some public wind and electricity farms and someone made a neat spider pet. Logged on again a day later for a couple hours and no one was around so I did some exploring to try to gain some materials. Discovered there are actually 9 islands on the map that I previously didn’t realize so started to build a bridge from a winter island to a desert? Island but lost my patience.\n\n\nPositives worth mentioning:  Inventory space & stacking feels generous. ːthumbsupː In a game that offers exploration and being able to gather everything I feel it’s important to have adequate inventory space and Alchemy Awakening delivers that. The unique system I mentioned is an alchemy area that allows for gathering 4 elements (Wind, Frost, Electricity, Fire) + 5 resources (Crystal, Metal, Sand, Nature, Stone) which are stored separate from the Inventory spaces. You can create different types of blocks to use from each alone or combined with different element/resources to create even more building options. The beauty of this alchemy area is that you can carry a lot more and create so many things on the fly without losing space.\n\nBuild your own creatures and give them life. Another unique twist to this game that allows for your imagination to run wild as you have the resources and elements to spare! The starter Quest you bring life to rock person that will harvest larger blocks for you. Mine also tried to fight  a black knight before falling to its demise.\n\nStacking blocks below your feet without jumping is nice when building upwards. I’ve only seen one other game (Portal Knights) do this. Probably a preference thing but I find it convenient. Also when suddenly I find I have 8 wolves on me and I can’t out run them but I can quickly drop any building block below me to aces .\nThings I wasn’t fond of:  Item loss on death is just a method I find annoying. If I spend an hour harvesting and lose it all upon death I feel like I just wasted my free time. I know this is not the same for everyone but that’s how it is for me.\n\nWould be nice to have a brief tutorial / tip screen how to use nonstandard functions like flying. I found one comment in steam discussion that mentioned it, but seems I missed something cause I still can’t fly.\n\nNo compass or mini-map is kind of aggravating. Especially if on a snow/ice island since you can’t see the arrow. Opening the map isn’t too horrible for navigation but the fact that I died cause I would press M to get my bearings then hear a wolf attacking me and die while smashing M key trying to close the map…*sigh*\n\nPress M to open Map but ESC to close it. Feels awkward for me as I am accustomed to pressing the same key bind a 2nd time to close a map. Would be easily solved if we can choose our own key bindings ːDː.\n\nCombat is clumsy and leaves little to be desired at this stage. If you hit the mob with a sword it appears to shoot backwards then walks at you again or in the case of some wolves run away hehe. And there are currently that I found 3 types of bad guys. But the early access notes on the store page read more creatures and attacks are planned.\n\nLooting harvested trees by walking over the fallen resources versus auto inventory or press and hold a single key started to annoy me after an hour. I mean it’s not horrible, and it’s certainly better than the days of target and click on every individual thing but regardless I found that after waiting for the tree to fall that I grew annoyed that I’d walk through the pile and see I missed half of it and have to walk through again.\n\nBuilding a straight line through the air was painful to me. And requires a patience I don’t have. I’m sure the infamous flying would be handy but I still can’t seem to make that happen. A tutorial would be fantastic for flying but that doesn’t exist either at this time. So on with dreadful experience of having the cursor at just the right spot to right click to add the block beside the one you’re standing on. I did realize after 30 or so minutes by pure accident you can click and drag to place a few blocks at once, but your position determines how many. For me it seemed like I could place 3-4 comfortably at a time and not fall from my location to certain doom. I just feel I wouldn’t have the patience to build a large structure in this game.\n\nDate: May 4, 2016\nRating: 5/10 at this stage of early access.\nI will be following the updates and waiting for Alchemist Awakening to exit early access.\n\nDisclaimer:\nKey provided by Osaris Games but does not influence the opinion reflected in this review.","May 4","true","11.0"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","6"

The game offers a vibrant world, calming music and the magical version of mining tools (click and poof!) to let you get your craft on.\n\nIn Alchemist's Awakening, you control a disembodied magic-wielding hand (ok, maaaybe a body too, but the hand is all you really see) to walk, jump, swim or fly around a vast open world full of the elemental building blocks you need to craft numerous tools and structures and create your own little alchemical paradise.\n\nIn its early access state, the game offers a large world to explore, plenty of building 'recipes' and a rather unique crafting system  (at least as unique as sandbox-crafting can be) based on elements that you 'spell' to life (sometimes literally).  However, the story mode has yet to be implemented beyond some basic quests, so there is no real objective beyond exploring the world and experimenting with what you can create.  Currently, it seems like this game will be best appreciated by fans of casual exploring and building, as any combat/survival system seems almost nonexistent at this point.  The tranquil atmosphere of the visuals and music adds to this peaceful, family-friendly focus.\n\nThe game seems mostly bug-free in its current state (which is *always* appreciated in an Early Access title), although some have reported occasional glitches, and there is still plenty of room for refinement of the game's basic features.  I would especially enjoy more work in the spell-combat system and additional crafting recipes, along with a much better guide for what items can potentially be created.  Additionally, I could not find any map of my brand new world - some form of mini/global map ought to be available at the start.  The game is also a bit lacking in tutorials at the moment - its very first 'starter-quest' seems to be meant as a handholding guide to the crafting system, but it still took me 10 minutes of button/menu mashing to figure out how to spell up my first object (a brand new oven!  Potentially to cook up some catburgers from that strangely non-menacing cougar always poking around, hmm?)\n\nAll in all, for those looking for a leisurely, extremely casual crafting game that doesn't involve endlessly whacking rocks and trees with pointy things, Alchemist's Awakening might be right up your alley.  However, if you prefer a story in your games, a more battle-y atmosphere, or more populated worlds to show off your stuff, you should wait until the game is closer to release before purchasing to make sure it will offer content to excite you.\n\nReceived a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.","April 4","true","1.4"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","26","28","0","1"

The difference in this is that it requires you to use the elements to create. In order to use these elements they must be obtained by objects you create. For example, an oven can create fire if "nature" or wooden logs are placed in it thus creating points for fire. I wish there was a tutorial in the beginning of the game to help players learn the game faster. The graphics were kind of dull and I wish there were more varieties of animals and people or enemies. I did like the creativity in this game as you can bring your creations to like. That's another big plus that made the game enjoyable. With that being said I would say that this is still an early access game in its early stages so I do hope they fix the game to make it more enjoyable. Hopefully some adjustments such as better graphics, more enemies and animals, better fighting animations would make this a great contender to becoming a good sandbox game. The price of this game is also overpriced in my opinion. If the game is somewhere in the $5-$7 range, then I would say that's a fair price. With all that being said I can see this game has potential to becoming great.\n\nRating:\n6.0/10\n\nPros:\nCreativity with elements\nCreate objects with different materials\nBring your creations to life\nUse the elements to attack enemies\nMultiplayer mode can be fun\nCons:  Graphics are dull\nLacks different characters and animals\nMultiplayer doesnt always work\nFighting animations are very limited\nOverpriced game\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor Samsung Series 9 S27B970D Display Port 2560x1440   Headphones Astro A40 Headset   Keyboard CMStorm KB   Controller Xbox 360 Wired Controller   Mouse CMStorm Mouse   Microphone Astro A40 Mic   Motherboard ASRock X79 Professional   CPU Intel i7-4930K 340GHz   GPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 760 X 2   RAM 16 GB Ram   OS Windows 7 Pro   HDD WD 2TB Hdd\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Osaris Games","April 3","true","1.8"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","1"

My review, however, is not affected by this action and will rate this game accordingly.\nREVIEW\nI may have not played most of crafting-sandbox games out there, but I think it’s safe to say that Alchemist’s Awakening is not like any other typical ones. I mean yes they follow the same principle of crafting and building stuffs, but instead, they’ve added more features to make things more interesting than the others. The developers are approachable and you can see that they are dedicated to this game. For the past few days, I’ve seen them regularly updating and trying to fix bugs and help out those who are in need.\n\nCurrently, there is no story or objective in this game other than the quest tab. I don’t really consider it as a quest because it only shows you what to build, how you can build it and that’s it. But if you are one of those people who enjoys crafting different kind of objects, then I’m sure your creativity will satisfy you right in this game.\n\nPROS	Graphics – It’s surprisingly soothing to just look at your surroundings even if it looks so simple. The areas are well-made and they all look good with the implementation of day-and-night cycle. Though there are times that the bloom is too much.\nOpen World – The game offers an extensive area for you to explore while discovering different materials that you can use.\nCrafting – This is one of the unique methods I’ve encountered when crafting an object. Basically, you gather up materials (which in this game is considered as elements) and instead of dragging those materials to a window and wait, you actually put those materials in front of you with a specific form and then use a spell to turn it to what you’re actually building.\nWorkshop – You don’t always see an Early Access launch will have a workshop support. With this, players can interact more and share their creations with others.\nCONS	Optimization – With how simple the graphics looks like, it is kind of surprising to have an fps which is less than what you’re expecting.\nGuides – Not everyone can follow instructions easily. I for one, took some time before I understood how crafting works. I highly suggest that you read and bring some guides with you upon playing this game. It really gets confusing.\nMinimap – There’s no compass, radar, or a map that can tell you exactly where you are. And this can be a problem when you’re playing in any Sandbox games, atleast in my experience.\nCombat System – I get that this is not the selling point, but it is honestly boring and the AI aren’t that smart either. There is no real challenge in it when in terms of fighting off some enemies.\nRATING7.2/10","April 3","true","2.9"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

The foundation that has been built here is solid. That is the key to any early access title. I have no doubt that as long as the dev continues to put in the effort, this will turn out to be a very enjoyable game.\n\nI am not the kind of clown that is going to buld a beautiful statue or a visually impressive building. That said, I have still found plenty to do during my time in the game.\n\nI started out by creating my own skins, which continues to be great fun. I have made quite a few of them, and they are all special in their own way, even if many could be considered abominations that should not be.\n\nAt the moment, the game shines on the multiplayer server, which features a large map that provides more than enough space to do as you please. You can put together some buildings in the community developing on one part of the map, or find a space off the beaten path to live the solitary life. I like to wander to a corner somewehere that nobody has visited yet, and create something strange that will one day make someone ask, 'what is this doing here?".\n\nThe act of building is easy to learn.

I didn't really know what I was doing. Yes, I knew it was a build and survive game, but it wasn't completely clear exactly how I'd be doing that. The tutorial is quite bare bones, and really doesn't do a great job of showing off what the game has to offer. If you can get past this tough start, you'll discover some quite unique elements which come together quite nicely so it's definitely worth sticking with.\n\nThe world looks pretty great, and you could spend a good amount of time just exploring and seeing what type of environments generate. The crafting system is deceptively deep. Everything comes from 9 base elements. This makes collecting what you need relatively simple, and also greatly lowers the hassle of inventory management.\n\nThe addition of magic is done well, and really gives making things a boost. Animating golems and having them do your bidding, flying around the world, throwing fireballs at enemies, and any other magic you discover works brilliantly and feels very fitting in the world.\n\nThe developer is very attentive and active in fixing bugs that occurring and providing updates. The game is relatively new still, but I believe this bodes well for the future health of the game. The development path seems realistic and achievable, so hopefully there is a lot more to come.\n\nThe good looking world, unique inventory and crafting system, and integration of magic make up for the slack of a decent tutorial, slightly clunky combat and questionable AI. The crafting can seem complicated, but you can keep it simple at first and move on to more advanced techniques as you get to grips with the game.\n\nAlchemist's Awakening should not be written off as "yet another Minecraft clone". It definitely brings something new to the table, and is it continues in the same direction this could be the best title in this ever-expanding genre. If you're looking for an open-world crafting & survival game, there aren't many better options - even with AA being in such an early state.\n\nSource of consideration: Osaris Games","April 3","true","17.8"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

More complex things like fire and wind demand an stove and windmill for example which you can build like in any crafting game with a little twist. You must do an some kind of premade thing and then bring it to life using bring to life tool (golem in videos) :] With stone element you can create all kinds of stone blocks and with wood doors and i think you get the picture :)\n\nWhen you start single player game tutorial is pretty helpful actually and lets you do things your way but gives instructions and you get to know the game well by playing it. Seemed much nicer approach than standard seperate tutorial.\n\nThen you can also use those elements for combat purposes like fire and lighting and even bring your creations to life :)\n\nGraphics look pretty nice but i had some severe fps problems despite having an pretty decent system but this being at EA this does not matter since everything will get optimized. Sounds are pretty generic along with music.\n\nThis game misses Invert-Y option! :D I know it is EA but damn, that is like first thing you do when create an FPS, this is nothing big but i just wanted to mention it :]\n\nCombat is just plain awful at this stage so i wont write more about it (will revisit it later on when it actually works)\n\nThis is no survival game in essence that there are no normal things like hunger, thirst or any of those.\n\nWhat i found positive that the game was pretty bug free but its in really starting stages so i would not recommend to buy this right now if you want to play an complete game but price is not bad for this kind of game. This game has potential but we will see about that in future and i will also revisit this review in the future.\n\nI will give thumbs up for now for good ideas.

You can harvest resources and use these to craft things such as swords, houses, wind-mills, ovens and more. When combining resources you can craft even more items. For example: Combining nature and metal create melee weapons. While combining fire and wind creates fireballs. Wind-mills can be used to gather wind, while putting wood in the oven creates fire. At first it seems a bit much, especially if like me you are not very familiar with sandbox games, which is why a tutorial would have been nice. The game does offer an alternative: a quest log which asks of you to create specific items, and tells you how to do this and which resources you need.\n\nDo yourself a favour and try to craft a metal sword early in the game, it makes battling enemies so much easier. So far mobs have been easy to find, but have not been very diverse. Your health regenerates automatically outside of combat. The game contains music which is soothing and fits the game well. Also the world you're in was much larger than I expected it to be, and has diverse areas; water, forests, snowy lands and sand areas. My main gripe with the game is that its novelty wears off quickly, leaving not much to do. I hope the story mode will change this.\n\nSettings\nYou can choose between English and French screen languages. Graphics: Offers full screen and windowed mode, shadows none/medium/max, antialiasing 1x/2x, quality medium/high, view distance and FOV sliders. The options are few, but having more options I think would be completely unnecessary as the game's graphics are very minimum. Controls: Despite not having a lot, are completely rebindable. Finally, you can adjust the sound and music volume of the game, so no need for annoying windows volume mixer.\n\nRating:\n6.5/10\n\nPros:\nI loved this games music, its very soothing. Fit the game well in my opinion.\nControls completely rebindable.\nQuick action bar for easier access to the items in your inventory.\nBig and diverse world to roam around on.\nGood amount of crafting combinations, both material as 'magical' (fireballs, blast of wind).\nCons:  The AI feels very subpar.\nThe way to change graphics options feels illogical (toggling). Changes are applied immediately.\nAction bar needs adjustments: being able to drag items to slots and change slots around(!).\nPet disappears too often, especially after chasing a wild animal, making it difficult to find again.\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor Dell24inchdontknowwhatmodel   Headphones SteelSeries Siberia V2   Keyboard Skiller cheap $15   Controller Xbox 360 (wireless)   Mouse Logitech G400s   Microphone SteelSeries Siberia V2   Motherboard Gigabyte GA-Z87-HD3   CPU Intel i5-4670K   GPU Geforce 770GTX   RAM 8GB Corsair   OS Windows 10 Home   HDD Plextor 125GB (SSD), Seagate Barracuda 1TB (HDD)\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Osaris Games","April 3","true","9.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

You will get my honest feelings about the game (both good and bad).---\n\nReview Written on Sunday, March 27th, 2016\n\nReview\nId like to start out by mentioning that this game is in early access. There are many issues at this point but and I will try to list them in the pro and con section below. I don't usually gravitate to this type of game but in this case I did. I found it to be quite enjoyable and easy to lose track of time while playing!\n\nYou basically go around and harvest resources from the land and build a home and other items by combining resources. At this point in the game, there is very little to do but explore, harvest and build your home or workshop.\n\nThere are a small handful of mobs which can attack and you would defend with weapons but I will get into that later on. Assuming the developer continues work as expected, this game will be great when the time comes to leave early access. Please take into account that all the cons listed will hopefully be looked at by the time the game leaves early access.\n\nRating:\n6.5/10\n\nPros:\nMultiplayer: There is an online server and you can join friends to build together online.\nMusic: I feel the music although limited in variety fits the game play quite well.\nProtect Home: There is an item to place which gives you protection for your 16x16 square on the map. Making it so no one can destroy your creation.\nVisuals: While not amazing, it is quite beautiful seeing the lay of the land from the top of a mountain.\nHarvest & Crafting: Somewhat easy to scavenge and obtain resources and then also build using them.\nCons:Tutorial: It is there in single player mode but it could be more clear and concise at times.\nMini-map: There are coordinates available in game but Im more of a visual person and feel a mini-map would be more useful.\nAttacking: It is hard to figure the attacking out in this game as the collision detection is not where it needs to be yet.\nProtect Resources: There needs to be a way to put resources in a locked box for when you explore. I was out and about after gathering resources for about 5 hours and I accidentally drowned and lost EVERYTHING I collected. This would help make the blow a little less.\nRandom Bugs: You can sometimes see sharks swimming on land and wolves going in to the water. Small things that come along with being in early access. I'm sure it will be fixed soon.\n\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Osaris Games","March 27","true","17.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

You don't craft abilities and blocks but instead equip their recipe to your hotbar, only consuming elements as you place blocks or use abilities. Picking up blocks converts them back to their elements, meaning you don't have to worry about junk cluttering up your inventory and micromanaging a dozen chests. Another type of crafting is placing down blocks, which in specific arrangements can be converted into objects such as beds and ovens. Recipes are easily figured out with trial and error (you select one or more elements and it lists what you can make with them) and the block arrangements are shown in the tutorial. More interestingly you can place any assortment of blocks and use your magic to turn them into your very own minion. It's not just swapping textures either. There's a template to follow, but you can build it larger and slightly different so long as it's the same general shape. How the game interprets modifications to the template can be confusing, but there's an awesome "build your skin" mode which allows you to experiment while designing your own character model.\n\nIn its current state there's not much to the single-player mode other than four creatures to encounter and a few tutorial quests that give you an idea of how the game works. It'll tell you how to build or make things but not how or where to get the necessary elements. After figuring some things out on my own, within a few hours I had harvested massive amounts of common elements that allowed me to fly practically endlessly (so much so that the game no longer showed a timer), incinerating anything that posed a threat.\n\nCreative is another story though. The game has many non-cube blocks to place and you can even place them in rotated or flipped positions (your house can have a non-cubic roof!). You can also import or export creations to the game's workshop. The developer has put up a few stunning examples that I couldn't even begin imagining to design. The only nags I have are that not every block is available in every shape and there aren't many colors of fabric blocks.\n\nUpdates have been frequent so far. I just hope there's a consistent trickle of quests and content.\n\nPositives:  Unique crafting system\nNo inventory micromanagement necessary\nCan model your character with blocks\nIncludes non-cubic shapes which can be oriented many ways\nGot 40-60FPS@1080p with GPU near minimum requirements Negatives:  No story mode yet\nTutorials are vague\nAI is noticeably lacking\nHardware Information\nOS: Windows 7 x64\nCPU: Intel i5-2500k @ 4.5GHz\nRAM: 16GB DDR3 1600\nGPU: Radeon HD 6870 1GB\n\nProvided by Osaris Games for testing & review","April 4","true","13.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

You will probably think the same i did when i first heard of this game: "Minecraft with magic and flying!". Ok, you dont have the liberty of destroying the "World", but you can "farm" some of it, in other words, you can't dig underground or destroy mountains. You also have at least 3 different Biomes, a Forest Biome, a Desert Biome and a Ice Biome.\n\nThe SinglePlayer is still pretty simple, only having around 7 quests, but you do have a Tiger pet with you, which is amazing! One thing i loved here is that you can create a Golem, and give it life, so that he can do what you want him to (you can create Golems on Multiplayer as well).\n\nIn the Multiplayer you have a tool that, in a radious of 16x16, only you can create/destroy, making that space always yours. I already saw a giant bridge between islands, the tallest tower ever, let your imagination fly for what can be created next!\n\nRating:\n8.0/10\n\nPros:\nA large variety of materials, either by farming them, and even more by using them. You can place Nature (wood) in your Oven to create not charcoal, but fire, and by farming that fire, you can then use it as a weapon, for example. And not only fire, you can also collect Electricity, Wind, Ice, and those are only the "Magic" elements.\nThe Dev is always aware of the community opinions and feedback, which is great.\nThe Music blends in perfectly with the ambient you are in, and the Graphics are pretty nice as well.\nSteam Workshop, so you can create skins for you, or use some already made from others.\nMultiplayer, where you can see the incredible creations of the community, and even help making more.\nCons:The lack of a tutorial is the biggest one, the SP has got quests, but not the same thing.\nSome bugs, but its still early access, dont forget that.\nCombat AI is too simple, very linear, and so far only two types of enemy (i could find, at least).\nAs i said, there are quests, but theyre not even 10, so you can do them really fast.\nHardware Information\nHardwareTypeMonitor1366x768HeadphonesOzone Rage STMouseE-Blue AurozaMicrophoneOzone Rage ST MicrophoneCPUIntel Core i5-3210M 250GHzGPUNVIDIA GeForce GT 620MRAM6GbOSWindows 7HDD750Gb\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Osaris Games","April 2","true","9.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

It could become something that I didn't knew I wanted to play.\nI decided to test this game in its basic current version to measure its future, and see how well it could stand up if it ever gets some decent support.\nThough there is currently no mechanic to make use of buildings for any PvP or PvE aspect of this game (I mean really, absolutely no use) I proposed myself to make the tallest castle in the furthest and highest mountain I could find, just for the sake of it.\nThis project required some serious grinding I soon found out not to be made for, as mining stones though the desert the world got me bored pretty quickly.\nIn one of my trips back home from this grinding sessions, I found this unattended finished construction. I went inside and saw its beauty, but most Importantly, how much time was invested in acquiring all that precious material.\nSo I mixed some air and fire I had gathered back home, and made myself a fireball.\nWatching it burst through that simple four wall building felt oddly satisfying, a feeling greatly intensified when I got to collect all the stone that flew bursting from it.\nI had collected an hours’ worth of grinding material in just a few minutes, and had an absolute blast doing it.\n\nI decided I would do it again.\n\nSoon I found myself doing daily flyby's through the multiplayer world, looking for abandoned constructions to burst and loot, and every day I got some kicks out of it.\nPeople are extremely creative and I almost always found some amazing constructions being built all around. I started to use the best ones as reference points to learn my way through the world, while my castle back at the mountain grew higher and higher.\nOnce I reached the sky limit for the game (that’s 510 blocks of altitude by the way) and stood up there watching the world from it’s top with a fireball in my hand, I came to me.\nI had made myself the server’s villain, and I was having S O  M U C H  F U N.\n\nPeople where chatting on how buildings where getting systematically destroyed all around the island, wondering about the sign left over the ruins reading 1460;510;1340.\nI soon got visitors to my castle and found myself with the anger of adventurous players that dared to climb up to my mountain tower, only to be greeted by a simple wall sign and a torch reading “Trilyan’s Lair”.\nSeeing how I've reached 20 hs in this game in just 2 weeks, I am certainly amazed...\nIt’s by no means a polished and finished experience, but I think I tested the basic concepts enough to realize there is a guaranteed future for the game, provided it ever gets the player support it needs.\n\nThe freedom of a unlimited PvP experience inside a persistent and mouldable world is something I had yet to experience and I’m sure that with a little help from a decent player base, this could refine a lot of its current edges and become a decent successor to the prehistoric Minecraft reference gameplay model.\n\nRating:\n6/10\n\nRecommendation:Only buy at full price if you are into crafting games and are craving for something new.\nWait for a discount if are only curious about it.\nDo not buy if you are neither of the above.\n\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor SamsungSyncMasterTA50027   Headphones Headphones   Keyboard RazerReclusa   Controller XBOX360Wired   Mouse RazerHabu   Microphone GeniusUSB   Motherboard AsusMaximusVIHero   CPU IntelCorei5-4670K4200MHz   GPU MSIGTX770OC2GB   RAM 8GB2133   OS Windows10x64   HDD WDCWD1002FAEX-00Z3A0\nDisclaimer:\nThis game was provided to me by the developer for beta testing.\nSource of consideration: Osaris Games","April 3","true","19.0"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

You can build (ooh!), craft (ah!), and explore (oh my!). My cynical jokes aside, this game has a lot of potential. The music and environment is pleasing and immersive. When I played online with my friend, it felt like we were a part of an adventure/RPG anime. The music, environment, and graphics all provide a very appealing and new experience.\n\nHowever, the immersive experience is short-lived. The game's building system is a refreshing take on voxel-based crafting, but it is flawed. How it works is you build a structure in the environment, and then click on it using a special tool. However, the tool isn't smart, and will convert anything that matches a recipe, regardless of if it doesn't make sense. I accidentally clicked on the floor of my house and turned a chunk of it into a bed. This, combined with the lack of a sprint function and THINGS TO DO, had me bored with the game after about an hour of playing.\n\nOverall, Alchemists Awakening is just another open world sandbox game, but the creative crafting system and pleasing cosmetics give it potential. With some polish, this game could be distinguishable from the pile of similar early access games that have cropped up over the last few years.\n\nRating:\n5.7/10\n\nPros:\nGorgeous soundtrack.\nAn original and creative (although flawed) crafting system.\nDecent graphics for early access (with beautiful bloom and post processing effects)\nFair amount of exploration.\nMultiplayer\nCons:  No sprint function, allowing wolves to munch on your butt with ease.\nCrafting system is awkward.\nAppeal is short-lived due to lack of things to do.\nGlaring early access look graphical glitches, etc.\nInventory system is unintuitive.\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor Generic Dell Monitor 16:10 1440x900   Headphones Generic Plantronics Headset   Keyboard Dell   Controller Logitech Gamepad F310   Mouse Logitech G700   Microphone Generic Headset Mic   Motherboard Powerspec   CPU AMD Phenom II X6 1090T Processor 3.2 ghz   GPU GeForce GTX 460   RAM 4GB DDR3   OS Windows 7   HDD 1TB HDD 280gb available\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Osaris Games","April 16","true","1.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","2"

The review describes my expression of the game and nothing more than that. This  particularly review holds more formal nature and form.\n\nApril 4th, year 2016. The copy was obtained from Osaris Games.\n\nDespite being a seemingly regular sandbox example, Alchemist's Awakening offers you colossal possibilites, innovative means and a creativity level you won't often meet in most similar games. For now it's not so perfect, as you could imagine, but constant work on the project, which includes, in the first place, adding new materials and elements, will maintain a way for AA for becoming a solid title. There aren't many resources, to begin with, but number of available combinations can cover for that well enough. The concept is typical, nonetheless, - after you run out of quests you are free to do whatever you want including further exploration and discovering while building some stuff, looking for loot and throwing hadoukens fireballs into unsuspecting foes.\n\nElements of nature can be used , for example, to fight enemies and animate lifeless into lifelike objects (homunculi, in other words), which are always shaped in a human form though. Therefore, bringing a life to 4 blocks of wood would turn the thing into a ridiculous alive pair of legs, yik! Even so, there is a hope that developers will come up with more forms later. The combating itself is simple and looks like "to be improved" appendix for the time being. Unnecessarily said, and a bit of self remark, but harvesting air in a world filled with it seems a bit peculiar too.\n\nTechnically, game might be in need of some polishing as well as optimization as it tends to be quite resourceful, but being in EA at this stage it is still justifiable and developers have enough time to settle things. Minor improvements are needed - adding more thorough in-game settings, for starters. I am yet to try out the multiplayer, so can't say much about this part, but may do later in time (with adding necessary redaction to the review, of course).\n\nWhat was enjoyable:  Unique concept and design, ability to create blocks of different shapes and then making them "useful".\nGiving life to blocks (wish I could create a fullmetal armor and "put a soul" into it though, sigh).\nMeditative and relaxing background music as well as realistic sounds of the "living and blooming" world.\nIntegration of Workshop this early and ability to create own skins.\nConstant updates.\nWhat proves lacking:  World creatures are mostly static and fullfill a better role of statues than actual fauna.\nAbsence of any kind of tutorial to get into the game, even though there are some basic quests.\nNavigating in the surroundings is quite troubling, some instruments like detailed map/minimap, compass would be nice.\nGenerally, interface: text isn't always visible and there would be nice to see certain indicators (ex. underwater breath, altitude).\nCombating, overall precision for building needs "smoothening". _____________________________________________\n\n6 Philosopher's Stones out of 10. Mostly short sessioned sandbox with unique touch, where you could fairly multiply your experience by entering online domain; 'sablière alchimique' to be said.","April 4","true","2.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Often not fun at all, full of bugs and based on promises that developers don't even intend to keep. This isn't the case with Alchemist's Awakening though. At this state, this game is not only playable, but actually enjoyable and intriguing. Details? This way, please!\n\nPros:\nGraphic. It's really good, very pleasant to look at, nights are beautiful. Animations are still lacking (regarding your character and other creatures) and there isn't enough variety in biomes, but your surrounding still looks lively.\nMusic. Fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly.\nIt runs great. Really. Even on my potato. I was afraid of lags, since my current laptop barely pass the required minimum, but fps rate is stable and games run smoothly.\nMultiplayer. I'm a loner player type myself, but this game looks like it would be so much fun to play it with someone.\nUnique. This doesn't seem like another "Minecraft type" of game. You can see that developer has original idea and wants to create something new.\nCombine everything! Seriously, this game gives you a lot of options. It reminds me a bit of Magica - since you use various elements to create something. Here you have more elements to choose from and you create not only magical attacks, but also useful things, building, weapons and even... your own creatures. Beyond awesome.\nSteam Workshop. Pretty much every survival game is perfect for various mods and this one isn't any different. Yay for all future mods! <3\nThere will be more! Duh, this is EA game after all. But game creator clearly have ambitious plans and he's working on adding story mode into the game. Which is great. I hope this game will grow, giving you a lot more options, a lot more enemies and an actual purpose.\n\nCons:\nTutorial. Like... seriously. There's need to be something more than: "open your quest book and follow instructions". Because those instructions are not clear at all. I was struggling for ten minutes to even built a oven since I didn't understand what I should exactly do (not to mention that the game doesn't explain how to gather elements). Then when I got a hang of it, another issue - thunder rod. How to craft necessary parts...? From what element...? Oh, metal, okay, got it. Where will I find metal though...? Don't get me wrong, I don't like tutorials that leads you by hand, but at this point game isn't very user friendly. Especially since it isn't super intuitive, so it really takes a bit before you understand all mechanics.\nBugs and all that stuff. You know, EA. You need to expect that. Sharks swimming on dry land, your creatures getting stuck on one another and start glitching, gathering elements gets a little sloppy and doesn't work even if you have enough energy. I haven't encountered anything major or game breaking and I hope this little issues will get resolved quickly.\nEnemies. I'm not sure if there are more enemies in the game. I was only in two biomes, so maybe somewhere else, but I've encountered only wolfs and shadow warriors. So, first issue: not enough variety here. Second issue, there is too much of them. Especially right after you start the game and don't have anything good yet, didn't even built anything, just wants to look around, find right place for your home and... You get instantly attacked by wolf. Plus, going around and see the same type of enemies everywhere you look is just boring. Solutions? Either more variety (not only in terms of look, but also reactions, combat style etc.), something Minecraft-style (you know, enemies only during night or in dark places or something along those lines) or at least give player a little more space to explore when they starts the game. Because otherwise, especially with lacking tutorial, it gets really frustrating very quickly.\nCombat. I think it's the weakest part of game so far. Spell-type attacks (like fireballs) looks cool and works okay, but actual weapons... Fighting with those feels and looks clunky and weird.\nNo minimap. Please D: For the sake of us, people who gets lost all the time, not only in games, but in real life, add at least optional minimap. Otherwise I won't remember where my house is and all important stuff. And that gets annoying.\n\nSo... Does it feel like EA game? Yes. But like good type of EA game. You know, exactly what EA game should be. It has a lot of potential, interesting mechanics and good ideas, it just lacks polish and this essential "THING" that will make it an amazing game. There are a lot of reasons to believe that game creator know what he's doing, so I hope that when Alchemist's Awakening will come out from EA it will be absolutely stunning. As for now, I'm waiting for story mode. I feel like giving this world (and my character) a backstory and purpose would serve this game a lot.\n\nSource of consideration: Osaris Games","March 22","true","8.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

I like the idea and implementation of how you can use 9 different elements as building blocks to make things. There is a lot of variety with creating things in that regard. Although there isn't much of a working tutorial, just small instructions on how to start building things. Plus the AI of the enemies isn't that great yet, but since it's still early access, I imagine that will be worked on some more.\n\nThis game is similar in style to games like Minecraft and the like, which is fun if you like building stuff. So far there isn't a whole lot to do, and the AI seems to be lacking as well. But, I do like that it already has Steam Workshop enabled and it is working well in the game. You can create unique things with the 9 elements you have at your disposal. Another neat feature is being able to play in multiplayer with other people and combine your work on creating stuff with the elements and so on.\n\nI may revisit this review after this game gets a lot more polish, but for now, its pretty barebones and still needs more variety of enemies, better AI, a better tutorial, some guides in-game would be nice, some more implementation of workshop options.\n\nRating:\n6.0/10\n\nPros:\nThe 9 elements used to build things\nThe graphics seem well done for what there is so far\nInteresting base of mechanics for what is to come\nYou can create things out of what you build\nHas workshop capability already\nCons:  Combat seems to be lacking\nNo tutorial, just basic instructions on how to build stuff to get you started\nNot a lot of music variety\nAI needs a lot more work\nSome major clipping issues in the game models\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Osaris Games","March 24","true","2.3"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

Although the game is unique enough to give the gamer a experience which is vastly different than anything they could see in Minecraft.  For starters the game isn't voxel based, the crafting is also quite different as well.  The game is in early access, which means it'll be ever changing, what you see right now won't be the experience you'll have 3 months, 6 months or even a year from now.  The best part about most early access games is that they give the gamer the ability to get a first hand view of a game's development..  Normally from it's infancy until the game becomes a full fledged thriving project of awesomeness.  While some early access games may disappoint I don't think that will happen with this game.  The developers are active and engaging and updates are coming out at a fairly reasonable pace.  I wouldn't let the Early Access title deter you in the least.  The tutorial in the beginning was OK, but it left a little bit to be desired as far as getting the gamer prepared for how the crafting system works.  A few things weren't necessarily explained, although a few quick google searches and and game play videos and I became what I'd consider to be a master crafter in no time flat.\n\nGameplay\nTypical open world sandbox game play, collect resources, hunt animals, and craft any and everything you can imagine, simply create the shape and use your tool to craft it into the object you desire.   You have a base element, nature, stone, crystal, etc etc etc, you use those base elements to build blocks, planks, stones, boards.  A very unique and interesting crafting mechanic to say the least.. Animals and enemies can drop resources, typically metals or crystals which can be used to craft swords for protection.  Early on the only form of protection you'll have outside of unarmed attacks is a cougar (Not a older female into young guys but an actual animal) that will help you kill enemies.  It won't take long until you're crushing everything you come too like a champ\n\nPro's\nInteresting and hands on crafting system\ngood music\nnice graphics\nWorkshop support\nActive and engaged developers\n\nCon's\nWould benefit from from additional enemies\nGame needs to have difficulty adjusted, enemies are far too easy\n\n\nRecommendation\nI'd strongly recommend this game, while it's currently still very much a work in progress, the developers have shown they are willing and eager to listen to player feedback and actively strive to make the game better.  The price maybe a bit off putting atm, but keep in mind as it's an Early Access title, it will continue to improve on an already pretty awesome base.  Buy in now and enjoy watching watching improve and get better.\n\nKey was provided by developers, but in no way, shape or form influenced my review..","April 21","true","2.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/431450/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAlchemist's Awakening is an open-world indie game with astonishing environment graphics and an enjoyable gameplay.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You live in a beautiful world where you have to survive. There is a bunch of different elements, from which you can craft many different things. In this game, unlike some other ones of the same genre, you can combine different basic elements in order to get even more items by combining, but I will describe this more in its separate paragraph.\n\nPros:    Graphics | The graphics are really very good. If you want to see what I'm talking about: click here. And make it a bit more beautiful in your mind, because my drawing distance settings were pretty low when I was taking the screenshot. Anyway, the textures look nice, which shows that someone was spending a lot of their time working hard on them and it paid off. So if you're worried about how the game will look, leave those worries behind you.\nMultiplayer | Since there are so many survival/crafting games out there, you have to offer something new in order to be seen by the customers. This game did that: it supports multiplayer and, to be honest, it's quite fun. You can just join a server or create your own one. And if you're afraid of some random troll destroying hours of your hard work, don't be: you have the ability to protect a certain area from other players.\nWorkshop Integration | You can also create items yourself and, if you so desire, you can share them with others on the Steam Workshop. There is over a hundred items already, which is, in my opinion, a lot for a relatively unknown game in Early Access. This shows that there is a lot of potential already and I'm hoping to see an even more involved community in the future.\nAmount of Content | As I mentioned, there is a lot of different materials to craft and what impresses me the most is that you are not only able to craft a certain item, but also craft it into a specific shape. Different shapes enable you to build more sophisticated items with smaller details, which is very hard to do in Minecraft, for example.\nSkin Builder | It's a tiny thing, but I really love the skin creator. You can choose whatever elements you want and build a character the way you like it. You are only putting blocks together, which may give you the impression of not really being able to for a human-like character, but the game automatically detects shapes like arms and legs and makes your creation move just the way it's supposed to be moving. I find that really impressive.\nLinux and MacOS Support | I'm not really sure what engine Alchemist's Awakening runs on, but it's certainly a good thing that it runs on Linux and MacOS as well.\nCons:    Difficulty | I needed at least an hour to figure out how to actually do anything useful. Building things is a real hassle at first and it takes a lot of time to get used to it. Once you get past that stage you discover the charms of this game, but the beginning can be just awful.\nAI | When you're fighting against AI, it's not really a big challenge. You just learn a few right moves and all enemies become more or less uninteresting.\nSystem Resources Usage | If your computer is not very good, you most likely won't be able to play this game. At one point, it used over 4 GB of my RAM. I don't have a problem with this, since RAM is there to be used, but it can severely slow down your computer if it's not strong enough. Consider this before purchase.\nAmount of Multiplayer Players | Although multiplayer can be quite fun, it's not rare to see servers completely empty, meaning that you can't really play with anyone but yourself. In order to play with other people, you have to figure out when are people most likely to play and try to be there at that time.\nClunky Menus | I really don't like the menus. The first thing is their look, which is, in my opinion, somehow cheap and tacky. Also, you can only access options once you're already spawned on the map.\nSteam Integration | First thing: no Achievements. Second thing: no Trading Cards. That's all there is to say about this.\nThe final verdict:There's no doubt about this: this game is beautiful. It also has a very advanced crafting system, which covers two of the biggest advantages of this game. There are some problems, such as getting used to the game and how much system resources this game uses, but since this game is still in Early Access, I think that there will still be plenty of improvements. It looks like the developer is active, which is always a good sign.\nIf you like survival and crafting games, this might be a game for you. I'm not too sure about the price, so you may want to wait for a discount before purchasing this game.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.","April 25","true","17.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

You have a sort of meter in the bottom right corner you can watch as you break things down or snatch things from around you; it will recharge quickly over time, though.  You don't really have to worry about it unless you are grabbing massive amounts of things, or destroying trees or other things that are built already.  So far, what I'm experiencing is a kind of crafting and building system, which I am learning to use as I collect more items.  I'm enjoying the expansiveness of the map so far, and the ongoing tutorial system.\n\nAs I started to play this one, I had to generate a world, and once I got started, I was impressed with the nice and expansive roaming I could do in the world around me. You have a cougar or puma or mountain lion, or whatever else you'd like to call them as your buddy when you first start out, and you have to check your inventory to learn how to craft things (default E).  Fighting stuff took me a minute to get used to, but it was all good once I started to understand the whole create and collect processes with right and left-clicks on the mouse.\n\nThe enemies are not too tough with my trusty companion (who can get KO'd then return to life after a few seconds). Sometimes he/she gets lost, and I simply cannot find them.  I can just restart the game if all else fails, and they're back whenever this happens.  I'd like to have a way to "call" them over, and/or give them specific commands...\n\nThe different alchemy ingredients in your inventory menu are nicely done, and you can use various "combinations" to create different and new things.  The layout is really great, in my opinion, making combinations a bit easier to work with than some other similar systems I have tried, which I like.  Highlighting over a particular elemental or item you have will show you other variations of that item you can create for more or less than the amount of the raw material you have.  For instance some things are half a material, or others are four, so it depends on what item you're looking to craft.\n\nSo far this game is looking like it has a lot of nice potential, and it's already a lot of fun!  I think I have done about all I can for now.  What I'd like to see later is possibly more crafting combinations, or if there are more, a way to find them out easier.  I like the treasure chests that I have found while exploring though.  I personally like RPG elements, so that is something I'd personally like to see incorporated, but that's simply due to personal taste.  Looking forward to whatever the game has to offer as things get going further along.  Great for an early access title so far!\n\nI am not a big fan of multiplayer, so I didn't try this part of the game as of yet, nor did I play with friends.  I can't really comment on that aspect of the game as of now, but single player is a lot of fun, for sure!  I cannot wait to see how this one develops!\n\nRating:\n8.3/10\n\nPros:\nA good tutorial system to help me get started in the game.  I like being able to ease into something without having to guess a whole lot, and just getting instructed helped me to understand how all the inventory stuff worked.  I did have to figure out the inventory button though, by checking controls.\nThe expansive world was nice to explore. I've enjoyed the size so far, and I can see this becoming quite fun when more things are implemented.\nI like the graphics for this game a lot!  The landscape is almost overwhelming for me personally, and I'm really glad to see this at an early access stage.  This could really turn out amazing!  I can see a lot of potential here with this game!\nMusic is nice and calm.  I like it, and it goes along with the relaxed feel of the world around me.  It's not overly intrusive, and I am not tired of hearing it, since it is so light and relaxing.  Great when songs don't bother me!\nI like the mouse-wheel option to scroll through your items you've recently selected, so you can pick or choose which things you want to use at any particular time fairly quickly.  At this time I am not aware of how to remove any items after they have been added to the quick menu, but restarting will of course start things over, and it's not extremely bothersome.\nCons:  I'd love to have a controller option supported for this game somehow. These kinds of games are a lot smoother with controller, but it's not as critical as, say a platformer, or something of that nature.\nA way to call my companion would be great, and a more detailed fighting system would be great, so I could sort of control the fighting aspect, and how to go about things.  When to bring my companion in towards me, when to keep them close, and when they can get aggressive, or passive etc.\nThere is no meter for when I am drowning.  The first time I ran underwater, I had no idea that was the cause of my death.  I've since learned you can jump as you travel over water to avoid this from happening.\nI was taught to build an oven in the tutorial/quest part, but it did not tell me to put wood in the oven to create fire.  That would have been nice to add to the tutorial, but I was able to connect the dots pretty quickly on that, as it's fairly a no-brainer sort of thing.  Still, I didn't think to add it at the start of the game, so it may help.\nThe sharks in the water will rise out of the water, but there is no splash afterwards.  Also I cannot seem to kill the sharks.  They disappear when I get their lifebars down to nothing also.\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor Sharp Aquos 42 LCD HDTV    Headphones Kingston HyperX Cloud   Keyboard UtechSmart Mercury RGB backlit mechanical keyboard   Controller PS3 Dualshock 3   Mouse UtechSmart Venus MMO mouse   Microphone Kingston HyperX Cloud   Motherboard ASRock Z97 Extreme4   CPU Intel i5 4690k 350 GHz   GPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 960   RAM Crucial Ballistix Tactical 16 GB   OS Windows 7 Professional   HDD SandiskExtremePro480GBSSD Hitachi2TBSATA3HDD\nDisclaimer:\nDisclaimer: I was given a key to review the game.

Only time and more users will determine exactly what the world becomes. There is potential for it to be a PVE survival with more advanced enemies to fight, requiring different elements, new attack methods, etc. With more active users, there is a chance it will become more of a PVP survival game, where your only safe haven is your home.\n\nAll possibilities aside, what the game is right now is a beautiful open-world sandbox where you can build almost anything you want in your section of land that you claim. You can work together with other players, share resources via community chests and element generators, and enjoy the pleasant visuals of the world. The crafting system is why you are an alchemist: the UI allows you to mix elements that you've collected to essentially have a menu to create tons of other objects, elements, and other interactive tools. Want to harness wind you collected from the windmill to fly around the clouds? You can do that. Combine the wind with fire you collected from your oven to create a fireball? No problem.\n\nOne reason I mention possibilities in addition to the features that are already included is because the developer is very active and responsive. Updates have been released consistently to include bug fixes, new features, and even the implementation of user feedback. This is an Early Access title that hasn't stopped development.\n\nAnother really nice feature of this game is Steam Workshop support. You can create or have access to many buildings and characters that have been created.  By subscribing to skins on the workshop, you can have your character appear as popular figures such as SpongeBob or Link, or self-made designs, including a polar bear with a jetpack, which is my personal favorite.  The developers recently offered to export user-created buildings as they migrated to a new back-end that would allow endless worlds.

This title is an open world game, admittedly not my favorite kind of game so I had some trouble getting into it. There is no story though the developers do say one will be added to the final version of the game. Right now you have the option to play alone or go multiplayer and that’s it. However, if you’re a creative person hours can easily be spent exploring and creating things.\n\nI focused on the single player mode, I was given a world to explore and what seemed to be a mountain lion as a pet. You’re also given small quests, but they’re more like goals that try to explain how the game mechanics work. If it’s trying to be a tutorial it’s failing -it’s not very helpful. You’re thrown into the game with no instructions and must fend for yourself. You’ll notice you have to collect raw materials first but once you do you can start building but aside from the items the quests tells you about you don’t have much of a guide on what to build or how to build it nor where to collect materials.\n\nFortunately, the game mechanics are not complicated. You use your keyboard and mouse to move around, interact with objects, build and everything else you need to do. Raw materials have to be collected and then used to build things, you have a tool that “makes things useful” turning something as simple as metal bricks shaped together into a chest. You also create weapons and magic which you’ll need to fight enemies in the game, though they have terrible AI and don’t pose much of a threat. Unlike in other open world games where you might need tools like an axe everything is magic-based which I found to be an interesting element.\n\nThe graphics in the game are not bad, I liked them better than other open world games I’ve seen. Things in the game are very stiff, however. The way the environment moves, the way other characters and animals move, water the sky are all very static. The music is very forgettable, it was very basic and didn’t seem to change much, like if I was being attacked or died. Sound effects were ok but also pretty bland and there are no vocals at all in the game.\n\nThe developers of the game are working to improve and listening to the community. The game in its current state isn’t bad, especially for an early access game, but is a bit expensive. There are no achievements or trading cards at the time of this review however you can use Steam Workshop with it. Alchemist's Awakening is a work in progress but shows a lot of potential for an Early Access game, if the price seems reasonable to you and you’re a fan of this genre then I would recommend picking it up.\n\nI was supplied with this key by the developer, this however did not affect the review.","April 24","true","0.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Here is that video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEGtcXxbH2U\n\nThe game is a little rough right now in it's current state, but I believe has plenty to provide a lot of fun with some new twists on the current popularity of these open sandbox survival and crafting sort of games.  Still, I love that it feels fresh and like the developers are actually trying to create something fun and innovative with this game as opposed to all of these sort of games where it feels like just a scam or cash grab attempt.\n\nThis game is VERY playable and a LOT better then I expected going into it having not seen any other reviews or gameplay footage.  I love how you can combine and collect items to make elements. For example, you can easily collect wood from a tree, and make a windmill following the simple design, use your tool you start with to bring it to life.  At that point, it will collect the element "wind" over time and you simply need to right click your windmill at any time to collect the stored wind.  You can make an over with a block of 8 stone blocks and the same tool, then put wood into the over to create the element "fire".  After you have both wind and fire, it's very easy to combine them to create fireballs which you can use as a weapon against the plentiful wolves and ninja beasts that love to aggro you when you walk too close to them.  Use can also just use fire by itself to shoot out a flame like a blow torch as a weapon as well, but it's not as much fun as casting fireballs which explode for more damage.  Also you can use wind to fly around the world, but make sure you have plenty before to take off too far, because if you run our of wind power while flying high, you will fall to the earth and take fall damage.\n\nIf you die, you lose all your stuff on your corpse and it seems to vanish pretty quickly at the current time.  But never fear, using wood blocks in a 3 x 2 x 2 pattern and the tool will create a chest to keep all your un-needed resources safe, much like a bank box.\n\nCollect all of the elements, and you can give life to ANY creature that you decide to make out of materials.  Want a solid gold golem, no problem!  Just find enough gold metal and then all the elements to bring him to life!  Want a gigantic iron spider with 8 legs?  I haven't yet tried that yet, but it seems like it would work, and I love this about the game!  ..Super cool!\n\nI think that this game will really appeal to players who love minecraft in particular, but also to anyone who enjoys sandbox, creative kind of games.\n\nAs this game goes through development and early access, it will be intersting to see how to gets molded by the developers with feedback and suggestions from the early access players.  Will hunger be added?  What about the ability to create more items such as bombs, moving devices, etc?  I honestly think it's well worth the price tag to be a part of this game and both watch and play it as it develops.  This IS a special game, and it's nice to see these early access games like this made by developers who actually desire to make a "fun" game as the priority over trying to make a quick buck.  That is already obvious to me on day one of it's early access.  Enough said.\n\nIt's not perfect yet, but it IS fun!  It also already seems to have a heart and soul, and bringing your creations to life is very rewarding!  Add in the ability to play online with friends and you got a game well worth it's asking price.\n\nMy Score on Day #1 of early access...\n\nVALUE:  At $16 USD, regular retail price today, I believe this game offers a nice value for your money.. with procedurally generated worlds and the ability to play online, this game delivers in the value department already.  38 out of 40 for Value is my score here.\n\nFUN:  It's a very fun game, at least my first few hours, and theres so much left to do, I don't see that changing much, especially as more and more content gets added over time!  I give this game an impressive 27 out of 30 score here.\n\nCONTROLS and BUGS:  The controls are fluid and responsive, there are a few weird glitches and bugs but nothing game breaking or un-expected of a game in early access.  I give this part of my scoring a 16 out of 20 for this game.\n\nGRAPHICS & SOUND:  The graphics and sound deliver well enough to make playing the game enjoyable but not anything that will take your breath away.  Everything looks as it should, and the music and sound works with nothing either disappointing to me or mind blowing.  7 out of 10 is my score in this department.\n\nADD IT ALL UP.. AND I GIVE THIS GAME A SOLID 88%.  That's a damn nice score for a game like this on launch day of early access.\n\n!!! IMPORTANT - BEFORE YOU BUY !!!\n-----------------------------\nPlease check the recommended specs before you buy this.  If you have less then 8 GB of RAM, if your CPU is older then 3 years old, and/or your video card isn't a GeForce 650ti or better, you are very likely to notice laggy gameplay and slower then ideal framerates.  Please make sure your computer can handle this game before buying it.. this game requires a much beefier system then Minecraft or World of Warcraft does for example.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nImpressive stuff devs, keep up the good work, and thanks for deliverying an enjoyable game in early access, something that isn't exactly common on Steam these days with early access games.","March 21","true","3.6"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","16","26","3","1"

The tutorial starts out with you turning blocks into preset door and chest models, which by itself is not particularly spectacular, but after you experience dynamic windmill construction, where you give life to a windmill with a blade length of your choice, you'll notice that the game has some truly special potential along those lines.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=681103722\n\nIt gets even better with giving life to NPC bipeds, which can have almost any shape you want, and are animated convincingly. The true potential of the game definitely lies in detecting and uniquely animating more things than just bipeds. Tripeds, spiders, birds, fish and so on would all be wonderfully jolly additions.\n\nThe author has been quick to add in Steam Workshop support, and hopefully it will at some stage be possible for users to expand the available 'dynamic' objects/creatures. So far skins, buildings and some slight object changes are possible.\n\nMultiplayer unfortunately does not have feature parity with singleplayer and is a much buggier affair overall.\n\nWith enough development time, there's a lot of promise here. The required triumvirate is polish, content and moddability.\n\nRating:\n6.8/10\n\nPros:highly novel system of bringing objects to life\nanimating weird-looking giant statues is super fun\nSteam Workshop support in Early AccessCons:block construction in non-block world is weird by design\nNPC AI and collision need improvement\nno ingame craftable object reference\nmore content (enemies, blocks, dynamically craftable objects/buildings/creatures) needed\nnot all features available in multiplayer\nrandom world design lacks balance and a safe early zone\nworld generation still prone to 'map holes' and unrealistic terrain\nHardware Information\nHardwareTypeMonitorSamsung SyncMaster P2470SoundSennheiser HD 580 and Samson Resolv 80a SpeakersKeyboardMicrosoft Siderwinder X4ControllerMicrosoft Xbox 360 WirelessMouseLogitech G400MicrophoneKoenig Electronic CMP-MIC8MotherboardGigabyte X58A UD3RCPUi7 920 at around 4 GHzGPUGeforce GTX 670RAM12GBOSWindows 7 64-bitHDD2x 1TB RAID HDD\nA review copy of this game was provided by the developer.","May 9","true","6.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

Besides basic structures you can also create interactive objects. For example you can build an oven to burn wood and harvest fire. You can also build windmills to harvest wind, lighting rods to get electricity and so on.\nYou can make yourself a nice sword or combine fire and wind and use fireballs to fight your enemies. The best part in my opinion is that you can create life by turning a pile of rocks into a golem that will protect you and can help you mine.\n\n\nGood:\nBig open world with different islands to explore.\nGood visuals (although character animation is a bit wonky) and relaxing music.\nPlenty of building blocks in different shapes and sizes. Different interactive objects / items you can create.\nGolems!\nDay and night cycle.\nActive developer and friendly community.\nWorkshop support makes sharing skins and structures with other players easy.\nGood price point. $15.99 base price feels justified.\nBad:  No story or tutorial. Just a few quests to explain how to build basic objects.\nCombat is not rewarding since it can be easily avoided and there is no experience to gain or loot to collect (although, some enemies are guarding chests but you can get the loot and run away without fighting). I have only encountered two types of enemies. AI is virtually nonexistent. Enemies are just standing in one spot and if you get in their field of view they start running towards you in a straight line.\nLacks player base at the moment. There is rarely more than a handful of people playing on a multiplayer server (there is also a singleplayer mode).\nEven though this game has plenty of potential it is hard to recommend it at this stage of the development considering how many sandbox / crafting games are available on the market.\nIt has a decent amount of content for an early access title, but not enough to keep you engaged for more than a couple of hours. It feels empty at the moment.\nI will continue following this game and I am planning to update this review in the future.\n\nBuy it if you want to jump in early and support the developer or wait until more features are added.\n\n\nPC Specs\nHardware Type   CPU Intel Core i7 5820K 3.30GHz   GPU Nvidia GTX 970   RAM 16GB DDR3   OS Windows 10 PRO\nDisclaimer:\nA copy of the game was provided for reviewing purposes.

The ability to fly and bring creatures to life are two of the most promising features out the early access box. The game runs fairly well on a moderate system as well.\n\nThe Good:\nAlchemist's Awakening captured my interest the first instant I saw it under Upcoming games. I checked it out, looked at the screenshots, read the description and thoughts: Okay here we go again, more promise than worth. I ended up getting it day one, and the above link is my first time playing. Needless to say, I end up having allot of fun. It's not that the game is amazing; the feeling I get from this is more of awe. Rediscovering how to build in a familiar setting felt quick but unknown enough to make it entertaining. Spending more time with the game after making my video, I learned about the flying/life creation/biomes.\nI feel like I could see multiplayer being played very diversely. It can be a PvP fest, or just a community thing. Arena based golem fighting?\nThe soundtrack is stunning, and was instantly impressive.\nThe life creation process is fun, and is without a doubt one of the big activities to do. You can make massive creatures, but more often than not, you will probably make some sort of abomination.\n\nCons:\nSome things are clearly implemented that really shine the early access polish. The combat being one of my yellow flags. It's not terrible, just very much a placeholder until it's improved upoin.\nOn the theme of combat, after looting several chests found with the enemies, I had about 8 fire or ice swords.\nIt seems that you face two enemies, wolves and bandits. Like I said, combat seems to be recently added, and not fleshed out. Nothing wrong with that though.\nNot all sound effects are as pretty as the music.\nAI is still a funny thing to watch, but is being improved on.\n_______\n\nI'll be sure to update and add more as development continues!","March 22","true","14.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It got a beautiful big world to explore, althought I would have liked to see some mini-map to help me navigate this big world. Also the thing I miss the most was a tutorial of some sort, I found it lacking direction at the start. Once I got use to the controls and started to go around, I did enjoy it, it is still a very early access so there's not that much to do at the moment, but I really think that it got a lot of potential.\n\nI liked the fact that Steam workshop is already implemented, it makes creating that much more fun as you can share your creations and upload other player's creation to your world. Also the dev is very active in the community, so I have great hopes of seeing the game progress well, he listen to suggestion and is quick to fix bugs and such. That's always very positive for a game.\n\nThe multiplayer doesn't have that many players at the moment but I thinks once it's more complete it will be a great survival/crafting game.\n\nI would recommend it for people who really like to be part of the creating process of the game as it is still very much in early access, but already I can see the bare bones of a great game. I give it 6/10 only because there is several things that I would like to see implemented but the I will update my review when the game is updated, as I said before I have high hopes for this game and the dev hasen't disappointed me yet. He has been on top of every problem the community brings to him and has done frequent update to the game, so I'm not worry about the future of this game\n\n\nDisclaimer: I have been provided a key by Osaris Games for review purposes.

If you have played other games of its kind such as ARK: Survival Evolved, you will completely understand how this game works. You run around collecting material by breaking down objects found in your natural environment in an effort to craft items, while making sure that you won't die to any seen or unseen enemies.\n\nWhat sets this game apart from its other competitors is with the use of elements, as a crafting material and as a weapon, and the unique ability to "give life" to your creation. This "give life" tool will actually create an AI companion that can do menial tasks for you, or follow you around as a goofy sidekick.\n\n==== Current State of the Game ====Pros:Elements as a crafting material/weapon.\n"Give life" tool.\nSoothing music.\nCons:Not too much to do atm (Story Mode to be added in the future).\nAverage quality texture assets/graphics.\nSuggestions:An overlay HUD, especially for Quest tasks/Inventory #'s.\nSprinting.\nFriendly introductory tutorial/emphasis on building a weapon first.\n==== Early Access ====For those that are not aware of the Early Access concept, it is perfectly acceptable for bugs to be present (none observed) and game mechanics to be missing. With that in mind, I can at least say that I have enjoyed what I've played so far, and hope to see more people get a jump on Alchemist's Awakening!\n\n==== Hardware Information ====HardwareTypeMonitor720p 32 LED TVControllerDS3 (M&K used for this review)MotherboardASRock Z97M AnniversaryCPUi5-4590GPURadeon R9 290XRAM8 GBOSWindows 7\n==== Disclaimer ====A copy of this game was provided by the developer: Osaris Games; however, this did not bias my review in any form.","April 3","true","1.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There is no recipe list because you need to create a form with blocks and materials and then apply some weird spell to see if that shape can create something useful.\n\nFor example, creating a rectangular form with 6 blocks at the floor let's you make a chest. If you try to form that shape vertical, it creates another thing (or not, but those are different shapes and make different 'recipes') Another example is creating a vertical rectangular form of 8 blocks, and that makes a door (spoiler, spoiler :P)\n\nYou can also give life to your creations using a combination of all elements and materials in the world (there are 9 elements/materials to use) This is probably what makes this game different from others open-survival-crafting games. Creating a tall wood protector or a stone golem is possible here, and you can of course try different combinations and make your friend a mix of stone, fire and crystal, if you want.\n\nThe weak point of this, and where it shows that it's still in development is the combat. For now, there are 2 types of enemies: wolfs and dark tall warriors with a big sword. While you can use the elements to create spells (like a fireball, for example or a lightning), the melee combat needs a lot of work. And also, the animations. For now it works and you can also kill a wolf with a sword, but it feels very basic.\n\nI hope they will also work a little more the AI of enemies and your 'friends', because right now they seem to like to get stuck usually with just a few rocks and you need to go back to 'help' them gathering those rocks.\n\nAnother point is that, right now, 'survival' just means avoid being killed by one of those wolfs or warriors. There is no hunger, or thirst.\n\nGiven another. mmm... not very good examples of early access that are also survival, open world and which also have crafting, this one looks, plays and feels like a very solid base for adding more content and features.\n\nOh, and i haven't found any bugs until now.\n\nActual content and gameplay: enough to start a new world and to play at least for a few hours collecting all materials, creating a house and needed tools/machines (oven, windmill,m lighting rod for auto-collecting elements) and a few golem friends to crush all in your way.\n\nNot going to talk about potential because i don't know and i don't like. For now, this is a solid game that, of course, is in development and needs more love, but it's already better than a lot others and in some cases, it's even cheaper so i think it worths the 15 dollars/euros or whatever right now.\n\nAnd as a picture is worth a thousand words, here's my house with my friends Patata and Willy xD:\n\n[img]http://prnt.sc/aimall[/img]\n\nP.S: if someone knows how to show the image instead of the link, please feel free to leave me a message in comments :P","March 22","true","2.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","4"

At this Early Access stage though it is just a shell - a storyless sandbox game.\n\nIt feels more robust than many sandbox games, and the features being released feel well-rounded prior to a Steam update.\n\nGraphically pleasing, with such a small install size, the game is intriguing from the initial opening. Single player starts out with a tutorial and, while it lacks some direction and clarity, it sets the player up with basic controls and movements to begin crafting. Next comes resource collecting, exploring and contending with (fairly easy) enemies which, while fun at first, can become a little monotonous before long. I would expect more distractions and quests to be added in due course however.\n\nThere's also an online multiplayer mode. Not much to it currently other than the ability to combine the Single Player experience with other players on one server to show of your creations.\n\n+ Size and variety of procedurally generated world\n+ Community potential with solid Workshop integration\n+ Great and frequent developer support\n+ Visuals are pretty good\n\n~ Occasional crashes and bugs - but much less than many other early access games\n~ Price. £11.99 is quite steep for what it is - but it could eventally live up to that price\n\n- Enemy AI is quite poor, making battles pretty boring and monotonous\n- Gameplay is lacking, and without a definitive story or survival experience, the game will be lost in a sea of great competition\n\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Osaris Games","April 4","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is a very unique crafting/fantasy/exploration/survival game that stand apart from the others.\n\nThe most memorable element of Alchemist's Awakening is the crafting system. Being able to choose which elements you want to combine to create different items and blocks is a lot more fun and a lot less frustrating than trying to figure out "recipes" by placing things on a crafting table in different patterns. The addition of elements (wind, fire, etc.) to the crafting materials makes it very easy to have logical crafting formulas.

Very relaxing and fitting to the game, although it could use a bit more variety.\nSteam Workshop capabilities make it easy to share character and building designs.\nCons:  The tutorial needs a lot of work before I would even consider it to be "lacking" some kind of blueprints for placing blocks or pictures or something similar would make the tutorial much more helpful.\nOwnership needs to be improved. While you can claim an area using your totem, you cannot lock chests or doors in that area to protect your possessions.\nQuests not implemented beyond basic single-player-only "tutorial" Just the addition of basic "gather X of this element" quests would be really nice.\nAI needs lots of work.

Unfortunately my play time with it was limited because for the life of me I could not figure out how to create a windmill to pass the second quest. Unless I missed something. the game seems to be lacking the proper tool tips or a more extensive tutorial on what resources are needed to craft various items.

There are a few bugs here and there, but so far I haven't seen anything game-breaking that would negatively impact gameplay. The skin-creation system is pretty fun and allows for some fun designs. The crafting system also seems pretty unique. You can craft some items and blocks using materials in your inventory, or you can set down blocks in certain patterns and turn it into furniture with some alchemy magic.\n\nThe reason I'm hesitant to recommend the game is just the lack of things to do. There's a quest system that shows you the ropes, but there's only 5-6 quests. So far, I've just explored the world for an hour or so and collected materials. I haven't seen anything to actually do aside from that. It really just feels like another Minecraft clone at this point with a magical twist.\n\nAs of right now, I'd say buy at your own risk. You may be able to play for hours on end, or you may get bored within a few hours. I'd wait out the game a bit longer to see what people have to say about some of the features that get implemented later down the line.

Although AA is in early access at the time of this review, I found no major problems that impaired my game-play. While there were a few minor bugs that I found irritating (which will be mentioned below for those interested), I'm sure these will be fixed, or addressed in future updates in order of importance. When playing AA, I was pleasantly surprised to find a simple 'quest system' that acted as a tutorial. I'm sure that once the game leaves early access the story mode will make this point irrelevant, but this current tutorial system shows the player how to get accustomed to the basics (building, magic, and harvesting) without being too annoying. Within 10 minutes of playing the game, I had already understood most of the game's mechanics without having to use the internet for assistance (except for harvesting ice magic, which I had later found out after exploring by myself). AA features a large an expansive world with somewhat realistic graphics that I found to be quite enjoyable during my play-through, and an even greater soundtrack that I hope will have more tracks as the game develops. For an EA title, AA stands high among the crowd in terms of presentation.\n\nHowever I found that the game-play of AA was severely lacking due to the amount of content currently available. After spending about an hour with the game and learning all of the mechanics that the game had to offer I realized that survival mode offer I realized that survival mode offers little for the player to accomplish. The combat within the game is lacking as there is currently no method of blocking, meaning that the player usually has to take damage in order to cause damage and resort to cowardly tactics when facing large groups of enemies. Once the player finds a suitable weapon in one of the many chests hidden in the over-world they become overpowered and decimate enemies in a few blows, making combat more bothersome than enjoyable. Aside from the constant beating of enemies around the island, there's not much to look forward. Different structures cover the island that begin to look all too familiar once you realize that they serve nothing more than an aesthetic purpose. Chests often contain identical or similar items, which lowered my expectations and resulted in a loss of interest in exploration altogether. I had then switched over to Classic mode and enjoyed the building aspect there, however this is a common feature of most sandbox games and was only used to create items for the steam workshop.\n\nCurrently, the EA version of AA gives good representation as to what we can expect from its full release, a demo if you will. The graphics, sound, and absence of bugs shows that the current state of AA is already far beyond what many other developers would call 'Early Access'. With it's mechanics firmly established it begs for complexity to be added in further updates, allowing for the content that the game needs to become a true competitor among other sandbox games and a worthy game in anybody's library.\n\nRating:\n7.4/10\n\nPros:\nGreat graphics and a wonderful soundtrack.\nMechanics were easy to learn and remember, with simple crafting built in to take advantage of in later updates\nVast open world for exploration.\nSurvival, Classic, and Multiplayer modes are present and working, with story mode coming in the full release\nCons:Little content as of early access, which leaves the player with few enemies, few items to collect, and few reasons to explore.\nHardware Information\nHardwareTypeMonitorPhilipsTrueColor3000TVHeadphonesGradoSi80KeyboardMicrosoftBasicKeyboard10AControllerSteamControllerMouseRazerNaga2014MicrophonecheapbrandNAMotherboardMotherboardCPUAMDFX4170Quad-CoreProcessor420GHzGPUGeForceGTX560SERAM4GBx2CorsairVengenceOSWindows7SP1Ubuntu14HDDSeagateBarracudaST1000DM0031TB7200RPM\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Osaris Games","March 23","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

You play as an alchemist, which means that the game main feature is the ability to use magic. This is done by harvesting resources such as wind, electricity, as well as stones and trees. Then you can take these elements and transmute them into other more sophisticated materials, as well as create powerful and very cool spells to use.\n\nPros:\n+Spells look and function great. The ability to fly is just fantastic and this game makes you feel like a badass in a way similar to Saints Row IV.\n+Animating creatures is really awesome! Getting to give life to a build you make is something that is really unique and lets this game stand out.\n+PvP is fun and makes the game have more replayability online, however I believe it could still be improved. For example, it would be really cool if the owners of a sever could enable/disable PvP in certain areas similar to what Minecraft plugins allow for, in order to allow new players to start exploring without being slaughtered or restricting players to only fight within an arena.\n+You can protect your builds with an ingame block that claims a 16x16 radius. This is pretty cool as a lot of other survival games dont include this by default. It also includes a cool Metal Chest which allows for rudimentary chest protection.\n+Steam Workshop support\n+ Environments look really nice. Multiple biomes help to create a more immersive experience.\n+Custom skins are cool and fuction well.\n+Mac support is very much appreciated!\n\nCons:\n-Repetitiveness and Lack of Singleplayer endgame content are really what hinder this game. This could easily be fixed in the future, but at the moment the ingame "quests" only last about an hour, after which the game becomes pretty boring unless you're playing multiplayer. A few dungeons or bosses within the game would go a long way in terms of replayability.\n-Shallow combat system and very few different enemies to fight.\n-Steam trading cards and achievements would also be a welcome addition in the future, though the game is in such early access that this is not a huge drawback.\n-Not very well optimized. While my PC is not great to begin with, lag has been a common complaint among many people, many of whom have far better computers than I.\n-The price of $15.99 is far too high for a game as incomplete as this.\n\n\nOverall, Alchemist's Awakening is a decent foundation for what could turn out to be an awesome game in the future. What really saves this game from falling into the garbage bin of most early access voxel based survival games is a unique and satisfying multiplayer experience as well as an extemely active, friendly developer who puts out constant updates for the game. I believe as more updates are released in the future, this game will only get better.\n\nVisGaming Rating 7/10\nWhile the game is far from finished in its current state, which may be reason enough for many to hold off on buying Alchemist's Awakening until later, I really stress that this game will only improve in the future, and will be something I certainly look foward to go back and reassess in future updates.\n\nA free game key has been provided by Osaris Games for review.

You start of as a boy with a lion on a island, you collect materials via magic. You craft shapes that turn into items such as chests, ovens, windmills etc. With these items you craft, you can harness elements to build items and used for attacks. You can also give life to objects you make, like golems and such to do you bidding. However, there is a lack of tutorial and I have no clue how to command them. The combat in the game is kinda lacking but is going in the right direction. You craft elements, and use them to either build or attack, you can also mix and make different spells. You lion also attacks anything hostile, however I've only encountered two types of enemies.\n\nThe game is decent, it needs fair amount of work. The game, is playable and enjoyable. However there is a lack of tutorial. After you build the first few structures and give life to your first golem, the game doesn't really tell you what to do with them.

So instead of building with blocks, you are using nine elements. This is probably enough to differentiate itself from other sandbox/crafting games.\n\nEarly on in the game, you'll see that the AI enemies, mostly the wolves, would guard areas that have necessary materials. They don't do much damage, but it is a bit time-consuming to deal with them. And since you probably won't die from them, they feel (at least for me) irrelevant.\n\nThe tutorial is currently sort of lacking and a bit confusing. I'll give an example: In order to continue the tutorial I needed to combine all the elements to create life, but I was missing Frost and Sand. My problem was I had no idea how or where to get them, but luckily it was mentioned in the forums by the dev.\n\nPros: Unique crafting system, with ability to mix elements.\nLots of items can be made, with many sizes and shapes.\nThe generated world is decent.\nYou can bring life to human-shaped objects.\nNo game breaking bugs\nMixed: The music is pretty relaxing, but during combat it feels out of place.\nNot much freedom in the menu options.\nCons: Combat somehow feels out of place. (Maybe make AI optional?)\nThe tutorial needs more polish and could be more detailed.\nUnless you recognize the landmarks, it is hard to find your way around, since there's currently no map.\nFinal Comment and Rating:Although I don't recommend you purchasing it right now, I highly suggest wishlisting it for when it's out of Early Access, or when you're feeling esspecially creative.\n3/5\n\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor ASUSZ87-PROSocket-1150   Headphones QPADQH-90   Keyboard CMStormQuickFireTKKeyboard   Controller -   Mouse LogitechG9x   Motherboard ASUSZ87-PROSocket-1150   CPU IntelCoreI5-4670K34GHz   GPU EVGAGeForceGTX7702GBPhysXCUDA   RAM CrucialDDR3BallistiXTactical16GB1600MHz   OS Windows7Ultimate   HDD WDDesktopGreen2TB600MBps123MBps\nDisclaimer:\nPlayed during Early Access with a review copy.\nSource of consideration: Osaris Games","April 3","false","5.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imamangafreak/recommended/431450/","imamangafreak","imamangafreak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imamangafreak/","374 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReceived a review key from the developer\n\nReview Written on Saturday, April 2nd 2016\n\nReview\nWhile playing Alchemist's Awakening, I couldn't help compare it to Minecraft. They're both survival/crafting indie games with an option to turn off the aggressive mobs and opt for a more casual creative mode experience. Unlike Minecraft however, AA is set in a fantasy setting so instead of zombies and spiders you get Black Knights and lions and wolves (although Minecraft has wolves too). It's also more realistic compared to Minecraft's literal blocks so the creative folks will have more choice in designing their perfect base.\n\nThe crafting system is something that is interesting in this game but at the same time very frustrating. I understand what the game is trying to do. You are an alchemist and you collect the basic elements of the world using magic and can convert simpler materials to more complex ones and vice versa. (Ex. Iron to Gold) There are many different elements to wield, such as earth, fire, wind, water, lightning, metal, stone, et cetera. You can collect those elements in different ways and later achieve powerful magic and complex buildings. Since you're constantly transforming elements to fit your needs, I understand why you need a "stamina bar" to pick up things. It's not really a stamina bar, it's a mana bar. The reason why you can't just pick up that log piece is because it's attached to the entire log. You're using alchemy to mold that log to a more moldable small log piece. After all, it wouldn't make sense for you to break off a small piece of log with your bare hands. However just because I understand why the mana bar is needed doesn't make it any less annoying when I run out of magic, and I have to just stand there waiting for the bar to restore itself completely before collecting more resources. It might make more sense, but it doesn't make it fun to play. There has to be a balance between realistic gameplay and fun gameplay, even in a fantasy game about alchemy.\n\nThe crafting menu is also very confusing to use. If you play around with it long enough you'll kind of get how it works. You click on the element and get small menu of all the things you can craft with that element. And then you can use a alchemy tool to transform a specific shape of blocks into a useful object like stoves and windmills. But it needs to be more clearer about the things you can make. I made a sword once and I have no idea how to make it again. This is probably just me being dumb, but it wouldn't hurt to revamp the crafting menu to make it clearer for people like me.\n\nRight now I cannot recommend the game at it's current build. The alchemy transmutation aspect to the survival/crafting genre is a nice twist, but other than that it doesn't really set itself from the genre. I do think that the game has a lot of promise, but this is in the future after more updates are made into adding features to the game. Currently you should not buy this game unless you want to support the developer and actively look for bugs and ways to improve the game.\n\nRating\n5/10\n\nPros:\n-Nice music- more music will likely be added\n-Decent graphics- They're not amazing, but this game is very early access and I've seen ♥♥♥♥♥ier graphics on completed or longer-developed early-access games. I imagine the graphics will improve as the game is further developed.\n-Interesting concept and twist added to the survival/crafting genre\n-A decent number of different items you can use to craft and build with\n-Developer is very responsive and pushing updates frequently\n-Would be fun to build things in Creative mode, I've already seen some people make some cool stuff in the Steam Workshop\n-game runs relatively well\n\nCons:\n-Game is in early early-access-> content has not been added yet making the game lacking in things to do.\n-glitchy animals (early-access: will be fixed in future)\n-unintuitive and confusing crafting menu\n-need more directions on what controls do what\n\nDisclaimer:  Source of consideration: Osaris Games","April 1","false","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Your journey is of your own making as you explore the different biomes around you, forest, snow, and desert to start with, each offer their own unique landscapes and resources to gather.\nMaking your way through this beautiful world is a joy as you quickly learn to build windmills to harness the power of wind and glide atop the air itself as you fly low through the forest tips or high above seeing the tiny players gathering and building their own homes for all to see and visit but be wary of new faces as you never know if they come as friend of foe in this pvp system is very active.\n\nPros:\n\n- The beautiful nature of the surroundings make going out to collect resources an utter joy as you will find hours spent just flying overhead looking off into the distance beyond.\n-The building systems are very well done and make placing blocks or other building materials quite easy and very intuitive.\n- It’s not uncommon to see Osiris games pop into the server and interacting with the community and listening to what they have to say. (This has to be one of the coolest things as it allows you the player to get direct access to those who can fix bugs or take the game in a different direction, (who knows maybe your idea will make it into the final product)\n- The devs seem to be very much on top of issues of bugs that arise in the game.\n\nCons:\n\n-The game is still in early access and isn’t completely done so bugs are bound to spring up and there are a number of them at the moment, some of which I will cover below in more detail. (Keep in mind this will change with every passing update and the devs seem very much on top of them for the most part)\n- Loading screens, these have in the past been the bane of all old school gamer’s as those of us who remember the Sega CD and the hours spent looking at a loading screen just drooling for that next level will recall, and can’t say I’m all to happy to see them return in this game as it quite literally will stop you in your tracks as the screen turns black with loading written upon it, but to make it better or worse depending on your view, the game itself keeps running behind it, you can fly, attack or more likely get attack, drown and die (losing all your resources you have collected on your jaunt out into the world.)\n\nIn conclusion a great game with a lot of really cool aspect and hours of fun to keep you coming back for more, but being in early access and a number of bugs that still need to be worked out before its up and running for the masses It does hinder its score a bit, this of course will change as time goes on, but I would still recommend this game to those looking for an open world builder as it fits the bill and I have no doubt will be amazing when finished.\n3 out of 5 for now, will revise as time goes on.\nAC-Gamer\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTyGAG_geVh7jDJJ0J8s3kMOCVsirM6na\nhttps://youtu.be/i-f02W-PyTk\nhttps://youtu.be/UQONA1UcXQk","March 26","true","19.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

All the right elements are there, but alas, this is an early access game and, as such, don't expect a finished product just yet. If you are the creative type, then the game is already ready for you and you can jump right in. Otherwise, it might be good to wait until the story is there.\n\nAs I said, the game is playable, but there are still a lot of things that need to be polished. Animations in third person are quite stiff, there is a lot of clipping, the tutorial isnt very helpful and the story is not yet implemented. Not sure if I should mention sharks swimming on land, but that was so hilarious that it should be a feature, not a bug!\n\nOn the bright side, the game looks beautiful, the overall feeling of the game is interesting storywise, the music is nice and fitting, the models and textures are well done, there is a huge variety of materials and almost everything is customizable. If "Creative Mode" appeals to you, then this game may be perfect for you right now, otherwise I'd wait a bit still.\n\nRating:\n6.5/10\n\nPros:\nBeautiful looking game\nFitting music\nGreat freedom for creative players\nCons:  Still needs some polishing\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Osaris Games","March 30","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And how to make them emply them into your world. but its still worke in progrress, so.. :)\n\nThe items that you can creat is allmost endless, as long as you know how to do it ;)\nand that  makes this game pretty neat.\nMarc!

This game is on its early stages and has huge potential. My rating may seem low but I rate what I get at the moment and I believe that I will change it to a higher value after some major updates. (and hopefully before official launch) I hate to see games go down because of bad launch timing with incomplete content. So I will keep this game installed and replay with each update for sure.\nFrankly it is more of an “engine” than a “game” with its current state. There is no story, there is no challenge and there is no real “multiplayer value” at the moment. Basically you learn how to play, the mechanics and the interface after that you explore the world you create but then start to get bored sooner or later. (There is a huge improvement window for the tutorial and the interface which I think the devs are already aware of)\nI feel that I should stress this out once more. As long as you have the correct expectations and know what you are buying it is good game for its value. But you have to believe in the developer and give some time for it. (which I do btw)\nMicro management on some level will be a nice feature for this game which is missing at the moment. (Like health,hunger,item levels and etc.)\nThe music is very nice as a background score. It makes good company while you wander around. A couple of additional tunes will be helpful for the official release.\nI experience some hangs/halts during my play but I expect that from an early access games so I am ok with that.

Graphic wise it is pretty good and playable with my 660Ti GPU. Normally I don't play this kind of game, but wanted to give it a chance to find out what the fuzz is about these kind of open world sandbox games is. So the idea for this game seems you have free choice to craft item, and build structures. Quite interesting if you like to build small, or large structures.\n\nI played in the single player mode, in the single player mode there are quests, which I guess are there to teach you about this game. Each quest I tried so far ask me to build an item, which requires a number of item. It is one way to teach you the game mechanic, but I would have preferred a tutorial instead.\n\nOne thing which I did not like was the mana which seems to be there only to hinder me from playing the game faster, since when I was out of mana I had to wait for it to replenish which was a lot of wasted time for I felt. It would be better if it was removed, since the only reason for it to be there seems to stop me to play for a while. Since I mentioned about tutorial before I can complain about this also. The small cat-like animal which follows me around, I did not understand it was my pet first, so once again if there were a tutorial these unclear thing could have been understood.\n\nRating:\n5.5/10\n\nPros:\nNice graphic, and incredible large world. Lots to explore\nUnique way to craft item which I havent seen before\nCons:Tutorial is somewhat lacking, requires that you have played other similar sandbox game before to understand some fundament mechanic\nMana is somewhat limiting the speed for building.\nPet AI somewhat lacking, it can run around in circles before attacking the enemy\nHardware Information\nHardwareTypeMonitor24HeadphonesHeadphonesKeyboardRazor black widowControllerxbox360 gamepadMouselogitech g602MicrophoneMicrophoneMotherboardasrock xtreme3CPUi5GPU660tiRAM24gb dd3OSwin10HDDHDD\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Osaris Games","May 3","false","1.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

So if I were to like a game from either of those genres they’d have to blow me away, Alchemist’s Awakening didn’t do it.\n\nThis game has a good base to build on; it’s got plenty of crafting materials and a system for combining them to create new things, both inanimate and living. It’s got a working multiplayer in an early access game which is always a nice bonus. The game’s engine is not bad, the environment looks nice and uses what seems to be a blooming effect for the lighting, doesn’t tear or cause a noticeable number of issues. But the character models for animals, enemies and other players could use some work. The animations for enemies in combat are not very good and the combat is clunky, but let’s be honest even in big games like H1Z1 the combat is quite terrible and I suppose that’s the standard these days. The game has one more feature, which is the skin editing page, where you can create a skin and quite easily put it up on steam workshop, you can also create a structure. A very nice feature and again, having something like workshop integration already available in an early access game is a nice bonus. You use the same materials you have in the game for your skin models, and after you’ve crafted it the editor automatically decides where your arms legs and head go and animates the model, then you simply need to save it and upload it on the workshop with a couple of mouse clicks (you'll need to do more on steam than you need to do in the game at this point, so the game workshop integration is very user friendly despite being somewhat basic). Of course like I said earlier the character models in the game could use some improvements and that reflects on the editor. But otherwise the editor is perfectly functional - albeit little blocky - considering the game itself is not using a blocky engine, it clashes a little.\n\nThe game issues that I’ve run into so far have been some camera wobbliness, and a tendency to zoom out then back in when I start moving from a standing position, which makes me uncomfortable walking up and down hills, it doesn’t exactly cause motion sickness or anything that extreme, but it causes discomfort. The soundtrack on the game is rather serene and feels a little like ASMR vids, which I suppose is fine of itself, but I do not know if it’s always fitting the game, I mean listening to relaxing nature music when hitting a wolf with my bare fists seems rather odd.\nSetting up your skills and materials on the hud is very simple, you just press E and click on the items you want to have in the hud, you can then change between them with the numbers at the top of your keyboard, not sure how to select that 14th item you put up there though.\n\nThe Life creation mechanic in the game in the game will give you some very interesting results, I feel like trying it on everything I come across just once to see what happens. Want a tree golem? Why not try it? That chest is just sitting there empty and not doing anything? Turn it into a handsome bodyguard with gilded hinges!\n\nSo all n’ all the game runs ok, does not crash often (I experienced crashes when posting stuff on workshop, then minimizing the game or alt tabbing while doing the workshop stuff, simply can’t get back to the game if I do that). The character models need some work, and the camera motion and perspective wobbliness get tiresome. Altogether the game did not intrigue me enough to change my views on sandbox and crafting games, and with a price tag of 15$ I’m not sure I can recommend the game at its current state. But as it has a few interesting ideas in it, a decent engine, support for multiplayer and steam workshop, with a few tweaks  and fixes I’m sure the game will interest quite a few people in the future.\n\nPros: Interesting mechanics for creating living creatures\nPlenty of space to roam collect materials and build your home\nWorkshop support\nA decent engine for the environment\nRuns smoothly, pretty stable for an EA title - a nearly completed product\nMultiplayer is fun\nCons: Character models could use some tweaking\nCombat doesn't have that oomph you'd expect of it, it's clunky and stale\nCamera and perspective change need to be stabilized and cleaned up\nSoundtrack seems a little static and detached (between my getting this game and the review the game had a slight improvement in the sound effects department unless I'm mistaken, so I'm guessing this will be improved in the future)\nSome clashing in the character models and the environment\nAI needs some tweaking\nThe price tag\n6.5/10  The game is headed in the right direction, but not quite at its destination.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=654521235","March 27","false","2.5"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","12","30","2","2"

Not much to do at all at the moment and AI seems to be none-existant. There are steam workshop that many other programer and sandbox builder can add a lot things to this game.\nThis game is similar in style to games like Minecraft and the like, which is fun if you like building stuff.

There is much more in the game multiplayer, survival, skin crafting, modding but im all about the architectual side of it. Modding your architecture is great i cant wait to see some great structures that you can subscribe, load on your map move anywhere you want and place. yes place it anywhere high, low, rotate it. Mods=skins, giant structures, trees, buildings, and much more. Walk through and check out there constructions modify the building you download, make towns, invite friends to your towns, cities, terrofom land, change material of land make your own trees. Make Pixal Art. Make a mod of your design and publish it and see if your structure can be the most popular in Alchemists Awakening.
