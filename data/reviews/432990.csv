"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/432990/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Green Game: TimeSwapper is iFun4All’s second game on Steam following the December, 2015 release of Red Game Without a Great Name. This title has also been released onto PS Vita, Android, iOS and is one of those rare games that is suitable for all of the platforms that it is on. The game is pretty simplistic to learn the basics of but features some very complex and well designed puzzles that will be certain to be the bane of your existence if you allow yourself to be suckered in by its charm.\n\nThe charm is in the presentation. The music is fantastic and is among my favorite soundtracks in an indie game this year. The soul jazz soundtrack really does the job of establishing the mood and the atmosphere for the game but at the same time reminds me of television shows from when I was a child (1980’s) and prior. It’s sweet sound is melodic and a natural fit for a game that I think attempts to be the ideal chill out indie game that you can relax to and complete a few levels after work. The green graphics are suitable for the game as well and again add atmosphere to the game.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are simple. I used my controller to play the game – I believe that is the best way to play the game – and you dial the use the time switches in order to set the smoke which pushes your mechanical bird in the direction it is blowing – if you decide to allow it to steam – otherwise the bird will keep flying in the direction that it is currently flying which may end with the bird flying into one of the deadly traps on each level. It sounds easy and the game begins easily enough but the challenges become increasingly difficult as the game goes on. As well as the smoke switches there are also teleportation markers on the field that will transport you from one area of the map to another. Although the game can be completed in one sitting I tend to be of the opinion that the mechanics would get a little boring.\n\nThere are fifty levels within the game with each level of varying lengths. One mistake takes you back to the start. There are also power ups within the game which all have their own special ability such as immortality. All of them have been thoughtfully considered and amount to relatively decent changes in the game play when you unlock them. The value proposition has been considered with the game hitting its mark nicely at the current US$4.99 mark.\n\nThere are  fifteen total Steam achievements within the game and the game has a 5-card set of trading cards. Neither are listed on the Steam page which is something that I hope the developers rectify as it is undoubtedly a way that they can garner more purchases without it costing them a cent and they’ve already done the work.\n\nI enjoyed my time with the game and I can certainly recommend it for arcade indie fans who are seeking a relaxing challenge.","May 2","true","6.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Or to play a series of twisted experiments with a cute critter that can fly. Green Game: Time Swapper takes players into a world where they can indirectly control the environment through the fragment of time that allows certain elements to change. This, in turn, allows a flying bird to escape a number of traps and it’s up to you to make sure it flies safely to the exit.\n\nThe flying bird cannot be controlled and moves in a single direction, unless made to do otherwise. You can change his trajectory by using various placements in the level and often these are controlled by the aspect of time. The player can control time by moving a dial from the left to the right of the screen; this changes certain aspects of the game world, from bringing machines to life that can push the bird in another direction, to huge obstacles that can, and probably will, kill that poor bird.\n\nIt’s a solid and rather dynamic concept for a puzzle game, where the environment reacts to your positioning of the dial. You must attune the dial to different positions at the right time, planning ahead of the bird’s movements and all within an extremely short amount of time. It’s clever as it tests your lateral thinking and reflexes.\n\nGreen Game: Time Swapper offers a good challenge with a simple design and mechanics that are easy to learn and remember. The game presents some nifty visuals with a mixture of silhouettes and surrealist colouring.\n\nThe overall challenge in the later parts of the game become a drag as the game fails to introduce enough new elements and even misuses some, such as power-ups that slow the bird down which are often placed in the right places while others just seem needless. They’re either too close together or are strangely absent when they could be needed most. The game never really delivers new challenges or ups the ante to make a bold spectacle.\n\nThe complexities of some levels become an annoyance when having to replay them over and over again due to its trial and error format of design. This isn’t helped when certain elements that alter the game feel a little buggy or too sensitive to the constant shifting of time. The trajectory of objects that push the bird in a different direction are difficult to judge and if you move them the slightest when the bird is close enough his flight pattern will reset and ruin your planned route.\n\nThe soundtrack is also rather irritating with little variation and just plain generic sounding. Not great to hear looping over when you have to repeat a level several times.\n\nGreen Game: Time Swapper is a stimulating and solid puzzle game with nice visuals and a dynamic mechanic. Yet it lacks any variation in structure for its puzzles/levels and becomes a short-lived affair when you start to see that the game becomes too repetitive without introducing other interesting elements. It can be fun and rather challenging, but sadly not fulfilling enough to ensure a healthy playtime.\n\n+Simple yet enjoyable puzzle elements\n+ Neat time control mechanic works well with the game's design\n+ Nice visuals\n\n- Becomes very repetitive around the half way point\n- Certain puzzles drag on too long\n- The soundtrack is rather annoying","April 12","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

On the way try to catch gears to complete each level in 100%. The difficulty increases gradually, with a good learning curve. Some levels are really challenging! Trial and error, to get perfect way! And believe: you will die. Many times! There is even a counter of dies. And all of this is fun.\n\nThe art is competent and consistent. It is made in vector style with a depth made by overlapping planes. The first plane, characters and level elements are in black, the background is a little more colorful. The animation is simple but proper, like are that vector animations.\n\nThe music is the higher point! Songs of soul/jazz like the great compositions of the 70’s and 80’s. It’s really nice, exciting. It does make to play again and again. The sound effects are simple like design and proper too.\n\nThe controls are simple with a flashlight that determines the state and positions of gadgets. This too determines the “timeswap” but, in my opinion, this is very subtle. In the beginning, I can hardly tell. And I don’t like the controls, that they are more suitable in tablets and smartphones (or in your touchscreen pc).  Even though we can choose between mouse, arrows in keyboard or gamepad (the best one!) .\nWell, actually the controls don’t hinder the game. It’s funny and defiant.\n\nArt: 8/10                 Sound: 8/10              Gameplay: 7/10            Fun:  8/10\n","May 13","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
