Something you play for a half hour to kill some time. Sadly, it's very light on features, almost feeling like a demo for a full featured game. But for under $2.00 I *really* can't complain. Overall, I really enjoyed it and I hope the creators decide to make a chess game with the same aesthetics.\n\nThe Good:\n++Fun game!\n++Fantastic art style\n++Fitting classical soundtrack\n+Narrator is quite entertaining\n+Local Multiplayer\n+Steam Cards\n\nThe Bad:\n-No online play\n-Story mode is short (about 20 minutes; I guess you can think of it as a tutorial)\n-Lack of game modes\n\nThe Ugly (which hopefully get patched) :\n---Questionable AI (Dumb moves, or the AI just repeats the same two moves over and over, really dragging down the flow of the game)\n---Game breaking glitches, requiring game restart\n---Inability to use Steam overlay or take screenshots","June 10, 2015","true","2.8"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

I am not going to try to explain them in detail here, it would be a waste of your time but if you are a fan of games like GO, Chess and Checkers you will be on familiar ground.  If you are not a checkers pro, fear not; there is a quick tutorial game that teaches everything you need to know about the rules in about three moves.\n\nThroughout the Story mode you play as both the Fox and the Flock.   Each round is tied together by voice acted narrative poetry.  Which is good, the voice acting and poetry, both.   The Story is to-the-point but interesting, not that it takes much to push an hour of gameplay.  The Music is excellent, as it is time-appropriate Classical that really sets the mood.  The orchestrated score contrasts nicely with the subtle blood stains that accumulate each time a fox eats (jumps) a member of the Flock.  The simple hand drawn art style also lends well to the overall Ball-Room Era theme of F&F.  It really looks like you are playing the game on the page of an old weathered book or something of the like.\n\nThe real challenge is to be had in the Quick-Game mode.  The Quick Game mode is the place to go if you are looking to crank up the difficulty or play a two player match, locally.  The Story Mode was quite short, to be sure.  None the less, I found Fox and Flock rather enjoyable... and the story mode even has a twist ending... which was more than what I was expecting.  Well worth the two Dollar Price tag.","June 9, 2015","true","1.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

Anything I can fire up quickly, learn how to master, and just keep for those days when my more heavy duty games aren't keeping my interest is always something I'm willing to add to my list.\n\nI've never played the game that inspired Fox & Flock so I made sure I played close attention to the tutorial. This is a very quick game to learn and I have a special love for things that come from the 1800s so color me already interested.\n\nThe music is very relaxing and puts you in the ballroom mood while you'll be very entertained with the charming place markers of the flock and foxes. (Go foxes, uhm color me biased!)\n\nThere is a bit of a storyline during your adventures if you choose not to indulge in quick games and there is a lovely little narration with voice acting that I did enjoy. It was something that most people overlook in games like this so I enjoyed it. (Fur standing on end... Thank you for keeping in character the entire time, too. People really do overlook things like this.)\n\nThere's no flashy graphics to give you a migraine. There's no complicated keystrokes. This is a game you can unwind with and include within your big titles just to have to wind down with...of course until the AI figures out what your game is and you're left cursing at the screen. Nothing painful unless we count your self-inflicted pain when that turkey in a ballgown has blocked your path to the noms. Multiple times. Accept your fate, turkey. Just accept your fate.\n\nI guess that would be my gripe. Much like tic-tac-toe, there's more of a "let's go for deadlock" than a winning combination. There weren't too many risks the AI was willing to make in order to win, making it so difficult that I had to frequently restart...\n\nWhich leads to one HUGELY GLARING DETAIL. This game has a major bug. If dialogue fails to intiate between matches to tell you if you're foxes or flocks(es haha rhyme) or to announce who has won, you will freeze and you will not proceed. The game will not save what has happened. This has occurred a few times to me so far. Now it's not frustrating as I'm fine to replay the level. No harm, no foul! (Or should we say fowl? haha flock, haha animals, oh I'm way too tickled with this one!) But that is a little annoying so I hope that's fixed soon. This COULD deter people from downloading because if you spent a long time on a particularly difficult match, you're not going to want to replay that again.\n\nBugs aside, this game really fulfills a lot of things that I do love and I find myself selfishly saying to download the game despite the buggyness and just play through it because it really is fun to waste an hour just moving those animal pegs around.\n\nAlso, a fox does deserve a good meal, after all. How dare they look down upon the foxes? You all taste good with ketchup and ale in the end!","June 21, 2015","true","3.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","0"

This version plants the core game itself inside a dark tale rich with comedy and tragedy ~ uninvited Guests at a ball.\n\nI greatly enjoyed the production value of the game; the artwork was quite well done and the choice of baroque period music fits very well with the story..  My only minor complaint was that the perspective of the board at times makes it difficult to see where pieces are or where they are not, and it would have been nice if the board had been rotated on a slight angle to prevent this.\n\nAll in all I Highly recommend this to strategy lovers and anyone else who might appreciate something a little more casual than your typical action-oriented game.","June 14, 2015","true","8.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

There's the "tutorial", and then there's a short campaign with poetic narration; it took me half an hour to complete.\n\nIf you have no one to play with, you can challenge the AI to a quick game. Its difficulty ranges from "dolt" to "aristocrat". I played a classic game as fox, and the aristocratic AI not only happily repeats the same moves forever (which should ordinarily be a stalemate), it also did some fairly dumb mistakes in the endgame that gave a certain victory away. So there seems room for improvement.\n\nFox & Flock is a fun way to learn a classic game, and priced accordingly.

It also has the same fundamental flaw, whereas it is easy to reach a stalemate.\n\nThis video game only added a short, roughly 30-minutes, somewhat dark and baroque story mode on it.

The length of the main part of the game is to be expected, so no problems there. However, there is so little replay value even with the quick game option. No multiplayer is a glaring example. My experience with the game in both story and quick play has been to repeat the same moves repeatedly until the ai eventually makes a mistake. If the aim of the game is to win, then I find this to be the best tactic. Of course, the potential exists to not play like this, but also increases the chances of losing on the hardest difficulty.\n\nOn the topic of replayability, there is also no reason to play the game again. No achievements, no collectibles, no unlockables. The only incentive currently is steam trading cards (the reason my playtime is higher than 1h). Perhaps this will change if the developer wishes to add content to the game in the future. It's quite easy to see features being implemented such as new visual elements, new music, new gameplay modes, multiplayer, character skins, challenges and so on. Maybe one day there will be new features or options.\n\nThe aesthetics of the game are certainly interesting, including the opera style theme music. Initially, the game is quite unique, but after ten minutes the specialness of playing something different was already gone, as I found myself repeating the same combination of movements. Is a unique aesthetic enough to justify purchasing a game that will potentially last between 20-60 minutes? Despite the price, I would say it is not. The game certainly isn't bad by any means, I just don't believe that what it currently offers justifies the (admittedly low) cost of the game.\n\nP.S, I also dislike not being able to turn off music or sounds. After having the game on for 3 hours for steam trading cards (I have something of an ocd about booster pack eligibility), I now hate opera forever.","June 28, 2015","false","4.6"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

And yet, a delectable morsel to behold.\n\nIntelligent Games really outdid themselves with this game. It's simple. It's clean. It's elegant in design, aesthetics, and wonderful in music. And yet they managed to accomplish this with such minimalistic assets. This game truly goes to show just how little material and how a lot of polish can really bring out a wonderful game. That and a brilliant voice actor who narrates the game and really does bring the charm of this little puzzle to life. It isn't "innovative" per se, as the game is an adaption of a long lived game, but its style is something that is not commonly seen in video gaming: stuffy Victorian animals drawn on parchment with clean calligraphic ink strokes on dancing "Fox & Geese" board to the accompaniment of orchestral ballroom music.\n\nThe game is simple. There are two parties. The Fox and the Flock. The Fox wishes to eat the Flock. The Flock wishes to not be eaten. The Fox must cleverly snatch and kill the Flock, one by one. The Flock must either herd at the exit or corner the Fox before there are too few to resist the Fox. But the Fox is limited by wanting to remain unidentifiable by the Flock he's hunted, thus he can only attack one nearby Flock at a time provided there is room. And the Flock, with their insufferable arrogance, refuse to be caught "uncivilized" by dancing improperly, thus limiting their own movement to escape the Fox. You will alternate between the two parties, either guiding the Fox to a fat dinner before his quarry escapes or aiding the Flock in their attempt to flee their foe.\n\nIt's all very elegantly done: clean and straightforward. No gimmicks. No flash. No distractions.\n\nI do have one complaint about the game, and that it's sometimes difficult to get a fuller view of the board considering how the pieces do take up a lot of space with their art. It isn't a horrible complaint, especially as the game gives you a simplified board view off to the side, but it is something that, at times, did frustrate me.\n\nBut for the meager price of 2$? I say it was more than worth it. You can easily finish the "story mode" in an hour at most, but I think the execution of the fable was an experience that definite had me grinning as I played. It's decadent. It's cheeky. And as said before, a delectable morsel.","August 14, 2015","true","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I can't say enough good about devs who are so responsive and quick to make sure their games are working properly.

I can see great replay value in this game (VERY CLOSE TO NINE-MAN'S MORRIS IN Assasins Creed Black Flag) even after you complete the story.\n\nOverall rating: 9/10 (Only because of a bug where sometimes through the story the A.I. wouldn't move.\nGreat buy for the price; would even pay more if I could\n\nHoping for more story's and dlc to this game as well as more games from the dev's in the future.","June 9, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

I'm going with an overall thumbs down because I am not very enthusiastic about it in the end, but with the low price and its "exactly what it says on the tin" presentation makes it worth buying if you're interested and want to give it a try anyway. You don't have a lot to lose if you want to try it.\n\nActually, if you don't mind the diluted blood stains (as seen in screenshots, nothing worse) I'd even give a thumbs up recommendation as a family game, since I could see my 8 year old self having a lot of fun with it, and there's no bad language.\n\nI played through everything a few times while waiting for card drops. Here's my pros and cons:\n\nPositives:\n+ Interesting art\n+ Pretty good narration\n+ Board games are fun!\n+ Story Mode/Tutorial/Local Co-op all work\n+ Steam cards sell for a good amount (for now), you could probably break even if you sell them all.\n\nNegatives:\n-Can't skip the sloooow narration in story mode\n-Making moves is slow too\n-A little goofy, +/- depending on your tastes\n-Very little content. Fair for the price, but not a lot to do.\n-Story mode glitches sometimes and the character art freezes, annoying but not unplayable\n-No settings, I'd have liked to change the volume in-game\n-Local co-op didn't hold my interest. Kids will probably have a good time playing story and against each other.\n\nSo it wasn't engaging or very entertaining, but nothing searingly wrong with it. Maybe it could have benefitted trying to add new gameplay gimmicks, adding new types of players besides fox & flock (like letting the lion move uniquely perhaps, larger board, idk). If you think it looks cute and want to try it, I'd say go for it, support the devs. Ain't expensive.

The narration is superb, the dialogue clean and (at times) quite witty, the story was actually quite decent (with a twist even!) for a simple game, and the music was charming and relaxing. While the board and stylized characters can get a bit muddled when the flock clusters, there is a small representation of the board in the lower right hand corner to help sort things out.\n\nThe game is inexpensive, easy to learn, and a perfect time killer for those who like puzzles.","April 27","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
