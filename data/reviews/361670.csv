It doesn't need a review and it doesn't need any judgement. It's still among the best of the best when it comes down to space combat (simulation).\nAnd with the single player co-op campaign it's even better.\nYou have to download it over here if you want to go co-op:\nhttp://amiralaria.free.fr/xwam_an.php\n\nAnd just so you know: 3D Hardware is active in high resolution mode and multiplayer works just fine with standard TCP/IP.\n\nAnd, also make sure to grab the X-Wing Alliance Upgrade Project which is free also. You can get that mod over here:\nhttp://www.xwaupgrade.com/\n\nLatest development regarding the XWAU project is that it won't support the Steam version. On their website they state that the .exe files are completely rewritten and that they don't know how to alter them to make it work with their mod. It's a shame, but at least they're honest and that's nice.\n\nThe game itself runs in 800x600, even changing the resolution in the config.cfg and write protecting it doesn't chang this, due to the fact that it's hard coded in the .exe file for some reason.\n\nWhat you could do however is edit the ddraw.cfg and change the fullscreen mode from 0 to 1.\nDepending on your resolution it might give you an acceptable experience. I run in 1680x1050 and it looks good enough for me.\n\nNOTE:\nMe, myself and I couldn't use those upgrades and enhancements with the Steam version, but others for some reason can. So, be warned if any of those custom changes crashes your game. With me, I'll have to wait for a fix from the creators end.\n\nIf you want to go multiplayer, make sure that the host has the following ports forwarded if using a router:\nTCP 2300-2400\nUDP 2300-2400\nTCP 47624\nUDP 6073","April 28, 2015","true","6.9"," 162 of 186 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","162","186","3","16"

The original boxed version of this game was purchased for me 17 years ago by my parents when I was much younger. I've played through the campaign many many times, and spent a lot of time experimenting with the combat simulator. I repurchased it on Steam so that I don't need to drag out the cd's anymore.\n\nThis is a great and very fun space flight sim. It's all fly-by-wire so don't expect the feel of Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous. It does give you some good control over your ships though. You can manage power between your lasers, shields, engines and beam weapons. Diverting energy from one to another. It is always soo much fun when you've completed your objectives just in time as reinforcement Star Destroyers start pouring in from Hyperspace, and you now need to divert all energy from all other systems to your engines so you can GTFO before Tie Fighters smother you. There's even one great mission where you need to fly THREW them to escape, passing right over Vader's massive Super Star Destroyer as it bares down on you.\nAs well you can set shields to focus on the front, back or equally both sides of your ship. Usefull when heading straight into the madness, or when a fighter is stuck on your tail. When flying ships with turrets (like the Millennium Falcon) you can even jump into the turret, and set the auto-pilot to chase your current target as you try to blast it. Just like the scene from A New Hope.\n\nThere's around 50 missions and they're all fairly unique, exciting, and lengthy. The story starts right after the battle of Hoth and ends at the destruction of the second Death Star. With you piloting the Millennium Falcon right into the mouth of the massive beast. You play as Ace Azzameen, a young freighter pilot for your families transport business. There are two types of missions,\nRebel Mission's: where you'll be piloting various Rebel fighters in skirmishes for the Rebel Alliance and\nFamily Mission's: where you'll be piloting a Corellian YT series small freighter (similar to the Millennium Falcon) doing jobs for your family to help build your families transport business.\n\nThe missions are more then just Go to point A, blow up Object B, and escort Ships C. There are capture, hunting, recon, infiltration and even base defense missions. It's pretty varied and I never found the game to go stale. Even playing it recently.\n\nThis is where I get a little sad. The game is split into chapters with many small story lines that all relate to the two major arc's The war between the Rebel and Imperial republic and the story of your family.  The family story arc unfortunately ends on a massive cliff hangar right before the battle of the Second Death Star. After that the game is over. It's clear the developers had planned for an expansion pack or sequel to continue the family story but due to the poor sales of the game that never happened. You spend a lot of time with the characters and I personally became very invested in the story. I was disappointed to see it never truly finished.\n\nThere's a combat sim that lets you put together custom (all be it simple) skirmishes. I spent a lot of time in this. It was fun putting together these massive battles with Star Destroyers and Calamari Cruisers clashing while the space in between and around is filled with fighters from both sides swarming like mosquito's.\n\nI never played the multiplayer so I can't comment on that.\n\nOne negative I suppose is the graphics sure have not aged well. BUT for the past DECADE there has been a small loyal group of great guys who have slowly sloooowly been retexturing the whole game (They've pretty much done the 95% of the game by now), and have created some mods to allow it to run better on modern hardware. It's not Star Citizen but they've done a great job with it. The new textures they have created look great at 1080p. And I love what they did with the interiors of the ships. Their website is http://www.xwaupgrade.com/ They just recently made it compatible with the GOG.com version of the game, and appearntly that does not work with this version. So for now you may be better off to buy that version instead http://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_xwing_alliance  (sorry Valve.) It's been about a year since I played the game. And I got the widescreen fix from another site but I think they have all the fixes needed on their site now.\n\nThe game runs great natively with an Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller. You can easily re-map the controls in the ESC menu. Although, you will need to use the keyboard a bit still as there is just too many different hot keys to all be mapped to those controllers. Don't worry though, in the thick of it the controller alone will be fine to adjust systems, swap weapons and do all the maneuvers needed to survive.\n\nAnd that's it. As you've probably noticed I've a great deal of nostalgia for this game. But I've played it recently and I still love it just as much as I did as when I was a kid. It's not too complicated yet not too simple. The missions are lots of fun, and the story is engrossing. I personally highly recommend it.","April 28, 2015","true","0.1"," 122 of 133 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","122","133","2","2"

The storyline is suprisingly good and connects to the original Star Wars Trilogy very well.\nThe game it self is a space sim rather than a rail shooter and as such, ship management is vital to success in a mission.\nThe game seems to work fine on windows 7 and (if you played it before like many here have) it's everything you remember.\n\nNow the bad:\n\nGraphically, the game is dated.

Nearly the entire game except for the last mission takes place in a parallel story within the original Trilogy, so it's a fresh and it adds to the immersion.\n\nI can't really recomend this game enough to any Star Wars fan.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhomega/recommended/361670/","Rhomega","Rhomega","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhomega/","267 products in account","X-Wing Alliance was the X-Wing I originally wanted, and I consider it to be the best game in the series. There's more craft here, you can see planets more closely than older games, and you can hyperspace to different sectors to perform different goals. Some flyable craft like the YT Corellian transports can dock with and carry cargo containers. Missions start you off in a hangar, where you can see activity going on around you, and you will sometimes have options for different fighters. There's more of a story this time, as you play as Ace Azameen, whose family-owned cargo business wants to stay out of the Galactic Civil War, but you are eventually dragged into the Alliance side after the Imperials seize your home. While X-Wing and TIE Fighter did give your character a name and backstory, they were limited to the manual, and you were otherwise a faceless pilot. Giving your pilot an identity here seems like a good idea because you have something personal to fight for, and makes you feel like you're stepping into a bigger galaxy.\n\nThis is all fine...until you have to do family missions. Every once in a while, in the middle of your Rebel Tours, you'll be called back to do some work for your brother and sister, trying to get your home back. Sometimes it even ties into the Rebel plot. But it feels like you're being torn away from your duty. "Do I still have to work for you people? I have better things to do." Which brings me to my next problem: difficulty spikes, which as I recall, tend to happen during family missions.\n\nAnother big feature is the final campaign: The Battle of Endor, where you get to fly the Millenium Falcon itself, including into the Death Star superstructure, which is probably the hardest mission in the game. Not only is it cramped, but the obstacles change every time you reset. On top of that, you're not playing as Ace anymore, you're playing as Lando, which means while Ace's story does get a happy ending, it also comes to an abrupt halt. I also didn't even want to fly the Millennium Falcon. I wanted to fly a B-Wing and take on Star Destroyers. Oh well...\n\nThere is a multplayer function, with a sort of mission editor, allowing you to put in any craft, up to and including Super Star Destroyers. This seems good, except you can't define where they are placed, or special conditions, making this inferior to the competitor Freespace 2, and the FRED program. However, the number of playable craft is greatly expanded, and you can even fly the Firespray-class ship (famously used as Slave I).\n\nFlaws aside, this is certainly the best X-Wing game, and I do highly recommend it, just beware of the harder missions.","April 30, 2015","true","1.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

I Still have the disks and with PC Gamers previous article about the mod upgrades I was happy with it, but Still wanted a Release of it to be compatible with modern systems without it doing the ''Xwing Alliance has developed an error message''\n\nYep the game works Perfectly, and nothing added or taken away from it but why! just Why would you lock the resolution and graphic Options? I noticed this whenever I tried to change the resolution both in and out of the game but it woulld still run at 800 x 600 resolution. Which is stupid considering even the original release you could change it.\n\nNow I've realised I make a small mistake getting it off steam as GoG Website who originally first released it this year allows you to change graphic options including the Resolution. It's a real shame, but unfortunately you just never know how long Steam/Disney will take to patch it up and from what research I've done the Mods will not work with the Steam version of this game. Take my advice, if you have the £6.99 in your account to buy it, go to GOG Website and get it there!","May 9, 2015","false","2.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

This IS my favourite game of all time. I can not say enough good about it. Simply put, the most immersive Star Wars experience I have ever had, arguably the most immersive game I have ever played full stop.\nCombat is rich, detailed and full of nuance. The massive story campaign can be genuinly challenging if played on the hardest difficulty, and the tactical nature of managing your wingmen, controlling where to begin engagments spatially and target prioritizing in between managing the subsystems of your ship, and flying around is both gripping and cereberal.\nThe universe is richly detailed, dirty freighters haul cargo between systems, hyperspacing along busy shipping lanes, massive Star Destroyers interdict shipments for inspection, pirates attack peaceful mining operations, and you are caught up in the middle of everything.\nThis all comes with a cutom mission editor, allowing you to create battles full of anything from super star destroyers, calamari cruisers, tie fighters, x-wings to old freighters and storage containers.\nBuy this game if you want real immersion, great combat, an expansive single player experience and a rich detailed universe.","April 29, 2015","true","4.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

I loved this series way back  in the day when I was a very young man in high school.  Alliance completes the arc and gives a phenomal end to the series.  The controls are great, the graphics hold okay for today and despite needing to alter the .cfg to configure modern graphics.\n\nI do think Tie Fighter got some things done better.  It felt more smooth and I think a bit more efficient.  Alliance played well to the campaign story for its epic climax but still delivered a great multiplayer expereince.\n\nI highly recommend this game to any Star Wars fan or space sim fan.

Well, they haven't. When I say scripting, I'm referring to all the stuff that happens as you progress through a mission. So many levels will have you lose because of buggy, confusing scripting, unclear goals, and the like. For this single reason, I cannot recommend the game - the single player story is a frustrating mess. They give you the ability to skip some levels and they give you the ability to turn on invincibility but at that point it feels like you're just forcing yourself to slog through a buggy game. A game realeased in this state this year would be unacceptable.\n\nEven when the missions aren't buggy, they are just poorly paced - you'll find yourself sitting there waiting and doing nothing for several minutes, often. If you then fail at the end of the mission, guess what, you get to sit through that section again.  Yeah it's not like I wanted to play a game or something.\n\nNow, if that doesn't bother you so much, this game is pretty awesome. There is lots of voice over, improved graphics, a more personal story, more complex missions spanning multiple sectors, and all sorts of improvements that make the simulation more immersive. It's just too bad they couldn't work the stupid bugs out of their cruddy level scripting and overall stupid mission design. This has always been a problem with the X wing series, and it's just sad that they never really fixed it for the final entry in the series. RIP LucasArts, at least Republic Commando was really good.","June 16, 2015","false","6.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It is the lastest and best evolution of the star wars x-wing and tie fighter series.  The grapics may not be great, but you never end up scratching your head saying "what in the hell is that?" The physics are near perfect, and I only say near because you cannot control your ships orientation (at least to my knowledge, correct me if im wrong).  Enemy AI is probably about the same as the empire in the movies, which means it is pretty bad (though allies are fairly useful).  However, this is countered by the fact that like 50 fighters and bombers are thrown at you all at once.  It is also countered by a fairly anoying feature, missiles.  On the first mission that you fight the empire (which I have yet to pass) you have no counter measures to block the missiles, accept your lasers.  It is nearly impossible to turn your ship and shoot the missile in time if the enemie is close, even with your turrets on auto fire they are hard to hit.  And you end up getting hit by like 3 at a time, which basically destroys your shields, and before you can say "supercallifristicexpiallidotous" you are dead.  This is extremely anoying and frusterating to the point of hole punching your monitor (if anyone has advice I would love to hear it). Ok, moving along, your ship feels like your own, you can control almost every function of the ship, from shield facing to how many lasers are shooting.  You really feel like you are in battle in a galaxy far, far away.  Mostly though, from the joy stick (which should be called sadness stick), as you NEEEEEEED, a joy stick. I bought this game back in november of 2015 and had to wait till january 2016 to play it since I didnt have a joy stick, it was very frusterating and sadening.  The story is fairly good.  You are a son who is coming of age in a family of merchants, who have just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off another powerful merchant clan, and you start off fighting them, and win, and then turn to helping the alliance beat the empire as you sence they are winning.  Characters are all dynamic and feel semi real (though there are some funny dialouge lapses) and for some reason the sister reminds me of erics sister from THAT 70'S SHOW.  To recap:\n\n\npros:\n-Graphics are comprehendable (IE: nothing looks like a turd if it isnt)\n- Allies are fairly helpful and not anoying at all\n- Game feels very realistic, like you are actually there\n-Game has only ever crashed on me once\n- Physics are near perfect\n- Story isnt cliche (at least for me)\n\ncons:\n- Requires joystick (now sadness stick)\n- No control over ship orientation in space\n- MISSILES ARE ANOYING AS FU*K!\n- Game is very difficult due to the afformentioned reason","February 22","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do you like Star Fights? Do you like Star Battles? Do you like Star Wars? Do you have a Joystick? If you say "yes" to all of these questions. You'll probably like this game.\nX-wing Alliance was the developed by Totally Games and published in 1999. This was the last Star Wars flying simulator game Totally Games developed.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\n*Requirements: Firstly, make sure you have a joystick. It seems there are some controllers supported with the game that you could use, but not all controllers work with the game, so buyer beware of that. Furthermore, there are additional graphical problems which may force some to download addons or additional software to fix them.\nYou see; X-Wing Alliance doesn't support wide screen display, so the screen is stretched a little funny, it doesn't bother me because I could play the game on a cell phone screen plugged into a potato and be in Ace-Azzameen-pilot-nolstalgia-ecstasy.\nI don't feel like my review would be fair unless I pointed out that X-Wing Alliance is available at: https://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_xwing_alliance which I've heard is a better source for retro games. But I haven't yet taken the time to pursue anything with them... so I cannot speak from first hand experience, but it's worth while to make note of it.\n\nStory: Hello Ace, that's your name. You're the youngest sibling in the Azzameen family. The Azzameens are a shipping family whom are simply trying to earn an honest living in the violent galexy, which is the Star Wars universe as a whole.\nUnfortunately for the family business, conflict has been on the rise with the Viraxo (a competitive family, trying to put your family out of business) and tension is heightened with the galactic empire! Things have gotten really tough since the Destruction of the Death Star at Yavin.\nPotential spoiler: Since the game is X-wing Alliance, it probably won't surprise anyone that the Azzameens flee to join the Rebel Alliance and assist them in their struggle to over throw the empire. other then assisting in that mater, the Azzameen family is still trying to do jobs and earn money on the side. So the game is actually having two stories going parallel to each other making the missions very different in tone and experience.\n\nGameplay: Plug that Joystick in, if you're like me, you'll need to dust it off too, because there aren't many games that use 'em anymore. Just a heads up; you'll need a manual to remember all the keyboard commands. There are tons of them.\nThe idea is to use your joystick for flight, and combat, while you use your other hand to handle throttle, commands, armaments, squad commands... pretty much everything else in the simulator. And yes, this is very much a simulator.\nThere's a few important things to note while playing: your speed effects your turning speed. you have multiple weapons and different weapon settings. If you're flying a ship with a turret you can set it to auto fire, or in a linked forward position. You control the power being sent between your lasers, shields, beam weapon, and engines.\nJust mastering these few things will requires a great deal of time and effort, and can probably get you through most of the game. To get into all the different strategies, commands, and methods of playing X-wing Alliance would be a great idea for a guide, maybe someday I'll actually write one, but for now hopefully that's enough to get you started with the game, if you decide to try it out. (If you need a hand or if you see something you really think would be good to know, feel free to comment!)\n\nAchievements: There are no steam achievements for Star Wars: X-wing alliance, really there's only one Star Wars game with achievements, and that's KOTOR 2. Why is that? HUH?!? [rant] Get your act together, Totally games, BioWare (KOTOR1), Traveller's Tales (Lego), and LucasArts. The games I want to spend more time playing, and generally do spend more time playing, don't reward me digital badges. [/end rant]\n\nPrice: Star Wars: X-wing Alliance is priced at $9.99, That's way cheaper then the $20 I spent as a little kid when I first got it... or rather my parents spent to get it for me for Christmas. I suggest getting either a bundle deal, or just get the whole Star Wars Franchise pack.\nI just realized that this was a gift on Christmas too! Man... 10+ years later and I still get Star Wars games for Christmas, Thank you cuteancuddly. :3\n\nConclusion: Again, remember to have a joystick or playing this game will be like pulling nails by hand in the desert. If you're not deterred by any of the warnings that have already been covered, and you're a solid Star Wars fan, this game is for you! Too bad Ace Azzameen was Expanded universe, so he's no longer cannon, he's now simply a Star Wars Legend :(  You'll always be in my heart Azzameen family. Once an Azzameen always an Azzameen!\n\n*the Requirements category was added for the purpose of this specific review, and it's not regularly part of the Atratzu Review process.","March 22","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Highly recommend if you are looking for one, both, or neither.\n\nThe story is excellent, with the campaign revolving around a family of merchants who get sucked into the Galactic Civil War, giving you opportunity to be involved in some of the biggest fights of the series and details that you would not know otherwise. Some very great secrets and easter eggs for fans.  If you prefer more action, the skirmish system has enough depth to keep you occupied for a while. Although setup can take a while due to the interface, nothing is more fun than a preload scenario and blasting tie fighters.\n\nThe gameplay hasn't changed much in the 15+ years since I played it, apart from the update to make it actually work with systems from this millennia. The learning curve can be a little difficult and it is easy to get turned around in the beginning, but it is well worth it.\n","March 12","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
