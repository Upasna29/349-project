To them, it adds more to Emmet's and WildStyle's stories. Plus they have to cooperate, take turns picking up items and work together as a team to achieve each stage's goal (we've dual controllers on our SteamOS/Windows SteamBox-MediaPC). Basically, they have to practice patience, not being bossy telling the other to do something, asking the other for an assist (even swapping controllers), etc. Watching them play and work together this way as a parent is so worth the sale price.","October 12, 2014","true","122.9"," 206 of 217 people (95%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","95","206","217","11","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noq_pl/recommended/267530/","noq_pl","·noq·","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noq_pl/","908 products in account","In short, is the game good?\nYes, it's very good.\n\nIs it worth my time and money?\nYes it is. Although, if you're having doubts about paying full price, I'd strongly suggest to wait for a -50% sale.\n\nIs this game for anyone?\nYes. The game can be enjoyed by both kids and adults.\n\nLinear, open-world or something else?\nThe game uses hub worlds which house connected, individual levels. Very reminiscent of late 90s platformer games. There's a lot of stuff to do in each hub world and the connected levels. Expect around 10-13 hours of playtime to reach the ending and around 20-24 hours to 100% the game.\n\nGameplay mechanics, gimmicks?\nPretty varied but all challenges and puzzle are based around LEGO. Each minifig has a specific ability that you'll have to use in order to progress throughout the level. There are some fun minigames sprinkled around the levels, in just enough quantity to keep the player interested.\n\nGraphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?\nThe game looks pleasant to the eye. Level design is varied, rich with little details. Graphical fidelity could be slightly better but it does its job.\n\nAudio design and soundtrack?\nSound effects are decent. Character voices sounds alright in most cases (with the exception of a few lines of dialogue that sound rather silly). Soundtrack is interesting and uses tracks from the movie. Oddly enough, Batman's "no parents" song from the movie seems to be replaced with a generic drumstep wub-a-thon, for some strange reason (licensing issues maybe?).\n\nPlot, story?\nYou play as over-night-chosen-one Emmet (and friends) trying to stop President Business from ruling the world. The game closely follows the story of the movie, although it expands the first two acts of the movie and shortens the 3rd act into just a few levels. This actually works in favour of the game, as you're able to explore more of the areas that were hastily rushed through in the movie. In theory, you could just play the game without watching the movie as the story is explained pretty well in the game. Still, I'd personally recommend watching the movie first.\n\nHow does the game run?\nRuns without any issues on my 5 year old PC (Dual-Core 2.66GHz, GeForce 9600GT, 2GB RAM) on 1920x1080 resolution with SSAO and V-Sync turned off. No jittering, no sudden framerate drops. Loading times are usually pretty short. Expect way better perfomance on newer machines than mine.\n\nAny details, character, motif, etc. you particularly liked?\nYes, the "Bonus Room" is a very cool touch.\n\nAnything you didn't like?\nThe game suffers from some really weird collision and clipping bugs. Didn't break the game for me but it was annoying at times, forcing me to restart a level at some point. Also, the minifig selection screen is a mess and doesn't explain which minifig has which ability.\n\nFinal score?\nI give The LEGO Movie Videogame a double-decker couch out of 5.\n","September 23, 2014","true","24.5"," 94 of 97 people (97%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","97","94","97","23","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GFZ/recommended/267530/","GFZ","CCCC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GFZ/","72 products in account","As a huge fan of the movie and Lego games in general, I got to say this entry into the Lego series by Traveller's Tales is one of the weaker ones. The game's campaign follows the movie closely and each level is based off a key scene from the movie, like Lego Lord of the Rings or Lego Star Wars. In those levels is a fun mix of puzzle solving and platforming using different characters with unique abilities. It's essentially what we've come to expect from all the Lego games up to this point. What makes this one different is that it's actually tying in with a new movie, not just based upon an old franchise. Fortunately, it's tying in with a movie about Legos, a perfect fit. But the syndrome of movie tie-in games rears it's ugly head into The Lego Movie Videogame. It feels more rushed than previous Lego games, like the designers are stretching out scenes in the movie to go on for a 20-30 minute level. It feels like they're padding the game out to be much longer than it should be, and that creates boredom. This reminds me of the Lego games on the Nintendo DS, where the levels are padded out with extremely repetitive puzzles and and button-mashy combat sequences. It's a shame too because I was really looking forward to this game. In terms of everything else, the music and graphics are fantastic and fit the style of the movie perfectly. This is one pretty looking game and is the first of the TT Lego games to be entirely made of Legos, so that's nice. Unfortunately, the core gameplay feels scaled back and TT just gave us the bare minimum, even the open world part of game is contained of small chunks instead of one big world. Really, the game is not bad, I would recommend it if you like the previous Lego games or really enjoyed the movie, it just isn't solid as previous Lego games.\n\nUPDATE 12/2/14 - I actually have grown a soft spot for the game so far. I still find Lego City Undercover and Lego Marvel better, but I love the source material so much that, it's hard for me to look at it as the weakest (Lego Indy 2 and Star Wars 3 are much worse), it gets better, trust me.","February 8, 2014","true","16.4"," 151 of 203 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","151","203","0","2"

While the gameplay is simple in nature it's still very enjoyable for all age groups. Great blend of action and puzzles. Keeping to the tried and tested formula you swap between 2 or more characters (if playing solo). Each character will receive different costumes throughout the story, every costume changes the abilities you can use. Puzzles usually require use of all characters combining abilities to complete the task. Controls are simple and effective, though as with all lego games I would definitely recommend playing with a gamepad (or two).\n\nLevels are a little shorter then some of the previous titles, but they do manage to fit a lot of action into each 'scene'. Upon completion you will unlock each of these for freeplay mode (open world). Length of the game gets extended quite a bit because as you progress through the game unlocking more characters, you can use these and return to past levels finding new areas and secrets you couldn't access earlier. Each level is a scene reenacted from the movie while cutscenes are copied directly from the movie itself, though they blend in well with the gameplay.\n\nGraphically speaking it looks the part and performance is great overall. The artstyle helps a lot with the humour too which is classic tongue-in-cheek lego. Both adults and children should find it amusing on different levels. Game supports a range of video settings covering some higher end setups, eg, basic AA, 1440p+, 120hz+, DoF toggle etc.  (small note: at the time of writing you need to load into the game itself to change graphic options). No fps caps in place here either folks.\n\nVoicework is top notch, all the official voice actors are used and I'm almost certain they managed to get some new lines written too.\n\nDoes make me sad each time a new lego game is released and it doesn't have online co-op support though. That would be the only small downside. Having played most of them now I can honestly say the last several have been brilliant. LOTR, Marvel and now The Lego Movie Videogame are all well worth picking up, particually if you have a children or friend nearby for some couch co-op. Solo play is a still an absolute blast, don't hear me wrong. ;)\n\nBonus Tip: If you can't see the game for purchase on your local storepage.

This game offers 15 levels that span the movie's storyline.  The levels are filled with collectables that give you construction manuals so you can move the level forward or give you other collectibles that help you get extra abilities or special construction manuals that you can only use in the final hub of the game.\n\nOverall, this game plays like most other movie related games like Star Wars and Indiana Jones.  However, not everyone like the Lego Movie, so this may not be as attractive for some as it would be for others.  My kids loved this more than me, yet I enjoyed the Star Wars and Indiana Jones games more.  However, the game and graphics are just as good, just as fun, and just as long.\n\nI did find a few glitches here in this game that I had not found in other games.

This one's short. It's got some bugs, but most Lego games do.  Honestly? This game is OK. It follows the movie fairly well, but there are points of divergence. And more than just "makes for a better video game". There are parts that honestly felt like it was an earlier draft of the movie. Which wouldn't surprise me. The game was released the same day the movie hit theaters. That strikes me as a bad idea. You haven't given the movie time to build interest in the game, and the parallel development means that if a change is made for the movie, the game lags behind. This was most noticeable with the cut scenes. They were taken from the movie, but the music is wrong - when it exists at all. Music is added fairly late in the film, and it's entirely possible that the scenes were sent to the game before the music was complete. The music that does exist smacks of "temp tracks". It's just not good, doesn't fit. One scene in particular, taken from the movie, references a specific song.. that's not in the game. Which makes that cut-scene particularly awkward.\n\nIt has an interesting mechanic in the swapping of pants. You can unlock pants that give you an effect in game. There's only a couple effects that actually make any real difference. And it's more "good idea, bad execution" than anything else. The fact that some of the pants are only available via codes found with the Lego sets for the movie troubles me. Not that the codes are hard to find. I'm sure they were online the day the sets were released, if not sooner. I don't really mind it for something like the alternate character model that the DVD/Blu-Ray comes with a code for, since that's purely cosmetic (though it does give access to a character and thus its abilities sooner). The pants, on the other hand, do have an effect on the game. Again, only one has any major impact, and there's a similar - but not exact - pair in the game you can unlock. Maybe I'm just being a curmudgeon here, I have nothing really against cross promotion in general. As long as it's cosmetic.\n\nOverall? Well, the game was on sale, so it's not like I paid anywhere near full price for it. And I certainly got my 'money's worth' out of it. But, on sale is really the only time I would recommend this particular game. Especially given the quality of others in the series, such as Lego Star Wars III and Lego Marvel Superheroes.  Still, if you are looking for more Lego games to feed your addiction, this one can fill the gap nicely.","November 9, 2014","true","15.7"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","33","38","3","1"

There's no true open world this time; there are hubs that can be freely explored with many of the characters, but they're not connected to each other. It isn't all that bad, but I can see why people don't like it this way. In fact, all the hubs could've been connected with a bit of creativity. Just sayin'.\nThe world is built entirely from Lego blocks which looks really cool. It fits the style of the movie perfectly.\n\nThe graphics are, again, the same as all the other Lego games; colorful and sharp. The game in general performs well, but there were a few times where the framerate dropped for a few seconds.\nA big part of the sounds and music were also taken from the movie, including the catchy 'Everything is awesome' song.\n\nAs far as gameplay is concerned, there are a few new tricks. Building stuff with blueprints has potential, but isn't really all that fun. It needs more polish and people should be able to build stuff from scratch, instead of selecting the correct blocks. The master builder move looks great in motion and even though you don't really do anything it's still nice to do and watch.\n\nAbout the missions. Each missions lasts about 15-45 minutes, and it can take much longer than that if you want to collect everything. Collecting everything will take you tens of hours. Finishing the game by just completing the missions will take you about 4-5 hours max. That's pretty short for a Lego game. I'm not the kind to collect and complete all things, but even I thought it was short in comparison to the other games. To be honest, I don't really mind. Every Lego game has the same gameplay and it's quickly wearing thin.\n\nGive us something completely new, or add enough new stuff to make it special again.

With a plot loosely based around The Matrix, it features some fantastic sequences, like a high-speed pursuit on a futuristic bike. As Wyldstyle (the female Trinity-esque protagonist) jumps from one vehicle to another while being pursued by the bad guys, it uses LEGO's two character co-op format brilliantly. Matrix 2, eat your hat! Early on though, a lot of the 'action' does involve building and demolition in the construction world. It's a clear nod to the real-world LEGO and you even have to seek out the instructions for the builds. These are identical to the type of instruction leaflets packed with real boxes of LEGO, on of many nice little touches to the game. I haven't watched the movie yet, but it's likely it pretty much recreates most of the scenes from the movie, as previous LEGO movie-tie-ins have. This time of course, with it being LEGO's very own product and movie, they have free reign to go nuts, throwing everything at you like a bucketload of trademarked plastic bricks. It also continues the trend of featuring humorous dialogue and sight gags. It's probably the funniest of all the LEGO games, and quite possibly the best. You rush through plenty of different themed LEGO worlds in the multiverse, donning some nifty apparel, which changes from location to location. There are as usual, plenty of characters to unlock, or purchase in the game. It doesn't really scream originality, with the usual tasks of collecting many, many hidden items  in an attempt to add replayability. It does pretty much what previous LEGO games have done before, but it does this very well, and is nicely graphically polished. Those who avoid LEGO games won't find much here to change their opinion. But fans will simply enjoy the ride. And the annoyingly catchy "Everything is Awesome" song will be rolling around your head for days after.\n\n9/10","February 27, 2014","true","3.2"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","1"

This game "only" has 75 gold brick, but after the nightmare of collecting the brutal 250 gold bricks in LEGO Marvel, this is a much less frustrating and more fun experience.\n\nGone are the terrible racing games that were either too easy or too hard, gone are the overly long and convoluted quests for a measly gold brick. This is something I sincerely welcome and I really hope this stays this way.\n\nYou only have to get all the collectibles and all the rest of the gold bricks are in the bonus room, that's it and that's how I hope it stay for the next game.\n\nThe fact that I'm probably going to buy a LEGO set after playing this game speaks volumes on how this game is about the love for LEGOs.","February 9, 2014","true","28.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

That's it really...\n\nFrom start to finish I enjoyed every moment, captivating me like no other LEGO game could do, and forcing me to play just one more level even though I told myself I'd get off 3 levels ago.\n\nIf you're in any way a fan of LEGO games, the LEGO movie, or just LEGO in general; I can't recommend this game enough.","September 24, 2015","true","5.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

What really surprised me about this game is that is features all the original voice actors of the movie like: Will Ferrell, Chris Pratt, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Charlie Day, Elizabeth Banks, etc. They are all here with new lines just for the video game. That really impressed me. The gameplay does get repetitive at times but it's all fun. My only complaint is that their is not much to do after you beat the game unless you want to go for achievements. Also the game plays a bit wonky with keyboard/mouse. I highly recommend playing this game with a gamepad instead.

But The LEGO Movie easily comes out on top, possibly because I loved The LEGO Movie too much. It feels like a true LEGO game, with literally EVERYTHING made out of colorful bricks, just like in the film. Which is amazing to see. The cutscenes are taken from the fantastic movie itself, revealing the plot, and going along with the gameplay. On that note, the game IS based on the movie, so it feels rather short in some areas or levels.\n\nThe characters are all voiced by voice actors that sound just like the original cast, which I was shocked to find out, because they sound so much like the original characters from the movie! I hardly noticed! It's really funny to hear them talk, and say a lot of really clever lines. It's all written up to standard! On the subject of charcters, there's many many different characters to choose from! Including about 3 or 4 different Unkittys which was awesome! There's also a few superheroes from a certain company that you'll enjoy playing as! I guarantee!\n\nSo, if you enjoy the LEGO line of games, or really enjoyed the movie, get this fantastic game by TT! It's a lot of fun playing with friends, and you'll be sure to have yourself a really special experience that no other Steam game has brought. Maybe Portal or Half Life.

I say that very deliberately. I love Lego games. I played every single one to 100% up until LoTR and have played a smattering to 100% since then.\n\nLego games are a blast. They're super formulaic. Destroy, build, run around collecting stuff and find hidden things. I love the cutesy sense of humor that these games bring to the table. Before the days when the Lego games included voice acting, there was such a great charm in the way the characters moved around to convey the mood. Despite voice acting, that is still there. This game is no different. They took a great movie and turned it into a full length lego game.\n\nThe HUB world is huge, but this game followed the LoTR and Harry Potter style of adding ghost coins to follow in order to know where to go. The vehicles handle beautifully. The character purchasing is done from a menu in this game instead of running around on a wild goose chase.\n\nNow the bad: This IS a Lego-ey Lego game. Which means it will feel that no one ever beta tested it. When I played Lego Potter (1-4), I had a game breaking glitch. I restarted the game. I had a completely different game breaking glitch. Same That's the only Lego game I have ever played and not played to 100%. The bad news: While playing this, I have hit almost a dozen glitches and I have not even finished story mode yet. Cut scenes won't load, areas don't register so I can't enter them, it will show I have to kill enemies but none will spawn. Worst of all, when I save and exit the level, it doesn't remember my progress. The good news is these aren't game breaking problems (yet). Each time I find these issues, I quit out and the bug is gone the next time I play.\n\nI recommend this game as a Lego game. It does exactly what you would expect from this style of game. It's light hearted, fun, charming and addictive. It is also incredibly glitchy, like most Lego games. Play this at your own risk!","January 16","true","16.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

With the Lego Movie, they had 1 movie that was about what 2 hours or less. They had to embellish certain area and add certain things.\n\nReally who cares....

You are much better off With Lego Marvel, Pirates, Lord of the Rings or any of the other wonderful lego games out there. And if you've played them all, hey just go play them again!\n\nEDIT: I've played through more of this since first writing this review and I still wouldn't recommend it - however for the steam sale price it's probably not too bad... just to answer compujosh - the main things I had a problem with were the overall sloppiness of the graphics (half the lego textures in the cowboy world were UPSIDE DOWN on the model amongst many other inconsistencies) the puzzles were painfully simple, rather boring and it all just felt very rushed. Also visually the choice to use actual movie footage as opposed to recreating the movie scenes with real-time animations as they have done in EVERY other lego games led to a disparity between the cut scenes and the real time play which I found quite jarring - it generally made the game look even worse every time you jumped back in..\n\n\nAnyway that's my rant. If you're buying this for a kid they probably won't notice or care about the things that annoy me, but think twice if you're buying it expecting a top notch lego game.","May 28, 2014","false","7.4"," 87 of 166 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","87","166","3","9"

In my experience, LEGO games are not so much about ground breaking, innovative gameplay; but rather, immensely enjoyable fun for the whole family that comes in all kinds of assorted flavors. Personally, I find the Star Wars flavor to be the best out of all of them, but for the same reason that a die-hard Harry Potter fan would tell you that the Harry Potter LEGO Games are the best.\n\nOn a more specific note for this title, if you've seen the LEGO Movie then don't expect anything new from the game; of all the LEGO titles I've played in my life, this one definitely feels the laziest. That does not mean I won't get countless hours of enjoyment out of it, but as far as the whole adoption from film to game goes The LEGO Movie Videogame is anything but creative.\n\nOverall, if you haven't ever played a LEGO game, then don't just buy the "latest and greatest".

Yes you have. This is as close as you can come to it.\n\nIt's different from the other lego games, mainly because the entire world is lego and because it isn't based off an entire trilogy. The story is short and kind of pointless..you have seen the movie right? There isn't much to work with and the movie is already in lego, so there goes that angle.

You have to complete small tasks and usually build something. It doesn't play like all of the other lego games. This one is fun and different. All of the NPCs are funny - I laughed anyway :)\n\nI'm thinking that kids might not "get" this game...there's a lot of dad jokes and sly humour. This is easily my favourite lego game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/virtuaroid/recommended/267530/","virtuaroid","VirtuaroidPilot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/virtuaroid/","27 products in account","BitzComms Reviews: The Lego Movie Video Game\n\n(This review covers the PC - Your experience may differ from platform to platform)\n\nI have to be honest with you - The Lego Movie came to me by complete surprise. For all the time I spend on YouTube, no word was spoken of the movie (at least that I saw) until I first saw the trailer for it on TV...\n\nBut then I was surprised even more when a video game was announced for it - It wasn't even a full year after Lego Marvel Super Heroes came out, and Traveller's Tales came out with a new game already?\n\nIt was more surprising that the game was coming to all major platforms, INCLUDING next gen platforms like the PS4, Xbox One, Wii U, in addition to the PC, Xbox 360 and PS3... Yikes.\n\nThe short development period between this and Marvel seemed like a sign that this game was going to blow HARD... But then I played it, and it is probably my favorite Traveller's Tales Lego game of all time.\n\nSTORY:\n\nThe game follows the story of the movie down pat... Which might turn off those who haven't seen it yet. I suggest you see the movie before you play the game, but even if you don't, the game doesn't feature EVERY scene from the movie... Some of the scenes that are in the game have parts that were cut from the movie, most likely to keep from spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it. I won't explain the story itself, because we have a movie for that, and I wouldn't want to spoil anything.\n\nPRESENTATION:\n\nThe Lego games that have been developed by Traveller's Tales over the years have had a reputation of exceptional presentation, and this one is no different. The game is fully voiced, and either they got the celebrity voices from the movie to do the game, or they just got really, really good sound-alikes. If it's the latter, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference because the acting in this game is so damn good. As I said before, the story is presented through scenes from the movie, and while that may sound kind of cheap, you have to keep in mind the short period between the release of this and Marvel. Plus, the scenes look so good already that you won't mind at all. It kind of harkens back to the days of movie tie-ins on the Playstation, which generally used scenes from the movie for the cutscenes of the game. Anyone remember Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue? (also developed by Traveller's Tales) The game also makes use of a new animation style - The characters actually move like actual lego... No more bendy, stretchy lego limbs. This is probably done to stay true to the stop-motion style of the movie.\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nThe game looks amazing, as everything is made of Lego this time around. The game also runs really well on low-end machines like mine, and that's always a plus.\n\nSOUND:\n\nEverything is Awesome!\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nHere's where things get pretty iffy - The game itself is a mixed bag. While this is my favorite TT Lego title so far, I can't deny this game has some serious problems. Let's first talk about the character selection - There are over NINETY characters... NINETY CHARACTERS. Don't get too excited though, as most of the characters are either clones of existing characters, or very minor characters that no one cares about. Most of the characters are different suits for Emmet. Wild Style or Unikitty. There are some good ones in this game, such as Lord Business, Metalbeard, Batman, Super Man, The Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and even the Green Ninja from Lego Ninjago.\n\nEmmet himself is a pretty boring character as well. For the majority of the game, all he can really do is use instruction builds. He can't use master builds, and he doesn't have any interesting attacks or gimmicks. Most of the time, you'll be playing as Wild Style, Batman and Unikitty, switching to Emmet only when you need to use an instruction build. Eventually Emmet gets the ability to use Master Builds, but that's very late in the game.\n\nNext, let's talk about the gameplay. The game follows the same basic formula as any other TT Lego title before it - Go through the levels, collecting studs and accomplishing objectives with preset characters, then go back and play those levels as any character to find hidden unlockables - Only this time it's mixed with free-roaming hub worlds, and my GOD these are underwhelming. Compared to Lego City: Undercover and especially Lego Marvel Super Heroes, these free-roaming segments seem to be just an after-thought. They are very small and contained. Not very much fun.\n\nNext, let's talk about the levels for a minute. The levels are probably the best part of the game, with only a few stinkers here and there. The only problem is that many of them are very long, and when there's a bad level, there's a REALLY bad level. Each level is quite interesting, with its own gimmick and setpieces. There's an entire level that takes place on an under-constuction submarine that's careening down an ablaze Cloud Cuckoo Land. Many of the level designs are very inspired and smart, but they are quite long, and if you don't have a lot of time for one session, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. There are checkpoints placed around the levels that allow you to save your progress, but some of them are placed in areas where you really wouldn't notice them... oops.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\n\nAs a whole, however, The Lego Movie Video Game is quite solid, considering the short development period. There's a lot of content in here, and most of the levels are fun, if not a bit too long. I'm giving this game a 7.0 out of 10.","June 7, 2014","true","8.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I think this is the best lego game that the publishers of all of the series have released. First of all, the graphics are very great with Light Flares, color correction (i think), and some light glow which is also part of light flares. Second, the gameplay, I haven't gotten stuck once or found ONE glitch in the game yet for playing for over 2-3 hours! The combat system is very fun ripping through blocky lego people, and the building aspect is not alot like the other ones while they introduce the part finding system which makes it easy for kids. This game is recommended by me for all ages and everyone who loves a good 3D, good gameplay, good graphics, lego game!","February 9, 2014","true","14.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I knew that they are very popular but i never had the chance to play one. So it was just a matter of time when i would buy the first. So thanks Summer sale ;)\n\nI recommend watching the movie first before playing the game but it sure works the other way round too. Soo ye, what to say about that game? Great, great and great. If you have a weak spot for Lego, why hesitate? Buy it! Now!\n\nIt got everything you'll need to enjoy couple of hours. The humor is hilarious (not just for kids, still funny for grown-ups), the gameplay and controls are awesome and the graphics lovely. I really love the details. You can basically destroy everything and gather so new characters with differnent attributes. And there are so many different characters (with different skill sets). Beginning from Emmet (the main guy) up to playing freakin' Batman! So if that doesn't bring you to buy this game, i don't know what would.\n\nI mean, there are some glitches sometimes, but not that bad or so often that i wouldn't recommend this game. So all in all i would give this game 9/10 (not finished yet, but i don't see anything that would lower that score!)\n\nSooo, everything is awesoooome!\n\n","June 24, 2014","true","21.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There was something simple and charming about those games that will always appeal to me more than the quagmire that a few of the later games sunk into, in my opinion. I felt later games disappeared into a hole of fiddly complexity regarding character abilities and level design that sucked the fun out of playing.\n\nIn saying that, The Lego Movie: The Game rises above a lot of the others I've played, giving you multiple open-world hubs to play around in, as well as some entertaining levels that expand competently upon the movie's premise and retain the sense of fun and variety that Lego embodies as a product.\n\nThe voice acting is very good considering that the actors are mimicking the original stars, and it's rare that you feel like you're not ACTUALLY listening to the movie's actors.\n\nMy only sizable criticism comes from that point when you realise that there isn't actually much gameplay in these games, and it mostly relies on your compulsive desire to keep collecting studs to keep you entertained. At that point I found myself wondering whether I was either playing a cheap cash-in, or whether I was playing a decent Lego game and it was just that the series is designed in such a way that, by exploited our completionist desires, they can squeeze the most amount of fun out of the least amount of effort. If it's the former, it's hard to tell, and if it's the latter, I feel like I have to applaud the developers for their ingenuity.\n\nEither way, I had fun while I was doing it, alhough I probably won't feel any reason to come back to this particular game after I've finished, as opposed to the Original Trilogy games, as my attachment to the Lego Movie was not great enough to make that a specific draw for me.\n\nOne last criticism is that I found the music to be annoying as ♥♥♥♥. I'm not a fan of the ethereal electronic soundtrack, and in the film the Everything is Awesome song is supposed to be a satirical take on bland, emotionless, corporate-built pop that is intended to be an ear-worm in the most annoying possible way. So when the developers decided to slap it all over the place in this game and have it haunt the dreams of everyone who plays it, they either missed the point of the film entirely in that regard, or they're ♥♥♥♥ing with us.\n\n7/10","July 31, 2014","true","7.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has a lot of fun with the premise, and it's actually kind of fun to play in a LEGO game that is entirely composed of LEGO.\n\nThe split-screen makes it a lot easier to play local co-op, though you occasionally can lose track of which side of the screen you're on, and there are rarely points where you kind of need to sit and figure out what you should be doing next.  Many scenes are quite fast-paced (the train is especially exciting).  Also, the puzzles are fun, though not too challenging.  One real nuisance as a color-blind person is that the little green studs we need to follow to get to the next instance look exactly the same as the little yellow studs.\n\nBasically, it's a very good effort.  It follows the movie *very* closely, so be aware that you won't feel like you're encountering new objects or LEGOfications of any of your favourite movies.  Sill, my kids and I enjoyed it.\n\n7.5/10","October 28, 2014","true","17.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/benhalliwell/recommended/267530/","benhalliwell","Ulumúri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/benhalliwell/","194 products in account","This is the shortest Lego game that I have played, by a long way. I really enjoyed that. The movie humour is present and very enjoyable but does not become tedious. There has been a lot of improvement in gameplay mechanics: the camera was great, the level length was just right, the free play areas were enjoyable and there were no frustrating 'jump just right' challenges. The graphics are a whole level above the graphics of other games because of the way they incorporated Lego scenery, and it's fantastic. The building minigame was too fast for me but was infrequent (unlike Lego Hobbit) and there were fewer collectibles of all sorts. Each level had 5 gold instruction manuals and one pair of pants (Honey, where are my pants?!). Gold bricks are not collected but represent your overall completion (there were 70, while Lego Marvel had 250). The variety of collectible characters is spot-on, there are relatively few, but they are all fun to play and can be unlocked easily (once you complete the appropriate level). The music within levels and in free play areas was never odious. Doing each level was fun - Lego games are often criticised for having no challenge to them, i.e., break stuff until you complete the level - but this game has the most variety (and least repetition) yet.\n\nIn short, this is a really fun game to play. There is a lot of variety and humour; the game is colourful, the graphics are great and the levels are balanced. It's a lot shorter than other Lego games, and I have thus been able to completely finish it while still enjoying it.\n\nI'd say it's 'as good' as Lego Marvel, but there is a lot less of it. This game was released around the same time as Lego Hobbit, and this game is far better. I hope they continue with this style rather than Hobbit.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a ... maybe 9 out of 10? [I'm having trouble figuring out why I shouldn't give it 10, though...]","July 20, 2014","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I feel, however, that this videogame is possibly the weakest entry in the series.\n\nIt seems that it has been delegated to a "B" team - TT Fusion and it shows. Gone are delightful interactions, varied builds and awesome cutscenes. Instead - you get parts of the movie (with Star Wars characters blurred out) and repetitive gameplay.\n\nIn most LEGO games you are required to mix a variety of "skills" and solve puzzles. In here, the element has been vastly simplified in favor of multiple "setpieces" where master builders build amazing huge things from 3 random elements on the screen. It is boring and happens over and over.\n\nSimilarly, many characters always build the same thing (unikity builds the same ugly springboard 90% of the time she jumps into action).\n\nThe game is also rather difficult to complete on free play mode as the way level triggers are set up tends to break if you have a character that allows you to bypass several story steps.\n\nIf you are crazy for LEGO games and played all the others - give it a shot, but if you have other options - play those first. Personally I'd recommend LEGO Batman 3.","May 30, 2015","false","17.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There's lots of similarities to some of the newest LEGO games as well as the older ones, such as high-jumping female characters, character selection wheels, and of course, buildable portions of levels\n\nHowever, there are some major issues I have with the LEGO Movies' video-game partner:\n\nFirstly, the graphics. It seriously seems like LEGO thinks that the graphics for LEGO Worlds is the greatest thing in the whole world. In reality, it makes it look plain awful for a company well-known for making their games look and feel like you're actually in the world that the game is set in. It looks like the older LSW (LEGO Star Wars) games. It looks incredibly childish and doesn't do the LEGO video-game franchise anything.\n\nSecond, a pre-determined story that is incredibly predictable when you've seen the movie itself. I get that LEGO wanted to incorporate the movie into the game, but a different storyline would have given it more "oomph", as they say.\n\nThird, I found the levels to be rather long. There's a certain length that the first LEGO Batman: The Video-game had for it's levels, and the last chapter in each of the three campaigns was always the longest and most action-packed parts, Plus about every level had a boss fight, with the exception of a few where the would-be boss had already been captured and taken back to Arkham Asylum during the villains' side of the story.\n\nI'm not saying that it's all-around bad,'but there's a lot to be desired with it. I highly encourage you to play this game yourself and decide whether it's worth it or not.","December 26, 2015","true","16.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nice story, music. And a gameplay that just manages to not be repetetive and boring. But fun enough to play.\nOn the other hand though. The more I played it. The more annoyed I got. And in the ned I've convinced myself that this game haven't had any playtesters. The more I played the more bugs would I find. Along with some poor AI's. Meaning that sometimes the challenge was not to avoid the mobs. But to guide the mobs into what they are supposed to do rather than get stuck somewhere. Forcing you to reset the level and loose your progress. This come more and more appearent once you've completed the storyline and go back in free play to get all the extras. As you are now playing with charaters not meant to be on the level. Which just makes you ♥♥♥♥ up the game so much more and create so many more bugs. Again forcing you to reset and loose progress.\n\nI've played the storyline. And liked it. But although my plan was to ace this game.

At first I was skeptical of actually getting out of my house and doing something other than play video games, but this girl really reached out for me. We went to our local movie theatre and watched The Notebook. We cuddled the whole time and shared all the happy and sad tears together. She was the most beautiful thing in the world. After that we went everywhere together from our houses to restaurants and the library. Everything in life was great. Every thought I had of suicide before I met this girl, seemed utterly stupid and rash. Every movie we watched together was just 10 times better than watching it alone. Everything was awesome. I said to myself. "Everything is cool when you're part of a team." Until one day I started to notice something. My items of value started to disappear. The first thing I noticed was my special fleshlight that I always kept in my secret shoebox and used whenever a girl would say hi to me at school. Of course I used it after and not during school because that would just be weird. Then my collection of Hentai magazines were gone and I thought I had misplaced them until I saw my girlfriend run across my yard with something suspicious rustling in her bag. I put on my 1000$ antique ninja suit and pursued her throughout out city. Using my superb cardio skills and gainz from the gym, I beat her to her house. I waited patiently in her bushes like I used to when I watched her change before school. As she arrived to her doorstep I leaped out of the bushes and clung onto her like an angry primeape and took off her bag and looked inside. Not only were my sexy kawaii anime figures and magazines in there, but something even more unforgivable. My 8th grade lego set my mother gave to me on my 13th birthday. She tried to explain, but my eyes were blurred with blood, rage, and tears; and a little bit of horniness. I unsheathed my 400$ mock Zanpakutō and stabbed her in the heart.

Personally, I preferred when Lego didnt have people talking and just had squeaks and grunts for "voice acting", but besides personal predjudice, it sounds like the actors aren't even trying. They sound like really badly done robots, until the part where they're supposed to be robots, and then they sound like even worse robots. It feels like the actors put all their energy into making the movie and did the game while they were half-asleep. Not only that, not keeping all the same voice actors from the movie has really damaged it, especially since they actually PUT IN SCENES FROM THE MOVIE. They voiced over the scenes again? Really?\n\nOn top of that, the game was obviously designed for console first, with very little effort put into porting it to the computer. Evidence? On many occasions there are minigames. These minigames are insanely difficult with the mouse of keyboard, because you have to be very fast and make as few mistakes as possible, whereas if you had a controller you can use the 8 directional movement of a stick with ease. There's also a dancing minigame that doesnt even use keyboard keys; it says ABXY for directions, and if you don't own a controller for your computer and you don't know the key layout of a console controller by heart, it's incredibly difficult.\n\nWith most lego games, when they add areas and things, it's really fun, seeing possible parts of the storyline the movies don't go into; with this, it feels cheap and dull, mostly. It's not necessarily a bad game, but falls far, far short of my expectations and hopes, and far from the movie and other Lego games.","July 29, 2014","false","6.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Not even if you liked the actual movie. This feels like an utter and complete cash cow. I completed the story in less than 6 hours (no cutscenes were skipped), but didn't play it to 100%.\n\nIn long:\nThe game itself is as bad as usual - barely any practical options (not even fullscreen), a LOT of bugs, and like with the LEGO games from other franchises, if you don't know the franchise itself - in this case the story of the actual movie - you will most likely have trouble following all the way through. Oh, and it still changes the Windows 7 color scheme to the basic color scheme, for whatever reason. Seems familiar? This shouldn't even be an issue!\n\nThe cutscenes were taken from the movie. While they were nice in the movie theater, it's rubbish in this game. Come on, you guys had the models from the game and even the sounds, would it have been too much to ask to animate it with proper 3D models and "full" framerate (as full as it gets in the recent LEGO games) instead of using the stop motion movie scenes? It doesn't fit in with the rest of the game! Aside from that, Milhouse was blurred out in one of the cutscenes. There is so much wrong with that!\n\nThe gameplay is as repetitive and enjoyable as always. Contentwise this is barely a competition to other LEGO games. They don't even have the full skill wheel filled with skills!\n\nIf this goes down to 10€/10$/something like that, get it, otherwise this probably won't satisfy you. Do not expect anything good, it's the old LEGO game formula reskinned, and nothing else. The minigames have been swapped for a pacman-like one, and a stupid reaction game, disguised as "building by instruction". You just pick the necessary part out of a list of 8 parts. much fun. wow.\n\nThat being said: if I were a LEGO figure, I'd go for Lucy.

Why? cause the cut scens are taken directly from the film.  Now that's true for all the other movie based Lego movie games, but this mone more so mainly you are dasically playing the movie. The core game play is the same run around building or destroying objects. for some people that gets a little boring. But for fans of Lego the fun just never stops. All the voice actors from the movie reprise their rolls. Just like in the movie you get the pop culture references and charatures from other lego games like Batman Superman and Wonder Woman. Just like in every Lego game there is a lot of backtracking through the stages with different characters just to fully complete it. That means there is a lot of replay value.\n\nMY VERDICT:\n\niIf you're not a fan of Lego or the games  or the repeatitive game play or backtracking then this isnt ment for you. for the rest of you  i cannot recommend it enough.

They tried changing the game mechanics for the better, which is fine once in a while, but it just doesn't feel like a lego game. I'm switching to another character every 10 seconds so I can progress in the level. The worst part is the machines only robots can use. It's this small minigame where you hop around as a block on this puzzle and get to a battery while dodging the skull blocks, and they make you do this minigame way too much in the game. Some mechanics are good, like bigger hubs with cars and the ability to have like 8 people to pick from at once, also I like the bonus room. But overall, a lego game should not feel the way this game did. I've played so many lego games when I was younger, but this game was just irritating. The humor isn't witty like the old games. In the old games there were bonus rooms you looked forward to going to because there were special activies you could do, but in this game it almost feels like a drag to go to them because you have to constantly switch to different characters for their abilities...\n\nOverall Rating 7/10","November 14, 2014","false","9.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I'm not saying it's not playable but it's not as entertaining as the other titles. A kid might not think much of it, but for me the game reflected poorly.\n\nThe fact that they use clips from the movie rather than making cutscenes not only shows lazyness, it display the biggest issue with the game.\n\nPacing.\n\nThe thing with The Lego Movie that made it so great was not just the fact that it was beautifully made with CGI stop motion animation that made it look like it had been built, recorded and entirely made in stop motion animation, it was the fact that it didn't lock itself to 5 year olds or anything, the movie knew that there were lego fans as old as in their 50s out there so they couldn't just try and focus on the small range of 6-12 or something, they went for 6-30. A thing i loved about the movie was that it had a fast pacing, many might say it is merely to keep kids entertained since a child can't sitt still for more than 5 seconds, but i feel that making a movie like this fast you needed to have your head around what was going on, i know that my younger cousin who was about 8 years old when he saw the movie missed alot of things due to the pacing being fast, faster than what many children grow up with today.\n\nThe fast pacing as i see it is the directors and makers believing that their audience will be able to follow, it doesn't hold a kid's hand through out the film, it let their hand go and they needed to focus on the movie to understand it.\n\nNow, what does this rant have to do with this game?\n\nIt's pacing is too slow.. The game doesn't work when it display the fast pace of the film in cutscenes and then move at the slow paste of a normal lego game, it even moves slowler as they changed animation styles and things to match the feel of the movie more, and the animation movement of the characters here is slower than it is in any other lego game i've played.\n\nWhat doesn't aid it either is the fact that they need to force the song "Everything is Awesome" at you. Yes, we remember it from the movie, yes it was great. But that song is also fast paced and doesn't fit with the game, it also kills the fun with the song when you play it all the time making us grown tired of the song quickly.\n\n\nIf i remember correctly, the guys who made this movie wanted it to be just that. A movie, not any lego products related to it, not any merchandise or anything, but lego did anyway. And that ended up with this dull game which fails entirely to capture the feel or spirit around the Lego Movie.","May 25, 2015","false","1.4"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","13","29","0","0"

First off, this game feels like a poor movie to video game adaptation compared to the previous LEGO games like LEGO Indiana Jones or Lord of the Rings. I think the issue is that the game shackles itself to the movie and tries to follow it too closely, which breaks the whole theme of the movie which is about being creative with LEGOs. I think the game would have been much better off if it had been a prequel or parallel story of some sort that could better utilize the potential presented by the world of the LEGO movie.\n\nThis unsatisfying story is exacerbated by the rather pitiful overworld that is miniscule in comparison to other recent LEGO games like Lord of the Rings or Marvel Super Heroes. Bricksburg is all of two city blocks, the wild west is the town square, and cloud cuckoo land is two or three (small) clouds. There's a few side quests to do in these hubs, but they pale in comparison to the previously mentioned LEGO games and make this game about half as long in comparison.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the game has a surprisingly decent selection of vehicles that can be built from the treasures found in the missions but they can only be used in the bonus room (i.e. a kid's bedroom) which is basically sterile and devoid of interesting things to smash. A huge letdown from the bonus areas of the previous LEGO games.\n\nThis is all on top of the standard LEGO game bugs which required me to restart some of the missions partway through because a script wouldn't work and I would be stuck. The character creator is also fairly pitiful.\n\nThe one highlight of this game is that it adds giant mechs that can be used in some of the missions. Those would have been fun if Bricksburg had been a proper city and if the game allowed vehicles to be spawn in the hubs.\n\nOverall I was disappointed by this LEGO game and wouldn't recommend it unless you're trying to collect all the LEGO games. Even if you liked the LEGO movie, I would say go play some of the older LEGO action games or find an old LEGO creator game instead.\n","October 3, 2014","false","23.0"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","4","11","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/duufwarrior/recommended/267530/","duufwarrior","Jormungandr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/duufwarrior/","260 products in account","While it is fun, I must say this game was pretty badly made. There's always some kind of issue whether it's with insane pop-in or with AI which is completely useless to say the least. For example, in Free Play after one of the game's end missions you have to escape a construction site but half the objects don't generate for several minutes making it barely playable. Your AI friendos don't even make an attempt to attack the enemy and instead just stand around and die. Meanwhile the enemy AI either swarms you and does nothing or swarms your team AI and dies.\n\nIn terms of optimization this thing was terrible too. It took a while before this thing was even playable - It was locked at 1280x768 for crying out loud and you couldn't change it. And that isn't the only issue with the game's graphics, you have to make some major tweaks to make sure this game doesn't look blurry and fuzzy. Oh, and you can't access video options without actually starting the game.\n\nCharacter balancing is all over the place. Unikitty would be the only worthwhile character to play as if it weren't for the fact that the feline can't activate switches or climb certain "girl sections" such as jump walls and climbing walls. Metalbeard is extremely overpowered too. You really don't need to use anyone else after you find him because he kills everything, but if you want to move faster then your other option is Bad Cop who is nearly game-breaking. His laser straight-up instakills everything it touches making him extremely deadly. The gameplay is weird too, every now and then you get these puzzle sections which are just broken or badly thought out. For example, the enemy AI on the hacking game is TERRIBLE. They never accurately predict where to move and end up moving from one end of the map to the other. There is a "brick matching" minigame which requires ninja-esque reaction time to complete without losing studs and even then you will probably still lose some due to how unresponsive the game is. Lastly, there's the useless dancing sections. They are BROKEN. Broken, broken, broken. The opening one set in a construction site is barely responsive and the second, and last one is completely broken - You can't do anything but lose the game. They still haven't fixed that after quite a long time either.\n\nLastly, this is a HUGE spoiler for The Lego Movie. It literally uses entire major scenes from The Lego Movie instead of real cutscenes and they're presented in a crappy aspect ratio which makes them barely watchable and therefore useless.\n\nPlay it with your kids, they'll like it. It's long enough for them to be able to enjoy it but it's easy, has bad balancing, terrible optimization and bad puzzle design to match.","December 21, 2014","false","40.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

The Lego Movie Video Game isn't the movie. I've gotten many adults and kids to watch it with me and it never gets old. The Lego Movie is my favorite movie and the game was well... let me explain why I dislike the game. First some elements of the story just weren't there and others were just completely extended to where you're wondering 'this isn't the movie' and also other things were added to extend the game  (like the stupid sub level) . The game itself is a standard Lego game and that makes it perfectly fine. It's as good as say Lego Batman The Video Game. So for that reason you should get it. But things like not being able to use your mouse or funky menu layout is kind of frustrating. You can't access the graphics settings unless you go into a level. Also like most other movie tie-ins The Lego Movie Game used lots of scenes from the Lego Movie itself (but both were made out of bricks so I think that's why they did it). The main reason I don't recommend it is that, The Lego Movie was great and I'm not saying the game isn't, I'm saying it's not as good. And really The Lego Movie Video Game is just a Lego Game.\n^\n|\n(Honestly this doesn't matter because this is just personal opinion, also if you haven't watch the movie before you play the game.

The animations are astonishing, the graphics are beautiful, the characters are very likable, (if you like the movie) I could just go on about all the minor details that make this game great. The only real thing I don't like is the overworlds, yes there might be more than one, but they are kind of small and considering it's not really a long movie, there aren't many levels. I'm not saying the levels aren't awesome, (cause they are) it's just that when you complete a lego game and get all the characters, you really just look foward to playing the levels again, but since there isn't that many levels in this one, really you'll just end up screwing around in the overworlds. But believe me I still enjoy it, It's just ganna be a little while before you want to play it again after completing it. I give this game an 7.5/10 which in my opinion is a pretty apropriate rating for this game. Please excuse me for any mistakes in my english, I'm German.

If you didn't watch the movie, you'd only understand bits of the story that made the film good. If you watched the movie, which you should, that's less of a problem, but a little bugging nonetheless.\nSpeaking of 'bugging', this game is the worst in terms of bugs that I've seen in the series so far.\nWent an unexpected way with a character? Restart level. Event simply doesn't trigger? Restart level. Stuff doesn't happen? Hack around in a way that shouldn't be necessary in order to not have to restart the level.\n\nBut all the bad things aside, the Lego games by Traveller's Tales never really disappoint. Relaxed play through the story and an hour or two of fun studs grinding in the end... that's 15 hours until 100% with all achievements here.\nSo if you watched the movie and liked it, you can't really go wrong when this game is on sale for seven bucks.","September 20, 2014","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even more fun if you have purchased a Lego Movie set that has a code inside to unlock secret characters. I have Emmet's Construct-O-Mech, which came with a code for unlocking Angry Kitty. Very fun to play as, especially when you consider that she gives early access to "rainbow brick" builds. (And the way she walks is simply adorable.)\n\nThe only real problem I faced with this game is that it CRASHES MY ENTIRE COMPUTER EVERY TIME I ATTEMPT TO COMPLETE THE FIRST OBJECTIVE IN THE FIRST STAGE. The tutorial stage with Vitruvius, Cleopatra, and Shakespeare works fine, and I haven't run into any issues in the Bricksburg hub yet, even when playing as Angry Kitty, but in the stage "Bricksburg Construction" my screen turns pink and staticy every time I fix the "delivery tube" (or sometimes when I just get too close to it), which is literally the first objective in that stage. I am unable to switch programs or bring up a task manager when this happens, and attempting to wait it out results in my monitor becoming disconnected.\n\nIn summary, great game with lots of fun characters and voice acting, if you don't mind not actually being able to play it.\n\nEdit: I managed to work around the bug, sort of. By maxing out the graphics options, I have moved the bug from a static location to random intervals. I can progress, but only a little bit at at time before the bug pops up and crashes my computer. What I have managed to play was fun, but I still can't recommend buying this bug-fest at full price.","September 24, 2014","false","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It shows parts of the film that were skipped over slightly and allows for exageration on the levels. The open world sector of the game doesn't do as much credit to the game as some of the others. It seems to have become a little meshed between the Marvel open world and the starwars style cantena. It offers different challenges such as finding the bonus bricks in the open world but also creating the builds.\n\nThe building is not as good as previous games. I understand the need for the master builders and the instruction builds but the instruction builds with the enforced money timer and difficult to use reel of items can make it slightly infuriating to play.\n\nThere are occasional times also i have found during playthrough where the commands were not being done or there are too many characters for an easy changeover, there was one point where my character could not get out of a vehicle they had entered.\n\nAn interesting take on the movie. Not one of their better LEGO games but worth a play through if you enjoyed the film. Just get it when it is silly cheap!","September 4, 2014","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems a lot more childish than the past games, I know a lot of 'lego' is aimed at younger children but the other games and a lot of lego products themselves are usualyl bought by older audiences.\n\nThe fact that the cutscenes are from the movie kind of annoys me, I feel like the game was made very quickly without much testing or overlooking at all, I'm on level 2 and I have found a lot of bugs already. I've also found that the controls for this game are extremely annoying, mainly because I am used to being able to change them to be able to use the left click for the action button, sadly I am unable to do that in this game.\n\nAlthough most of this review has been 'bad', I would suggest buying this game for a younger audience other than an older audience like most of the other games. If they were to fix some bugs and allow me to change the 'action' button to left mouse click that would also make me very happy.\n\nI plan to play through the entire game, so this review may change in the future, but for now, this is my thoughts on the game.","July 26, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It basically follows the movie, scene by scene and adds more content through gameplay.\n\nI will say some of the instructions were lost on me until the very end.  Like how unikitty, when enraged can destroy gold blocks with her fire attack.\n\nBatman, can I say more?  Also you will find yourself using batman all the time.  His long range attack will destroy any item and send the bits directly to your collection, saving on collection time.\n\nAlso unikitty's long range attack can be used to cheat a bit, since she will "jump" to the target, so if there is a destroyable item over a chasm, you can use her to reach it.\n\nThe menus are not very informative, except maybe a few will say (laser) or some other attribute, but unless you know "Ice Cream Jo" can put out fires, you don't know why to ever use her.\n\nIt's simple to play and dying isn't a problem.

It also contains 96 charecters (Not trying to spoil) Some of them were barley even shown on the movie, or video game but are still playable!Lego games that are co-op,adventure and actions are my favorite types, like this one.Also along with lego the hobbit,Marvel Super Heroes,Lord of the rings, Lego batman 1 and 2 and finnaly Lego Harry Potter:Years 1-4 and Years 5-7.This game is pretty funny, you get to wear pants that give you special effects (More Spoils) Like theirs one with a fart effect, (My favorite, must jump for sound effect) a drilling effect,music and those 3 are the only ones im going to say so. BOOHOO TO YOU!Anyway,They also added charecters from Ninjago,Dc Universe and more! (Also Hobbit :3) YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!! You should know who this guy is if your in a Super Lego FanCLUB like me :3! Also my favorite part, you get to become the villains Like Robots, The Last and final (Powerful) Boss, President Business and LORD Business.Their are also 4 free worlds to explore, including bonus room. (Unlock Bonus Room by completeing games story mode.) So That Means...., Lego Brick Adventures! Their is 20 red bricks......... Sometimes i call them deadpool bricks because i play Lego MARVEL Super heroes to, (I got all of them) Before i go like i said, Overall the game is 9/10 to me, let me hear your thoughts!!!!!!! :_) (Watch the movie first to understand some gameplay or clips) Just a reminder :D","September 20, 2014","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even more fun if you have purchased a Lego Movie set that has a code inside to unlock secret characters. I have Emmet's Construct-O-Mech, which came with a code for unlocking Angry Kitty. Very fun to play as, especially when you consider that she gives early access to "rainbow brick" builds. (And the way she walks is simply adorable.)\n\nThe only real problem I faced with this game is that it CRASHES MY ENTIRE COMPUTER EVERY TIME I ATTEMPT TO COMPLETE THE FIRST OBJECTIVE IN THE FIRST STAGE. The tutorial stage with Vitruvius, Cleopatra, and Shakespeare works fine, and I haven't run into any issues in the Bricksburg hub yet, even when playing as Angry Kitty, but in the stage "Bricksburg Construction" my screen turns pink and staticy every time I fix the "delivery tube" (or sometimes when I just get too close to it), which is literally the first objective in that stage. I am unable to switch programs or bring up a task manager when this happens, and attempting to wait it out results in my monitor becoming disconnected.\n\nIn summary, great game with lots of fun characters and voice acting, if you don't mind not actually being able to play it.\n\nEdit: I managed to work around the bug, sort of. By maxing out the graphics options, I have moved the bug from a static location to random intervals. I can progress, but only a little bit at at time before the bug pops up and crashes my computer. What I have managed to play was fun, but I still can't recommend buying this bug-fest at full price.","September 24, 2014","false","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It shows parts of the film that were skipped over slightly and allows for exageration on the levels. The open world sector of the game doesn't do as much credit to the game as some of the others. It seems to have become a little meshed between the Marvel open world and the starwars style cantena. It offers different challenges such as finding the bonus bricks in the open world but also creating the builds.\n\nThe building is not as good as previous games. I understand the need for the master builders and the instruction builds but the instruction builds with the enforced money timer and difficult to use reel of items can make it slightly infuriating to play.\n\nThere are occasional times also i have found during playthrough where the commands were not being done or there are too many characters for an easy changeover, there was one point where my character could not get out of a vehicle they had entered.\n\nAn interesting take on the movie.

It seems a lot more childish than the past games, I know a lot of 'lego' is aimed at younger children but the other games and a lot of lego products themselves are usualyl bought by older audiences.\n\nThe fact that the cutscenes are from the movie kind of annoys me, I feel like the game was made very quickly without much testing or overlooking at all, I'm on level 2 and I have found a lot of bugs already. I've also found that the controls for this game are extremely annoying, mainly because I am used to being able to change them to be able to use the left click for the action button, sadly I am unable to do that in this game.\n\nAlthough most of this review has been 'bad', I would suggest buying this game for a younger audience other than an older audience like most of the other games. If they were to fix some bugs and allow me to change the 'action' button to left mouse click that would also make me very happy.\n\nI plan to play through the entire game, so this review may change in the future, but for now, this is my thoughts on the game.","July 26, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/recommended/267530/","mokushiroku","Moku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/","694 products in account","The Lego Movie Game is, sadly, one of the worst Lego games to have come out for a while, on par with some of the first to be released. This game is first and foremost a movie tie-in, make no mistake. There is no original story, movie clips are used instead of in-game cutscenes, and don't expect any inivation beyond two bland mini-games.\n\nI've loved all the Lego games so far, and I got this one with the express purpose to play as Unikitty, and on that it delivered. What it didn't deliver is that scope that we've come to expect from modern Lego games, such as sprawling open worlds, a large cast of characters, and a host of special skills that are drip-fed to you throughout. Let's look at these in more detail:\n\nThe character select screen may seem healthy, boasting 90-odd characters, but take a moment to consider who these characters are. Most are generic citizens who got mere seconds of screen time, or the mini-figured you find in the blind bags: Panda Man, Taco Tuesday Guy, and Larry the Barista are among the memorable characters you can play as, who only differ in apperance and the object they throw. The main character Emmet has not one, not three, but thirteen variations, all seperate (unlike most Lego games that stack variations of the same character on one spot) and all exactly the same, with two exceptions. Also, only the main characters have facial animations, and not even they get lip-synching when they talk.\n\nThe world is divided into four areas and a bonus zone; Bricksburg, The Old West, Cloud Coocooland and the Octan Tower. These areas consist of more or less two rooms, with missions scattered around, with no central 'hub' to begin them. Characters are bought from the character select screen, as with the newer games, but the mini-figures can also be found scattered around to buy in-person, which is completely redundant. Within 10-hours of gameplay, taking my time, I have already finished the game, bought all the characters, and bought all the red blocks, making this the shortest Lego game I've ever played (and I've played most).\n\nThe unique skills in this game are nothing mind-blowing: silver needs explosives, gold needs a laser, only construction-workers can repair, only women can be acrobatic (that's right, Batman cannot climb walls or jump around), only Master Builders can make objects, only Unikitty can use rainbow blocks, etc. etc. All very standard and mostly things we've seen before, too. Aside from Lord Buisness, who you get at the end of the game, most bonus obstacles can be cleared by the half-way point, let's say 6-hours in. It's a Lego game, so obviously you'll be going back and playing it all a second time in Free Play mode to unlock everything, but this certainly won't take anywhere near as long as the comparative colossus, Lego Batman 2.\n\n\n~In summation: This is a game for people who loved the movie. You'll get to see it all again and play with characters you probably won't otherwise get to, such as Unikitty. The gameplay is exactly as you'd expect, nothing breaks the formula, and anything new is few and far between. And you'd best hope you like the soundtrack, because you'll be hearing three particular songs an awful lot. In short: It's silly, short fun, but don't expect much more for you money beyond a playable advertisment. I recommend it because it is exactly what it is: It's not great, but it's not bad either, but it most certainly IS a movie tie-in game, and should be treated as such.","July 30, 2014","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

In this game the story adheres to the movie's story rather well, and uses cutscenes from the movie too, which is a nice touch.\n\nThe game follows the same formula of platforming with action sequences and linear level designs that is common in other LEGO games, although the main quest was noticably shorter than the others I have played; it took me just under 30 hours to finish the story and go back through the levels to find the collectibles and unlock every achievement. I have also noticed there are less levels and they are dragged out to be longer than usual, which I personally didn't have an issue with.\n\nIn some areas, things have changed a bit. The game's presented in a similar manner than that of the movie. The characters are modeled in what seems to be a more realistic form, and their movements match that of the movie's. In addition, almost everything is gorgeously rendered in LEGO form and is a marvel to analyze. Batman also provides some hilarious commentary at times. Fans of the movie should feel right at home.\n\n\n\nOut of the LEGO series of games, I\n\nLoved:\nLEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham\nLEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars\nThe LEGO Movie - Videogame\n\nLiked:\nLEGO Batman\nLEGO MARVEL Super Heroes\nLEGO Star Wars\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\nDisliked:\nLEGO Indiana Jones 2","August 1, 2014","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The animations are astonishing, the graphics are beautiful, the characters are very likable, (if you like the movie) I could just go on about all the minor details that make this game great. The only real thing I don't like is the overworlds, yes there might be more than one, but they are kind of small and considering it's not really a long movie, there aren't many levels. I'm not saying the levels aren't awesome, (cause they are) it's just that when you complete a lego game and get all the characters, you really just look foward to playing the levels again, but since there isn't that many levels in this one, really you'll just end up screwing around in the overworlds. But believe me I still enjoy it, It's just ganna be a little while before you want to play it again after completing it.

It seems a lot more childish than the past games, I know a lot of 'lego' is aimed at younger children but the other games and a lot of lego products themselves are usualyl bought by older audiences.\n\nThe fact that the cutscenes are from the movie kind of annoys me, I feel like the game was made very quickly without much testing or overlooking at all, I'm on level 2 and I have found a lot of bugs already. I've also found that the controls for this game are extremely annoying, mainly because I am used to being able to change them to be able to use the left click for the action button, sadly I am unable to do that in this game.\n\nAlthough most of this review has been 'bad', I would suggest buying this game for a younger audience other than an older audience like most of the other games. If they were to fix some bugs and allow me to change the 'action' button to left mouse click that would also make me very happy.\n\nI plan to play through the entire game, so this review may change in the future, but for now, this is my thoughts on the game.","July 26, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In my opinion, The LEGO Movie Videogame is just another LEGO game; and thus has all the fun things you’d come to expect from one. Everything is good, well written and fun. The story is basically the same as the movie with a few minor changes to fit the game format. The gameplay is what you would expect, fun co-op, puzzle solving and of course, smashing everything in sight. The game has a semi-open world, that is very diverse, ranging from literal sunshines and rainbows to the desert heat of the wild west.\n\nThe most defining feature of this game is the visual style, borrowed from the movie. Most LEGO games tend to have a mix of brick built objects and non-brick objects. However, this one stands out; due to being visually represented entirely by LEGO elements (save for the bonus level). Even the character animations are decisively LEGO, differing greatly from how characters move in other LEGO games.\n\nUnfortunately, aside from its distinct style, The LEGO Movie Videogame is just another LEGO game. It doesn’t change much from the formula and as such feels like an almost copy and paste from other previous games. There’s nothing wrong with the game, it’s just… average. There’s just not enough to make it stand out in the crowd of LEGO games. It’s not bad or below standard, just… average.\n\nAll in all, if you like LEGO games then, let’s face it, you’ve probably already bought this game. If you don’t mind the occasional LEGO game then there are better LEGO games to play. That’s not to say i don’t recommend getting this game, it still has its merit and is just as good as any LEGO game before it. So if you see it on sale, just give it a go; you won't be disappointed.","January 17","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Star Wars, Middle Earth, Batman, you name it- in each LEGO game you get what could best be described as an affectionate parody, with MiniFigs and an awful lot of brick.-smashing. And The LEGO Movie Videogame is just the same, with all the good and the bad this brings.\n\nThe LMV follows the basic plot of the movie: Normal everyday construction worker Emmet is pulled into an ancient prophecy that claims him to be the only one to save the world from a doomsday weapon called "The Kragle". Despite being utterly unqualified for the job he does his best, and hilarity ensues.\n\nIf you know the movie (and you should) you'll find it hard not to smile a few minutes into the game. The complete cast is there, the setpieces are amazing and occasionally outshine the movie, the voice acting is pitch perfect and the undiluted charme of giant scenery build out of LEGO is as ever-present as ever. The game looks amazing and pulls a lot of awesome scenes together to form a narrative that is pretty close to the movie.\n\nAs per usual, you control a growing cast of characters, each with their own ability set. Emmet can build sturdy objects with the proper instructions, and can smash through special bricks with his drill. Wyldstyle has some extra agility and can jump and climb on certain ledges, Batman gets his ever-useful Batarangs and grappling ropes, and so on. Using and combining these abilities make the bulk of the level's challenge, and the game does a good job of adding layers to the formula as the cast expands.\n\nControls, also as usual, are nice and tight enough. The keyboard is a bit inferior to a good gamepad, but both work in a pinch. Switching characters and pulling off their moves is easily learned, and the game goes the extra mile to pop up tooltips if you keep missing a hint. Despite the cheerful toy aesthetic children will probably be overwhelmed by the action. There is always somethign going on, there is always something to do, and while death is cheap (you only lose a couple of studs, which are the in-game currency for everything) there is a certain difficulty here, a tad bit too easy for older, experienced players and a tad bit too hard for someone who's just learning the ropes.\n\nWith a ton of unlockable characters, mission and freeplay game modes, and downright over-the-top-awesomeness, the LMV should be easy to recommend: It is an awesome game and filled to the brim with charme and action.\nStill, I need to stress that this game makes not exactly much sense if you do not know the movie. And even IF you know the movie, you'll have a hard time following events, so much that the levels stop being a string of related missions and instead become little self-contained bits connected with (occasionally edited) movie footage.\nAnd this is odd, because the game clearly knows what it is doing. The movie has a bike chase, which is awesome. The game stretches this chase over a whole level, and adds to it, and makes it just twice as awesome because this time, it's you playing that scene. I would have loved to see the team make their own plot, with in-game rendered cutscenes, and maybe explore the LEGO world a bit more.\n\nStill, this is nitpicking. The fun is there, and chasing down all achievements and unlockables will take a while- and this is a game where you abseil into a LEGO chicken, get encased in a rainbow eggshell, have a unicorn-cat smash that eggshell and build a toy-mouse car out of the bricks, which you can then ride, as Batman, all the while grumbling how rainbows are soo corny.\nNeed I say more?","September 27, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this game the story adheres to the movie's story rather well, and uses cutscenes from the movie too, which is a nice touch.\n\nThe game follows the same formula of platforming with action sequences and linear level designs that is common in other LEGO games, although the main quest was noticably shorter than the others I have played; it took me just under 30 hours to finish the story and go back through the levels to find the collectibles and unlock every achievement. I have also noticed there are less levels and they are dragged out to be longer than usual, which I personally didn't have an issue with.\n\nIn some areas, things have changed a bit. The game's presented in a similar manner than that of the movie. The characters are modeled in what seems to be a more realistic form, and their movements match that of the movie's. In addition, almost everything is gorgeously rendered in LEGO form and is a marvel to analyze. Batman also provides some hilarious commentary at times. Fans of the movie should feel right at home.\n\n\n\nOut of the LEGO series of games, I\n\nLoved:\nLEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham\nLEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars\nThe LEGO Movie - Videogame\n\nLiked:\nLEGO Batman\nLEGO MARVEL Super Heroes\nLEGO Star Wars\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\nDisliked:\nLEGO Indiana Jones 2","August 1, 2014","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just like with most of them, they are simple, fun, and easy. This is the optimal "feel-good" game in my opinion. One that you can quickly beat in a few days, and complete shortly after. One thing I've always enjoyed about this games are the way they let you break the game with the strongest characters the game has to offer. This game is no different, and is still quite enjoyable.\n\nHowever, if you do not find the characters charming in any way, you will be quickly annoyed by how often they talk during levels. Offering quips, moral support, and hand-holding throughout each of the 15 levels. I personally found it a little much near the end, but it is a children's game after all.\n\nIf you're looking for something new from the Lego games, this one isn't the one you are looking for. But if you are looking for a fun, simple, and enjoyable game, then this is for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/docscott16/recommended/267530/","docscott16","Scottish Doktah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/docscott16/","123 products in account","The LEGO Movie Videogame is another game in the prolific Lego Platformer series. Just like with most of them, they are simple, fun, and easy. This is the optimal "feel-good" game in my opinion. One that you can quickly beat in a few days, and complete shortly after. One thing I've always enjoyed about this games are the way they let you break the game with the strongest characters the game has to offer. This game is no different, and is still quite enjoyable.\n\nHowever, if you do not find the characters charming in any way, you will be quickly annoyed by how often they talk during levels. Offering quips, moral support, and hand-holding throughout each of the 15 levels. I personally found it a little much near the end, but it is a children's game after all.\n\nIf you're looking for something new from the Lego games, this one isn't the one you are looking for. But if you are looking for a fun, simple, and enjoyable game, then this is for you. It's a bonus if you enjoyed the Lego Movie as well!","January 3","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In my opinion, The LEGO Movie Videogame is just another LEGO game; and thus has all the fun things you’d come to expect from one. Everything is good, well written and fun. The story is basically the same as the movie with a few minor changes to fit the game format. The gameplay is what you would expect, fun co-op, puzzle solving and of course, smashing everything in sight. The game has a semi-open world, that is very diverse, ranging from literal sunshines and rainbows to the desert heat of the wild west.\n\nThe most defining feature of this game is the visual style, borrowed from the movie. Most LEGO games tend to have a mix of brick built objects and non-brick objects. However, this one stands out; due to being visually represented entirely by LEGO elements (save for the bonus level). Even the character animations are decisively LEGO, differing greatly from how characters move in other LEGO games.\n\nUnfortunately, aside from its distinct style, The LEGO Movie Videogame is just another LEGO game. It doesn’t change much from the formula and as such feels like an almost copy and paste from other previous games. There’s nothing wrong with the game, it’s just… average. There’s just not enough to make it stand out in the crowd of LEGO games. It’s not bad or below standard, just… average.\n\nAll in all, if you like LEGO games then, let’s face it, you’ve probably already bought this game. If you don’t mind the occasional LEGO game then there are better LEGO games to play. That’s not to say i don’t recommend getting this game, it still has its merit and is just as good as any LEGO game before it. So if you see it on sale, just give it a go; you won't be disappointed.","January 17","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just like with most of them, they are simple, fun, and easy. This is the optimal "feel-good" game in my opinion. One that you can quickly beat in a few days, and complete shortly after. One thing I've always enjoyed about this games are the way they let you break the game with the strongest characters the game has to offer. This game is no different, and is still quite enjoyable.\n\nHowever, if you do not find the characters charming in any way, you will be quickly annoyed by how often they talk during levels. Offering quips, moral support, and hand-holding throughout each of the 15 levels. I personally found it a little much near the end, but it is a children's game after all.\n\nIf you're looking for something new from the Lego games, this one isn't the one you are looking for. But if you are looking for a fun, simple, and enjoyable game, then this is for you. It's a bonus if you enjoyed the Lego Movie as well!","January 3","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's certainly a Lego game worth getting if you have the other games, but if you don't... this is sort of the middle of the road of them. It's got two problems:\n\n1: The movie it's based on is just a single movie, so there's rather a lot of filler involved. It's not Indiana Jones 2 level of filler, but there's a good few levels that are based off of very minor scenes in the movie.\n\n2: It doesn't feel as polished. The most obvious example is that it takes its cutscenes straight from the movie, rather than animating them in-game, and it really doesn't work so well. But there's other stuff too, like a bit more bugs than usual and the humour isn't as good as normal.\n\nOn the flipside, unlike the other Lego games, EVERYTHING in this one is made of Lego!

I love the added features like the Building Instructions and the Pacman-style hacking mini-game which are both really fun and break up the casual gameplay which can get boring after a while. I also really like the level design which means the game is not too difficult but easy enough that I can keep on playing and is the only Lego game I\'ve played so far that I literally couldn\'t put down. I\'m also not a big fan of the massively open-world Lego games as I can easily get lost and I won\'t know where to go but this game shows where to go easily.\n\nThe only criticism I would give is that the setting menu is lacking, especially for PC users but this is present throughout all of the Lego games. The default keys are also lacking but I also have my own setup which works for me as well as a controller which I sometimes use. I also couldn\'t find the resolution settings in game which I think should be more obvious as I ended up playing in the wrong one for half of the game. I also came across a few bugs but they weren\'t game breaking and didn\'t require me to restart the level (like Uni-kitty getting stuck in places, but this was easily fixed by just jumping out, even thought it took a while).\n\nOverall I do recommend this game to people who like Lego games as it does offer a slightly different formula to the original games we all know and love and I would love to see this same formula reused again (perhaps using the same characters but with a new story?)","June 1","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
