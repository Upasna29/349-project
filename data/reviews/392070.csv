"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/392070/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Pumped BMX + is a fast platformer that revolves around controlling your BMX bike and doing as many tricks as you can without crashing, while riding towards a finish.\n\nGameplay-wise it's similar to another popular indie game, OlliOlli. I've played it on Xbox 360 Controller and the controls felt really great, speed control is handled with one button, left stick is used for balancing and right stick is used to do specific tricks in the air. The game is responding to every button press precisely and I haven't seen any problems related to possible bad latency. (Don't worry, the game runs with 60 FPS without problems.)\n\nLength of the game seems to be nice, there are 5 sets of levels and every level has a set of easy, normal and hard challenges - completing each level challenges for specific difficulty unlocks the harder challenges. This way, you'll gladly replay all levels multiple times and you won't even mind, as you really have to try to be better and usually do some specific tricks. This is a delight option for players who don't care about the score, they still get enough motivation to replay levels.\n\nYou might be afraid of higher difficulty, which obviously you can expect on hard challenges, but the frustration doesn't come so easily, as you can restart any level in a second. There's no time to rest, you can beat everything!\n\nVisuals look really nice for the game (check screenshots and make your own opinion), the soundtrack contains mostly electronic music with electroswing influence. Achievement are well designed, as there aren't any laughable easy ones - each achievement really requires to do something challenging.\n\nIt's been several months since the game have been released and it's sad that it didn't get much attention from players, because it's a really nice game that's entertaining even for people who doesn't play bike/skateboard platformers. Recommended!\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 31","true","0.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Loads of little port bugs I keep running across and very limited resolution choices is a bit discouraging though.  Hopefully the dev will fix up all the minor glitches, nothing game breaking.  First off, while using the keyboard/mouse to navigate the tutorial menus, I got stuck in the level selction screen, clicking on levels or back or select and keyboard controls all made clicks but did nothing, had to force close game.  Switched to gamepad and was able to navigate the menus, but during the tutorial, it kept saying things like "For big tricks press #NotInString#Glyph.xb1 or something to that effect, forcing me to guess through the controls.","September 18, 2015","true","0.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It's much more difficult than the mobile version! It's really tough to get your head around the controls.\n\nIt's a pure port, the levels are generally the same but the dirtjumps are mostly replaced with wooden ramps.  Everything is as expected. I wish the levels would have changed a bit, but oh well.\n\nWould recommend for $10, being able to play essentially the mobile game on a large screen with controller was well worth it.","September 19, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The colors pop out and add that sense of immersion.\n\nTricks vary from form to form, and are either easy, or hard to pull off and chain together.\n\n","January 29","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/junt/recommended/392070/","junt","Junt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/junt/","48 products in account","This game would be fantastic if it weren't for the incredibly high difficulty. There's three modes, Easy/Medium/Hard but you wouldn't know it from the titles They should be relabled to "Hard/Hard/Hard" These levels are so hard to complete and are based on extreme precision. The overall feel of the game is wonderful and feels great to pull off tricks but if your velocity is just a SMIDGEN off you will fail the level. This kid can't ride his bike uphill what so-ever which adds to the frustration. It's not hard to pull of the requested tricks and points, but just to complete the level itself is the diffcultly.\n\nI wish there was a level editor so I could give the middle finger to the devs and design levels I actually want to play.","February 14","false","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"
