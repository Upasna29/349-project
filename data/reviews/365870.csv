A complicated adventure with a twisted plot, spanning across several levels ? Yep. A torture chamber filled with deadly traps ? Why not ! A pixel art gallery that you visit on a moving platform as player-made music plays ? Definitely !\n\nThe game feels rewarding both as a player and as a creator, as several good ideas were used.\nAs you complete levels and gather the shurikens scattered around them, your character will level up and unlock new moves (sword attacks, flying tricks...) and you will be granted access to deeper levels.\nWhen you create a level, people can play through it, apply tags to it from a list, and leave a comment. And you, the creator, get trophy points that you can spend to buy new things to use in your levels.\n\nAll in all, it's a very addicting and creative game that you can explore in various ways depending on your mood.\n\nGreatly recommended ! :)","May 14, 2015","true","13.4"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

Why? Because it perfectly appeals to the ADHD gamer in me. It's got a very slick engine with tight controls that feel just perfect with a keyboard or gamepad, but what's really astounding is the content.\n\nOh my god. So much content. From the developers and users.\n\nI mean levels based on music, pixel art museums, stories, quests, you name it, it's in here, and it's FUN. You can rate levels once you're done with them, and even make your own. Your ninja gains levels and skills while exploring all these adventures as well, so it's a perfect carrot and stick combination.\n\nI'll be playing this game for a very long time to come, and you should totally check it out if you like platformers, creation tools or just fun gameplay.\n\nOh also, you can try a browser version for free to get a feel for it: https://game.belowkryll.com/","September 14, 2015","true","5.8"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","20","23","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seeric/recommended/365870/","seeric","Seeric","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seeric/","1183 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI think it might be best to start this review with the following message: If you at all enjoy action platformers and/or games which focus upon player-created content then Below Kryll is absolutely worth the asking price.\n\n\nI have easily spent several dozen hours on Below Kryll (most of which is from before its Steam launch) and even after having spent this much time with the game it is difficult for me to find much in the way of fault with it. The game has a neat, unique look to it and Mitsu, the main character, animates particularly well without prioritizing animation over input. The music and general sound effects are also well-made, though there is not at this time too much in the way of track variety.\n\nGameplay and exploration are the parts where Below Kryll really shines. Mitsu has quite a bit of momentum to his movement to the point that the controls take a bit of getting used to and they might initially feel overly slippery when trying to do more precise platforming. However, abilities such as an air dash and kunai throwing (which completely stops Mitsu's momentum) as well as a few other tricks allow you to both move quickly and precisely.\n\nSpeaking of tricks, Mitsu has quite a few of them as experience is gained from completing areas and new abilities are unlocked along the way. In addition to dashing both in the air and on the ground as well as throwing kunai to stun enemies (not to mention several other skills), Mitsu can jump and slide off of certain walls, grind rails, perform a downward diving attack, and even chain together multiple dashes and jumps by killing enemies in the air; the playerbase has also found quite a few creative ways to utilize Mitsu's varied skillset and maps generally do a good job of both teaching and incorporating these skills, such as using the downward thrust to slightly extend the horizontal movement of a jump to create a 'long jump'.\n\nThis extensive skillset is particularly important largely because of just how much freedom it gives players when creating areas. If it is not already apparent, the vast majority of the content in Below Kryll is created by the playerbase and incorporated into a giant interconnected metroidvania-style grid with each area being a single rectangle on the grid. As Mitsu's skillset is so varied and flexible, areas which focus upon combat, platforming, and/or puzzle solving are all equally viable and can range anywhere in difficulty from trivial to insanely hard\n\nAs for the creation side of things itself, it is handled well and making a new area is simply and intuitive. Upon reaching an unclaimed rectangle on the grid, players can pay some gold to reserve it and start building. Which enemies, traps, and objects can be placed in a room are determined by just where on the map you are placing your room as more dangerous or tricky objects and enemies are reserved for deeper floors. Otherwise, creating an area is largely a matter of  clicking and dragging to clear or create terrain and to place objects and logic gates.\n\nLastly, there are a lot of little touches in Below Kryll which serve to give it the polish which many similar games lack. Reviving at the most recent checkpoint after dying requires the press of a single button and is otherwise instantaneous; players can even reset the stage completely or warp back to a checkpoint without dying at any time. If a stage has pits, players can quickly toggle between treating them as death pits or as paths to a new area. Although players cannot yet directly interact with each other, there are chatrooms and players can see the shadows of each other in real time when moving through the same area.\n\nAll of this adds up to a game which is not only a unique and interesting concept, but one which is executed very well in practice; as the content is primarily community-made not all of it is great and there are some parts of the game, such as the main storyline, which are still being worked on, but Below Kryll excels in all the most crucial areas and is simply a joy to both play and to create in.","June 3, 2015","true","15.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyoberon/recommended/365870/","ladyoberon","LadyOberon [#GamersRule]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyoberon/","2871 products in account","Below Kryll has been a very pleasant surprise for me. This is one of those games that sneaks up on you right at the moment when you realize just how big the gameworld and possibilities really are.\n\nFrom a graphics standpoint, the game has a very retro-feel. The graphics aren't flashy, but they certainly do the job, creating a pixelated world to get lost in. The soundtrack is average, but I don't play these kinds of games for the soundtrack anyway, so that's not really a negative for me, though it is definitely relevant to a review like this.\n\nThe control scheme is better than average, advertising partial controller support, which is accurate. The control settings offer both standard and emulator keyboard settings with an ability to remap controls and built-in gamepad support for forward motion, jumping, dashing, wall-jumping, and other combat moves as these are unlocked with game advancement. Players will likely need to use their keyboard for menus, inventory, character stats, and maps.\n\nWhere Below Kryll really excels is in the content department. Between the regular developer-made levels, side quests, collectibles, and achievements, sandbox mode, and the player-developed worlds, there's a whole lot of content to both see and create here.\n\nGameplay is not complicated, but it is challenging, and it's certainly not boring. Just when you think you've got everything figured out, new levels, items, quests, and abilities unlock opening up new adventures and possibilities.\n\nThere are some cerebral components to the game, too, especially with timing, agility, and the creativity component.\n\nProblem-solvers and experienced gamers are very likely to find a challenge here in the form of collectibles, items, abilities, and additional content, while casual gamers can very easily enjoy the game even without experiencing everything the game has to offer.\n\nRegardless of what type of gamer you are, if you enjoy platforrmers, puzzle-platformers, RPGs, Ninja combat styles, collectibles, achievements, and player-developed content, such as that created in the Steam Workshop, I'd recommend giving Below Kryll a try.\n\n\n*This review is featured on the curator page of Review Experts.","April 26","true","1.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

I've always loved games where the player gets creative freedom, and this one doesn't disappoint. Whether you like platforming, puzzles, story, music, art, it's all there! I do recommend you have some good platforming experience either way, and if you don't this game will teach it to you so no worries! Not only has playing been fun, but creating adventures for others to play has also been a blast. But one of the greatest things of all is the the Below Kryll community is one of the best game communities I have EVER been a part of.

I don't know why I was expecting very much. I was hoping that as a "metroidvania" there would be a fair amount of coherence with how the world is hooked together with, you know, actual exploration based gameplay. Sadly that is not the case. Every user created level is linked to other ones but you can teleport to the beginning and end point of each stage you have visited from your minimap so the whole layout is like a really dumb level selection gimmick instead of a large world. picture it as a world map where new levels are squares adjacent to squares you have already cleared.\n\nsome problems -\n\n- do you like levels "inspired" by all your other favorite media.  Replay the gimmicks from other games you may have enjoyed with clunkier physics!\n\n- oh man, I hope you like autoscrolling stuff where you watch the level move you around to play music and put on a show. That stuff has been around since mario rom-hacks and I hope it it worth paying $10 for you.\n\n- speaking of which I hope you like IP infringement. You will be hearing tons of soundtracks from other games and media all over the place. Hell, the tutorial itself has the final fantasy level up jingle in it and assumably that was created by this games actual creators. Neon Genesis Evangelion piano segment. Listen to it as you watch your character ride a moving platform for two solid minutes. etc. Again. Decide if this rom-hack quality experience is a thing worth paying for.\n\n- constant references to stupid internet things. unfortunately most of the "exploration gameplay" is really simple character conversatin triggers and door opening / object collection triggers. These are used to string together quests made of nauseating dialogue that try to be as tweee and Internet as possible.
