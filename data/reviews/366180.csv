"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/366180/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3933 products in account","Disposable Heroes is a simplistic rogue-lite with an enjoyable play-style and a fairly large amount of content.\n\nI'll start by saying though I'm enjoying Disposable Heroes very much I have to admit it does have it's problems, but I still find the game playable and keep finding myself playing 'just one more run'.\nThe gameplay itself is very simple, room by room you must destroy the enemies you're faced with using random weapons, potions and your own wiley movement skills!\nYou start by picking one of two characters (with two unlockable later) and then are popped right into the game. The levels start without telling you much but the game is pretty easy to work out. Defeat the enemies and advance  picking up items and weapons as you go along.\n\nThe game has an abundance of weapons, items and enemies to keep you busy and though the levels are predetermined there are minor RNG elements so there is re-playability. The balance is slightly off on some of the weapons so some are pretty useless imo and some are super overpowered but this is the case with pretty much every rogue-lite out there.\nYou collect gold throughout the levels and gold carries over after dying and can be spent at the market for various upgrades to make your gameplay a little easier so it's not the same grind over and over with nothing to show for it.\nThough lacking it story (and I mean completely lacking) the gameplay makes up for that as it doesn't pretend it's deep or well written it just does what it says on the front of the tin. It also has some fun achievements to get so achievement hunters should be pleased!\nDisposable Heroes has co-op as well as single player mode so you can play with another person locally which is appreciated because as I've said before local co-op is often overlooked these days in favour of online multiplayer which can die out very quickly.\n\nThe graphics are really simple and nothing to call home about but they work in a weirdly charming way. I also enjoyed the voice acting at the start even if it there was only a little of it, it definitely made me smile.\n\nNow onto the problems I've found. I have no idea if it's just me but I cannot cancel the intro EVERY time I start up the game.  Considering my sessions are around 10 minutes, having to watch a two minute intro every time gets annoying. Secondly is the instadeath that happens randomly without any warning. Some levels are designed very poorly and can result in your dying in under 5 seconds which can be hell if you're doing really really well or have weapons and items you like. And my final issue is the fact that once you clear a room it throws you right into the next room without allowing you to pick up any of the gold, chests or items that may have dropped. That is my biggest issue with the game as certain weapons are better than others and they spawn randomly so if a weapon spawns and your complete the level without grabbing it, it's gone and you're screwed.\nAll these issues can be fixed fairly easily though and I hope the developer takes note because it would make the game ten times as fun.\n\nWhilst I feel the game could have a little more content I definitely think it's very fun and worth grabbing when it's on sale. It isn't the easiest game out there but the challenge is an enjoyable one rather than a grindy one. Plenty of replayability for those quick relaxing rogue-lite sessions!","March 26","true","5.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

"as far as I know the game has only one developer for it and someone else for the music "\n\nWhat needs work - The game gets too difficult and unfair if you got close enough to a monster, because their attacks resets when they hit you, so if you're close enough they can land 14 hits in 1 second and you die instantly considering your character has no fade-time after taking a hit, same thing for any spike obstacle or trap.\n\n\n- At later levels the control scheme suddenly changed for me from arrows to wasd, I died without moving because I had no idea they'd change suddenly so this is a bug "on level 3 the cave"\n\n- The controls feels clunky with character movement, its not that easy to attack enemies though you'd get used to it but its still not as satisfying as you'd hope it to be.\n\n- I love the narrator's performance, but she doesn't really have to say everything you do it gets annoying, like when scrolling the main menu "1 player, 2 players, options " yeah those ... either reduce it or give an option to do so.\n\n- In certain levels that has traps throwing daggers or shooting lasers, considering that the character's movements are not as smooth as you'd hope it to be, it gets really tough to dodge them.\n\n- Due to the fact that enemy attacks has no cooldown and your character has no fade-effect when hit, you can die INSANELY fast if got too close to an enemy so you'll die a lot and feel frustrated from this unfair difficulty.\n\n- Having the controls on keyboard to use inventory potions set from 1 to 5 is not a good idea, I really died so many times without using them because the buttons are too far : |\n\n- Sometimes after picking up a potion or weapon then you try to walk over another one to pick it up, it don't work so you'd have to walk away and walk over it again.\n\n- Level transition is annoying to say the least, I mean the idea of moving to the next level automatically after killing the enemies is dumb, so much loot gets lost, however some levels requires you to reach the end to pass it.\n\n- I don't believe there is a button to get back to main menu, pressing esc only freeze's the game and the narrator says "take a break", screen stays the same just frozen, pressing F2 restarts the game, pressing - or + reduces window size, those are all weird but whatever.\n\n\nConclusion I know I mentioned a lot of things the game needs work on, try to remember this is an early access game and a new one nevertheless, so I am still expecting more updates and I know that most of those issues I talked about are simple to fix, so please don't let what I said shy you away from getting the game, it is really a lot of fun to play with a friend if you can ignore the unfair difficulty hoping it gets fixed soon.","December 18, 2015","true","5.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

This is also one of the most content-rich games I've seen on Early Acces. There are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of levels, minigames and weapons/special powers. Some of the weapons that can be found in the game are extremely fun to play with, such as the pew pew weapon and the holy cross.\n\nHowever it's still rough on the edges, there are some bugs and balancing issues (note this is still Early Access and it will probably fixed in the nearby future).

And the best point of this a full voiced story telling.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough  at the start you can choose from two character (also later you can unlock additional two). After that your goal is to kill all enemies at the current level and after that you are automatically teleport to next level (sometimes can be annoying if you dont grabbed all items). At the last level you will find a boss, after that when you kill him, you can go to the next stage. Levels and items what you can find mostly random generated, so if you do stage again, this be a bit different than before. Also you will find here a lot of different enemies and weapons. In the level you can also collect coins, what you can spend later in the market for some upgrades. You can play this game alone or with your friend also, thanks for a local coop. The game music is nice and sound is ok. Graphic style enough simple but not bad.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+ steam trading cards and achievements\n+ lot of different weapons\n+ lot of levels\n+ lot of different enemies\n+ full voiced story telling\n+ nice sounds and music\n+ coop mode\n\n- at some points to hard\n- a bit to simple graphic\n- a control system can be better\n- no online coop\n- auto teleport to the next level after complete\n\nThis game however from graphic style side looks like a little kid drawing can be enough enjoyable and addictive. If you like a rogue-lite games i think you should try out this one, but in my option better wait a sale for it.","April 1","true","7.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","12","17","2","0"

I love indie games, Early access never discourages me, but this game is nearly unplayable to me. The options are useless, the controls are terrible and unresponsive, combat is boring, room transition doesn't make any sense, the narration is VERY loud and obnoxious with no option to lower its volume. It could be because my rig isn't that great, but the main menu is leggy as hell, everything about this game screams VERY early access, i regret buying it even at 50% off, i hope they overhaul it entirely before it's release. Disappointed.\nTL:DR\nDont buy unless you want a laggy, slow, lackluster game with awful controls.","December 12, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As I played through I started to forgive a few of the thingsthat annoyed me during the start. Then as it progressed instead of giving me more things to like it gave me the same gameplay as earlier and more things to be annoyed about. I know this is still in development and will be ready to change this review to positive after some fixes.\n\nDisposable Heroes is not ready to be a complete game yet but has potential.\n\nBelow is my first impresons video covering what the game is and the start with minimal spoilers if you would like to see. Under that I have listed the pros and cons with minor spoilers (pros and cons will make more sense if you have played or seen the video).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4nNmf2BacI\n\nPros:\n- this game is fun\n- it's funny\n- the art style if you don't judge it it really cool\n- the save point system makes up for cheap deaths and mistakes\n- purchaseable "powerups" allow for easier clears if you choose\n- decent variety of rooms and enemies\n- decent variety of pickups\n- weapons potions and random "spells" are very fun to use\n- co-op has potential\n\nCons:\n- no in game options/pause menu to turn down sound or rebind keys or check inventory\n- UI lackng, I picked up a health potion but until I use it it is very hard to remember which it is\n- sound is really loud at some points and not at others, cannot change volume in game\n- hitboxes across everything are odd\n- hitboxes off for all traps especially lasers, all spinning enemies, all spinning projectiles, everything in the minigames\n- the controls are buggy, in single player sometimes you get wasd to move some times you get the arrow keys, if you plug in a controller  things go to hell\n- co-op controls buggy as well, the only way we got it to work was for P1 to suffer wasd with c v and P2 using controller stick and n m\n- P1 and P2 are limited to only two character choices instead of four? Why? (and yes I wanted to play as the boobie girl solo)\n- the auto progression through rooms feels well out of place, why is it there?\n- ♥♥♥♥ing compulsary minigames, they are ♥♥♥♥ and out of place\n- not sure if it was a bug but why is a whole level (Caves) hidden behind a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ minigame?\n\nI would like to point out again that I do like this game and will change this review to positive after some fixes. Hope my review was helpful.","February 6","false","1.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

It tends to poke fun of a lot of cliche characters you find in games such as these.

It seems to feature some RNG elements into the mix of the game, but doesn't really go all out on it very much. Fighting enemies that are in rooms, and just trying to get to your objective will become a real challenge with the random weapons you will find that may (or may not) help you along the way.\n\nGameplayDisposable Heroes is a fun local co-op game that has a few issues here and there with some balancing issues with the enemies and the way that you get hit which I will explain later. Although the graphics aren't all to be looked up upon, don't underestimate what the game really is. It's a very content-rich sort of game that doesn't focus much, if at all, on story but more of the gameplay itself. There is a nice variety of levels, weapons, special powers and such that you can find throughout the entire game. This does mean that you might be constantly switcing weapons and having to adjust to how the new weapon works in the next couple of seconds of obtaining it. Obvioulsy some weapons are better than other, and some of them are just damn OP, but we as gamers like OP stuff. The way that you will play through the game is rather simple. Your objective is to clear out each room in order to progress to the next one. You will continue to do this, with some RNG deciding what rooms you will encounter, until you get to the end of the area. You will face countless amounts of different types of enemies along the way, some of them throwing swords at you while others are just walk to you. This does however take me to a few of the issues that I had wit the game, and what it set up to be in my opinion to what it really is. When I first started playing Disposable Heroes I assumed that the game would run along the lines of a Dungeon Crawler. However, the game itself doesn't do that unfortunatly. You only have to kill the enemies in the room and then you get teleported to the next room. I found this a little odd, as there are sometimes 2 doors that will open after you have killed the enemies in that room. I also found out that you can't actually grab the dropped loot once you have killed all the enemies in the room because you get instantly teleported to the next level. Nothing too major, but the next point is one of the things I really don't like about this game. Once you get hit I would expect to get a small amount of invinsibility to get out of whatevers attacking me. You don't get that here, which leads to a lot of cheap deaths as your stuck in a corner and get continously hit by enemies.\n\nPros+ A nice co-op game\n+ Content-rich\n+ Variety of weapons\n+ Trading cards & Achievements\n\nCons- Some cheap deaths\n- Get teleported to the next room automatically, meaning you can't grab any gold or weapons once you have killed all the enemies\n\nResult / Final thoughtsDisposable Heroes is a fun co-op game that has some fairly difficult gameplay. I would highly recommend playing this with a friend to make the game a little easier and extend the replay value a little bit more. The graphics are a little bit of a meh, as the game doesn't really focus on that part of the game very much. There are some cheap deaths, but loads of different weapons to collect.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Good Games Giveaways & Reviews curator group here.","March 25","true","3.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

It is silly but fun, tremendously addictive and, as someone that is not particularly good at this sort of thing, incredibly frustrating. BUT it is fun. I am impressed by the amount of work that has gone into its development. The horses make me laugh, the 'evil dudes' are truly evil and the heroes very, very disposable and you always have to be on the look out for the odd things that appear and you have to question whether you have actually seen it or not... Give it a go!","October 12, 2015","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game is still in progress, but developer is actually really cool and works on improving the game a lot. Good buy.","January 18","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the charming little rodents and bandits to the nearly inescapable death traps, this game is truly a trip. It's like the Dark Souls of dungeon crawling. It is hard. It is unforgiving. And yet, it's also addicting and encourages you to play more. The weapon choices are even endearing, from your starting weapon of a wooden spoon, to the futuristic lazor gun.\n\nThat being said, there are some improvements I would like to see. For one, it would be nice to have online or LAN multiplayer. This game was definitely made to be played with another person, and I feel as though it's restricted by only having "couch" co-op. It would also be nice to see difficulty settings, especially if a person feels like going it solo.\n\nGameplay of Disposable Heroes","February 4","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The game obviously has a few minor issues, since it's still in early access, but they were very minor, and did not detract from the game substantially.\n\nHere's a video of me playing the game, and giving my first impressions, should it interest you!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbJrXGruIwo&feature=youtu.be","February 4","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artwork grows on you and th gameplay is just ridiculous, but it is so enjoyable! Also, I would highly suggest playing with a friend because the game can be quite hard :-)\n\nLooking forward to playing the game some more, if you want some gameplay footage, I have started a Let's Play and added my video to Steam. It's hard to search on YouTube because apparently Metallica has a song named Disposable Heroes...\n\nEnjoy it!","February 9","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
