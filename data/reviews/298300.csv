Before anything, excuse my english.\n\nAfter I bought this game, i feel in debt with humanity, i have the duty to tell: this game sucks, hard.\n\na) Its a facebook game - i will not elaborate beyond that (poor graphics, gameplay, etc...)\nb) Its a free game you can play from www.ufoonline.de\nc) In the steam store there is no "Play for free" option. GG\n\nThere is no much else to say. I feel like i just light up 6,79 usd and smoke it.","October 10, 2014","false","0.8"," 909 of 968 people (94%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","94","909","968","21","48"

I gave this game a chance keeping an open mind.  While already receiving negative feedback, I thought "give it a go at least".  What disappointed me the most was waiting for the game to load into missions.  Concept in general is pretty good, yet too complex for my likings.  And I DO NOT like the idea of having to purchase additional credits (or diamonds) throughout the game.","October 13, 2014","false","0.9"," 153 of 163 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","153","163","0","0"

It's no different than any browser game with "tactics" in its name.\n\nmade in flash\nright mouse button opens adobe flash player pop up\nvery slow\nopens in full screen on the primary display device, not possible to change it no strategic part of the game:\nno income other than from missions\nno economy\nno detecting or shooting down UFOs\nsingle base only\nbase expansion is limited to upgrading 4 rooms poor tactical part of the game:\nsoldiers have a predefined class which defines their skills and equipment they can use\nthere is 5 weapons only, one for each class; they are exclusive to use for this class only\nthe equipment is limited to weapon, armor and two slots for usable items\npoor leveling system - acquring new stats is made by creating a path on the large triangle (see screenshots), you can get only a skill which is adjacent to previously chosen skill\ncharacter level is limited to 20 making it impossible to acquire all skills\nslow experience income\nputting soldier on watch (so it shoots during opponent's turn) consumes action points in both current turn and player's next turn - i.e. it counts as if the shot was made during player's next turn; putting soldier on watch costs more than making a single shot\nvery limited ammo on the missions, it's likely that you will run out of it\nknife (scout's main and only weapon) requires ammo\nweapons have min/max range and optimal range - shooting outside min/max range is not even possible, shooting at range different than optimal is most likely to miss and even if it hits the damage will be much lower. And so sniper rifle has range 4-14, 10 optimal, pistol has range 1-4, 4 optimal, minigun has range 1-4, 1 optimal. There is enemy at distance of 6-7 squares? You are unlucky. limited storage for items, at the beginning you can store only ~15 items, later +1 per level of the storage room (max level 30)\nmultiple interface bugs\nit is sometimes not possible to move an item from soldier's inventory to storage room or the other way round\nsometimes interface freezes during mission while the turn timer is still counting down, after 30-60 seconds interface unfreezes and starts processing all mouse events so if you clicked in multiple places you are likely to end up with your soldiers moving to places where you never inteded them to go\nselected soldier sometimes becomes unselected without reason\nif you try to give an order to the soldier during animation, the soldier becomes unselected, the order won't be executed - generally you cannot use mouse during animations\nsometimes it's not possible to scroll the map during oponent's turn - so you can hear your soldiers getting shot without knowing where and by what\nsometimes movement paths are not cleared as all browser games, it is a pay-to-win - you can buy diamonds for real money and use them to buy absolutely anything in the game\none of the "campaign" tasks cannot be completed preventing you from getting further "campaign" tasks\nsome of the daily tasks require you to spend ~12h to complete them (e.g. kill 500 aliens where on mission is ~10 aliens and it takes ~15 minutes to complete a mission); you have 24h to complete a task once started\ngame requests administrator permissions on every startup\nstarter packs give you soldiers at maximum level with super equipment - the game becomes pointless, because the only thing left is research and upgrading rooms\nupgrading rooms and researching is done in real time (e.g. 2 hours)","November 19, 2014","false","18.4"," 131 of 138 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","131","138","3","1"

Almost better to go free, unless you want bonuses.  You get what you pay for with the packs, it saved a good 10-20 hours of game play to level up.\n\nGreat game.  Only about 10-20 hours of new content, but it repeats and has pvp.  It's a browser game and it's okay if you need something to play at work or on a laptop or on the go devices.\n\nIt's not a graphics powerhouse, but it gets the job done for some fun in the office.","February 10, 2015","true","13.5"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","23","5","22","3","2"
