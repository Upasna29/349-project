There's no actual randomized items, no deep character development, and the story looks interesting but sounds like it was badly translated. All together, the game comes across as bare-bones, it functions like its still in its development stages (hell, it probably is considering), and you really don't get bang for your buck. Thankfully I got this during the steam sale, so my wallet wasn't hit too bad, but still, unless the developers release a HUGE update that actually makes like it like an actually finished game, I don't think I have the strength to finish it. Plus, going by the achievements, its not very lengthy anyhow.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/demeryk/recommended/301220/","demeryk","Demeryk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/demeryk/","200 products in account","SummaryLegends of Persia is an action-RPG played from an isometric point-of-view, similar to Diablo or Torchlight . It is one of the most disappointing games I've played in years, with very few redeeming qualities.\nUnless you obtain it as part of a bundle, it is not worth the price of entry.\n\nStory elementsOriginal but underused setting\nOriginal story, set in a part of the world that isn't often explored in videogames. However, the story is conveyed entirely via cutscenes and only the first one has voiceovers; the remaining dozens do not. The cutscenes are mostly exposition, and the gameplay barely feels connected to the story.\n\nCliffhanger ending\nGame ends on a cliffhanger promising a sequel or an expansion. Remains unclear if it'll happen.\n\nBrief longevity/replayability\nGame it very, very short. A playthrough while watching the cutscenes is about 4-5 hours long. Replayability is almost non-existent.\n\nGameplay elementsUnderwhelming loot\nThe weapons and equipment variety is extremely low for an action-RPG. I changed gear a total of 5 times from start to finish.\n\nVery few skills\nSkills variety is low. Descriptions don't update past the first level, making it impossible to know what leveling a skill to the second and third level does before investing points.\n\nUnbalanced difficulty\nGame difficulty is poorly balanced. Instead of fixing it, the developers added cheat codes to be invincible and skip levels...\n\nLinear level design\nLevels are very linear and exploration is not rewarded. There is no minimap.\n\nEnglish translation\nIt is rather obvious that the game wasn't developed by native English speakers, or translated by someone who had the skills to do so. In addition to numerous typos and grammar mistakes, sentences structure is often incorrect, making the story harder to follow. My favorite error is the game title: on Steam, it is called "Legends of Persia"; in-game, it is "Legend of Persia".\n\nTechnical detailsDated visuals\nGraphics are dated and the aesthetics are bland and generic. Animations are sub-par.\n\nAdditional informationFalse promise\nEditor promised in the Key Features section is unavailable.","November 1, 2015","false","5.1"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","24","26","0","0"

I backed the game on kickstarter thinking it would be exactly that - a mid-east Diablo II clone. Initially I was put off by what seemed to be an overly simplistic game, as everything seemed to be rather generic. However, if you play on, the game gains more complexity - equipment gains stat modifiers for example. Legends of Persia is actually a fairly decent ARPG.\n\nThe graphics are not great by modern standards, but they are not as terrible other reviewers say. I guess people tend to forget that many of the games people loved that influenced this game (Diablo I & II, Divine Divinity, Siege of Avalon) look horrible by modern standards. In a forum I saw someone compare this game to RAW. This game is no where near as bad as that turd.\n\nWhile I like the game, I believe that the average steam consumer probably would want to pick this game up when it is on sale because it does not compare favorably to some of the other games available on steam in the same genre.\n\n\nWhat is interesting to me is that the game studio is based in Tehran. The story is based on a legendary prince of ancient Persia. Personally I believe that cultural engagement with the Middle East is important, and do not at all mind having paid full price for this game. I also believe that this game studio is capable of improving and doing better. Instead of giving up on the game after 10-15 minutes, play the game and give the studio constructive criticism.\n","July 1, 2014","true","4.1"," 95 of 156 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","95","156","7","3"

Persia is not really anyone's idea of "the coolest setting ever", to begin with, but the gameplay is just brutal. I couldn't get into the story due to its horrid gameplay.\nInstead of buying this game, get yourself either the FREE Path of Exile, which is awesome. Or if you're looking for more of a story, I strongly recommend Van Helsing. I haven't beaten 2 yet to give you a good enough critique, but the first was(in my honest opinion) better than any of the diablos I've played.\nHonorable mentions: The artists for this game obviously worked their tushies off, and I love the story telling aspect. But the programming and animating team should probably be REPLACED, or trained a lot better. Might I suggest Disney's Principals of animation? You'll be doing yourself an immense favor by learning from it. A programmer I am not, but from the dabbling I've done in UDK and Unity I have created more convincing and better programmed pieces of crap. Honestly though, the animation is probably worse than the programming. All I could say for programming is it felt like they were not compelled to do a better job, which I could understand to some degree, but they should have at least tried their best :/\nReview END.","October 23, 2014","false","0.8"," 46 of 75 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","46","75","0","4"

Very, very simplistic Diablo clone. Combat is a chore, having to hold down right click on each individual enemy to kill them one by one, with only skills that deal AoE damage able to kill more than one at a time. Graphics are very basic, and are hardly worth mentioning, and that hideous green effect that persists throughout a long portion of the beginning gets very annoying very quickly. Questing goes by horrifically slow, with even obtaining quests being a pain in the ♥♥♥. When you pick up a new quest, assuming can even find a one, you're greeted with a slow, boring cutscene instead of a quick and simple popup text window, almost ensuring that nobody will pick up the details because they'll feel an urge to skip that damned thing. I wish I were more eloquent when it comes to describing games, so that I could warn everyone else of this awful clone of a game better. THANK GOD I PICKED THIS UP IN A BUNDLE FOR ABOUT 3 BUCKS!

There were 3 times before I ever reached actual gameplay where I thought the game had crashed because I was just staring at a blank screen for over 2 minutes. The cutscenes at the beginning were beautifully drawn but shoddily stitched together and at one point there was a 3 second clip of in-engine gameplay that was completely inexplicable. Sometimes things were voice acted, other times I had to read the subtitles. Once I was finally given control, I was dumped into the most lifeless, barren, bland city I have ever scene. I must have wandered around a good 10 minutes before I finally saw the single object in the whole town I could interact with and when I clicked on him I sat for another 2 minutes staring at a black screen while the cutscene loaded (this time without any sound period). He made a bow and sword materialize behind me and I proceeded to roam the town with the objective “Finding the Gold” until my eyes finally began to bleed from the terrible aliasing and constipated character animations.\n\nIf I’m going to play an aRPG I would reinstall Path of Exile; Legends of Persia brings nothing to the table that would merit overlooking all of it’s awful design first impressions.","September 29, 2015","false","0.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Unfortunately, the setting is not one that is very exiting for me, and one I don't particularly care for.  That *may* taint my review of the game, so I am warning you beforehand.  In terms of graphics, I would say they are "alright," but nothing that really screams out "Man, this game looks great!"  Item placement on the maps (thus far) doesn't make much sense, and so far the environment is dull and lackluster.  The UI is ugly, in my opinion, but servicable, it does what it is supposed to do.  The character models are well done and well animated, but again, not very interesting.  The cutscenes for dialogues get really annoying, really fast.  You have to go by the speed of the cutscene if you want information, so if you read faster or slower than the text during the cutscene, you're pretty much SOL.  And if you skip the dialogue scenes, you miss everything that is said, which is unfortunate.  On the plus side, I really do like the art for the dialogue scenes.\n\nCan I recommend this game?  Not really.  Unless you get it drastically reduced in price, you'll probably feel that your money is better spent on another game (like enjoying the first two Dungeon Siege games again, or playing Sacred or Sacred 2, or even Diablo 3 is far superior to this game.)  Is it a horrible game?  No, but there are much better (and often cheaper) alternatives that you may get more enjoyment out of.","July 24, 2014","false","0.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I do recomend... stay clear of it. Unless you really are desperate for another Diablo clone.\n\nThe game does not look too good and the "feel" from it is even worse. I am not much into writing a review, so just some points which I realy hate about it:\n\n- Ingame movies and even most dialogs are more like static images, taking over whole screen, some of them even does not have voice actings.. hm. not good.\n\n- In game graphic and character and even enemy animation is prety decent, but the inventory graphic is prety ugly and small so it is hard to say what is what just from the look of it and I have to look at the popups. This makes the inventory hard tu use because there is absolutely unnecessary delay before description pops-up. and I did not found any way how to check the items in any other way. Also not good.\n\nCharacter control feels "lagy" - its like you click to attack and the character thinks an half a second before doing so. It is even more noticeable with ranged attacks. And if you decide that you need to move away during an attack animation, it gets cut of in the very moment, which looks very very ugly. And well, this is also true for enemies - most noticeable is it in the first (second?) boss fight when using a bow. This is not only ugly, but it also makes the bow usage a bit hard against the bos, because he just break of his atack and continue chasing you as soon as you gets out of range. This is not so ba as it sounds, it is mostly ugly/strange, but for me it is another negative point.\n\nAlso interaction with game world is bit problematic - you need to click very precisely when you want to pick up something from the gorund. You can not actualy click the item itself, but you must click the ground in a place when your chjaracter will end up standing exactly over that item before he pick it up, which is sometimes really hard... this makes me angry very easily and it is probably because of this that I will not play the game anymore...\n\nWell, to summ it up: I am really sorry that I can not give this game to someone who will be able to apreciate it, because I definitely can't.\n","July 24, 2014","false","0.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

There is nothing in this game at all that hasn't been done a hundred percent better (at least) by just about every other ARPG out there, often simultaneously.\n\nPlay Van Helsing 1/2 first.

WHY?D:\n\nanyway, i chose one of the character appearances (an actual model or a bigger picture would be nice...its quite small you know) and got started. I skipped the cutscene, got a loading screen just to experience....another cutscene. yay. Skip again. I found myself in a small town without a clue what to do (which was probably my fault as i skipped so much) so I run around looking what I could do. Shortly I finally knew what was meant with "attack/run buttons". Just...why couldn't it be like in most of the other games of this genre? why do you NEED to have 2 buttons for attack and run? I don't see the point. You can't change it either :/. Anyway, after a while I found someone with a "!" above his head. Thought i would get just a textbox i could click through to get some fast information but nope, another cutscene.(which i skipped. Is everything involving a dialog a cutscene in this game?I just want some quick info i can scroll through, not a cutscene that takes ages for each sentence :/)\nAfter that, I finally got my first quest (or rather my second, as my first was to find that person as it seemed): get some gold. Now that (while searching for something to do) I already found some gold from destroying some debris etc. I actually thought my quest is already complete (since that guys "!" didnt change. could have been greyed out...). So after some reading in the quest log it turns out i have to go to some graveyard south east of town. first i thought it would be outside of town, buuuut it wasn't. after some enemy bashing i got tons of gold, brought that back to the quest-guy and got my next quest: An escort mission. yes. (everyones favourite).\nso apparently i didn't know where to go, had suddenly the choice to get some kind of minion (which i just realized that those are fighting for me after reading the description of the LAST of them...)....oh and they also cost gold which hasn't been mentioned anywhere (didn't see it at least). after a while the to-be-escorted guy died and i had to start over, which was the point where i quitted.\n\n\nother complains:\n- why are things like "character"-button, "skills"button etc. in the skill bar??? they are neither skills nor items, so seperate them from the bar!\n- i have NO CLUE what skills actually do damagewise. is 20 dmg much? does it scale with my other stats? what dmg does it on the next level? what level is required level up that skill? those infos are mandatory imho\n-why does it tilt when i scroll in/out?\n-could leave the city only with several tries as it felt like a forcefield stopped me from proceeding (maybe a bug?)\n-clicking dropped items while npcs follow you is a complete mess. their boxes are HUGE\n-also, also...why do dropped weapons have to be so gigantic?\n-dropped misc item would probably be better displayed as a small bag instead of something that looks like a treasure chest full of potions (looked at least to me like one on first glance)\n\n\noverall this "full game" rather feels like a pre-alpha of an early-game. Sorry but 20$ is NOT an appropriate price for this game.\n\n1/10","July 24, 2014","false","0.5"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

So much crashing and crashing and crashing and  . . . did i mention crashing. The minor things like enemy names with underscores, enemy names ending with numbers like "zombie_lvl2_197" or something like that. Desynced cutscenes and constant crashes. Inventory bugs, like items randomly unequipping from a character slot, not being able to equip items at all and then crashing. Did i mention this game crashes. I really want to finish this game i really do. But it looks like the game does not want to be finished. The price tag for this game 19.99 Euros is ridiculous when the game is at the state it is now.

A tedious journey through terrible graphics, a boring and completely forgettable story and controls that are awful. It feels like this game was made as some intro to game design project that they thought they could sell for $20. Even if I got this game for free, I'd want my time back. Unfortunately I paid actual money for this atrocity. As I write this, the gameplay video is streaming above. Watching it, It's like they sped up the gameplay to make the game actually appealing. I wish it moved that fast! In reality, you run around through bland, muddily textured environments and fight enemies named "Zombie_lvl3" in what feels like slow motion. The excitement never ends, folks.\n\nI like supporting indie games and little known studios but when they put out crap like this at a high price point, it's extremely sad. If I was their gametester for this, I'd have strangled myself with my own mouse cable for having to play this so much and find bugs. This entire game is one large bug. The only people I can imagine enjoying this are ones who have never experienced a quality game experience IN THEIR LIFETIME. They're the ones who loved Superman 64 and ET for Atari. Even Atari hated ET so much they buried the game cartridges in the desert. There should be an equivalent to that for this game.\n\nMove on, for you have been warned.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hotbullet8/recommended/301220/","hotbullet8","Hot Bullet 8","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hotbullet8/","320 products in account","3/5 Average game !\n\nOVERALL First of all, don't be fooled by the cool cinematics, this game is abysmally different, it's like the devs hired an animation studio to do the cinematics and showed them none of the gameplay. This game is an average hack and slash, a Diablo 2 clone that's anything but memorable although it still manages to be fun if you don't set your standard to Diablo 3 kind of quality. You will beat it in about 5-6h and I don't think it's worth $20 (more like $5-8 IMHO) but if you're a fan of the genre or want a pretty simple hack and slash then you will have fun with the game as you progress.\n\nREPLAYABILITY The game lets you chose between 3 classes: melee warrior, ranged archer or mixed mage. So once I completed the game as a melee warrior I did play it as the other 2 classes and had my fair share of fun with it. A downside are the way the achievements are managed since if you beat the game on a hard difficulty you don't get the previous achievements as if you beat it on the easier difficulties, also there's an achievement for the First Boss that YOU WILL NEVER GET because the dev has stated that they have decided to permanently remove this boss, so bummer there for all the achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s around the world (such as myself).\n\nGAMEPLAY You hack through a variety of enemies with melee, ranged and magic weapons (you can equip up to 2 at a time) and use mana on your magic powers (you can equip up to 4 at a time, also can invest on passive abilities too). As you level up you can spend some points on improving your character and making it more oriented to melee, ranged and magic to suit your preferences; each avatar is purely cosmetic since you can make your barbarian a warlock, turn the bow girl into a warrior princess or your mystic into a deadly marksman. This game has very simple mechanics and this may give you a good time if you're looking for a beat 'em up with some light mechanics.\n\nAESTHETIC Visually this game isn't on par with other games of the genre, that's OK by me although it makes a little bothersome to pay full price for a game that isn't remarkable on gameplay or story either, but we shouldn't be so hard on the game visuals since they aren't THAT bad either as some people have said. The loading screens and cinematics present some nice visual art but you NEVER see those characters ingame, nor you see the armors and weapons depicted in them, which is why I start the review by telling that the developers most likely hired a separate studio for the art that they display.\n\nSTORY To be honest the story is just a nonsensical filler, I was really excited after seeing the opening cinematic but then found a pretty bland and uninspired story, quite confusing since I can't even remember the name of the character you are supposed to be playing, at some point I stopped trying to make any sense and thought that characters call you different names on each level as if you are just supposed to represent a different mythological persian character. So yeah... forget about getting an engaging story from this game.\n\nMUSIC The sounds are ok and the music isn't bad either, I can't complain nor praise the game's musical score, all I can say is that I wasn't bothered by it but wasn't lost in it either.","September 18, 2014","false","7.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"
