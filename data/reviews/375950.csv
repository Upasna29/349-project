You would think this is some kind of a plant simulator game.\n\nWrong. Classic misdirection.\n\nThis game is all about the snail. The snail is the one unchanging variable. You can pick up your snail. You can spray your snail with water. But the snail will just keep going, always in the same direction. It will not turn around, it will not change speed.\n\nThe snail is a metaphor for life. It just keeps going.\n\nYou can even speed up time itself - the game does a timelapse when you've had it off for several hours. During that timelapse, the snail doesn't zoom around. Plants will grow before your eyes but the snail does not give way to your constructs of time and space, it will move at its own pace.\n\nEdit: by a recent update, the snail now toots.

Apart from planting your succulents, watering them, and zooming in to sing at them, there's very little else you can do. It's supposed to be a very zen experience — similar to keeping actual plants — so if you expect more interactivity than that then this is not the game for you. I usually had it on in the background while I went on with my day as always (hence my exorbitant playtime), but you don't need to leave it on all the time. Your plants will grow just fine while the game is closed as well, so if you only want to spend 5 minutes a day checking up on your plants, then you can do that too. As you can see the joy of the game doesn't lie within its interactivity, but rather within owning a virtual garden in itself.\n\nWhile this game does have micro transactions, it's entirely possible to play it without ever spending a single penny on it as you start out with 10 plants and you get a free seedling every week.\n\nI very much enjoy playing this game. It's an extremely niche title, but if this game sounds like your cup of tea, I fully recommend you give it a try. It's free so there's literally no downside to trying it out either.","August 20, 2015","true","302.4"," 289 of 308 people (94%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","94","289","308","20","17"

It's free, minimalistic, relaxing (or maybe that's just the ambien kicking in), but more than anything somehow it's fun. I've beta tested some games before, although none of which were PC and I wish I would've known about this game before now so I could've been involved with the game more closely. It seems well-polished, at least enough to enjoy as an extra background thing (Like a plant would do?) or directly interact with it (I guess you could try this with plants too). There are micro-transactions in the game so you can buy plants, which I guess is kind of a downside, but hey! you could also just wait until you get your free seedling every week! Personally I'm a pretty patient person so the microtransactions thing doesn't mean very much to me.\nDevelopers if you're reading this: I do really wish that the random seedling were more often than every week, or that perhaps there were a chance to get bonus seedlings. I feel like the entire week between seeds really pressures most people into wanting to buy seedlings.\n\nOverall I'd definitely recommend this game, if you can call it a game.\n\nIt gives you loads of options too:\nMove your plants!\nWater your plants!\nFind your snail!\nFollow your snail!\nSing to your snail!\nPick up your snail and pretend like it's a racecar!\nSpray water on your snail!\nYour snail is now wet!\nIMPORTANT EDIT: YOU CAN NAME YOUR SNAIL GARY!\nThe possibilities are endless!","August 20, 2015","true","10.6"," 102 of 116 people (88%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","88","102","116","67","0"

(You also have a snail, but he’s just the world’s cutest decoration, not necessarily integral to the “gameplay”.) The seeds are already planted. Your job is to keep the seeds healthy. Armed with a spray bottle, you click on each seed to douse it with a gentle spray of water. You give each one enough water to make it “sated” instead of “thirsty” and then you wait for your little garden of succulent plants to grow.\n\nThere’s not much to be done in Viridi. You can move and rearrange the succulents in your plot. Each week you get another seed you can plant. You can water your plants (though they don’t need to be watered frequently). If you zoom in on your plants, you can also sing to them, which makes them grow faster. If you’re looking for something a bit more active, you can watch your snail (whose description simply says “wow cute”) travel in a slow circle around the rim of your pot.\n\nEver since my negative review of the game Mountain, I've been searching for a "screensaver game" that has the capacity to engage me. I like the idea of having a passive experience in gaming, one where I take on the role of observer and watch something grow without much interference from me. To a lot of people I suppose Viridi would be boring, but if you’re just looking for something cute to keep an eye on in the background, then Viridi will fill that hole perfectly.","September 3, 2015","true","60.9"," 78 of 82 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","78","82","10","3"

Indeed, like many people said before me, it's more a pot plant simulator than.... well, I don't know.\n\nAnyway, you choose a pot, you plant some seed and then you let the time do its work. You pluck weeds, you water your plants (if they're thirsty), you look at the snail on the pot (I've named it Snaily), you arrange the disposition of your plants, you remove those you don't want, you go to the shop to discover that there is a seed free each week (yay, some of them are expensive and it's cool to have them for no penny), that the price range is from 0.09 to 0.39$, that you can't sell the seeds on Steam Market BUT you can trade them, that you can change your pot if it's not your taste anymore, that after all, you can change any name of the plant, that the shop has information on the plants...\n\nThat's what you will find in the game.\n\nAnd strangely enough, it's relaxing, addicting (well the achievements may be also considered as inciting to grow plants), graphics are correct, the commands are easy to understand (well, once you know that you shouldn't overwater the plants - thanks god, I didn't kill any of them) and it's free (apart if you want to grow plants quickly). The soundtrack is also relaxing.\n\nMicro-transactions aren't bothering here. It's not like you need to buy seeds to improve a character or have a better weapon or anything that will make you advance. I don't bother to buy the seeds over 0.1, if I can have them through the free seed of the week (I got at least 2 like that).\n\nEDIT: since the review, I've bought the cathouse pot that was released after. Yeah, I know, I shouldn't have as it's 2.99$ but at least, I've a Snaily Cat now! Oh and there is also a vacation mode, where your plants will live forever but never grow or flower unless you get out of it. It's practical if you're going somewhere where you'll not have access at Viridi. Also, the developer managed to correct the plants that you're watering by error when trying to remove a weed. Good! Oh and hey, there is a mode where you can enable some singing for your plant. Well, nothing really hard in it as it doesn't require any effort from you than zoom and stay on the plant for seconds. I'm kinda late in discovering this but as I've maintained a certain level of zoom, it wasn't enough for showing this feature.","October 3, 2015","true","12.9"," 50 of 52 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","50","52","0","1"

In spite of that, Viridi is charming and somehow addicting, and with the exception of a vague interface at the beginning, it's very easy to understand what you have to do.\n\nThere isn't a whole lot of variation. The game appears to be designed for people who do their daily "task", then leave it overnight and come back the next day to check on its progress. There's also a in-game store where you can purchase new succulents (ironically, they're just as inexpensive as real seeds), and it never feels exploitative. The biggest purchase you can make is the ability to have a second pot grow at the same time.\n\nViridi probably won't appeal to everyone, but if you want a charming and simple game/time-waster with cute music and graphics, this will be right up your alley.","August 22, 2015","true","2.2"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","0"

Viridi is also quite difficult to write about due to the very little content it possesses.\n\nBasic Overview: There isn't much to the core of the game, it's basically just a plant simulator where you nurture a small pot of succulents that grow in real time. You water them, sing to them (also the snail) and watch them grow. Released by Ice Water games as their latest creation.\n\nYou're launched into the game with nothing more than a start button, you then choose the decorative pot, the first few starting succulents and name it whatever you wish, after this.. You simply watch plants grow.\n\nPros: Cute, minimalistic, relaxing, quaint, easy to have in the background and to just check on it every so often, cute snail. It's nice to de-stress for a brief period of time\n\nMain Cons: There's not tutorial, no restart if you do something wrong, any additional seeds are micro-transactions within the game (Or you wait a week to get a free seedling from the nursery), the click box for selection of the plants is right next to a delete button which in turn leads to many accidental killing of plants - Even plants brought with real money and finally the erratic camera controls that flick you from one side of the pot to the other when something is selected.\n\nFinal conclusion: Honestly, you have nothing to lose by trying it except a few minutes of your time and very minimal hard drive space. I praise the effort and ideas that have obviously gone into it and have a mild whine about the little things that could easily be improved to make this far more enjoyable. It is however exactly what it claims to be; A relaxing oasis to run in the background or a quiet space when you need something simple to get your mind off things.","August 23, 2015","true","3.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","2"

However it IS a game you can play over time. Because you have to keep track of your plants and take care of them, its important to stay on top of the game and to keep coming back and watering them and taking care of them. So in that aspect its a cool game. However it doesn't offer much else other than to kill time. I dont really see this as a game, but more as a simulator and has some uniqueness to it with different seeds, pots, and plants. The game is free and its a decent time killer. So I would recommend it as its a unique simulator that has real life examples of taking care of plants.","May 1","true","1.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

All you have to do is to regularly water (not too much) your plants and sing to them if you want. There is also a little snail that runs around the pot. Everything can be renamed, watered, positioned, and as you enjoy a relaxing music, you can watch your plants grow or do your business as they do theirs. The plants will not be fully grown in an instant, but it will take up to two weeks.\n\nIt's the different and alternative experience you were looking for, and it's free!\nMicrotransactions are not necessary needed, and you get a free object per week.\n\nI'm writing this review while singing to my Aloe Vera.\n\nGaming industry definitely needs more titles liek that, or may no, this has to remain a pleasant surprise, a little corner of relax.\n\nDefinitely recommended!","August 25, 2015","true","29.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

However, the full implementation of this game leaves something to be desired.\n\nThis game is 'free to play', and without spending any money you start with a set of plants (4 varieties, multiples of some smaller growing ones) and a single pot. There are a total of 23 plants available at this stage (all succulents). The pot is suspended in air so it's free to for you to rotate your view, zooming in on a specific plant or zooming out to view the whole pot. You can spray water on each plant when selected individually, and when zoomed right in you will automatically start 'singing' to the plant after a short while. And that is all. Oh, and you can look at the snail that simply circles the pot in contant motion, or water it. Wet snail.\n\nPros Attractive plants which are easily recognisable.\nInformation regarding origin and naming of plants available in nursary view.\nNice animation of plants developing plays when you first open game each time based on how long it has been since last play.\nFree new plant each week so you can eventually have owned each type if you a patient.\nRelaxing - if you have two monitors you could use it as a 'background' for the second - just like having a plant pot on your computer desk without risk of spilling water.\nCons Only 1 plant pot - while you can buy 2 more pots for $4.95 each, it is quite pricey for what you are getting - one attractive new location called the 'grove' where there is a new pot, and one very random cat house background with pot.\nExtra plants are purchased through microtransactions - each plant is relatively cheap ($0.09 - $0.35), but can die or simply have no space to put it and end up being thrown away.\nLimited space for plants in each pot means that if you want a different plant you have to throw some away - there is no ability to store plants outside of your one free or extra purchased pots.\nInformation on plants not available in your pot view, and if you rename your plant you might not know what type of plant you even have anymore.\nHas steam acheivements, but if you care about these it will take you a LONG time to get them, as it takes 3-4 weeks to grow a plant to flowering stage, and you only get a new plant every week (unless you buy) if you are lucky enough to get a plant type you don't already have.\nHave to play game every 4ish days otherwise plants will die - you can put game into holiday mode, but then nothing will grow/change. This means if you spend money on plants, you might end up killing them and wasting that money.\nGame gets boring quickly as there is very little you can do - quick startup, water plants that need it, sing if you feel like it (might make them grow/flower better), then rinse and repeat each day with very little changing. It says something when you click on a plant and it says 'thirsty', and you think 'hooray! something I can do!!'.\nThis game could be dramatically improved if you could grow your plants to maturity in your pot, the place them in a bigger garden you could arrange as you liked - especially if once placed in the garden you no longer had to water the plants (gets tedious watering each one individually). Or even if you could place your plants into storage to be reused later if you want to redesign your pot contents or layout.\n\nAlso would be a huge improvement if information about your plants (variety name and info, age of plant etc) was available when you click on them in your pot view.\n\nAlso, microtransactions should NOT be part of games - have a demo version with the single pot and plant selection, with a full version that gives you the rest of the plants. Even if you had in-game money that you get from selling mature plants to buy new seedlings it would be a huge improvement.\n\nSummaryIf you want to try this game, feel free (since it's free)- you will experience the full game within 3 days (your plants won't be fully matured or flower, but you'll see the growing animations which make the full 'gameplay'). If you find this relaxing to just see the plants sitting there you might find this game is for you, but most likely you'll just end up getting bored and uninstalling.\n\nIf you care about acheivements however uninstall it before you mature the first plants (first acheivement) at around 1 week so you don't get stuck playing this game for a year to get all the acheivements.\n\nDo not waste your money buying extra plants that will die or you will end up throwing out due to lack of space.\n\nSadly, not recommended.","January 13","false","9.9"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","19","29","2","1"

The music is so tranquil. I absolutely love this game. And the price is definitely right, straight enough...Free! You can turn the pot around by holding the left mouse button down onto the pot and turning it in either direction. Check the individual plants often. If one or more plants are thirsty, just one spritz from the virtual 'spray bottle' will do the trick, otherwise, you'll overwater the plants. (I found this out the hard way and have a plant SWIMMING as we speak)! A cool feature I liked. You can name each plant and the snail by clicking on them. Write a name in the box provided and press 'enter' on the keyboard! Also, click on a plant (or the little snail) and 'sing' to them!...Too cute! (A virtual song or two might help these little buggers to grow faster)! The plants do grow VERY slowly. 25 to 30 minutes into the game I finally saw some progress...Weeds! Oh yeah, and little budding plants...maybe!\nOf course there are cool extra items in the Nursery. Plants, pots and things, (for real money).

There's nothing hard about getting every achievement, except that you have to keep logging in daily (ok... every two days irl, or so) to water plants, and then get all the plants, and keep doing this until all of them flower.\n\nTo this end, the devs have created a system where you get a free, random plant drop (READ: tradeable STEAM INVENTORY ITEM) every week for free (must login and go to selection screen), and/or can pay (various amounts from $.09 to $.39 USD) for additional plants.\n\nThe community for this game is wonderful in trading and helping with advice, and the game itself has a soundtrack that is relaxing and pleasant just to run in the background.\n\nYou can even name the little snail that crawls around your plant.\n\nInnovative game and a great buy at $.00.\n\nMy father would be proud that I'm virtually an accomplished horticulturist, which, I suppose, is better than being a whoring cultist.\n\nNice job, Ice Water! :)","May 27","true","63.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/D22/recommended/375950/","D22","Moobs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/D22/","478 products in account","This is a difficult game to write about. I’ll admit that I wanted Ice Water Games last title, Eidolon, to succeed. It remains a wonderful game; poetic, beautiful and awe inspiring in ways that very few games are. SteamSpy, however, is a powerful tool. So here we are; Viridi. The next game from Ice Water Games is a game about arranging and watering flowers.\n\nIf I found myself leaping to the defense of Eidolon, a “non” game in the eyes of many philistines since it involves not a small amount of walking and not a lot of killing, then I may well find my defense pushed to the limits here. Viridi will be shunned by many as a non game, but I know that Ice Water Games understands that, and this won’t be pitched to people as a game in the traditional sense.\n\nThe world is a hectic and busy place. Just look at the world of gaming; maybe a hundred games get released every couple of weeks, women are poorly portrayed in games while their absence in the industry is telling, GamerGate continues to rumble on ruining lives while attracting no column inches, games are launching in buggy, broken states and DLC and pre-order bonuses are more prevalent than ever. That’s just off the top of my head, my point is - this is a busy world we have created and perpetuated for ourselves.\n\nOne of the reasons Eidolon resonated with me is because of that quiet. That simply beauty of being alone overlooking a lake. No achievements in sight, no arbitrary goals; just me and the game. It was a welcome break, a refreshing palette cleanser. Viridi has taken that emotion and run with it.\n\nWhat we have here is extremely simple; a flower pot with some seedlings. You can load it up as often or as infrequently as you want to water them, see what’s changed, get your free seedlings once a week and re-arrange your plants as you see fit. There are in app purchases, which is something I have never been crazy about, but nothing seems too expensive here. You can buy plants and more exotic seedlings to spice up your garden should you wish, or just stick to what you have,\n\nI’ve been playing Viridi on Steam and I already feel like this won’t be the game’s target market. Coming out on iOS as well, Viridi could well speak to a commuter demographic crammed onto tubes and buses, granting them a moment’s respite from the rat race. The music is gorgeous and the art is wonderful in its simplicity.\n\nHaving said that I have a couple of mechanical issues with Viridi. When you revisit your plants you’ll often find a couple of weeds that need removing, that’s fine. But when you do the camera movement is a little erratic; snapping to the location where you removed it. The same is true while you’re watering your charges, a problem that’ll need to be resolved for the eventual release on phones. The major camera issue, though, is that you can’t zoom in while planting your new seedlings, making precise placement in your decorative pot a slight chore.\n\nThere are quibbles though, rather than annoyances. Viridi will find a market away from the hustle and bustle of roguelikes and Early Access first person survival games. It’s charming, simple and extremely relaxing.\n\nhttp://www.permanent-beta.net/reviews-1/2015/8/20/viridi","August 20, 2015","true","0.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/375950/","trar","Hammurabi of Babylon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/","318 products in account","Viridi would be good on its own merits as a relaxing plant pseudo-simulator with a nice low-poly aesthetic. It's the only "game" of its kind on the market right now, at any rate. But you know what it reminds me of?\n\nAQUAZONE. That old 1990's aquarium sim that somehow, against all odds, holds a special place in my heart. Maybe it was the late 90's aesthetic. Maybe it was because I was an impressionable young child when I first played, and so did not understand it.\n\nMaybe it was because Aquazone was real-time, mostly like Viridi is. Maybe it was because it had an online microtransaction store (in the '90s!) that let you buy new amenities, and new fish in limited quantities. That's something Viridi has too, although thankfully the seedlings here are less expensive than the fish of old, and you receive a free random seedling every week instead of an infinite supply of two types of fish. Seedlings are also tradable on Steam, which is nice.\n\n\nOf course, Aquazone didn't have a mellow, purchasable OST or achievements, and fish certainly don't flower like these plants do...but Viridi does not yet have a science fiction expansion featuring robot plants. Viridi is less work than Aquazone: these aren't fish that catch diseases, die and pass on their genetic code to their offspring (which was quite literally a thing in Aquazone). These are succulents, desert plants that simply need some water now and then - although they can still die. The only customization to be found is the style of your pot and the arrangement of your seedlings.\n\nAnd, of course, there's a snail.\n\n\nSo...I guess I like this even more than I normally would thanks to nostalgia and feelings for an older game. Which probably isn't very useful to you, but hey, I wanted to say it.\n\nGive this a shot if you want to try something potentially relaxing - the base game is free.

Plants, along with pets, are something I have always loved.  I have cacti, succulents, ferns and a lot more just in my bedroom alone.  For those of you who want to keep plants but think you're somehow cursed to only kill them, keep trying.  You can learn.\n\nYou start out picking a group of starter plants (specifically succulents) and a pot, and then you name it.  Do things like water them (don't overwater), sing to them, pick weeds, and make snails go away (or let them stay, as the developers have confirmed they are friendly).  Your plants will grow, even when the game isn't running.\n\nThe art style and music are both relaxing and cute, and I am actually quite pleased with what they made overall and surprised they made it.  Not something I'd have ever expected to see on Steam or anywhere else.  Give it a go if it sounds like your thing.","August 20, 2015","true","2.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The music is incredible, and really pulls together this close bond you create with your plants, and I like that they give you a plant once a week. This game is like taking care of real plants though, so it is more of a job than a game. This experience is not for the impacient.

I'm terrible at keeping plants and thought I'd feel stressed trying to remember to water the plants, but it's actually a really sweet game. I like checking in on the plants, seeing the clip of their growth progress during the time I've been away and planting the weekly free seedling. You can buy more seedlings if you want to, but for me it's enough with the free starter pack of seedlings and one free new seedling a week.\n\nThe free seedling will show up in you steam inventory so if you don't want that particular type of seedling, you can trade with other players for one that you want. You cannot trade what you've planted, though!\n\nSome tips:\n- Don't water plants that are "sated", they can die from overwatering.\n- Some species of plants come in different colours and shapes, so even within the same type there is variety.\n- After 2 days without water the plants start to die from thirst, so enable the vacation mode if you don't have time to take care of them!\n- Singing to the plants for at least 10 min will make them grow faster.","February 26","true","8.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I came looking for this game - I kid ye not!\n\nSo I own a Nintendo 3DS, and they have a game that you can play 'ONLY' if you've pased someone who also ownes a 3ds.

A game in which you can show off your garden, and anyone who "Visits" (via Streetpass) your garden helps in diffrent ways for your garden to grow.\n\nOne BIG - HUGE - problem is that you can only make ANY progress if another 3DS owner passes by.\n\nSo, as this did not leave me Satiated ;-), I came to see if something similar in the gardening aspect was here on Steam, Without the limitations of the 3ds game.\n\nThank you VERY MUCH Ice Water Games for Viridi. It is EXACTLY what I wanted.

I'd love to see more games in this 'meditative' genre. It makes me want to grow succulents in real life, something that I've never considered doing before.\n\nKeep in mind this is not a game for people looking for something engaging and gameplay demanding! It's sort of more like an interactive screensaver which you can check on occasionally to tend to. It's incredibly slow paced and takes hours/days for plants to have any visible growth. It's definitely a lovely game, but not one some people will enjoy. Thankfully the devs understand that and it's free to play. Be aware that there are optional microtransactions involved. Imo, it's a great system; for a couple of cents you can purchase new plants, and each week you are rewarded a free random sapling. It's a nice approach to microtransactions, I've already purchased a couple plants to support the devs. I mean, what's $.09? You are in no way required to pay to progress.\n\nReally hoping that lots of interesting updates are coming in the future.","August 21, 2015","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's calming, great to open when you're not playing any games, the music can be muted, but is so calming it doesn't need to be. I have seen people complain about the plants you need to buy. What I haven't seen is them saying how cheap it is. $0.09, US Dollars at least. You could sell 1-3 cards and make that kind of money, maybe more.\n\nHowever, I have seen there really is no "Pause Menu" or "Tutorial," both I'd like to see. If it did have a Tutorial, it'd help. However, if you look around there ARE guides for that. Not too hard to find it. There's not a lot here, if you looking for a lot. It's just simple, it's nice though. Took me less than a minute to download/install. Hardly CPU intensive you can do pretty much anything with it running.\n\nAnyways, too long, didn't read.  Here I go.

It is a relaxation game. There's maybe 5 minutes of play to do every day or two - watch a time lapse of growth since you last visited, pull the weeds, and water the thirsty plants. Occasionally I'll re-arrange the plants in my pot into a more aesthetically-pleasing arrangement. There's not much to it.\n\nIt is free-to-play with microtransactions. You can get new seedlings over time without paying, and you also get a starter set for free. Some have complained about this at length, but I feel the way Viridi earns its money is nice. It doesn't push you to buy anything, and it rewards even non-paying players. I have spent nearly a dollar on seedlings for this game and have no regrets in doing so. I'll probably spend another dollar or two on it over the next year...unless I decide to buy some real-world plants to take care of.\n\nThe developers are also still making refinements to the user interface. Two of the most annoying little problems I've been having have been fixed in the most recent update. Not bugs, just usability annoyances:\n\n* When pulling weeds, the nearest plant would be selected, moving the camera in the process. Now the selection doesn't change when you pull a weed.\n* When looking at seedlings in the store, you couldn't zoom in or manually rotate the preview. It would slowly rotate on its own, but you had no control. Now you can zoom in and out, and rotate the view.\n\nThey also added a feature that seems obvious now; vacation mode. You can leave your plants unattended indefinitely without time passing for them.","October 8, 2015","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can water your plant, adjust and move it around the pot, sing to it (which supposedly helps it grow), take pics of it, listen to the soothing background music, pluck the weeds that spring up in your pot over time, and that's about it. The only way to mess up and eventually kill your plant, as far as I can tell, is to either overwater or underwater it. Both are bad.\n\nThe game's Nursery gives you a free seedling each week, but its species will be random. If you are willing to pay a few cents for the plant of your choice, then you have the option of choosing from a wide variety of popular succulent species. I think this game is sweet, so to support it I'm considering purchasing the species I'm most keen on owning: classic aloe vera! :)\n\nOnce your plant is chosen, you'll need to choose its home. There's a pretty big selection of pots to browse through, and though they're nothing outstanding there's bound to be at least one or two that'll strike your fancy enough to use. After you've got your succulent and its pot, you're all set. Now you have a pet digital plant, which comes with its very own smaller succulent companions that automatically spring into existence and grace its pot upon planting. No succulent in this game apparently allows itself to be planted solo.\n\nAnd yes, you do get to name your plant. Every pet needs a name, flora or fauna. Though, I suppose it's more like naming your pot instead of any individual succulent within it since, well, see the paragraph right below this one.\n\nYou're not limited to caring for just one photosynthetic pal. You're allowed to plant and maintain a whole bunch of succulents in your current pot. You start with just one proper seedling, which you get to pick from a limited, if still fairly large, selection of species. Though the list of starter species isn't complete, you still get to pick your first plant (unlike the random free seedling given to you each week by the Nursery) and once you've accumulated more through this means or via purchasing additional seedlings, you can plant the seedling of your choice in the pot at any time as long as room remains.\n\nOne more thing:\nDo you happen to dig snails as well? Well, you'll be pleased to know there's a snail that serves as sort of a living decoration for your pot. You get to name said snail and while you *can* spritz and even sing to it, you don't actually have to worry about it in terms of care (the game is about plants and not molluscs, after all) and in fact, all you can do is watch the little guy go 'round and 'round the edge of your pot in endless circles. The snail doesn't grow/change in any way and can't die, and is always the same. So yeah, the snail is bascially pointless but hella cute.","September 24, 2015","true","30.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

[I did not buy any DLC so my review will pertain to the free experience of the game]\nAt the start, you are given a pot and a seed, your goal in this game is to grow plants by periodically watering them and tending to their weeds. Time goes by in real time so you need to open your game once or twice a week to take care of your pot; overwatering the plants will cause them to die. The game also has a vacation mode that will freeze time which will be useful for those who travel or might go without internet.\nEven though you aren't given many seeds at the start, you can get more once a week for free in the store. Otherwise, you have to pay cash to buy not only seeds but additional pots as well.\nBy slowly getting additional seeds and by growing and tending to them you slowly make your colorful and busy pot which is quite rewarding. That's all there is to it, grow your pot enjoy the tranquility.\n\nSome pros and cons:\nPROS\n-Nice fitting music\n-Soothing visuals\n-Achievements are easy to get\n-Educational?? I now know what an Echeveria Lola is.\n-Real time simulates the process of actually growing plants\n-You can sing to your plants and pet snail\n-Yes, you have a pet snail\n-Watering can be done once or twice a week so don't worry about missing a day or five\n-vacation mode\n-You can name your snail (mine is named Moogie)\n\nCONS\n-DLC is expensive and not really worth it\n-Short sessions since there's not much to do other than decorate, water, sing, and pull weeds\n-Not a large variety of music\n-SFX is quite repetitive\n-can sometimes be buggy, but most if not all are fixed (I haven't experienced any problems so far though besides mild freezing)\n\nSo, these are my thoughts on Viridi, and never forget, "Life is fleeting, death is eternal".","December 31, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's calming, great to open when you're not playing any games, the music can be muted, but is so calming it doesn't need to be. I have seen people complain about the plants you need to buy. What I haven't seen is them saying how cheap it is. $0.09, US Dollars at least. You could sell 1-3 cards and make that kind of money, maybe more.\n\nHowever, I have seen there really is no "Pause Menu" or "Tutorial," both I'd like to see. If it did have a Tutorial, it'd help. However, if you look around there ARE guides for that. Not too hard to find it. There's not a lot here, if you looking for a lot. It's just simple, it's nice though. Took me less than a minute to download/install. Hardly CPU intensive you can do pretty much anything with it running.\n\nAnyways, too long, didn't read.  Here I go. Simple, and calming, could have a few improvements they'll most likely fix. I suggest this for relaxing, you see by the "Yes" I clicked below after writing this.

I started witha a small garden that I saw grow over a few days. I named my snail Steven, he moved around pretty consistently and didn't change much. I started selling my counter strike skins to buy plants.\n\nMy garden kept growing and was looking pretty cool, and I was watering them every few days when I remembered to, usually when waiting for counter strike queues. Over winter break I kinda forgot about my plants for a bit, and checking back in tonight I found them all dead.\n\nI sprayed water on all my plants in an attempt to revive it but found the water had no effect. I had to toss out all my plants and start again. I was heartbroken. I planted new free plants, and sold a couple cheap counter strike skins to get another small plant, They won't grow for a bit and my planter looks awkward. At least steven is still there.\nSteven u r my rock. <3\n\n10/10 Like Skyrim, but with plants.","January 12","true","36.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's more of a mindfulness exercise than a game but nonetheless, caring for these digital plants as wonderfully serene. For those that work with computers all day, even leaving the little app open just to have the reminder of a tiny virtually living world to come back to throughout the day would be a welcome change.\n\nThere are the options of purchasing seedlings with money but you already start with your choice of arrangements and you get a free random seedling every week. For a free game, this one doesn't pressure you to buy upgrades or faster growing times. I'ts simply a free game giving you a virtual succulent garden. No strings attached.\n\nI go back to it a few minutes each day to water my plants and pluck the weeds, sometimes just to watch the little snail trundle round the edge of the flowerpot. I's recommend this game to anyone looking for a little quiet reflection in their hectic day.\n\n","January 2","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not very game like, there aren't objectives or anything like that. It's very to the point. Plant suculants and keep them from dying. Remove random grass that accumulate in the pot.\n\nThe things I find wrong with this game:  if you mess a pot up, you can't restart it. Or even have multiple pots. There's no tutorial since its such a simple game, but that resulted in me choosing an initial set up I wasn't too fond of because I thought I could change it.  I also accidentally over watered and killed a plant. There are beautiful flowers that sprout, and I'm sure that they don't last long IRL, but I'd like to see them last longer than 15 seconds since this is virtual and not real. What would really make this more enjoyable is multiple pots. I could replant suculants I don't want in the other one and it would add to the difficulty of keeping multiple ones alive. IDK maybe that's in the paid version...\n\nMicropurchaces aren't really a big deal since you earn random seeds each week.\n\nOverall I still find myself logging in every day to see if there are new seeds and remove grass.","April 2","true","36.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is pretty, relaxing and fun to play for a minute or two every couple of days. You get a lovely little environment (or two if you have bought Eidolon as I have) and get your choice of pots and starter plants. Water them, and watch them grow. The music for the game is lovely. Though it has in game purchases, they are very cheap (from .10 to .40 per plant, though to be planted only once and then it is used). You also can wait to get plants, as you get a random free one each week. It is a bit of a pain if you don't remember to come back to it often, as I forgot about the game and came back to all of my plants dead, and now I have one lonely aloe plant until next week. There is a vacation mode now for if you know you won't come back for a while, which is nice, but its like having a real plant and you can't just neglect it like I did (poor little fellows, RIP)","October 10, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some of mine flowered for the first time the day I wrote this review and it's awesome to see my patience rewarded in such a wonderful way. I find myself genuinely happy to see my plants growing and flourishing, and caring for them is a calm, soothing exercise. They don't require much maintenance, so it's never a worry or stressor for me.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who needs something different from today's usual gaming fare.

They are my children, they are my friends, they are my everything. I don't know what I'm gonna do if they die, but I feel good trying to keep them alive. Hell, I even worried when I couldn't log on for a week. This game is amazing, it's one of those games that you can boot up, do a few chores, take care of your lil plants and keep going with your day. It's relaxing, it's interesting, and it's nice to see your garden grown and your plants flower.\n\nThere's an in game store, too, but you'll only use it if you want extra plants, you can get a free seed each week, a random one, so there's nothing pay to win in this game. Plus, the seeds are cheap, most of them cost a cents for a single seed. I would recommend this game, play it now and then if you want, but if you don't feel like you're going to be able to take care of a few silly virtual plants, then stay away.\nPlus, if you absolutely have to leave, there's a "vacation mode", where plants won't grow but you don't have to water them, neither, until you come back.","December 24, 2015","true","37.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are 23 plants which I could find igstore and as plants grow in "real time" you cant just replace them on daily basis and see which one is better. Its like a garden in a pot.\nYou need to water plants occasionaly so they dont die and if you going away for long you can activate "Vacation" which will freeze/pause the growth of your plants so you don't need to worry about watering them until you come back.\nCalm music will surely make you relax so if you want some background relaxing music then you should surely try it out.\nIt has steam inventory as well which is an awesoem thing to have for a collectionaire [Me]. I am not quiet sure yet of the store items which cost 3 & other one for 5 euros [the only 2 items apart from plants igstore] but they seem to change the background or something more than just a plant so I will update the review when I find out.\nTo summorise its like a tamagochi except its at a slow pace, like realy slow one & as its free I cannot put thumbs down even for micro-transactions which could be by-passed using random free plant per week.","November 13, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You've heard it all, this game is 100% Bush. IGN added this to game of the year for the reward "Bush Watcher." Viridi is the game where you get emotionally attached to your snail. The game gets a rating of 9/11 for deleting your snaily. Viridi is a pay2win game where you can't do anything about it. If you can't tell the difference between Jelly and Jam you should uninstall. If YOU DON'T SUCK YOUR OWN CAT'S DI CK, THEN YOU SHOULDN'T PLAY THIS GAME, the game's way to intense. Instead of giving that homeless man you saw on the street a buck or two, you should use it on Viridi, the game to buy more plant seeds and watch them grow.

More of a screensaver or desktop pet application. It's beautiful. The simple presentation yet non-comprimising point-and-click format is rather simple, yet it's all you need.\n\nIn the first 5 minutes I had the application up. I discovered the nursery where you get new seedlings. I have not purchased anything, but I recieved the weekly free seedling, some sort of vine. I believe it was one of the more expensive ones in the nursery, the minimum being $0.09, and the max being $0.39, I think. Which is alot better than paying $200 for some CS:GO skin.\n\nOver the next two hours, I managed to overwater one of my plants in an act of curiosity (I hope its okay), and made the snail wet. No idea why anyone would want to water their snail, but I did.\nI move around a couple of the seedlings as part of my master plan to make it look coordinated. Vines all along the outside with some kind of Aloe in the center. Almost like a vegetation-covered mountain. Speaking of Mountain. This game reminds me of the other desktop pet game, Mountain. Mostly for its simplicity and "this will happen, eventually" feel to it.\n\nThis application will certainly make your office computer slightly less depressing than it already is, and is a go-to app for the one minute a day you spend not doing your actual work.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone without a green thumb.","August 20, 2015","true","3.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

In Mountain, you could shake the mountain, and rearrange things in it, along with the chance to destroy the mountian with a few keystrokes.\n\nViridi is no different. You choose a pot and name it, then you choose your starter set of plants and can rename it, then you notice the adorable snail patrolling on the rim of the pot. You can rename it. It's supposed to be a "sanctuary" to get away from it all. I'm not sure if you need to be in the game for the plants fo grow, but so far they are little excuses for plants.

I can imagine myself coming home from a busy day and just plopping down and listening to the music while I tend to my gardens and sing to the snail.\n\nThere are micro transactions in the game, like buying the seedlings. Very cheap, if you feel like you would like to have a more personalised garden. I bought the map to the Grove, while it was a little expensive for all the things you can do in the game, it's still nice.\n\nI think a nice addition would be being able to buy other pets to sit around your pot, similar to the snail.

It's a nice way for me to start my day and to end it when my work is put on hold at last. Though simple and with minimalist-style graphics, the little touches here and there - plants perking up when watered being my favorite, followed by giving a fear-inducing name to my snail and then a few of my plants - make it really enjoyable. Besides that, the gameplay is smooth and easy to pick up, the soundtrack is beautiful and I feel relaxed after a few minutes of tending to my pots.

(I keep forgetting)\n\nThis game is a real-time plant-growing simulator with soothing music.   Your plants grow real-time based on your computer's clock and the plants do look rather nice.  However, the issues with this game involve achievement timing (as in flowering after maturing), timeskip abuse (people changing their computer date a week ahead so they can water again without waiting while plants instantly mature/flower), buying plants from the online in-game store with real money, and realizing that there's really nothing to do in the game.\n\nIn this game, you water your plants every few days (or a week) and weed your pot (as in plucking the weeds).  The only things that will kill your plants will be over-watering and under-watering (simply forgetting your plant, which you probably will).  I'm not sure if forgetting to weed your garden kills your plants or simply slows down the growing process.\n\n\nPROS:\nFree\nAchievements\nCalming music\nGreat detail on the plant and pot designs\nFree random seedling each week\n\nCONS:\nMicro-transactions (+more pots.  +more seeds)\nBuggy (no pun intended with the snail)\nA patience game that requires remembering to log in every few days\nNothing to really do in-game\nGets boring....fast.\nNo option to start a new pot\n\nIf you like free achievements, are a plant-growing fan, or like soothing music, feel free to jump in and download it.   If you're looking for something fast-paced, are impatient, or just want something to do other than babysit virtual plants, avoid.\n\n\n3/10   (Decent, but not great.

Unlike Mountain, in which things happen from time to time if you're patient enough to stare at your screen for 10 minutes in a row, Viridi offers even a less challenging experience.\n\nYou start the game by selecting a pot and a set of seeds that allegedly grow in real time. The only gameplay consists in logging in once every 1 or 2 days for 1 minute and clicking on your plants to water them; otherwise they die. And that's pretty much everything one can do in Viridi. Oh, and if you select a plant, then there's an indicator on the screen that you are singing to it, but in fact singing has no effect on the plant's growth. So it might as well be ignored. I don't even understand why the developers decided to add this functionality that has no real use case.\n\nLet's not even start talking about the fact that there is no option to cycle through the plants, so if you have a crowded pot, then clicking on the plant that you want to water might prove to be a challenge.\n\nOnce per week you receive a new seed that you can either plant in the pot or sell on the market. It's similar to the CSGO random drops, but at least here you don't have to work for it. The seed is indeed no CSGO skin, but it still sells for $0.09 - $0.39 depending on its type. The only reason for which one should keep these seeds and replant them is if he/she wants to obtain the achievement corresponding to that specific plant; but in this case you still need to wait a few days/weeks/months until the plant reaches maturity.\n\nThe impression that this game left me was that it was created solely for the purpose of microtransactions and that the effort put into developing it was minimal. At least for now, buying all the seeds for all the achievements costs roughly $4 but of course, adding more seed types / pots is trivial, so I expect the developers to do that.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","September 12, 2015","false","4.4"," 36 of 73 people (49%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","49","36","73","5","9"

These grow in real time, but sadly, real time is very slow. If you want, you can buy more plants, so that you can have even more pretty things in your pot, but those cost money. Not a lot, just about 15 cents per plant, but it's still a way to nickel and dime every cent out of your pockets. You can get a random plant every week, which is a nice touch, but extremely slow.\n\nThere's also something called a "map to the grove", which is not explained at all ingame, and costs $5 to buy, but I don't like buying random things that don't tell me what they do.\n\nIf you ignore your plants and forget to water them, they'll all die, if you over-water your plants, they'll all die. If it was just something you looked at, it would work well. Just leave it on in the background and check every few hours or so. But if you leave it on for a few hours or so, won't they start dying? Right you are, this is a game that's designed to sit in the background, but you need to interact with it!\n\nTL;DR if you want something to look at and take care of throughout your work day, you can leave this on in the background and let it play pretty music for you.

If you really want to do it, do it in real life, because waiting weeks by staring at the empty soil is way more fun than this, and also will teach you something useful.\n\nYou don't even have much to do: you select a vase and a pre-made bundle of plants, then remove the wild weeds, water each plant separately by selecting each one of them and then pressing a button, and that's how it always begins, and also everything you have to do. Come back in a day or 2, rinse and repeat.\n\nThe graphics are very basic, so much that my ps1 would laugh at it; the sound effects almost non-existant, and the music forgettable. And if that's not enough for you, you can pay micro-transactions to buy new plants and feed the developers.\n\nWell I'm sorry to be so rude, but I think you should find a job that you are able to do, rather than asking money for one that you aren't.","October 8, 2015","false","0.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mandalorez/recommended/375950/","mandalorez","The Deer Hunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mandalorez/","321 products in account","Where are we in this game when we step into the world of Viridi? The endless abyss that surrounds the pots. These shrouded colors that reveal an open expanse with no ending. What of the pots that float in midair for which we must care for and develop? What of the creature that rotates around our pot, who calls himself ‘Snail’? So many question around this intricate game.\n\nUpon first starting the game, we are met with the option to name our pot, chose the pot coloring, and later choosing what plants will first start of in the pot. Perhaps these are psychological questions that the game ponders about you in order to obtain information. Lighter colored pots may indicate a softer personality. Darker colored pots may indicate a strong and brash personality. Whichever of the two, the mystery behind the extreme amount of free choice the game delivers at the beginning has an unknown purpose.\n\nThere is also the open world, which seems blurry to us. Its color tends to match the color of the pot or similar in color arrangement.  Where we are in the world of Viridi may be in our own minds or perhaps a distant far off future. What is this lonely pot doing surrounded by the endless abyss?\n\nEver so stepping into the world of Viridi, we are met with the demands of the pot to care for it. What is the purpose behind removing the weeds that try to attack our saplings? Are they implants of evil sent to ward us off the true path of a beautiful TV garden? Are we on a holy crusade, to pluck out each and every weed? They must only be messengers of death, sent to ward us off the righteous path.\n\nThen there is the water from which we feed each plant. This water satisfies our plants. It is the blessed holy water that delivers sustenance to feed our plants. For each time we feed them, we are brought the pleasure that we have just sustained our plants, or overwatered them. Perhaps it is a test of measurement, from which we must measure our ability to correctly water our plants? Our ability to move these plants individually shows that we have some autonomy in regards to the realm of Viridi.\n\nThere is also the Nursery from which resides an assortment of saplings. What is this currency from which each sapling requires different amounts? Is this a different form of greed, from which the nursery wishes to extract our personal allowance? Does this nursery diverge from the free path, where the pure of heart walk? The Nursery presents all of its saplings in a glittering array, and tempts every passerby.\n\nAnd also if one cups their ear to take in the soft melody of the music, one cannot bear to be reminded of their own childhood, or perhaps of a soft memory. The music loops after playing a few pieces and then repeats them again. Perhaps this music is to sooth us while we are at work, or maybe wake us up from the world of Viridi. Could it be the plants themselves speaking to us in tones we have yet to decipher? Whatever the true meaning behind this, it echoes to us and is ever present in our travels.\n\nWho is this mystical traveler that crosses my pot ever so often? His name, which is referred to as ‘Snail’, befits his slow movement revolving around the pot. There are occasions when we can sing to him, sing an empty song to him. I ponder what is the true nature of this mysterious creature? He is perhaps the only creature that we encounter on our voyage in the realm of Viridi. Perhaps this snail is a messenger sent by an unknown presence, to forewarn of something which simpleminded brain cannot process or measure. Our only modes of speaking to him are through a simple song, which has yet to produce any viable evidence or aid. This snail posses no harm though, and it is compliant with being picked up and shifted to a different part of the pot.\n\nCan this game, Viridi, be called a game? What is the meaning behind a game? Certainly attaining some sort of gratification comes with playing any game. The amount of gratification any player can obtain from Viridi is up to the gamer he to determine and to receive.  What are we to expect from Viridi? The game is open to so many interpretations and the realm surrounding Viridi remains a mystery to us all.\n","August 21, 2015","true","306.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you forget to play for a week all of your plants die.  You can avoid this by entering vacation mode but then your plants never grow.  There's no way to bring them back, so you lose literally all of your progress.  All the plants you earned over so many weeks and all the plants you bought are just gone.  And, you can't just take out any dead ones, if one is dead you have to start over because there appears to be no way of deleting a plant, or at least not one I could find.  But not only can you not take them out, but restarting the game requires you to go into the files and delete specific things and rename things.

It's fun being able to keep plants alive with only a few minutes a week. The fact that you don't have to guess if a plant needs attention is pretty helpful too. The free 'weekly' seed keeps things interesting. Downside is that there comes a time when your pot is full and you must let some of your lil plant buddies go. Also the music can either be relaxing or obnoxious.

As I started the game I started weeding and watered my plant, but after a second or two I found that the seedlings had a water level and that I had killed one of my plants due to waterlogging, aka overwatering. As I was a bit agitated to the lack of tutorial I proceeded to the in game shop. As to entering the shop I noticed that the seeds had a price, so i wondered if you earn monney by growing your plants and didnt know if I had any so I clicked buy on one. This is where I was furious. As I clicked the buy button it brought me to the steam shop and had added seeds to my cart. Why would you ever want to pay for virtual seeds the same price as in real life?

I had built up an almost-full pot, and simply not having the time for the game for a little while trashed all progress.  While I only ever spent a few paltry cents on it, money I had acquired by selling steam cards, I still regret even that much.  I feel that if you buy the plant, you should get a few seeds, not only one.  You only have one pot, after all, and there's literally no other way to obtain seeds, other than wait an entire week to get a SINGLE SEEDLING.  I know this is to encourage microtransactions, but I feel this game is focused on relaxation.  What's relaxing about having to come back to your pot after a little break from gaming, only to find everything you did wasted, and that your only option for fixing it, is to spend several dollars?

Deleting plants is way too easy, in fact I found I deleted almost half my plants by accident in less than 10 minutes of play.\n\nBasically, a confirm prompt before deleting, or if deleting threw things back into the seed bin rather than removing them from the pot forever, or if you had to click a "delete" icon at the bottom of the screen and THEN click on a plant, any of that would make the game playable, but just having a little x show up that's barely visible and deleting the plant if we click near it is ♥♥♥♥ed up.

I had built up an almost-full pot, and simply not having the time for the game for a little while trashed all progress.  While I only ever spent a few paltry cents on it, money I had acquired by selling steam cards, I still regret even that much.  I feel that if you buy the plant, you should get a few seeds, not only one.  You only have one pot, after all, and there's literally no other way to obtain seeds, other than wait an entire week to get a SINGLE SEEDLING.  I know this is to encourage microtransactions, but I feel this game is focused on relaxation.  What's relaxing about having to come back to your pot after a little break from gaming, only to find everything you did wasted, and that your only option for fixing it, is to spend several dollars?

If they added the ability to change background images to ones that suit you, or upload your own to the game, that would be an improvement.\n~Watering, not watering, and overwatering, seems to have little to no effect on the plants growth.\n\nI would recommend this game if the microtransactions weren't asinine. They should be decorations or custom bowls, not the plants themselves. Also, if you claim to give out a free plant once per week, ACTUALLY do so, and incporporate a way to unlock free plants.\n","August 29, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I choose the Swiss Concrete because it was the least ugly. Still ugly, just the least ugly.  After that you pick the starter plant. You only get 3 options on this one. The Pallidus, Prasinus, or Primus. I picked the Prasinus because it was, yet again, the least ugly. After this you get to name your pot. I named mine "Green" since Prasinus is Latin for Green. After you name your pot, you get to see your plant as just a yound bunch of grass pieces with a small snail on the outside of your plant. In the bottom right there is a shining gray cirle that upon clicking on pulls up a menu with 4 options. The first on is for muting the sound, the second one assures you that the game isn't actually "free", the third one lets you place other plants, and the fourth on closes the menu.\n\nThe plants grow in real time as I hear, so you might as well just start an irl garden since that would be much more entertaining and healthy.

It makes everything else lag while it's open, so  I just can't leave it open.\n\nAlso, I mean.. you could just buy real succulents. They have them at supermarkets for like $5 max. They also need to be watered less, and don't take cpu power to exist.\n\nUnless we're all in a computer, then they are taking cpu power. What if a real succulent on your desk is making someone's computer run poorly because it's growing them in real time? I bet if your apartment or whatever was just a single instance, then anything non-living wouldn't take much cpu power to simulate, except succulents. Those succulents would seriously cause problems. Like, if you got a bunch, would the simulation crash? Maybe we just don't notice it rebooting. Maybe that's deja vu. Or is that why all my succulents keep dying?\nIt's probably just that I forget to water them. That's what happened to my mint plant too. Mint plants are good to have if you have cats, though, they like them.\n\nIn short, it's cool that it's free, but if it makes my laptop (a rather nice one, may I add, no integrated bs here) run poorly while it's growing in the background then I just can't let it go.\n\nBut, the snail.. maybe it's just the snail.

Snail. This game is more than just a stoners dream. This  game brings up many theories in many reviews, but here's mine. This is syymbolic of life. You are not able to remove or undo anything (except your pot name or your entire pot). The plants can be moved, but not removed. The snail will stay, unaffected by time, circling the rim endlessly. Plants will grow, as will people. You mil plant new seeds and meet new people. Relationships and plants take patience and care to grow. But no matter what, you can never truly remove a plant from your life. You can move it around, underwater it, overwater it, but the plant will still be there, green or brown, sated or overwatered, dead or alive. People never really leave your life. They may move far enough away that you may never see them again, but they will have a lasting effect on your life and they will be a part of you until you buy a new pot. Viridi has truly shown us the truth.","November 23, 2015","true","35.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Snail. This game is more than just a stoners dream. This  game brings up many theories in many reviews, but here's mine. This is syymbolic of life. You are not able to remove or undo anything (except your pot name or your entire pot). The plants can be moved, but not removed. The snail will stay, unaffected by time, circling the rim endlessly. Plants will grow, as will people. You mil plant new seeds and meet new people. Relationships and plants take patience and care to grow. But no matter what, you can never truly remove a plant from your life. You can move it around, underwater it, overwater it, but the plant will still be there, green or brown, sated or overwatered, dead or alive. People never really leave your life. They may move far enough away that you may never see them again, but they will have a lasting effect on your life and they will be a part of you until you buy a new pot.

The difficulty lies not in your strategy or twitch skills, but in your patience. In fact, by desiring to win the game, you are playing it incorrectly.\n\nViridi is a simulator. You simulate owning an assortment of succulent plants. They need water, but here's the catch: they don't really need very much water. This is a game about making small adjustments. You can pluck some grassy weeds. You can name each of your plants, if you want to. You can sing [simulated] to each of your plants, if you want to. You can water each of your plants, if you want to. Each plant has an indicator to let you know whether it needs some water. It's very easy to overwater, especially if you're looking for "something to do." That's okay. If the urge is too strong and you overwater a tiny bit, you might stunt the plant's growth somewhat but it can always make a comeback. 99% of the time, there isn't "something to do," which is a pretty accurate depiction of owning & caring for succulents. Much of the appeal comes from owning a visually-interesting thing that changes over time but doesn't require a large upkeep committment.\n\nEverything about this game is crafted to encourage relaxation: the color palettes, the soft underlighting, the soundtrack (the music is lovely, but if you like to leave the game running you may want to mute it sometimes), the slow bobbing of your pot in the game's space, even the menu style.\n\nI suppose the elephant in the room is the microtransaction system. Yes, there is IAP, but it's about as inoffensive as you can get. There are currently 22 varieties that can be grown, and you can get a free random seedling (no strings attached) every week. If you really have your heart set on a specific breed in the nursery, you can buy it, or you can try your luck at the weekly drop. If you absolutely have to get every species, you can buy them, or you can wait for them (with phenomenal luck, you could get all the current species for free in under 5 months).\n\nAchievements have recently been added, and there is one for each available plant, awarded for bringing the plant to maturity. No speedrun. No expert mode. No secrets. This is not a tryhard game, but if you're a tryhard, Viridi would probably do you some good.\n\nwow cute / 10","August 28, 2015","true","100.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
