"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/299150/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","A couple of HOG gamers persistently suggested Empress of the Deep series and I sincerely tried to like this one. For that purpose only, this is my third playthrough of the game, in hopes of catching a glimpse of what I might have missed before. I know that it takes a maximum of 2 hours to finish the game, so it's not a labor, but the spark simply is not there.\n\nMeet our protagonist: Anna. We watch her drifting into the depths of an ocean in the opening cinematic, and then, she opens her eyes in an odd sarcophagus, remembering nothing of her past. She - who is a bit dim witted, may I say - is told that she just woke up from a century old slumber. She is in a mysterious underwater civilization and two unseen companions welcome her: an old man named Jacob who asks for her to try and gather three royal relics to uncover her own destiny, and a nameless young girl who we can only communicate as a fleeting, creepy voice in our head. One asks for our aid to help the sinking civilization by overthrowing the evil empress and the other asks us to activate 10 uncanny orbs to see something cool. Guess who is actually trustworthy?\n\nThe setting - besides being a shameless imitation of Bioshock series - is beautiful, and I'd like to congratulate the visual artist on that manner. It looks old - as if taken from an old Myst game, but pretty enough. Is there anything else remotely interesting or exceptional about this game? No. Sadly, the whole game doesn't go even one step further than being a collection of pretty environment design. Voice acting is tedious. Characters speak as they are about to fall asleep half the time. And other times, you can swear that Bollywood has seen better acting performances, with more feeling. Animations are actually old stop-motion presentations, and they look a bit eerie in play, which is not the intended atmosphere, I think.\n\nHOG scenes are horrendously bad, consisting of cut out stock photographs thrown around in blending colored backgrounds. It is nearly impossible to even recognize whatever you are clicking on half the time, so no one should expect for you to actually search for an item that you cannot identify! You'll quickly find yourself abusing the hint button just to get done with the scene. About puzzles; yes, there are some imaginative logic puzzles. But there is no skip option, so either you complete it, or get stuck on the present point until you manage to solve the puzzle. This becomes disengaging pretty quickly. Gameplay? There is a horrible amount of backtracking for a game this short in playing hours, and there is no usable map option for quick transport either.\n\nStill, my major complaint is about the story itself. At the beginning of my blabbering, I mentioned Anna being a bit dim witted. Well, I underestimated. She is downright stupid. I mean, she keeps seeing her own face on a family portrait, side by side with the same girl, and she doesn't get even slightly suspicious of the mischievous little girl voice, who speaks in a tone fitting for Disney villains! We practically see a portrait of the evil empress, carrying those purple orbs all around her, and we still keep activating them! I mean, there should be a limit to how stupid a character can be! In this situation, she was stupid enough to let a maniac blow up the archive of all civilization...\n\nHailing from Gogii games, I'm not surprised to see a below mediocre game. Their games tend to be either brilliant, or horrible anyhow. What I was surprised is that there is a considerable amount of gamers who are in favor of the series. I didn't play the rest of the series yet, so I'm still hopeful that this shoddy little game doesn't represent all that there is for me to discover in Empress' world. I'll see for myself, and inform you accordingly.\n\nUpdate: Please bear with this game, 'cause with the following instalments this makes one great trilogy! I'm still annoyed when I think about this one, but I promise you, losing 2 hours with this game worths it when you experience the rest of the series!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 13, 2015","false","6.1"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","30","36","0","4"

In terms of Empress of the Deep that comes in the form of an unapologetic retelling of Bioshock, as told through the eyes of someone who skimmed a synopsis of its plot and then asked a fifth grader to rewrite it based off the most prominent themes and moments.\n\nA mysterious voice on the radio, a creepy girl asking for help, all taking place in an underwater city meant to be the last bastion of humanity. I'm not entirely opposed to casual games trying to do their own version of something I've already seen, and in some cases find it hilarious the way the developers get around the fact they are making a game on a much smaller scale and budget, but EotD is so painfully written and voiced that it just feels insulting. The plot is contrived to the very last moment, with boneheaded characters that constantly feel the need to reexplain the simplistic plot to you through painfully voiced dialog. The voice actors sound incredibly bored the entire time, and almost seem to be missing the correct tone on purpose as never once does a characters reflection actually fit with what they say. It's hamfisted and forgettable, making it even more obvious that little attention was payed to writing anything half decent for what was likely seen as casual shovelware by the publisher.\n\nI'd be able to forgive the horrendous narrative if the object finding was itself enjoyable, but it's hard to have fun when you're locked at a resolution so low that it's near impossible to make anything out from the background. More often than not I was simply guessing at what I was clicking on, as objects are blurry to the point of being invisible, which really kills the entire point of this sort of game. The handful of logic puzzles inserted among the traditional HOG gameplay are a nice touch, but are so easy they feel like throwaway additions.\n\nI might seem rather down on Empress of the Deep, but it's not that it's especially bad for what a lot of people consider a HOG to be; it's that with an influx of excellent ones like Angelica Weaver and The Twin Vaccines, this sort of halfbaked mediocrity is no longer what we should expect from the genre. It deserves better, and that quality is out there hidden among all the fluff. If you've already devoured the other HOGs in your near vicinity you could do a lot worse, but that doesn't change Empress of the Deep from being a wholly lackluster experience that's better left forgotten (and perhaps chucked into the ocean for irony's sake).","May 26, 2014","false","3.2"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","31","42","2","0"

It is very puzzle oriented and the puzzles come with no directions. However, if you're familiar with these types of games, you should be able to figure everything out. The story is very cryptic but that actually helps the whole feel of the game, which I liked very much. For an older game, the graphics are quite nice. The hidden object areas are a bit blurry but not bad enough to stump me for long. Even though the game is dated, it DOES have voice acting - sometimes good, sometimes not so much, but always interesting. One thing I absolutely love about Empress of the Deep is that once you've finished everything there is to do in an area, an "Area Cleared" Star appears. You never have to worry about coming back to that area to find or do something else. And it gives a nice sense of accomplishment. I wish more hidden object/puzzle games incorporated that feature. The whole game has a very surreal feel to it. It's not a long game but I enjoyed every minute of it. There are also two sequels to this game that continue the story, if you're curious about what happens next. Because of the length of the games, I'd recommend trying to find them on sale. But they're good enough that I'm currently replaying them all.

It's an adventure/hidden object mix, which has become quite common, but leans more on its adventure side than hidden object, and instead of heaping in hidden object scenes every few steps, includes a selection of different kinds of puzzles, some of which were fairly unique. The hidden object portion is the standard fare you'd expect, perhaps even a slight bit sub-par with the amount of objects I felt I was squinting to make out (even with a hint, some were still unrecognizable in my opinion).\n\nThe adventure portion, however, more than made up for it. It won't shine in the way a full-fledged adventure game would, but as a casual title, it can be clever with the sorts of puzzles it throws at the player and gives a decent number of rooms to explore. This, though, leads to some backtracking, some of which is particularly unnecessary. Without spoiling anything, the ending makes you revisit nearly every screen to click a single object on each, which was a rather bland way of padding the already short game length.\n\nThe narrative is decent, but nothing groundbreaking. You'll see any major plot points coming a mile away, but it still gets the job done and gives you a reason to wander the game world. It's also fully voiced, and the actors do well enough a majority of the time.\n\nOne thing to point out is it ends with a "To be continued." It does complete its own self-contained story at least, and the next part is available on Steam.\n\nLastly, it clocks in at a measly two hours. It's worth the ride for fans of the genre, but only on sale. (As of writing this, it's 50 cents, and that's a steal :) ).","May 14, 2014","true","2.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The hidden objects comprise 50% of the gameplay and aren't particularily challenging, and there's no penalty for using the hint button. The puzzles comprise the other 50% and are based on classic concepts like "tower of Hanoi", which makes solutions easy to find online if you get stuck. This is NOT a challenging game and I suspect the intended audience is tweens through teens.\n\nI appreciate the fact that I wasn't forced to replay any of the hidden object scenes: once I completed a hidden object  area, it was done.

I finished the game in 100min which isn't a lot, not even for HO games. The story is very linear and while this is maybe not the most important part of an HO game, it really stands out.\nMost importantly the HO mini games are no fun. This is mainly caused by the lack of high-resolution textures. The game only runs in 800x600 windowed or the same resolution stretched. The artwork quality is pretty average too. It's rendered with a grainy look and isn't hand-drawn. Together this makes objects harder to find than necessary. Add to this the bad font choice where you can't tell h from b, hat or bat? Animations are not fluid. Overall it's hard to believe that this game is from 2010. It looks and feels like a game from the 90s, when PCs had 800x600 resolution.\nOther puzzles aren't that interesting. But then, I can't be bothered with the 8-queens-on-chessboard-problem. I prefer fresh types of puzzles.\n\nBottomline: Unless you're really into HO games, avoid. There are many better ones. If you want it, wait for bundles or get it cheap under 1 <<currency>>.","October 11, 2014","false","1.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It's a little like Amerzone with more water and hidden objects, which makes it a happy light entertainment for, say, downtime at work, which is where I played it in 15- and 20-minute slices. My 3.7 hours in the game involved reminding myself where I was and what I was doing since I wasn't playing straight through, and I reckon an average player would complete it in three hours or less.\n\nThe game is a pretty slide-show exploration adventure set in a deserted underwater habitat called the Ark, where you are awakened at the beginning with little memory to explain why you're there and, of course, with a destiny to discover. This is pretty much par for the course, but happily the voice acting is fairly subdued and the plot is delivered calmly, so the routine nature of the story doesn't compete against the pretty scenery.\n\nYou're met early on by Jacob, a disembodied voice that will come to you from time to time over your little handheld device thingy (map, clues, notes, and collections) with encouragement and vague instructions. He tells you to find the three parts of a family artifact, and you're off through a trio of silent, giant pavilions. A furtive little-girl voice will join in later, and she and Jacob push and pull for your trust until the end.\n\nThe art is beautiful, and not especially detailed. It's pleasant to push through and ultimately feels like an inert high-fantasy world of science, though without the splashy excesses of, say, Rapture. There isn't much to explore - the eye captures each screen quickly unless there are puzzles present - but I thought from the bones of the design that the game idly aspired to Myst as an influence, rather than entirely embracing its hidden-object heritage.\n\nStill, it is absolutely a casual game, with none of the crazy-making that kind of ruined Myst for me back in the day. You'll push a button in one scene, activate an orb in another, collect a few stray inventory items here and there, and move similarly through the peaceful scenery at a good clip. The game introduces an "Area Finished" star icon that displays in the upper left of each screen when all actions there have been completed, and it's a great convenience. Less usefully, it awards you flowers when you finish puzzle segments, and you're meant to collect them all, but since they arrive automatically as you progress through the story and don't do anything but sit on their collection page, it's easy to forget that they are there.\n\nA flurry of action at the end contains a satisfactory reveal, as well as putting the player into position for part two.","April 12, 2015","true","3.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","8"

If you really like the genre, you may give this a try. If not, look elsewhere.\nI was torn whether to recommend it or not, but I feel it's just about good enough if you get it very cheap (i.e. at a huge discount).\n\nThe game in detail:\n\n# It has only one game mode. It's fairly easy, and the hint button recharges quickly. There's a random clicking penalty, that doesn't really do much (your cursor moves around wildly for a bit).\n\n# The graphics aren't good. The HO scenes are blurry, and sometimes, the objects are very difficult to be spotted. Awkwardly, most screens have only one item lying around (usually in plain sight), and once you pick it up, the screen is finished. It felt like a great waste of potential to me.\n\n# There are a few mini-games but nothing extraordinary.\n\n# You'll spend a good deal of time backtracking. There's a map, but it's pretty useless. You can't use it to "teleport", and it doesn't indicate the unfinished screens. Thus, the backtracking gets pretty annoying.\n\n# It's quite short. It took me just 1.5 hours to finish it, and I read all the dialogues, watched all the cutscenes, and played all minigames.\n\n# The game doesn't have achievements, but for some reason, you collect flowers. They seemed very out of place to me, didn't do anything, and were impossible to miss.\n\n# The story is somewhat decent, but you can tell the big twist right from when the characters are introduced.\n\n# The voice overs and music are all right.","September 17, 2014","true","1.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Guided by Jacob, she must find who she is, why she was awaken and who is behind the purple orbs.\n\nGiven the fact that the sequels give you some anwsers, yeah, you're in reality royalty that was destined to be the Empress of the Deep... if only your twin sister, hungry with power, didn't try to kill you. And your enemy is... her.\n\nWhile the game isn't as beautiful as Artifex Mundi's products, Empress of the Deep is way better than Theatre of the Absurd, published by the same enterprise and based on the same mechanisms. But here, the plot doesn't really suffer of plotholes. Besides, the places are also less dark and way more colorfuls. Not that I don't mind dark settings.\n\nThe puzzles aren't hard but I never found a skip button. It was: "solve it or forget about finishing the story". The HOG are challenging because the majority of items aren't really seen immediately. Another regret is that the map isn't interactive: you can't go from one place to another by clicking on it.\n\nThe soundtrack is good too. The voice acting is also well done. I mean, you don't know who to trust because Jacob and the one behind the purple orbs have trusting voices.\n\nBut the best is perhaps the ending.

This is a combination of puzzles and hidden object scenes, with items to find in the world for clues or to complete puzzles.

The graphics are older and while it didn't excessively bother me (I grew up with an old 386 so I get strangely nostalgic for ancient graphics), it does make some of the HO scenes difficult.  This isn't because objects are well hidden but simply because the scenes can be dark or grainy.\n\n3. This is not a long game.  I took about two hours to playthrough this time on Steam, and it took a little bit longer the first time on my iPod.  This was at a leisurely pace, without rushing much, and with a couple of unpaused breaks for various reasons.  Actual playtime was probably closer to 90 minutes.\n\n4.

I like the art through most of the game though the style makes it even harder to see the hidden objects in the puzzles. The font is pretty terrible. Sound and music is decent, though for some reason the voice of the main character annoyed me though the same person voices two other characters in the game whose voices was perfectly fine.\n\nYou control Anna, who recently woke up from coma and explores a small underwater world trying to find out who you are and what's going on. You encounter two characters who help you on your way.\n\nVery linear story with a lot of backtracking, the hidden objects outside of the puzzles are overly easy to find. The hint button is there throughout the game so you'll never be stuck. There is no punishment for not getting puzzles right, if you mess around too much you can skip them and on the hidden object puzzles the hint button has a fairly low recharge and no penalty for use.\n\nThe map is mostly completely useless. For some reason you get a flower as a kind of achievement for every level you finish, though the flowers seem to do nothing other than be a collectable.\n\nThis is game 1 in a series, but has a decent ending in itself.\n\nI suspect this game would be enjoyed the most by kids and pre-teens.

Having an indepth and engaging story, deep characters need not also be coupled with the best graphics or modern game-play which works to shoe-horn in every aspect.\nSeriously, if you've played any recent games from 'AAA Developers/Publishers' like EA or Activision, you'll no doubt see how they've attempted to cram everything from stealth elements, to puzzles to even racing into games that neither need it nor gamers who want it. Konami added forced stealth elements to Castlevania Lord of Shadows; I remember when those used to be games about combat, about adventure and fighting monsters, not about trying to copy the popular parts of other video games to 'broaden the audience'.\n\nYou may notice it says I've played about 3 hours, that is how long the game took me, being a puzzle game, it may take more or less time for others but even so, I was more interested in the story of a 3 hour, point & click game than any AAA title that has come out in the last few years.","June 25, 2014","true","2.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Fairly addictive with puzzles that are ranged and challenging, however it is very easy to skip and hint your way through the entire game which is a shame. Too many "find the item" puzzles for me and also some of the items were very modern which really ruined the whole "underwater city" aesthetic and emmersiveness of the game. As predicted this game isn't made with amazing graphics so don't expect much 3D or HD but regardless it has a very nice art style. However, as mentioned the "find the item" puzzles break this. Some nice voice acting and good sound with a fairly predictable storyline, but then this is somewhat irrelevant when you're playing a puzzle game.

I wish there was an option between "yes" and "no" for a game like this.\n\nWould I recommend at the price of five dollars? No.\nWould I recommend it at a sale price or as part of a bundle? Yes.\n\nIt's a hidden item game with a few other types of mini games thrown in, so if you like the genre then find it on sale. However, I would gripe that it's not much of a hidden item game at all. The game barely had any hidden item puzzles and seemed to rely on other mini games, most had absolutely no explination. And when you did hit a hidden item puzzle you could aimlessly click on everything with no pentalty. So you could pretty much click everything and guess.\n\nThat all being said, I finished the game for the story. It was weird and required you to suspend belief but it was interesting enough, although predictable. Ending had me feeling meh, though.

The graphics are sub par quality and it does muddle the hidden object scenes a bit since you'll have a hard time telling if that thing blended in is the object or just bad graphics.\n\nThat being said! Overall it's a good casual game. As with most hidden object games don't expect much in terms of animation, voice acting or plot. But the voice acting in this one was decent although your own character you play as seemd a little weak at times. The plot and "truth" can be easily realized quickly in the the game.\n\nFor puzzles and such the game does a decent job and the areas are very nice even though not high quality graphics.\n\nIf you want a bit of cheap but quick fun and like hidden object games, I'd get this on sale at around .99cents.

I would be looking for one item when in fact it was another item that I needed, but because of what could only be considered a lanuage barrier between different english speaking countries, it did make it difficult at times.\n\nWould I recommend this game? All in all I did have fun with the game, and did find a lot of the puzzles fun to solve.","January 21","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really liked the Myst-like environment and atmosphere. Also, the hidden-object scenes have some original ideas - like the one where you look through a telescope. Or the one with objects named in strange language which you had to translate first.\nSadly, the downsides outweigh everything. The graphics quality is just horrible. I mean, grainy 800x600 with no widescreen support? Are we back in 1998? It gets even worse in the hidden-object scenes because some object are transparent for no reason, to the point they're virtually invisible.\nThe story is really stupid but I'm getting used to it in these games. Bad voice acting doesn't help it. With the exception of Jacob the characters show no emotions, they just don't care. So why should I?\nAnd last but not least, the map. It doesn't show unsolved locations. And it has no fast travel so enjoy clicking a lot while constantly running back and forth.","July 7, 2015","false","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And a better ending. Most of the puzzles are quite easy, though later on I had some problems.\nThe story itself is enjoyable, though a bit bland perhaps. Certainly not as deep as this underwater ark is :-) I think it's mostly the idea of the story (underwater "city" that is called an "ark", an evil empress, you awaking from cryo-sleep, etc...).\n\nNavigation could have been more userfriendly. You have to manually click the navigation arrow no matter where you want to go - a quick travel would be nice.\nOr at least arrows that appear instantly, instead of only after a second or so.\n\nI liked the voices, and there is text to the voice as well (always good), but apparently no way to skip the speech (you can skip certain cutscenes).\n\nOn the plus side, you get a visual notification when you have done everything in an area, so you don't have to wonder if there might be something you've overlooked.\n\nIMO the biggest letdown is the ending. No subtlety, though a hint of more to come.\n\nI recommend getting it when cheap - it took me 2 hours to get through, so I wouldn't spend more than at most 1 Euro for it.","July 18, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
