Purchasing items from the store help's support the game, however this is one of a few MMO's where those with money are not left totally behind.\n\nA lengthy story line is included that you can complete solo by filling the rest of your team positions with your bridge officers. Alternatively you can team up with friends and enjoy the experience together. The game contains a rich mix of ground and space missions in both the story line and the Special Task Force (STF) missions. There are also Zones such as Defari, Romulas, Voth and Nukara Prime where you can land planet side and complete a variety of missions. The developers are constantly adding new content, regions and special events. Anything can happen from free ships, a vacation to Risa or a visit from christmas Q.\n\nOnce you have reached max level there is the repuutation system to earn further bonuses and equipment. Plus Elite STF missions to test you.\n\nThe Bad:\nStar Trek Online experience lag when servers are heavily. The interface and options are overwhelming so is the depth of charecter customisation and training. Bugs do exist and most have work arounds, this is not uncommon in a sofware upgraded over so many years.\n\nSummary:\nSTO overall for a free to play is robust and has held my interest as a long term game. Main factors in this are the customization you can make to ship and crew and the changing content. We recommend you give the game a try.","November 25, 2013","true","522.3"," 522 of 588 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","522","588","0","1"

I would change from thumbs UP to thumbs DOWN but this review is for some reason already highly visible.\n\nDelta Rising is a rapidly growing disaster due to several really idiotic decisions. The core content itself is sound. New episodes are fun and creative, with a compelling story and interesting T6 ships and mechanics.\n\nHowever there are a lot of persistent bugs, some over a year old, and swathes of existing content and queues in dire need of overhaul. Instead, Cryptic seem to focus on bringing out new, very poorly QA-tested, content and systems with associated P2W aspects and let the problems pile up.\n\nThrow in some very poorly timed nerfs, complete disregard for the sorry state of XP earning, and a total lack of dev communication, and you have a team so far removed from reality that they have the gall to call this the "best expansion yet". One can take a quick glance at the steam player numbers and see how it actually went down. Why not look at the dismal PvE queue numbers while you are there?\n\ntl;dr, still a great Trek experience, but some fools in Cryptic HQ seem to be going out of their way to make this game as unenjoyable as possible.\n\n"DO YOU RECOMMEND THIS GAME?" - NO","January 2, 2014","true","918.7"," 717 of 827 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","717","827","3","8"

But since there isn't one, I feel like the most honest thing I can do is not to.\n\nI have a few hundred hours invested in this game, which I started to play in 2014. Since then I've gotten my main character to 60, and created a few alts that are on their way there as well. I've pretty much exhausted all there is to do in my main, and finally feel like I can do this justice with a review.\n\nSo is this a bad game? I am inclined to say no. However, there are many negative things that will hold the experience back for you. The thing is that, mostly, they are not enough to stop you from playing once you've tried it and if you've liked it for what it is. But after a while, dissapointment might start to catch up with you nonetheless.\n\nSTO is a bittersweet experience. I feel that most of the time, for every three good things this game has, there is also one bad thing to go along.\n\nPros:\n\n-The episodes are really good. This game has an interesting story that kept me going from beginning to end to see what happens.\n-Space combat is not the most deep out there, but its satisfying and fun. Yes it's brainless and a spacebar smasher, but enjoyable.\n-It feels like a true Star Trek experience, despite some questionable things lore-wise.\n-Missions are repetitive, yeah, but more often than not many of them can be quite creative and entertaining.\n-There is a lot of room for roleplaying if you're into that sort of thing.\n-A good amount of content that will keep you busy for a few hundred hours.\n-The foundry allows for some welcome creativity and what I consider the most meaningful player run aspect of the game. It helps keep things fresh and going when you are out of episodes from the game's main storyline.\n-Getting in-game currency is not as painful as in other games, and the Exchange (a.k.a auction house) is great for fattening up your wallet.\n-There is a sizeable amount of voice acting (many of it from actors of the actual Trek shows) to help immersion.\n-You can customize your character appearance anytime you want, and as many times as you'd like.\n-The fleet (a.k.a guilds) system is good and has a lot of things going for it, from your own fleet starbase to many other cool things you can add and customize in it.\n-There is a decent amount of fan service and the tie ins between the tv shows and the game can be clever from time to time.\n-There are nice events that let you have neat things, as well as giveaways for the same purpose.\n-The game is regularly updated with content.\n\nCons:\n\n-The game is designed to extract money from you. What I hate is that half of how it's done seems appropiate to me. The game seduces you to buy uniforms and packs from your favorite shows. If the milking would have stopped there, It would have been fine. But nope, the game asks you to pay up for the best ships of the game, or grind dilithium for around 2 months just to get one of the tier 6 ships (currently the best ones). And then theres the whole "pay here for xp boosts, pay here to unlock more inventory slots, more character slots, and this and that, and etc." which isn't as annoying as how it was on SWTOR, but still pretty out there.\n-Ground combat is terrible. At first, I accepted it for what it was, but after hundreds of hours invested here I have come to grips with reality and had to admit the truth: it is just horrible. Shallow, thin, counterintuitive, buggy, and just an overall mess. The AI of your companions gets the job done, but it is barebones basic. And enemy AI is just laughable. Patrols can be so bugged up, their walk will jitter and flicker around like a bad LSD trip.\n-The game feels like a singleplayer game that was slapped the MMO label because of some online components. There isn't really any need to group for questing and exploring, and end-game content is sort of shallow to even bother and fully experience it, so that pretty much erases any meaningful purpose to grouping.\n-Fleet actions (a.k.a. dungeons) are ok when they are space based but horrible when ground based. And even in space they can be boring, tedious and repetitive: fight waves of guys, protect some AI ships, and a small twist here and there depending on the particular one you're doing. There are different difficulties in which you can complete these, but considering you pretty much blow through everything with standard solo gear, the need to come together to get the best pieces seems like an aftertought. Don't expect endgame organized raiding here.\n-The community is just dreadful. The chat on Earth Space Dock really brings out the worst in humanity. I've actually created a special tab in the chat window that filters it out for whenever I visit. Players are not helpful, and every channel feels full of slander and insufferable banter. In groups, it's the norm to roll need on everything, even if you dont really need the gear at all.\n-This game is not noob friendly. The UI design is not entirely convoluted, but it can take a while to figure out. The map is a mess that will make your head spin the first time around. It is a labyrinthine disaster that will not be kind to a new player at all. Hell, I'm 60 and I still get confused looking at it.\n-The exploration factor is virtually unexistant, except for some random missions you can pickup when flying near some planets.\n-There is a lot of grinding, particularly with reputation, dilithium, stuff for the fleet, credits and many other currencies.\n-Bugs. Bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs. Little bugs, medium bugs, large bugs, game breaking bugs. Bugs everywhere. Sometimes they get patched. Sometimes they don't. Developers are not as terrible as people often say, but they sure slack when it comes to patching for fixing errors. Not to add content, though; they can profit from that.\n\nAnd despite having much more negative things to say about the game than positive and overall not recommending it, I feel obligated to answer the following question: is there any circumstance in which you would recommend the game? Surprisingly, yes.\n\nIf you are a hardcore fan of Star Trek and videogames, and you are willing to depart from some money then this is for you. Or perhaps if you are one of those fellows that do not mind to grind for months. If you like roleplaying, this game can be hours of fun as well if you find the right fleet.\n\nIf you're looking for a deep MMO with complex mechanics, don't bother downloading this. If you're not willing to open up the ol' wallet or grind your way through all the stuff you need, then keep browsing for something else as well.\n\nWhat keeps this game alive and running with faithful players that follow it, is that despite all the bad, it is fun. A lot of fun actually. Many of us stick around waiting for a miracle that might never come: for Cryptic to revamp the areas that need it, and to patch the game so it can be rid of the problems it has. Perhaps a bigger developing team, and a more humane cash shop.","May 6, 2015","false","530.1"," 545 of 622 people (88%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","88","545","622","23","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KTaras777/recommended/9900/","KTaras777","Taras","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KTaras777/","3 products in account","By all means play this game so long as you don't spend money on it.\n\nFor those that don't know, Star Trek Online (STO) is an MMORPG loosely based in the Star Trek universe. Canon is not followed that heavily however there are facilities to create your own story, involving roleplay communities and the foundry which is a tool to design your own missions. If you are a Trek fan I would personally leave your Trek canon feelings at the door as you might find they get challenged at regular intervals.\n\nThat said it is a personal thing, and so work through the story because that is one thing that STO has done reasonably well for. The art in STO has always been very good and so that combined with the story missions has always made good time spent.\n\nNow pre-Delta Rising this game was pretty unique in that people who were casual, hardcore, in-between or even super-casual could play the game and be able to enjoy it. You could be competitve on less than an hour a day, and while some things required more commitment, it was something that would get you competitive with others without too much grief.\n\nHowever those positives mentioned I would be negligent to not go over in detail the severe issues in the game, and therefore why I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone who wants an enjoyable, sensibly progressive experience or doesn't want a second job.\n\nI am now talking post-Delta Rising for the most part, which is where most of the issues that now permeate the game originate from. I'll be talking about the bugs, which has been an ongoing issue anyway, the difficulty settings, the ongoing issue of the degraded state of testing and bad customer relations.\n\nSTO is riddled with so many bugs it makes an ant colony look small. Two of the top developers have openly admitted to not listening to player feedback any more, which is very apparent. The beta test server is now mockingly called the 'exclusive preview server' as what you see is what you get, broken mechanics, bugs and game-breaking exploits with it.\n\nPart of the reason for this is that their QA team for STO is a measely 5 people strong (http://sto-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?p=20853101#post20853101). This has shown through the years as bugs have built up due to there never being enough bugs fixed before a lot more come in to replace them like a hydra's head.\n\nSome proof of the developers lack of regard for the player opinion:\n1) http://sto-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?p=13321451#post13321451\nThis link is to the Star Trek Online forums. It has a message from Tacofangs that tells us that by the time they are putting out content it is basically set in stone apart from the odd tweaks here and there, and usually they are just tweaks.\n\n2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYsw_GYP8Ok\nAn interview which enraged players when Geko says that there is no actionable feedback on the Duty Officer UI. Suffice to say there was plenty of it and they did back track in a small manner after the uproar the interview caused and did give an option to minimise the UI.\n\n3) http://sto-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?t=1224081&page=79\nBecause a practical case in point is always good, this is the link to the Tribble Feedback post for the Upgrade System. This is by far and away the most recent poignant example of the effort Tribble Testers such as myself put in to be simply ignored. I challenge anyone to go through that thread and find a dev response that addresses the core concerns of that well tested feedback.\n\nAs far as Cryptic are concerned, money comes first and retaining players second. Feedback is ignored unless something crops up that damages their profits, which is why the game is so badly riddled with bugs.\n\nA very recent example is the recent release (Delta Rising) had such a huge content gap that many of us had to run patrol missions to fill the levelling gap, Cryptic even recommend this as the way to do it. However a bug that was flagged up during testing was the patrols weren't all scaling. Of course because this wasn't fixed it made it the easiest patrol and so people used it to get past the absurd gaps.\n\nSo what do Cryptic do? They roll back a decent sized number of the players, cut experience gains by 70% and call everyone who took part exploiters. As you can imagine, although some would obviously exploit, the vast majority weren't and Delta Rising is becoming a PR nightmare.\n\nThe reason this turned into a PR nightmare is two fold, firstly and as I have said, they ignored tribble testers. Yet the big issue that started up was that many folks who got hit by the roll-back were innocent of any wrongdoing. Anyone who has had any serious experience with Cryptic's customer services knows their ability to read data is severely lacking. I have personally been quoted inaccurate purchase history, incorrect data on missing items and even had the representative show a critical lack of company knowledge about current events, even about new development blogs that I was asked to send a screenshot of to prove existed.\n\nNext thing I want to talk about is the state of the game in terms of how one participates in the end game content and how easy that is to do. As it stands now Ground Combat allows for a lot more build flexibility than Space Combat does. The closer you get to end game Elite level (the top grade) the more you have to build a ship that is focused on damage dealing and little else.\n\nSo to clarify, Space Combat at end game has become a DPS Race (DPS = Damage Per Second), where having DPS more in the 20-30k range or higher is essentially required to complete the missions, simply because the devs decided ramping up the hitpoints, shields and resistances on enemies exponentially was the way to improve difficulty which has only led to a system where creativity is punished in favour of linear builds.\n\nOn the other hand we have Ground Combat that is still accessible to build variety so long as the build is sensible and is well fought out, and in fact each profession can run at least 4-5 different base builds and all of them can be effective. However that being said Cryptics idea of making this harder was to increases the numbers of tough enemies in missions and make them hit harder, something that doesn't make the experience reinvigorating or challenging on ground maps.\n\nOne thing that links both though are the awkward optionals. Advanced queues have timers or objectives that instantly fail the mission if they fail, which is bad from a player progression standpoint as a fresh 50 is going to struggle to get gear they need, as the gear materials come from those missions which has led to a sort of necessity of either having a very competant team or the chance to be carried through, both options of which are poor game design. However the sad part is anyone who has the gear already has a leg up and can finish the missions with relative ease still, however at this point in time Elite Borg queues are missing so using the old favourites as a comparison is not easy, however I will post videos of before and after in case anyone wants to look them over.\n\nA comparison:\nOld Elite Khitomer Ground: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWNFn7JdbXA Only 4 Elite Tactical Drones when this was filmed.\nNew Advanced Khitomer Ground (Technically supposed to be old Elite): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhaqdIHtIEo This has 17 Elite Tactical Drones in, slightly weaker but still time eaters for less geared or experienced teams.\n\nI will post Elite Comparisons when they become available.\n\nWant to play? Go right ahead, but when you start hitting the pay walls, don't ignore the fact you'll be paying literally hundreds of whatever currency you use to get competitive, it's not like before when newer folks had every chance to be as good as the older players.\n\nSo would I recommend this to anyone? Of course not, play for free but don't be surprised when Cryptic ruins it, again.","October 25, 2014","false","259.7"," 1,064 of 1,254 people (85%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","85","064","1","56","64"

My perspective is from one who only plays PvE(Player vs Environment) content. I'd recommend you try this game if;\n\n1) you are not bored with the tradional WoW type MMO (hotbar combat)\n2) you are Star Trek fan\n3) you like to play doll with your character(s) (the character customization in this game is awesome)\n4) you can live with bugs popping up (The new VP promises that bugs will be fix fast but only time will tell)\n5) you can resist(or don't mind gambling) since there are lock boxes in the game which gives out a top prize of ships(basically classes in the game), etc BUT you can get all these things in game if you have enough in game assets to dabble in the exchange(auction house)\n6) you don't mind the usual MMO grindfests which can get repetitive to farm better gear, etc\n7) you are not a hardcore gamer\n8) your internet connection to the servers is not crap\n\nThe gameplay itself is nothing to write home about and the main reason I'm still playing it is because it's the only Trek MMO out there. The game panders mostly to the casual crowd.\n\nContrary to some, the game in my opinion is not Pay to Win. You can have access to all the ships and gear if you grind enough currency to exchange for these items which other players put up in the auction house. Using real money is just a shortcut in the game.\n\nAlso this game features player created missions, some of which, are much better than the official ones. Don't forget to give some a try if you decide to try this game out.\n\nIn my opinion, Free to Play means demo and Star Trek Online's demo is surprisingly good in the sense that it's not restrictive like in some other MMOs. If your ISP does not suck and you can wait to download a 10GB or so game, give it a try and see if it's up your alley.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/okRaleyn/recommended/9900/","okRaleyn","Raleyn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/okRaleyn/","52 products in account","Almost a year and a half and roughly 800hrs+ (1,600hrs total) after originally reviewing this game, I believe it's time to wipe the board and update from scratch.\n\nHaving played this game for so long I think I have a pretty solid understanding of the overall state of the game. Originally I was very enthusiastic about the game and may have come off as a bit one sided. Now, I'm going to try to be as unbiased as I can.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy playing this game, don't get me wrong. However, my opinion may be heavily based off of the fact that I am quite a big trekkie. If you aren't that versed in the Star Trek series or movies then you may struggle through the storyline and/or a lot of what this game is offering in terms of general aspects of the game. You could most likely still get a good experience out of this game even if you aren't really a Star Trek fan. But you've been warned.\n\nThe game starts you off with you being able to play as one out of three factions. (You can have a default of three characters which can pick between the three playable factions. You also have the option to buy more character slots if you desire) Each faction, the Federation, the Klingon Empire, and the Romulan Republic has a seperate storyline TO A POINT. After about half way through the main storyline you will be forced to play the same missions as the other two factions that you didn't pick. This may hurt replayability and/or having characters on each individual faction. The missions can become very repetetive as they follow pretty much the same idea every time. Kill something in space, go down to a planet and kill things there, come up into space again and kill something, done. However, that is just a very very very crude synopsis of each mission. There are definitely variations in this pattern and, if you follow the story and read the dialog, can be a very interesting and enjoyable experience. The storylines are quite long, however they of course stop at a certain point.\n\nAfter you've finished the main missions you can entire fleets. You may join fleets whilst still in the main missions, however they don't really mean much until you reach level 50+ or finish the storylines. Fleets consist of a group of players that donate and interact with eachother to help evolve fleet areas. Your entire fleet must work together to gather the materials needed in order to finish these projects. The higher tier a certain zone achieves you gain access to high end gear and equipment. Upgrading tiers just gives you ACCESS to the stores in which these items are located. And some items cost a pretty penny. (NOT REAL MONEY!)\n\nThere are also Reputation systems. These use a very similar tier system to a fleet, but you are the only one that can work on your Rep systems. Reputation systems give you access to high end gear and equipment. This may sound exactly like fleets but they don't give you the same type of gear.\n\nThis game makes you work long and hard for endgame gear. And what better than to give you this work than in the form of GRINDING. Yes, grinding. Lots and lots and lots of grinding. Grinding is pretty much the only way for you to get past level 50 and get to the levelcap, 60. PvEs (Player VS. Environment) or as a lot of people call them in STO, STFs (Special Task Forces) is pretty much all you're going to be doing if you want to get to level 60. Granted there are missions that you can do to get from 50 to 60 but they still leave some mighty fine XP gaps in between them that you need to grind in order to unlock the next mission.\n\nNow let's be real here. This is an MMO. It isn't uncommon to find grinding in MMOs. But what else normally comes with playing an MMO? Yep, microtransactions. Microtransactions can give you a shortcut if you don't feel like grinding. The C-Store is a large store with exclusive ships, weapons, outfits, and misc. items. All of these things I have mentioned are obtained through the ingame currency known as Zen. You can GRIND for dilithium and then turn refined dilithium into zen, but you can only refine 8,000 dilithium a day. And let's just say 8,000 refined dilithium converted into zen won't get you anywhere near the amount you'd need to get anything like a zen ship. T5 ships cost 2,500 zen and T6 ships cost 3,000 zen. You can convert real money into zen, but $1 is equal to 100 zen. So if you want a good endgame ship you'll have to either grind enough dilithium for you to get 3,000 zen or pay $30.\n\nNow, if you've been reading other reviews or been reading/hearing anything about this game you've probably heard about there being a paywall or that this game is P2W (Pay 2 Win). You can kind of understand where that's coming from now. However, I disagree to this as you can indeed get anything in the zen store without paying a cent. It'll just take much much longer. Paying in this game is just a shortcut, not a wall.\n\nCustomization in this game is on point. You can customize your character so in depthly that you can even change the positioning of your cheekbones. You can change the deepness of your chest and even how wide your ribcage is. Multiple hairstyles to choose from for both genders and multiple eye colors, skin colors, and hair colors are available. You can get more uniforms and even alien outfits in the C-Store. (Most if not all of the outfit packs are 550 zen each) You can combine multiple outfit sets together to make a 100% unique play and attire. You can even customize the colors of your individual outfit pieces with dozens of different shades. You can even customize your ship. You may customize the material of your ship's hull and even add a paintjob if you want. You may also have different bridges for those of you who want to roleplay.\n\nThe graphics aren't terrible but aren't incredibe at the same time. The optimization is pretty bad. So for those of you that like having a steady 60fps+ may be forced to run on the lowest graphical setting. And even then you may not get your beloved 60 frames all the time. I've come across many different texture bugs in my time and some have been fixed, some not. Animations in this game are lazy and in small numbers.\n\nPerformance wise this game is laggy. Server lag and frame lag are relatively common. It's bad, but tolerable in most areas. Places like Risa where vegetation is everywhere is VERY laggy. I have to turn my graphical settings ALL the way down if I want to go to Risa and even then I can only maintain about 25 FPS.\n\nSpace combat is fun and unique, it takes coordination and good gear to survive the PvEs and mission battles on maximum difficulty. It can be frustrating at times but in general the space combat is neat. Ground combat is iffy, some people like it more than space combat, but personally I find ground combat distasteful. The ground combat controls feel clunky and the HUD layout feels wrong for combat. It might just be me but that's my opinion.\n\nThe Devs (Cryptic) don't listen to the community at all.

Space is vast, huge, unimaginably large.  Space in Star Trek Online is not so much.  The game takes place mostly in our Galaxy, with the Alpha, Beta and Delta quadrants split up into three largish maps.  Once you hit level 60, it'll take you around five minutes to get from one side to another on the largest of these maps.  You can transwarp, which is like teleporting, around which greatly reduces your travel time.  There's also a sprint option for getting around.  Basically, there's a large space to fly your ship around in but it does not feel endless.\n\nThese are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.This is where the game shines, in my eyes.  Like most MMO's, you get out of it what you put in.  Star Trek Online is unique wherein you don't just work to level up your character, but your ships and bridge officers as well.  With the inclusion of Duty Officers, it's like managing your very own star ship crew.  The Duty Officer system lets you build a crew and then send them out on little missions that will last from fifteen minutes to days on end.\n\nYour voyages are a big part of Star Trek Online as well, with a large campaign on both the Federation and Klingon side and a medium sized campaign for the Romulan faction.  These campaigns are broken up into 'episodes', each segmented into different categories.  The writers certainly know their stuff, with little nods to the series littered throughout the campaigns.  A lot of these missions really make you feel like you are helping your faction though hard times or discovering new things.\n\nIts continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds. Missions in Star Trek Online are heavily instanced, with a lot of the more recent content not playable in groups.  This can make it a little harder if you're trying to play though the lot with friends and there's no really easy way to tell which missions are single player only.  There are quite a few queues once you get towards end game and most of these are a mix of challenging and entertaining.  They range from fighting off a Borg advance to pushing the Terrian Empire back into their own reality.\n\nTo seek out new life and new civilizations. Seeking out new life and new civilizations is something that Star Trek lacks a little bit in it's core gameplay.  Luckily, we've got the Foundry for this.  The Foundry is an easy to use mission creator inside Star Trek Online with the intention of pushing your missions to the live game.  These missions will be playable by everyone and with some creative thinking, the sky can be the limit with this tool.  People can donate in game currency to your account if they really enjoyed your mission, so creating something of great quality can be benificial to yourself as well.\n\nTo boldly go where no one has gone before. Star Trek Online is five years old now.  People have been here before, aside from Foundry missions, you won't discover anything new here.  Though, I'll take this time to quickly talk about the Free to Play model.  There's been some argument over the 'Pay to Win' status of this game.  While you can sink real life cash into Star Trek Online to fast track yourself to the top, you don't have to.  In fact, with a bit of time, you can actually earn in game currency and covert that to currency to buy items from the cash shop.  Obviously, Star Trek Online is geared towards wanting you to spend money and there are some brazen attempts to pull some out of you, but with some self-control, you're able to enjoy all of the story and locations without spending a dime.  Premium ships and gear is locked behind a pay wall, if you're happy not having this.  Not one single cent needs to be spent.","November 5, 2015","true","984.2"," 171 of 195 people (88%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","88","171","195","21","0"

Simple really, in the beginning this game was almost perfectly balanced, with ~30% content grind, but these things where optional and could be found as loot with % drop chance, bought from other players or simply a direct reward while you where exploring new areas etc.\nAs it is now, there are HUGE power creeps, making almost all viable options of ships and skills bad-really bad, and a handfull few stupidly overpowered and all new updates and new ships they pour in makes the ship you grind for obsoleate before you even get it.\nThere are 5 (main) types of credits. Three which you need to specificly grind for.\nAnd don't get me started on those damn Locked Boxes, you need a key to open, keys can be bought for ~1-2 000 000 credits (or just pay up real money). Each boxs has ~1-2% chance (stays at that % even if you pay) of holding ANYTHING you would like, most is just useless crap.\n\nAnd forgett the exploration they're boasting about, it's just the same thing over and over, go to place a and defeat three waves of really easy enemies, then defeat the really easy flagship, repeat. (Yes, I played on Elite setting.)\n\n\nNow let me explain where the grind element comes in, a base ship has ~20 slots for equipment.\nYou will grind for:\nSpace:\n- The ship itself. (Price for good ships ~1 000 000 ( very low end) - 100 000 000 (high end) ingame credits. One Elite mission will give you avarage ~100 000)\n- Weaponsx6-8. (It'll take you ~3 weeks to get ONE high level ship equipment from a Fleet merchant.)\n- Shield.\n- Engine.\n- Deflector.\n- Consolesx6-8.\n- Space crew skills.\n\nPersonal: (You + crew.)\n- Weaponx6.\n- Shieldx5.\n- Armourx5.\n- Skill Kit.\n- Land crew skills.\n- Crafting. (Gods only know how long THAT will take.)\n- Passive skills.\n- Sub missions. (Duty missions.)\n- Events. (These will pile up quick and if you don't do enough to turn it in (100%), you walk away with nothing.)\n- Reputationx6-7.\n- Crafting XP.\n- Crafting material. (More kinds than you have slots in your Bank btw, and you don't find the ones related to each other in the same place, forcing you to scan every single quadrant to find those you need and end up with a ton of those you don't anyway.)\n\nFleet: (Community effort.)\n- 5 buildings to simultaniously upgrade, with 6 subcategories each, all 6 can (and need to) be upgraded atleast 5 times. (All demands HUGE quantities the same resources as your ships and eqpts cost.)\nDon't think that's the end of the list, I just can't remember what more there where.\n\nSo no, no no no no no no no NO, do not start this game, because it'll eat up all your time and give you nothing in return.\n\nEdit after New Dawn:\nDid you remove your pay-to-progress? No? Well, no change here then.","October 16, 2014","false","531.5"," 503 of 639 people (79%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","79","503","639","13","20"

I don't write reviews,  I Love Star Trek and this is easy to get lost in and with all the negative reviews I've read I have to write something positive.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game.\nKills me to see/read reviews that are thumbs down by players who have hundereds of hours in and speak all this good and try to throw out "pay to win" or that cryptic doesn't give back.\n\n"it's pay to win." Everyone who complains that you have to pay to win is just wrong. You can earn game currency(zen) by playing the game. you get dilithium just by playing. You have to refine that dilithium and exchange it for zen. You are only allowed 8000 dilithium to be refined a day. at this time I think the exchange rate in 236 dilithium to 1 zen. You can do the math, too early for me to do it. Sure it takes longer than paying but what doesn't and it's not difficult at all. I saved up 3000k zen by doing this and it seemed like it took no time. For reference, you get 500 zen a month by subscription. Bought the ship I wanted that was only offered using zen.\n\nIn fact it comes easy just going through and playing you earn dilithium just doing the regular missions. You also earn by doing side crew assignments which run while you're doing missions. You earn different ships by leveling which is the other thing. Most of the ships you buy with zen aren't that much different than the ones you earn leveling, at least I wouldn't see it being a problem for a casual player of the game.\n\nPaying doesn't earn you any combat bonuses either. Paying really only opens up more slots for officers, ships, and gives currency each month. look it up on the site. It only expands those slots by a few. PLUS if you pay for a month subscription, cancel, and never sub again. you KEEP all the bonuses you earned while subscribed, with the exception of the monthly money, when you're unsubsscribed. Who else does that?\n\nI've been playing for a few years now, on and off, and all i've seen this game do is grow and develop into something awesome. I look forward to the new content or "seasons" and the devs always seem to do something to draw me back if I stop playing for a while. The map has expanded and grown to be awesome. If you're a fan, sometimes just flying around the map and visiting the places you recognize is rewarding enough. Cryptic has done nothing but improve this game step by step and continue to do so. They feature voice work by actual star trek cast and seem to be making this a truly remarkable and unique game.\n\nThe thing I love most is the foundry missions. Which are player created missions that play as episodes in Star Trek.\nSo you have your ship that you get in game, you have your crew, and then you get to take them on these episodes/missions that feel like you're playing through an episode that you're watching on TV. This is by far one of the greatest things this game has to offer for the fan who wishes he could watch a new episode. and as a plus, anyone can create missions through the foundry.\n\nThe "Fleets" are like guilds or clans in this game. and I have found them nothing but helpful. Content is unlocked by joining one. Awesome features that I think are worth your while. !st column is recommended.\n\nThe game itself is beautiful and any Star Trek fan has to geek a little to be able to take a character though all the places you've watched growing up. There are problems with every game and everyone is different in what bothers them vs someone else but to generally thumb down this game is rediculous. I feel sorry for those people because I'm sure they are having trouble finding a fleet or are frustrated with maybe the learning curve of all the content but if you give this game a fair chance, and are a fan of Star Trek, I think you'll find yourself feeling that same feeling you felt while watching your favorite episodes when they first aired just playing through and learning the game. I personally cannot wait to see what they do with it in the future.","July 23, 2015","true","473.2"," 242 of 308 people (79%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","79","242","308","13","3"

I am a lifelong Star Trek fan, and I even was a Star Trek online fan for quite a long time, but Perfect World killed this game. It is but a shell of what it used to be. They want money for every little thing. People will argue against this point, saying you can convert dilithium to zen and what not so no need to spend real money... DO NOT BE FOOLED. It is a deception. If you were to go the dilithium to zen way to purchase new ships and stuff IT WILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE LIFETIME. It's capped at 8000 Dilithium per day, you would have to spend every moment playing grinding toward your goal accross multiple characters to get what you desire.\nThe Delta rising expansion made the game so much worse than my above description even. Ships you already bought and paid for, now require expensive money bought items to be upgraded to be kept up with the new level cap increase. They decieve you by saying these upgrades are optional and not neccesary to play, but it is a lie. You will be a scrub without these upgrades. No one will want you on their team in any serious content if you run around without a properly upgraded ship.\n\nAll in all the only good part of this game is the roleplaying aspect in it.

You will encounter a plethora of memorable personalities on your journeys throughout the game while exploring both the famous and uncharted systems across the galaxy.\n\nAt the time of this review you can currently play as a Star Fleet Officer, a Citizen of the new Romulan Republic, or a Warrior of the Klingon Empire. There are three career paths that you can chose - Tactical, Science, or Engineering - which determine what skills you have access to as well as what kind of ship you will command.\n\nSTO is one of my top 3 best MMOs and is the second best MMO for Free to Play Players as there are literally no content restrictions unlike games such as Star Wars: The Old Republic (End Game content + Expansion Pack) or The Lord of the Rings Online (all content beyond The Lone Lands (level 30ish) requires individual purchase or subscription). You can easily reach max level (50) and beyond without subscribing. That being said there are the common account restrictions for F2P players, such as a currency cap, limited character slots (3), no account bank, and limited character bank storage space.\n\nIf you do decide to play STO here are a few tips:\n\n* Levels 1-49 are essentially a giant tutorial that helps familiarize you with the mechanics of the game.\n* At level 50 the game content changes from Single Player to Group as you take part in STFs (Special Task Force) missions and their Elite counterparts where you fight extremely tough enemies such as the Borg and Tholians for reputation items.\n* At End Game, Lock Box and Cryptic Store Ships are vastly superior to anything else.

Plagued with BUGS, power creeps, balance issues, an expensive upgrade system, lock boxes, dead queues, very slow leveling up process, and very expensive Tier 6 starships; has pretty much stalled STO on its track.

To me it really wasn't about the characters, it was more abou the tech and the ships.  I can pilot the NX, Excelsior, and TOS Connie?  Sign me up!\n\nI started playing the game over 2 years ago, and honestly the direction is has been moving has made it so I no longer interested in the game.  There will always be grinding in MMOs, that's a given.  STO however takes the grinding to a whole new level of bad.  The game is set up to get you to 50 quickly so you can start grinding away.  You grind for reps, the traits of which you are now limited to 4 active space and ground.  You grind for gear that is now going to be worthless so guess what?  Grind for the newer gear.  To PWE/Cryptic, grinding = content.  Add the time gates to slow down any meaningful progress in the game, and you have what amounts to a second job.\n\nThe last few feature episodes have been single player only.  So what's the point of being in an MMO if I can't run what little new content there is with friends?  This is the most single-player MMORPG I have ever played.  With the dwindling amount of players that probably won't be a bad thing in a while.\n\nNow after telling their player base there would never be T6 ships because they wouldn't want to make everyone's T5s obsolete (some costing $25.00 for a single ship), they are now rolling out T6s and giving people the opportunity to upgrade their T5s to T5Us, which will still be inferior to T6s.  In the case of fleet ships you will end up paying three times for the same ship, just to get a little better stats.\n\nIf you play STO for any length of time you will notice the cash-grabbing.  I understand they have to generate revenue, but they way they do it makes you feel used.  I have seen it grow worse with every season to the point it is so obvious now you wonder if they will charge you every time you enter Earth spacedock.\n\nIf endless grinding is your idea of fun, then this game is for you.  But this is not a Star Trek MMO.  They have moved so far away from the base material this is now a generic space MMO with a Star Trek flavor packet.  I only log in for the social aspect with my friends who haven't left the game.

I don't regret trying it, and put a lot of time into it/might not be finished with it, but I also can't recommend it as a good game. While not exactly a 'pay to win' production, there does come a point in the higher levels where upgrading your ships to the current maximum level takes more 'Zen', the purchasable currency of the game, than a person could reasonably be expected to gather themselves in-game.\n\nPros:\n- The game has great character customization. Few are willing to admit that most MMO's are basically complex dress-up games, but this game embraces that element. Not only are you afforded extensive personal customization, but all your bridge officers can be fully customized as well, ony their sex and their race being pre-determined. While there are many alien races to choose from, you can also select 'Alien', which allows you to create your own species, and gives you wildly versatile customization. Want to play as a bald, pot-bellied toddler running around with a Bat-leth? Go for it. Want your captain to look exactly like a Vault-Boy Bobble-head? No problem. Want your first officer to look exactly like one of those giant blue chicks from Avatar? Jake Sulley it up all you want.\n\n- Ship combat is fun, versatile, and very nostalgic. The mechanics mirror the way combat is portrayed in the show very well, with all the special abilities available being the go-to phrases of Captains throughout the Star Trek franchise. Emergency power to weapons, reverse sheild polarity, fire a full spread of torpedoes, activate the tacheon beam... all the technobabble of Star-Trek returns, all with unique functions in combat. My personal favorites? Ramming Speed and Self Destruct.\n\n- Uncannily challenging for an MMO. The game has the rare MMO feature of a difficulty setting, and the max difficulty is really quite challenging after the tutorial levels, and really quite crushingly difficult after around the lvl 40 mark. The ships you confront will be exceptionally more powerful than yours, often able to obliterate you in a single torpedo spread, making quick reaction time and well-thought-out tactics essential.\n\nCons:\n- Ground combat is weak, and ground missions are often exceedingly annoying puzzles that don't so much challenge you to think as force you to do a lot of tedious reading while running back and forth between consoles. Many of the ground missions were a major chore to complete.\n\n-The crafting system is dreadful. Essential resources are incredibly scant, about 2 harvesting nodes present on about 2/3s of the missions you run, and 90% of those nodes being the basic common-grade materials, meaning you'll have huge stacks of those and next to none of anything else. The only decent way to gain experience in crafting is to engage in these 20-hour research projects that prevent you from building anything while they're active, and actually building things gives you minimal experience by comparison, and wastes your over-rare resources. The only way to really succeed in crafting is to buy crates of resources using Zen, I.E real world money. Otherwise, your crafting will never in a million years keep up with your leveling, or ever be of any real value to you except perhaps in the distant future of play.\n\n- It doesn't really feel like an MMO. Besides the occassional 'Borg attack' event to which everyone in a system is invited, playing with other people is a rarity in this game. You see other folks flying through space at warp, you run into other folks at the docks/space stations, but the vast majority of missions are all solo experiences. There are ques for PVE and PVP events, but they are so long that I've never successfully joined whatever it is they're queing for.\n\n- space combat, while entertaining, follows 2-dimensional rules. While I undserstand the need for set 'up' and a set 'down' while in space combat simply to keep directions and mapping viable, ships are far too bound too and bogged down by the imposition of 'up' and 'down' in space combat. You cannot dive, nor fly straight up, nor do a flip, nor fly upside-down. You essentially move like a sub-marine and not a space-ship. This puts annoyingly restrictive limits on manuevering and heavily detracts from a players capacity to use superior piloting skills to any sort of advantage. It's also highly annoying when travling to positions/enemies above or below you, as you have to slowly spiral down or spiral up in order to change your height position. This has got to be the single greatest turn-off for me.","November 6, 2014","false","260.7"," 143 of 198 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","143","198","0","2"

If your a trekkie or a scifi lover I recommend this game.  The different story lines are well put together.  And unlike most F2P games it isn't a pay to win game.  The reasons for that is you can achieve everything the guy that just dropped some of that hard earned cash on a ship or items through just grinding and playing the game.  Play as Klingon, Romulan or the Federation character.  This Star Trek Universe takes place after the Star Trek Nemesis movie. (cause JJ Abrams universe is an alternative one) Leveling your character is fairly easy think I capped out in about two weeks if not sooner.  There is both ground and space missions.  And once you have done all the story’s because you will there is the end content like Special Task Force fighting the Borg and few others.   One cool aspect of this game is the foundry where players like you create there own missions in the foundry and upload them so you can play there missions.  Some of the people creating missions for you are fantastic at it and creating missions and its is pretty fun to give it a go.  Also if your a lonely gamer and don't play nice with others this isn’t the game for you because a lot of content is only accessible if your in a fleet ( guild).  Now there are good fleets and bad fleets.  You will jump from fleet to fleet till you find one you like.  Now on to the four types of currency the pay Zen, Dilithium which you achieve by doing missions, or different events. Energy Credits you get just by playing the game and buying and selling items, and Fleet credits.  Each has its own role in this universe the Zen enough said you buy zen to purchase different items in the zen store.  Now the dilithium which is the most important because you can sell dilithium on the market to turn into zen there is a daily cap on how much dilithium you can earn each day because Perfect World wants you to spend money.  Now the fleet credits are earned by joining a fleet (guild) and helping contribute to fleet projects.   I do however recommend you subscribe for one month if you are getting into the game because of the added perks you receive like ship slots, character slots, inventory, bank, and also the 500 zen they give you for subscribing. Then unsubscribe and you still still have those added benefits.  I still subscribe to this FREE TO PLAY game because you also earn other perks.  But as you progress in the game you will see if its for you or not.  But STO is probably one of the best F2P MMORPG's on the market.","February 13, 2014","true","85.7"," 86 of 118 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","86","118","0","0"

That is a good question and I would have to say yes and no.\n\nYes if you are a Star Trek fan and no if you are looking for a casual MMO with no pay wall.\n\nYes I know nearly 800 hours in game… But there is no way anyone can play all aspects of this game,  getting 5 Toons (characters) to level 60, have full reputation, end game gear and all R&D at level 15 in less than 500. Unless you pay a boat load of cash and even then there are things that are behind time gates to max out all your crafting will take 4-6 months minimum.\n\nPro's\nThe lore and story are really damn good and the major saving grace of this game. If you are a Star Trek Fan then you will love this, as it takes all cannon and moves on with it in its own universe. Introducing enemas new and old from all over the franchise.\n\nyou can also play it your own way want to load your ship up with different colours of weapons and look like a happy rainbow of death then go for it. Want to be the next Picard and try to be diplomatic about things than strap your Toon into a Galaxy class, say ♥♥♥♥ in French and go bring peace to the cosmos.\n\nSpace battles are well done and you will in the early stages have to think about how you approach things even more do on the elite difficulty with friends.\n\nMost of the story can be played with friends as a co-op.\n\nGraphics are starting to show there age but are still quite pretty.  Ship detail is very good.\n\nCustomization is a big strength from clothing to ship paint to various bumpy heads you can change it all including making your toon a midget with a hightist attitude.\n\ncons.\n\nPVP: let’s get this out of the way PVP is essentially dead in this game and is more between friends than fleets(Clans guilds). The PVP system in game is in major need of an overhaul.\n\nBugs such as doing an episode (Quest) with friends only to have the game say. “Oh no you didn’t and you were never there.”\nBeaming into solid objects,\nReset to Boff (Bridge duty officer) powers. Yep those are important but hay it’s just to make getting that first place all the more difficult as your team gets murdered when you are scrambling to rest them so that you can help\nCamera angle resets at the most inopportune moments,\n\nlag\n\nrubberbanding "Boldly going to where you have already been"  can at times be rife.\n\nWhile you can put in a ticket to report bugs as I have many times… Do not expect there to be anything done about it unless it is extremely bad. Lag and banding  are normally felt if an instance has more than 35 persons in it or if your ping is above 90. Before you ask it is not my PC or internet connection my PC being an I7 4770K@4Ghz 32GB ram and 2 R9 280's  and the game is on an SSD the internet connection I have is 50Mb down and 3Mb up  and they system is kept very clean.\n\ncombat in general is all pew pew pew.\n\nLack of Cryptic love for the science class. Seriously Cryptic treat that class like the creepy uncle your parents told you to stay away from.\n\nOther elements.\n\nCommunity. For a game that has little to no official community managers, The games community For the most part are welcoming and helpful with just the few elitist or idiots that blame the noob for their own misgivings Chat is normally quite active and some are always willing to help if you get stuck. There is a forum reddit and various online tools to help with the game.\n\nIn game currency is split into four parts. Energy credits EC (main), Dilithium, Lobie crystals and Gold Pressed Latnum (GPL).\n\nEC can buy you almost anything from ships to weapons but the game suffers from greed a hell of a lot so it may take you time to get what you need with some items costing in the hundreds of million range. There is also a 10.000.000 EC cap on the free to play characters.\n\nDilithium is your life blood for R&D it is needed to upgrade weapons with good procs hoard that pink crap as much as you can and never spend it to get out of a time gate.\n\nLobie is used for some nice to have not need to have consoles and is gained from opening lockboxes.\n\nGPL is pointless and not really needed.\n\nIs the game pay to win. In the strictest manner no not realistically unless you have more money than sense $5 would get you one fleet module that will sell for about 10-15 mil EC on the exchange one epic beam bank with the best procs will sell for about 100 mil and you would need 8 of them . Cannot buy power or your way to the top of the DPS tree unless you spend a hell of a lot it is easier to grind out than to spend.\n\nAh but what about tier 6 (T6) ships.  Aren’t they more powerful. “NO”  It is the weapons, consoles and the person’s ability to pilot their ship other way around I have in PVP taken down T6 ships with a T4 free ship a T4 is viable at end game so long as you have a dps of over 10,000 you would not hamper your team.\n\nAnyway the game is free to play so give it a go just don’t spend cash unless you really want to\n","November 12, 2015","false","162.3"," 85 of 117 people (73%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","73","85","117","14","5"

That and I've learned to tolerate the poor ground combat and some of the game's other weak areas and there are a lot of weak areas.\n\nHowever it's not all bad.

Very poor ground combat, poor quest design, currency grinding, clunky interface, ugly ground textures and dated special effects accentuated by a patch work of development suggesting a lack of resources and focus. There's also an extremely heavy emphasis on paid content and little attention given to free and pre-existing content that needs work.\n\nHowever despite all that the game is free.

Sadly, the studio that developes and runs it has turned out to be profit centric to the point of ignoring things like constant spamming by asian players in chat asking you to pay them money for in game currency (which you can't block out until they've spammed you), server disconnects that are rampant (7-12 times per day on average), content that either is tempermental or flat out doesn't work, fleet options that seem to get broken after every other update and content push (which defeats the purpose of having a fleet), etc...\n\nHaving put nearly 100 hours into the game itself, I'll admit that aspects of it are quite fun but over the years the quality of the game has been declining.  What I find interesting is that again, this game could be fantastic if it was supported and maintained better.  Sadly, it doesn't seem like this is the goal of the developement team.  I suppose when they had the opportunity to do more as a pay to play format, they did what many of the smaller developers do and soaked up profits while neglecting their product.

If the developement team would be willing to fix outstanding bugs, content and servers, I would consider revisiting this review and possibly stating that paying for it would be worth it, but as it stands I simply can not encourage anyone to spend their money on this game.\n\nI would caution anyone from complaining on the actual cryptic forums as they have been known to ban people for posting negative reviews on their forum.  If you're going to post anything against them, I would recommend doing it here since Steam isn't beholden to Cryptic studios.","October 29, 2015","false","128.0"," 85 of 130 people (65%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","65","85","130","8","8"

It has it's defects, I won't lie to you. But it's definitely the most original mmo experience I've ever had, the most vision inspired and honest endevour!\nThere's plenty to do, space combat is great, complex and exciting. As are the mechanics of gameplay, in general. Ground combat is ok, but improvents are constantly in development. Also, to be honest, pvp play falls a bit short at the moment, even though after just a first match you can realize that there's huge potential, and the community around pvp is remarkable (they even started an open school!). Gameplay is very story-driven, and most of the narrative inside it's absolute TOP NOTCH Star Trek fiction -they have brillian writers. It is, I think, the only place where new Trek episodes are being made at the moment. It's been showcased in many mmo rpg reviews and also won a "best free to play" title a year ago.\nIf the game is not enough for you, and if you feel like it, there's an integrated editor called "The Foundry" where every player can create their own episodes (=quests, pve campaigns), and upload them into the game for everybody to play, review and vote (there's a periodic competition with prizes for the winner)! The content is limitless!\nWhat else can I say... I just loved it from day one and I will keep playing it, as I know Cryptic is committed and passionate about making it a little better every day!\n\nJust try it out and decide for yourselves, it's free to play for crying out loud!! :D\nLive long and prosper!","January 29, 2014","true","910.9"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","30","37","0","0"

I've been a player of Star Trek Online for about 5 years now and I gotta say; it's not getting any better.  That said, let's start out with the good...\n\n(TLDR At Bottom)\n\nYou can't talk about a Star Trek game without talking about immersion.   This game does draw you in and make you feel like you're a part of the 24th century universe that began with Christopher Pike and continued for decades after.  You feel like you’re a  part of an ever growing galaxy, doing missions to better the life of those around you.  That said, it’s only good immersion for one pass through.  Starting a second character on the same faction finds you instantly bored and upset with having to perform the same exact story over again.  Thankfully there is more than one race, which means more than one story.  If you want to stay the same race though, just take a different route (Assault/Science/Engineering) you’ll find yourself performing the same story over and over again.  In addition, the additional content that is added after the 3 main storylines is pretty much identical no matter what race you are.  Thus, you only get one playthrough of the additional content before you're repeating it with your other races. Anyway, back to the good stuff…\n\nSound and graphics are well done in this game.  Arguably the best Star Trek experience yet.  Game play adds to that experience as well.  Large ships, while having more firepower and armor, actually feel bulky and slow while smaller ships are much faster and more maneuverable.  You have to customize your equipment/ship to the style you play or you’ll quickly find yourself in a lot of trouble when an enemy race locks its weapons on you.  There are also a HUGE array of ships you can use, of all classes and sizes, bringing a high level of variety, sort of...\n\nNow let’s get to the bad.  This game is distributed by Perfect World.  That means the game is free, but not really.  The game has been slowly converted from a very balanced system to what exists today, a heavy “pay to win” system.  The best ships are only really available on the marketplace and every new ship has a higher price than the last newest ship.  Now, I’m not going to say I haven’t purchased my share of ships, because I have.  But it gets extremely frustrating when a ship you paid good money for is suddenly made inferior by the next ship released, with that ship then being made inferior by the next, and so on, and so on, and so on.  This has quickly become the biggest money grab in the history of MMO’s.\n\nToday, if you want the latest collection of “Tier 6” starships (9 in total) you’ll have to fork out 12000 Zen (the store currency) for the bundle, which equals around $130 of real cash.  Believe it or not, that’s actually a deal!  Buying just the tripple bundle for a specific race costs 6000 Zen ($70, roughly).  Buying each ship individually for 3000 Zen would be an astronomical $315!  For virtual ships in a game where said ship will probably be inferior in less than a couple months, that’s a lot.\n\nIn all honesty, the pay-to-win scheme has literally destroyed this game.  On top of all the crap available in the market, which includes inventory expansions, expanded ship storage, upgrades, clothing, bridge layouts, shuttles, and so on, you start to hate looting ships/people because of all the drop boxes you’ll collect.  Of course, the drop boxes are locked and require you to purchase keys (from the market) to unlock them.  I remember, at one time, having my inventory filled with nothing but drop boxes.  Like an idiot I paid for about 30 keys (can't remember the cost, but it wasn't cheap) and got what I expected.  The boxes either had absolute junk or items that would become useless within a very short time.  There was always a very rare chance of getting a starship in a drop box, but I never did.  That said, I've heard of people spending hundreds of dollars on keys just to get those rare ships.  (Maybe Perfect World isn't stupid, because people are)  After my 30 keys were used I started dumping the drop boxes in the garbage, as selling them on the auction is totally useless.  Trust me, if you go to the auction and type in the name of any drop box you’ll have no less than 50 pages of already existing auctions at stupid low prices.\n\nSome players might argue that you can trade in-game dilithium for Zen, and it’s true.  That said, all this has done is pushed the cost of the items in the marketplace higher.  In addition, you can only convert so much dilithium every day, and the exchange doesn’t guarantee how much your dilithium is actually worth.  Honestly, it’s worse than gold farming in other MMO’s.  Not worth the time or effort you’ll have to put into it.\n\nTLDR :\n\nSo, do I recommend this game?  Absolutely not.  The pay-to-win scheme has pretty much destroyed this game and the massive amount of drop boxes you’ll end up looting will annoy the hell out of you.  It’s got a fairly good story, which continues to expand, but the game just feels like a Ferengi designed it.  So no, I don’t recommend it.  Why then is my play time is as high as it is?  Not really because I enjoy the game.  I was one of the saps who got suckered early into sinking money into this P2W pit of decay, before we saw it for what it was, and I wanna be sure I get my money’s worth before the final nail goes in the coffin... That's why.","May 14","false","50.8"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","31","39","5","4"

The aesthetics are very good, although there may be some lag if you enter a high player-vs.-environment area.\n\nThe lore is very good, and you can teleport down to countless planets and walk around, doing missions on the ground. There are vehicles too and the combat is pretty standard for an MMORPG. The grinding and item drops are reasonable, and you can grind HARD to get a good ship, but that will take A LOT of time.\n\nThe coolest feature is when you deploy your squad into an enemy ship, however, I really wished it could be like Pirates of the Caribbean (the XBOX original, buggy gem) where you could take it over and use for your own, but you cannot (would take away from the grinding aspect of the game).\n\nThere is a massive variety of missions, both in space and on the ground.\n\nThe space battles can be very, very fun when you go into an area with a lot of activity.

If you use to paying 50 bucks for a game or even 30 you should have no problem buying a ship and flying it around. Ive seen some negative reviews but the reason i personally come back is I love star trek and the game is really the best thing we have as fans of the series to play with. Arc games has some.... Issues but there is alot of content to find in this game. Not as much as WOW or even Runescape in terms of size but more so custom ships and different builds. Ive been playing on and off for about 2, 3 years and you cant go wrong if you want to play the game. Have a open mind and just have fun. Heads up though if its your first time go with Tactical.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnkilo/recommended/9900/","johnkilo","johnkilo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnkilo/","46 products in account","If I had reviewed this game a few months ago, it would have definitely gotten a thumbs up... but now that I have over 700 hours into the game, I've started to see cracks in the facade. To start with the positives, the game plays like a single player game. I myself do not really care for MMOs in general as I generally don't like being forced to deal with the toxic communities of games, but STO is much different. Sure there are jerks, but by in large the community is willing to help you if you have a question. The game plays just like a single player game, just incase you really don't want to deal with other players.\nAlso, the ships are pretty well modeled, and space combat (especially with a lot of ships) really gives you that big battle feeling of the Star Trek TV shows.\nUnfortunately those are the only positive I can say without adding negatives, so lets dive into the rest.\nThe story lines for the Romulans and Klingons are especially strong (the Federation is rather generic), unfortunately very early in those two races stories, you end up having to do the same exact missions you had to do as a Federation character. To me it seems to be a huge cop-out by the developer. If you play at an average pace, you will be done with all of the story missions up to current day. When you consider that this game debuted almost 6 years ago, that is quite disappointing. In my opinion, rather than getting any wash-up actor who made a guest appearence, or had a supporting role on any of the Trek shows, they should forget about that and focus on more frequent releases of storyline missions.\nSpeaking of missions, there are a few gems that are well written, creative, and fun to play, but by in large every missions consists of an opening space phase where you fight to reach a planet, you then beam down and have to fight on the ground and accomplish an objective, and then you beam back to your ship and have to battle in order to leave. Those types of missions make up a good 85-95% of the game.\nAlso, the major story arc the game has been leading up to for years (fighting the Iconians), has been a complete disappointment since it has debuted. Almost as if the developers didn't know what to do with it now that it has finally arrived, and now they are in a big rush to end it and debut their new story arc for the game.\nThankfully the new story arc seems to involve more exploration and less shooting, which is what Star Trek is really supposed to be about (in theory). Everyone loves space battles, but after the five hundreth time of doing them, it is nice to have something different.\nThere is a system in the game where people can create their own stories and missions, and make them available for everyone else in game to play. It is a good idea in theory, but even the top rated ones I have sampled are amateurish and dialogue heavy. After 5 minutes of playing one you will just want to get on with it and start skipping dialogue.\nOne of the biggest universal complaints about this game are the microtransactions. Yes, this is a "free to play" game, and they need to make their money somehow. I don't have a problem with it, but I do have a problem for the ridiculous prices they charge you for the smallest stuff. Want to rename your character? That will be $5. Want to respec your skills? Another $5. Want a cool ship instead of the neutered free ones they give you? That will be $20 AT LEAST. The norm is $25-30. Anything cool, from ships to uniforms, that you may want will no doubt cost you money. Yes you can get the TNG Enterprise D or the Enterprise E from the later movies for free, but they are the much weaker versions. Fortunately you CAN get through all of the storyline missions with the free ships. You may have a bit of trouble in the later stages of the game, but it can be done. I will give the developer credit for how masterfully they've made the game to convince players to pay money. The longer you play the game you can really see how things like daily dilithium refining caps, lack of inventory space, bank space, etc is all crafted to steer you to spend money. It's very sad that the serious players have to have one main character and then several other characters that all essentially farm and supply the main character with enough resources/in game currency to accomplish things in a reasonable amount of time.\nAlso, it is worth mentioning that the Klingon faction is essentially dead in the game. The majority of players either play Federation, or Federation aligned Romulans in the game.\nAlso, doesn't anyone think it is odd that this game which is mainly about the Federation, who are essentially space communists, is centered around an in game item selling system? In order to make any decent amount of money in the game, you will have to work "The Exchange" and sell items to other players.\nWhich brings me to the end of this long review. Once you finish the story missions, have joined a fleet (this game's equivalent of a guild) and have gotten decent gear, you will be able to handle anything in PVE (PVP in this game is essentially non-existant, not that it isn't there, people just don't really play it). It is at this time that all there really is left to do is to grind for every so slightly better, and more time consuming to get, gear. When you stop and think about it, and consider that PVP in this game is almost a non-entity and you can already beat most things in PVE when you are in the "end game" with ease , what is the point of grinding? If you continue to grind for better gear, and drop lots of money getting the top tier gear, you're only essentially doing it for bragging rights.\nSo anyways, to sum all of this up, if you really love Star Trek and want to try this, go for it, play through the storyline missions, but don't spend a dime on it. Also expect to run out of things to do, other than grinding, within a couple months (depending on how often you play). It's not so much that STO is a bad game, I do think they have gotten a lot right and did fairly right by Star Trek, but that it has fallen victim to the micro-transaction model of making games and is very clearly a cash grab at this point in its life.\nOne final thing, if you do think you want to spend money on this game, consider that someday the game's servers will be taken down permanently (like all old MMOs) and you will be left with nothing to show for your money spent.","September 6, 2015","false","721.2"," 56 of 87 people (64%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","64","56","87","6","0"

Well, it turns out that the gameplay is pretty great (once you level up a bit, of course) and the writing is fantastic! If you don't care about Star Trek, you most certainly won't care about this game (as the best parts are fairly story-centric) but if you do, there's a good chance you'll love it. The ground combat is pretty mediocre, but after the early-game bits the devs clearly realized that, and instead lean heavily into the space combat (which is *awesome*), leaving weirder, more puzzley elements for the ground-based mission bits.  The only real problem I have with the game is its unfortunate need to use MMO trappings sometimes. With the occasional fleet battles notwithstanding (see: recreating The Battle of Sector 001 ad infinitum) there is basically no reason for this to be an MMO. Apparently, once you hit the level cap there's not a ton of stuff left to do besides fleet-based raids, but each of the three factions has a unique story progression, so while I can't speak for the quality of any faction's story except the Federation, there's an easy 100+ hours of story-based game here to play for absolutely no money. That said, it's totally worth a few bucks to get some of the unique ships or costumes from the shows, if you want them. The game is structured around three different specializations (basically buff/debuff/healer, tank/warrior, and minion master), but you are never locked from acquiring a differently-optimized ship and can make up the difference with bridge officers, as well as getting a respec token every few levels, so you're never really 'locked in' to a particular playstyle. Anyway, I just like this game a lot more than I thought I would, so, recommended.","June 27, 2013","true","82.5"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","28","38","0","0"

The PVP is dead or woefully unbalanced and despite the three "classes" (the three departments in starfleet, science, tactical and engineering) the holy trinity does not exist here. It is all about DPS numbers with all group PVE actions requiring high DPS to have a chance. The story up to end-game is enjoyable for both of the main factions (fed and klingon) and the sub-faction (romulan) but when you reach max level the game boils down to run the same mission over and over and over to gain currency to buy better gear to make the same mission easier to complete.

Since I have not had to pay for the game, following Beta, I have had the fortune of enjoying it off and on at leisure. STO, has evolved since the beginning, with a whole new research and development system, additional episodes with a magnificent ton of canon content, STO allows players to experience up close, old favorite worlds, species we've grown up with for decades, and new, powerful enemies of ancient Trek lore, back to cause destruction. The graphics are mid-level, but the game makes up for those shortcomings by allowing players to fully customize their ships, officers, characters, and more.\n\nOne evil little caveat, this game is notorious, and I do literally mean Notorious for it's legion of micro-transactional content. I do not agree with the level the current owners of ESO take micro-transactions. I believe that paying out of pocket for the chance to wear Star Trek: The Motion Picture costumes, is a little overboard. This is just one example, there are hundreds more. Each has to be bought separately with coins from the in-game store. Coin's can be purchased with real money. As a huge fan of Trek, up until about 2 years ago I had purchased everything the in-game store allowed, and the sheer volume of new content available by micro-transaction was so high, I didn't have the hundreds or even thousands of dollars necessary to keep up with it. Sadly, there is a lot of content, including actual pay to win ships, consoles, etc. which may be out of the casual gamers reach. If one can overlook this glaring and elephant in the room sized flaw the game has, the game can be fun. The episodes are like playing an interactive star trek series. It has a lot of room for growth and potential.

The F2P model feels fair since you can grind for the in-game currency that allows you to buy any ship or NPCs in the game. There is no paywall to speak of since as a completely F2P player I managed to get ships and equipment good enough to do endgame content.\n\nMy favorite part of the game is building up the roster of capable Duty Officers that you can send on missions, just like what a real captain of a starship is expected to do. Your duty officers can even come back injured if the mission was particularly harrowing, and take time to heal in sickbay. Want to see Seven-of-Nine as a Bridge Officer on your own ship? You can do it in this game.\n\nSo why did I stop playing? It's not the F2P nature of the game, which I still hold as a gold standard for F2P games. It's the lack of immersion which I crave for in games that finally drove me away. First and foremost, there is an insane number of loading screens. Moving from a room in my own ship to another room can result in a loading screen that can take up to a minute to load.\n\nAlso, the art direction does not feel like Star Trek and the textures on some of the ship are very low resolution, such as my favorite ship in Star Trek, the Intrepid class. The new ships made just for STO did not feel like Star Trek.\n\nOther graphical infidelities kept grinding at me: the phasers on a starship do not fire out of the phaser strips, the bussard collectors are static, the ceiling is way too high inside a ship. And last but certainly not least, I have to pilot the ship myself all the time where a captain in Star Trek leaves the piloting to the helmsman. I signed on to play as a captain, not a helmsman. Immersion gone.\n\nI would return to the game if they fixed this but this is impossible without a total rewrite of the game, which will never happen. Perhaps in the next Star Trek MMO we will have a more immersive experience, but don't write off this one just because it's not perfect. It's a great experience while you level up and enjoy the stories in the missions, all without spending a single cent.","April 8","true","559.0"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","19","23","2","0"

The engine is fifteen years old and it shows.  The visuals are primitive and great fun for the Playstation 2 enthusiast crowd.  However, because the game is built on Cryptic's ancient proprietary engine, the game suffers tremendously.\n\nThe early (first two weeks or so) of play, this game is very entertaining.  It may be prehistoric, but the pew pew is mildly entertaining.  The earlier storylines are pretty good, but many have been revamped recently, and the revamps are utterly awful.  The dialogue reads like it was written by a middle school student that watched too much scoobie doo growing up.\n\nAfter the leveling ends, however, you are presented with the reality of the game.  Since being bought out by Perfect World Entertainment, Cryptic has lost most of the rights to direct the development of their games.  As a result, Star Trek Online and other Cryptic IPs like Neverwinter have recently begun losing players at a dramatic rate.  The honeymoon after going FTP has reached it's inevitable conclusion with this game as Perfect World Entertainment has turned this game into a thinly veiled scam and gambling interface that utterly diminishes the intellectual property and is pretty offensive.  There is a common excuse used by Cryptic apologists that 'well, all FTP games are like that these days'.  Hogwash.  That's no excuse.\n\nBecause Perfect World has so drastically reduced Cryptic's resources to develop the game, there has been little to no real content introduced since early last year.  Ever quarter or so, Cryptic is able to scrounge together a 'featured episode' that evidently has never been edited or run through any kind of quality assurance, and call that 'content'.  At the same time, the bulk of their resources and development is spent on introducing more 'lockbox' ships.  These 'lockbox ships' are quickly thrown together reskins of earlier ships and don't really introduce anything to the game.  You have the privilege of paying for lockbox keys in order to open the boxes that contain them if you feel lucky, as you have less than a .005% chance of getting the ship in the lockbox.  The entire game runs off of this mechanic.  Where a valid and reputable game has a crafting system, Star Trek Online has a gambling system, where even if you spend the 8-12 months (yes, an entire year) maxing out a single crafting skill, you can't actually craft the gear you are trying to.  Instead, you are permitted a minimal 'chance' to create the desired gear.\n\nSo in the end, Star Trek Online is a good game to play for a few weeks.  As the lead developer has stated the game isn't really interested in retaining players.  They rely completely on gamer churn.  There is no endgame content, there is no meaningful progression, there is no reason to invest a single dime in or continue playing past the level cap.  Everything after that point is a sad scam designed to get you to throw out those dollars.  And we're not talking three or four dollars here.  For the ships gated by Perfect World Entertainment's Zen (ingame currency) store, you are expected to shell out between 25 and 120 for what you're after.  120 dollars for a ship in this prehistoric engine on a game that is just a thin veneer for a gambling simulator.\n\nI would have recommended this game to people about two years ago.  But now, as the population is disappearing and the ingame community is dwindling to nothing, as well as the development team holding a very public scorn for the remaining players, I would have to say 'save yourself the heartache'.  Watching what Perfect World Entertainment has done to the Star Trek intellectual property will break your heart if you're a Star Trek fan.  According to rumor there is another Star Trek MMO in the works.  Wait for that one.  This one isn't worth your time.","April 22","false","820.0"," 39 of 60 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","39","60","6","0"

Yeh, it is, I can't argue with this as I've spent quite a lot over my 400+ hour gametime. HOWEVER, if you only take part in PvE, the story and the endgame reputation system then you have no reason to buy anything. You can earn everything in game. Once I realised this I stopped throwing money into it and I've since had a blast not paying for anything. Granted it all takes a lot longer and some things, like saving for the late game ships and equipment, can take hundreds of hours as well as careful resource managment.\n\nI should say at this point this is also not Star Trek, at least not for me. If you liked the TV series for the tense diplomacy and starship standoffs, you probably won't like the 'story' aspect of this game (which involves throwing your starship at wave after wave of opponents in never-ending explosive battles - which tbh is awesome :p). If you liked the films, epic, all guns blazing space battles, (see above) then go for it, you will love this game.\n\nThe community is pretty good, all fairly laid back and the fleet actions  and STF's are a fun.\n\nOne final point about the 'pay-to-win'. The ships you can buy with real money are hit and miss, some are worth it, some aren't and they are all upwards of £15, the really good tier5+6 ships are around £25-£30. So... if you are thinking of buying a ship, my advice is to only buy the endgame ships (tier5+6) as these are the ships you'll spend the most time in, I wasted money on a middle tier ship and now it just sits doing nothing and didn't really get me anywhere I couldn't have gotten by just playing the game. If you are wanting to buy a ship do some research, ask around and ask yourself 'Do I really, REALLY need this to enjoy the game?' - Most of the time the answer will be no.\n\nDespite the paywall, I would recommend this game. It is cheesy, spacey, laser-battlin' good.","November 25, 2014","true","554.6"," 115 of 197 people (58%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","58","115","197","13","0"

Though at level 2 I found a bug that prevents me from playing any more.  You beam down to the Academy after doing some space tutorial missions and my ability to beam back up to my ship was missing.  I searched the hud for a good long while and found plenty of buttons to buy stuff at thier store, but no way to get unstuck.  There's also a transwarp feature that was greyed out.  Effectively imprisioning me at the academy.\n\nI attempted to ask people how to get back but was all but ignored in local.  I attempted to use the Zone chat and found that unless you give them money, you can't use this feature.  I had to make a hot chick character in order to get the Star Trek community to even acknowledge me.  I learned where the Beam Up button was supposed to be.  Which it was not.\n\nI went to the forums and found that I could not post because I was new.  I looked to see if anyone else had this issue and sure enough I found posts that were from years ago that had this same issue.  From what I can tell there has been loads of content created for you to buy, but bugs like being forever stuck somewhere have not been fixed in years.\n\nI've submitted GM tickets in the game and on thier website but I am doubtful that it will be responded to since it has nothing to do with thier store.\n\nIt's too bad they don't support thier players.  It was fun while it briefly lasted.\n\nEDIT:\nI was wrong, GM's did in fact send an email response.  Here is the response to a 3 year old progression stopping bug.\n\n===\n"Hello,\n\nThank you for contacting us.  We are sorry to hear that you are having issues with beaming out of Starfleet Academy.\n\nUnfortunately, with being such a new Character, if you get stuck within these first few missions, you may need to re-create your Character. We also advise following the tutorial in the order it was presented and refrain from deviating from any of it until you have finished all the tutorial missions. In addition to that, please let the cinematics (if any) run to the end to ensure that the mission updates correctly.\n\nOnce you get to Earth Space Dock, please be careful not to beam back to the Academy avoid this issue again.\n\nWe truly apologize for the inconvenience this has caused."\n===\n\n\nIt makes me wonder if a max level character that runs into a bug like this would have to delete his character and start over as well.","November 8, 2014","false","11.1"," 70 of 116 people (60%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","60","70","116","15","4"

This is a massive multiplayer online game that is part role playing game, part over the shoulder shooter and part star ship navigation and combat. I love Star Trek as we probably all do to even be here reading this. I've always wanted a game that gives you the total feeling of captaining a star ship, commanding an away team and interacting in a universe. Star Trek online feels shallow and hollow in some areas, yet needlessly cumbersome in others.\n\nThe game is shallow with interactions and choices. The game delegates talking with characters down to a portrait and written text. No voice acting, but maybe I have been spoiled. I take that back, there is some horrible voice acting from Leonard Nemoy to start the game and the holographic doctor that acts as a tutorial is one of the flattest and worst voice acting I've ever heard. Especially when the EMH doctor on Star Trek Voyager uses the same lines with a pop and snap. The dialog is so bland that I just skip through it because everything you need to do is marked with an exclamation point. It would have also felt better to be able to interact with more random objects like scan flowers that are not marked and have a 1% chance every hour to find something. There are still interactions like anomalous readings that open up a wave pattern mini game that is very easy to say the least.\n\nRight off the bat it is a disappointment as you are thrown into a conflict with the Borg who in the Star Trek universe should not be for beginners. Nor should they fall easily, but you might as well have a fly swatter for all the Borg you'll encounter.\n\nLuckily if you have a problem with the missions, there is an actual mission editor. You can submit your missions and have them put into the game which is a nice touch.\n\nLike any MMO, you get to pick a race, pick a class from three (red, blue and yellow). Everyone seems to pick red. Each race has special traits and you can customize your look with excessive detail. It all feels very superficial.\n\nWhen you're not walking around and talking, you're either flying a ship or shooting things. The shooting is good and pretty easy even if its one dimensional. Point your phaser at the target you want to die or blow up and keep firing til its dead. Shooting civilians doesn't matter... and it should. You get an away party that you make up of crew members that you find or recruit throughout your play. Its a fun micromanagement thing and your allies are pretty competition and takes away from a MMO when your party is made of computer characters. The ability to just jump into someone else's party to replace the computer would have been nice.\n\nYou have some basic controls to fly around, but it seems a little cumbersome, throttling up to go forward and then going to impulse... Flying around objects and toward objects to blow them up or beam off survivors. The visuals are beautiful here, but the fact you're over dead space makes things seem pretty lifeless unless there's a space battle going on.\n\nSpace battles are where the game excels. You have 4 "power" settings... attack, defense, speed and balanced. They all do what you'd think to make it easier for you to survive. In a space battle, your star ship has 4 shields, front, rear, left and right. Taking too much damage to one shield will leave your ship vulnerable and easy to kill. So you need to maneuver around the ship you're facing firing off phasers to drain their shields and torpedoes to finish them. Oh and aft weapons as well. The weapons have cool down times just like any MMO. Some space combat missions feel like a slog when you're on your own... kill 4 enemies here, fly there, kill 4 more enemies, fly there, kill 4 more and go back and they respawn... 1 ship vs 4 quite frequently. There are no quick battles until you level up. Then there are massive battles MMO style where its 10 players vs 1 super ship or 10 players vs 10 ships then 10 more then 10 more then 10 more. There is a noticeably slowdown on my laptop for those.\n\nYou can visit your bridge and ship interior from your vessel, but there is little life there. There are plenty of NPCs and big hollow areas, but no one speaks and its more of just a little head nod that... yes we have your ship interior. Perhaps in further stages of the game the bridge opens up, perhaps when your ship is boarded by alien hostiles... but that is just a prayer that's what happens. Perhaps drama of your ship filling up with deadly gasses and you and a party need to save everyone. Oh and another glaring detail is the fact that when you start the game you pick how your uniform looks... why is it no one else from my crew is wearing the uniform I have chosen? Am I the rogue ensign captain that does as he wishes?\n\nThe missions greatly vary but after a while they feel very copy and paste. Some missions are well thought out with plot twists. Other missions seem one dimensional, like space battles where you need to destroy 4 satellites protected by a squad each... then fly to pick up dilethium that is guarded, then drop off dilethium but you can't, because your transporters are being blocked by a jamming station that is guarded, so when you return after destroying the jamming station the dilithium drop point is guarded. Constant space battles are not a good thing. Neither are the missions where you are exploring random planets where 2 of which have been baron and devoid of life or action. You are sent down to scan 4 objects on one with no enemies and barely anything to look at. Another planet had me in a cave with no enemies downloading audio logs that I couldn't listen to... what? Those are the bad missions and the missions seem to each take 40 minutes with sections that take 10 minutes.\n\n5 or 6 hours into the game, you get duty officers that you get to send on away missions. These are not missions that you do, but rather as a captain you need to assign the right people for the job. Its a nice little add on, but not needed for sure. The officers have jobs and personality quirks like stubborn, a team player, logical and so on. The missions specify what traits and jobs are best suited for each away mission.\n\nIn all, with no voice acting for the flat characters and bland dialog coupled with mediocre missions I can't get into it and I'm a big fan of the lore. I really think that the game makers missed the point of Star Trek and that wasn't space exploration it was drama. Sure you travel to far away planets and dogfight against other star ships, but the point of the TV series and movies was the characters and this game has flat characters. The game doesn't really feel like an MMO. After 15 hours I've never really interacted with anyone except for seen them flying by and the big boss battles. Nothing seems to have consequence, there could have been factions and alliances instead of just Federation vs Klingon. Or your own personal alliances like Morrowind.","August 12, 2012","true","80.9"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","0"

I know plenty of people who will say it's crap, the devs are awful, the game's engine is bad, and so on and so forth. The graphics are good enough, there's not much lag, and it's generally fun to blow up Borg. Coming from a few other F2P games (*cough* WAR THUNDER *cough*), I feel as though the developers of STO do somewhat care about their playerbase.\n\nGame progression is easy enough, until you hit level 50. Leveling up to 60 gets a bit tedious, but you can access the whole game (minus a few not-really-important story missions) from 50. The learning curve is fairly steep - I'd recommend looking at a few tutorials before trying to work in the community exchange. There is, as always, premium currency, but you can change one of the other types of currency into it (for a large ingame expense). There are multiplayer missions with other players, and the harder the difficulty the better the rewards are upon completion. There are eight or so "campaigns" that give out some good gear. The ships are accurate, as far as I can tell. I hate long reviews, so this is gonna be pretty short.\n\nFor me, the most important part of a game is whether or not I had fun playing it. Here, the answer to that is a definite "yes". If you don't believe me, try it out. It is, after all, free.","December 27, 2014","true","743.1"," 80 of 137 people (58%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","58","80","137","8","0"

The foundry (permitting self-written content) is fantastic. The replayability is high and frankly - being able to pop online and fly a ship around the Star Trek universe for a bit provides a nice break from the daily grind. NOT a game for those who want PVP - but since I'm happily well in the PVE preferring body of gamers I've got zero issues with that. There are some variances from Star Trek canon, but the development team at PW seems to have continued to work on keeping to what's reasonable for the universe as Roddenberry framed it. The variety of story lines can sometimes come across as a mash-up that doesn't mesh terribly well, but the quantity and variety vastly outweigh any annoyance at those moments.

No game content is behind paywalls. Only premium equipment requires in-game purchases and even those can be grinded for free given enough time. In-game currency Dilithium can be converted into Zen which is used for purchases. Exchange rate at this time is about 1:200 (zen to dil, most premium ships cost 2500-3000 zen, which is about 20$ real money) and there is a daily refining limit of 8000 dilithium. So it takes a while, but can be done. Gets easier if you have several characters grinding dilithium as Zen pool is account wide. So Pay-to-Bypass-Grind is more accurate for this game.\n\nOnly veteran awards require montly subscription (or Lifetime account) but those are mostly cosmetic upgrades and one endgame level ship. Only truly worthy perk is the 500 Zen montly stipend.\n\nAs far as game mechanics go, this is an MMO like any other. Gather experience, level up, grind for gear, team up, form guilds (Fleets). Both ground and space combat are in the game, though the ground side isn't as interesting. It is the space combat which makes this game a little different from other MMO's. Much like SWToR, the single player missions, or Episodes, are the bread&butter for Star Trek fans. Featuring voice over acting from actual Star Trek actors, like the late Leonard Nimoy, one could not ask for more story wise. Especially the newer content is very well written, and every now and then older content gets revised, the latest 'update' being mid-gameish Romulan story arc, which is now much more story-like as opposed to being just a bunch of missions in sequence. Also features Denise Crosby as Romulan Empress Sela.\n\nMost of the game content is PvE. PvP exist, but hasn't been properly balanced or developed in years so not many people play it seriously.

It's a Star Trek themed resource management game with queue based resource gathering missions in-between filling up a dozen progress bars for things you don't even want or need. Your personalized crew that is so plastered over advertisements are nothing more than bland paper dolls with barely any customization options. They are so hardly ever used in the game they might as well not even exist.\n\nThinking you might at least be able to walk around the inside of your ship? Guess again. Outside of your bridge, ship interiors don't exist. It's not like there's any reason to visit it anyway. Everything is queue based.\n\nTwo years ago there wasn't a single thing about this game that was pay to win. Well it is now. The best ships and gear are locked behind so many resource gates you may as well pay out your nose and skip them or else you'll be grinding for hours.\n\nEvery system in the game, everything from Crafting, to the ships themselves seems specifically designed to bleed as much money out of you as physically possible. I realize that developers have to eat, but not only do you have to buy a ship, you have to essentially buy it twice to make it powerful enough to do anything.\n\nI could give a dozen more reasons why this game isn't worth your time. I will simply say it isn't. Whether you are an old veteran wondering about coming back, or someone who hasn't played at all and is curious, from me, who has spend hundreds of dollars and hours on this game, I am telling you to love yourself.\n\nAnd play something else.","August 27, 2014","false","177.2"," 31 of 49 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","31","49","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/1960s/recommended/9900/","1960s","Sixties Chick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/1960s/","8 products in account","I've been playing this game for several years now and it's definitely a wonderful game for all Star Trek fans old and new. I've always wanted to be the captain of my own ship and Star Trek Online gives you the chance to throw in your own character into the Star Trek universe with ease. The story line never gets old and they have recently added so much to the game to make the story line even longer. Levelling up alone is quite easy, but trust me, it's much better with a friend.\n\nThere are endless possibilities on what you can do in Star Trek Online. You can queue up in special missions to fight lots of dangerous species such as the Borg, Undine and now the Iconians. You can even just explore strange new worlds and beam down to millions of beautiful planets and even throw a beach party on Risa!\n\nTo be honest you don't even really have to be a major Trek fan to enjoy and like this game and you can learn so much about the Star Trek Universe just by playing the game. So if you're thinking of getting into Star Trek in an interactive way instead of watching seasons and seasons of the show this game is a good way to get yourself started.\n\nThe new reputation system is very long and requires a lot of grinding but at least you can do different things to gain marks. My favourite places to gain marks are New Romulus, the Dyson Sphere Ground Battlezone and Kobali Prime as you can really engage yourself in many different things such as missions or just shooting all the enemies you can see. Also the new system is a much better way for every one to be able to get the items as the old system was just pot luck and this caused a lot of "elitists" to appear in game and this made things harder and more challenging for new players. Whereas now almost everyone can get the items easily and work better together as a team.\n\nAnd, yes, sometimes the game is laggy. But trust me I've played games with worser lag than on Star Trek Online. At least in this game it is sorted out by the creators instead of just being left there.\n\nIf you want to explore strange new worlds, seek out new civilizations and boldly go where no man has gone before. Then Star Trek Online is the game for you.","May 3, 2015","true","720.5"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RebelSerah/recommended/9900/","RebelSerah","RebelSerah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RebelSerah/","2 products in account","Short answer: Deffinatly give this a try if you like Star Trek or don't want to pay a lot of money for a good mmo, it wont cost you anything other than some download time!\n\nPros:\n-It's actually free! Some people have called this a "pay to win" game which i find very strange, this is the one of the few games where you can have access to the entire game and become as strong as anybody else without spending any money at all. The way it works is mostly a "pay to skip the grinding" or "grind and sell instead of paying" which I find to be a very nice system. It makes it so you don't feel preasured to pay for anything and even if you don't want to pay nor grind, you wont fall way behind everyone else, in fact you can still go from level 1 to 60 (the max level) and experience the whole storyline including new content without a problem.\n\n-Graphics are not spectacular, but you can play this on an older pc or family laptop, or have something else running the background easy.\n\n-Storyline goes very well with all of the Star Trek series, expect to find some familiar characters with their original voice acting. The story takes place a few years after Star Trek Voyager (there will be lots of Star Trek Voyager characters).\n\n-Despite the fact there is lots of bias as to what is the best way to play, I feel like the gameplay is actually fairly well ballenced. It's not perfect; some may be more difficult to get good at, some may suck early on but even out later on, but I feel like this is better than some other mmo's.\n\n-level syncing option makes playing with friends easier, however someone whos high level still might kill everything in a couple seconds in a low level area.\n\n-I personally found the community a bit nicer than most mmo's when it comes to playing in queues. There is not really any tank-healer-dps roles (there can be but it is not neccessary) so you can't blame people for not doing their role, which makes it overall feel nicer.\n\n-Space and Ground gameplay: 2 different ways you can play, if you prefer one over the other you can choose to do one more than the other (at least for most end-game stuff), however your mostly stuck doing both in the storyline.\n\n\n\nCons:\n-A bit glichy, however they do eventually fix them which is better than some other mmo's.\n\n-Not much end-game content. While there is some things to do such as increasing reputation and upgrading gear, most of the end game content is pretty much just "increase the difficulty to advanced or elite". They are constantly adding new content however.\n\n-PvP is almost non-existant unless you get some friends together for it.\n\n-Some areas of the game can be dramaticly easier or harder on your pc, I might run a very pretty graphic heavy scene in one of the earlier storylines at 60 fps but then run a patrol in the delta quadrent at 8 fps and it's not even that graphicly heavy. Probably not a problem if you have any kind of gaming pc.\n\n-Some of my friends in Germany said they had strange problems with translation.\n\n-The 3 roles can be rather confusing, there is Tactical, Engineering, and Science. You might think that it is "Tactical = Dps, Engineering = Tank, and Science = Healer" but it's not. In fact there really is no clear cut roles in this game. They are also slightly different for ground and space.\n-For Space: Tactical can deal a little more damage, Engineering can take hits better and heal better, Science does exotic things such as crowd control, draining shields, and some exotic damage (they also have strong shields).\n-For Ground: Tactical can deal more damage (also has an aggro catcher which I find strange), Engineering can create turrets, have pets, and regenerate shields. Science can debuff and heal.\n-All these roles can also be mix-matched a bit when combined with a different ship. Example: a tactical officer can fly a cruiser (a type of ship with high engineering) for a mix of offence and defense, or he/she can fly a science ship for some exotic dps. There is no right or wrong way to play, you can focus on 1 thing and play a role, or be more diverse.","December 31, 2015","true","068.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The community is the most generous and helpful I've ever experienced, and more oftne than not when you want to sell or buy, you'll get a fair deal. The gameplay is so grabbing, you'll never notice the grind. I actually hit level 50 with only finishing the first 3 missions, the game is just THAT fun to play. I finally did go back, and I discovered a great story, and some great levelled loot that made me greatful I waited until level 50 to pick up. I can't recommend this game more, so in appreciation of how much gameplay I got out of  this title I spent $30 and grabbed a nice Tier 5 ship, upgraded it to T5U, picked up a few Duty Officers, bought some custom skins, eventually ended up spending about $60 total, becasue I felt that this game was worth a full release title's price.

I can say this game no matter what they do to the interface and skill trees, is packed FULL of content. The dev team are very good with new content coming out all the time. For anyone who is a Star Trek Fan You cant go wrong with this. Its a Fantastic game for the price of £0 you dont need to pay to win. It Helps sure but you have a huge variety of ships and their classes.\n\nThere is one massive oversight. For me this is an immersion breaker. Its your bridge. The Bridge is instanced and is not relative to what you are doing in space at the time. Some functionality makes it useful but it absolutely sucks that you cant manage battles from your captains chair and no "on screen" functionality.\n\nDont let this put you off. There is so much content youll be playing non stop for a year before you run out of interesting things to do. Many wierd and wonderful locations to explore both planet side and in space.\n\nThe Game itself is VISUALLY STUNNING and character creation is a great feature. Personally i think Escort Ships are the best way to have fun in battle as you can get more manouverability, that way it doesnt matter that they have less console slots as you go in guns forward and manage your shield one way until you absolutely need to manage left right and rear.\n\nMost gaming rigs with 2gb of video memory can run this at Max settings.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/starfetcher/recommended/9900/","starfetcher","starfetcher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/starfetcher/","53 products in account","First of all: I love this game.\n\nThe story is superb and as a die-hard Trekkie, I can vouch that the developers' attention to detail when it comes to the Star Trek Universe is marvellous. It is the continuation of the Star Trek series and films that never was, filling up holes in the story, piecing at first glance totally unrelated episodes together and creating a story as original and Star Trek to the core as you can get. Even the "title theme" is instantly recognisable as Star Trek, while being something completely new at the same time.\n\nThe fact that a lot of known Star Trek actors (Leonard Nimoy - Spock, Tim Russ - Tuvok, Michael Dorn - Worf, etc.) lend their voices to their characters and you get to talk to them and fight alongside them makes my Trekkie heart beat a lot faster (one of the highlights for me was fighting alongside Voyager and traveling to the Mirror Universe).\n\n\nI have concentrated on the story so far as that is the most important aspect of a game to me. I am no expert in different aspects of gameplay and controls and the like, so I leave that to others. But I do enjoy that you have both ground and space fights. not to mention the diplomacy missions, allowing me to engulf myself in RPGing in my favourite fictional universe.\n\nSo, if you are a Trekkie such as myself, this game is definitely for you. For everyone else, this is still a superb online game (stunning graphics for FTP) with an intriguing story (although you won't get all the in-jokes and references, don't worry, it's definitely not a game you can only understand after memorising each and every dialogue from all five shows and ten films - but maybe it will pieque your interest in Star Trek). I can definitely recommend it.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Oh, if you're wondering why I have spend so little time on this game if I love it so much: I don't always play it through Steam (gaming on Linux can be a tricky thing sometimes). But believe me, I have clocked A LOT of hours on STO.","October 8, 2014","true","143.2"," 32 of 54 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","32","54","0","0"

Overall i've been impressed by the game especially since reading some of the bad reviews.  If you've been watching Star trek lately and are in the mood for some deep space exploration yourself. Give it a shot. I'll summersize the game's good and bad points, baring in mind i have only 17.7 Hrs logged into it so far.\n\nGOOD POINTS:\n. Space combat:\ncustomising and naming one of many diff ship types (that youll gain access to later on), and sending them into space to blow ♥♥♥♥ up is REALLY fun!\n\n. Instanced missions:\neverything in the story is instanced, you feel like its YOUR story, there are no pugs hanging out in the BG messing with your immersion.\n\n. Awesome story:\nThe games focus and rightly so! I've started as a romulan, and have been (so far) mainly doing story missions they have been well scripted, the parts that were voiced were ok/good. The content of the missions has been interesting (mainly becasue i get to blow a lot of things up in my ship) but also becasue the missions have weight and consequence. I was establishing homeworlds, negoticiating peace talks. The missions that did involve combat (most/all) elements all had meaning behind them. It definately wasnt a trashy roller coaster kill 100 sheep and report back system >=( so it has that going for it too!\n\n. In-depth Character customisation:\nWont find many if any games that offer a better level of character customisation. you can literally create a new alien race that is playable on all three factions if you want to.\n\nBAD POINTS:\n. Takes a while to get the bigger and better ships.\n. When aquring/buying new ships, a lot of them have cash shop upgraded versions with extra station slots and in some cases exrtra weapon slots. (wont matter in cluster ♥♥♥♥ PVP much) but is still kinda pay-to-win-BS. As i wont be doing much PVP myself im not too bothered.\n.Graphics are kinda poor, On Max it delivers all it needs to, the explosions look really nice and the ship weapons are pew-pewey enough, they pass but it would be nice if they were closer to E.V.E's standards.\n. U.I is kinda ugly, and sometimes confsuing (action bars'n'stuff)\n. Warping. Costs a lot for new players to warp, so dont bother. (thankfully missions so far have been close enough) dont have to wait as long as E.V.E typically to arrive at new sectors.\n\nI'm having a lot of fun, i was expecting a terrible game and what i found was actually something very promosing. it wont blow you away, but you should have a nice experience early on anyway.","October 14, 2015","true","19.5"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","19","30","0","2"

Despite seeing players and their ships, most are ultra-casuals that play solo.  Queues are always dead.  No real advancement as you will be doing the same things after max lvl cap that you did to get there.  6 years of the same bugs, unreliable server setup and the mot god-awful, no respect for the playerbase support I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with.  Most support tickets are deleted without player contact unless one is verbally supportive of the company on twitter.\n\nPlayed for almost 3 years after it launched, left for 2 years, came back a few months ago...same game despite "expansions" that are no more than a new faceplate for the same tired grind.  The entire game is a grind and it never ends.  There is no endgame, only the same game.  Whatever new skills you learn or ships you fly, you will be using them on the same missions at lvl 60 that you ran at lvl 20.  You'll even need to run the same mission 2-5 times each (or more) to acquire all the items that can be rewarded...not diffferent missons for diffferent gear, the same missions, over and over and over again...then onto the next mission for multi-repeat runs.\n\nVery limited inventory space with hundreds upon hundreds of wholly useless items that will keep your inv full non stop without buying more space or living in front of a vendor.  Player premium currency exchange market is so horridly out of control in price only long established players will really benefit from it before the servers are unplugged (the f2p is there but its a miserable experience now - in the first couple years it was quite good and the "devs" kept the market exchange balanced...they no longer do that.)\n\nPoor and dated graphics from a decade past that don't even begin to stress an old card like an HD6870 let alone ever even get a gtx 790 out of 1st gear.  Unavoidable cutscenes that make the replaying of missions miserable as you'll spend more time in cutscenes than in the gameplay of most. Sound effects that have  caps...the system can only process X# of sounds but in cases where there are more than it can provide to you it will skip, cut out and stutter while it decides which to make audible and which to mute.  The best sound cards on the market cant force the sounds the client cant process.\n\nIt is a click to win game with no skill of any kind required or even rewarded.  Mash the buttons and you cannot lose.   *case in point...I set a mission to advanced level and let my cat walk on the keyboard as I pet her...mission accomplished with no deaths :(  Elite is only more time consuming due to the sheer scaling of HP and resists for NPC's...they get entirely ridiculous...no challenge, just time.\n\nThere is no more Trek here than in a star wars game, aside NPC names and ship models.  If you can get lost in a grind, this might be the game for you.  If you enjoy watching the same episode of a show 5 times before moving on to the next, it might be a game for you.  If you like to think about your gameplay, enjoy tactics, teamwork, or even communicating with people in an MMO during the few queued events you'll be able to partake in, this is probably not a game you'll enjoy.","March 9","false","802.1"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","13","19","5","0"

I have about 450 hours logged through Arc and still enjoy playing this game. It does have its flaws though. PVP is dead. The balancing for it was so bad that even the Devs admitted that it isn't what they wanted for it, but only have vague ideas on how to fix it with no immediate plans to make changes. Also the cost of the fancy ships are a bit ridiculous. You could pay the price of an entire game for how much you can spend on one measly ship.\n\nThat being said, you absolutely don't need to drop a single red cent to play this game all the way to the end without trouble. I never have and enjoy all the end-game PvE queues and battlezones. Seasonal events give free players the opportunity to have end-game ships with a bit of grinding.\n\nHonestly, I feel like many Star Trek fans are just some of the hardest to please people on the planet.

But not this.\n\nCryptic has done a great job in developing this game. There are a few bugs here and there, but nothing too game-breaking. The story is very well done and is the part that keeps my attention. The leveling is also stellar, in most MMOs you'll sit there for hours and hours grinding to get to the next level. Or it sets you on a quest and the area is for level 20+ and you're level 10, you'll have to grind for days just to get to progress the story. Not with STO.\n\nEach mission in STO does require you to be a certain level, BUT each mission also levels you up just enough to get to the next. And with the DOFF system (which is very easy to get the hang of) is an easy way of getting XP. I've known a few players who have gotten some of their characters to max level and not even leaving their faction's homeworld by using the DOFFs. The story is also interesting to say the least, it wasn't so good that I couldn't keep it off my mind, but it was good enough to keep coming back.\n\nTL:DR The story is great, the developers are cool, and the leveling is stellar.\n9/10","October 2, 2014","true","220.5"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","21","35","0","1"

I never found myself having to grind because of being underleveled and whatnot. By playing the episodes and playing on the event weekends (2x weekends, etc), I easily made it to Lv 55 in about 100 hours.

I was Lv 50 when I bought it. I could have gone with a T6 ship, but I already had the free Kobali Cruiser and I prefer the Excelsior Refit due to it's dashing good looks.\n\nIf there is one big problem with the game, it would be the ground missions.

They really should focus on just scrapping the current ground system and re-building it with a more dynamic/controllable.","March 1, 2015","true","894.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

I played this game almost from release and only a week before I finally quit it (Dec 2014) for good I added it to steam so I don't have to Alt-Tab every time someone texts me.\n\nIt used to be the best game ever in the entire universe. Everybody who played during the first couple seasons will agree with that.\n\nThen PWE took over and thrashed it.\n\nFrom what I hear there is no end to this agony, so I decided to stick the boot right in and write a review myself. Not being a man of many words, there is not much else to add. People who played and especially PVPed in this game exactly know why I and many many other started quitting the game after PWE took over.\n\nIf you never played STO before, then there is only one advice I can give you: run, run as fast and as far as you possibly can away from this game.\n\nIts business model is following: everything is for free and you can obtain literally every single item in this game without spending a single Dollar, Euro, Pound, Banana or whichever is your country's currency. Sounds great, right? It is in fact great if you have a lifetime to wait for crafting and reputation missoins while you endlessly grind for dilithium. Of course you can accelerate this process by shoving your real world money up PWE's rear exit. We are not talking 2 Dollar microtransactions, no my friends, we are talking big money here.\n\nIf you even dream of being something remotely close to competitive in this game then you already play it for at least 2 years and know exactly what you're doing, or you have thousands of Dollars, Euros etc ready to be thrown at PWE.\n\nTo people who love and enjoy at least decent PVP matches: According to PWE's PR person "The PVP community consists of 14 year olds living in their mum's basement". And that's also pretty much how PWE treats PVP in this game. The Queues may pop but what you find there is P2W spam deluxe.\n\n\nFinal verdict: Would not even force my special friend Geko to play it, that's how bad it is now.","January 27","false","153.9"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","14","22","3","6"

I have yet to find an MMO with the atmosphere of satisfaction and wonder this one does. It is a true follow on to the overall Star Trek franchise and can be said as one of the most cannon Star Trek workings to keep ticking on with the true feeling and fantasy sci-fi kept within.\nAt a performance standar the game is prety easy and fun to control leaving the payer with the option tho change his/her controls if the have an significant problrms with it.The gameplay is pretty fun too. It is always improving with the game itself allowing the constant expansion of the franchise's own universe involving the timeline (25th Century) so that you can't simply say that youve already seen it or that its all been done before. Another thing i like is that the nature of the game features seasonal events than will constantly bring in new gameplay and all new missions and storyline to enjoy.\nHowever, there are some issues i have with it. Mainly being that in order to advance thouroughly through the ranks and continue with certain missions and aspects, you are almost required to have 4 other consecuative friends to join you just so that you can make a fleet. Now i know thats just what MMORPG's tend to do but this slight detail means that I have to a)Continue the game with that ship I have owned for around 2 months or b)I simply join some other random clan in which would require me to talk to other people. I know shocking but considering that i dont have enough time to participate in the constant flow of events they would be asking me to join i would rather not.\nRegardless, over all an enjoyable fun game that i can always rely upon for some relaxation and enjoyment if required\n\nPersonal Rating: 9/10","March 17, 2015","true","715.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

In a lot of ways, it's a very conventional RPG; a levelling system, more grind than a flour mill, regular bug-filled updates (which, to be fair, get fixed pretty quickly - the big, noticeable ones, at least).  It's also got two and a half factions which don't like each other, and since it's F2P, it's loaded with microtransactions.\n\nIt marks itself out with having both space and ground mechanics, being almost entirely instanced, and through being Star Trek.  Let's face it, if you're here, you're almost certainly a Trekkie to begin with.\n\nThe cons:\n1. 'Micro'transactions.  This game is not cheap.  I've played over 400 hours and not bought anything from the C-store, and I don't feel particularly helpless, but endgame ships will set you back around $40.  Admittedly that's a one-off payment, and any future characters can use that ship without restriction, but it's still a fairly large investment.\n2. Endgame balance is horrible.  The Special Task Force missions (read: raids) have almost dead public queues due to horrific imbalance in capability between a newly minted Lvl 60 player and an experienced and well-equipped endgame player; we're talking not a difference of 25% or so, but in the order of 1000% or more.  This has a few nasty side-effects for obtaining important gear; not insurmountable, but certainly frustrating.\n3. Complexity curve.  The game itself is relatively simple, but there are a lot of behind-the-scenes mechanics that are not even slightly self-evident.  These aren't a big obstacle to gameplay until lvl 50 or so, but it can make the experience feel sluggish and frustrating.  Browsing of the STO reddit is highly recommended if you want to stick with the game.\n4. Ground combat is subpar.  I personally don't think it's as bad as some people make out, but it's not nearly as fun as space stuff.  There are a few exceptions (personal cloaking devices combined with plasma flamethrowers are immensely entertaining) but it just doesn't feel as polished and developed.  Fortunately it's also a lot more forgiving in general.\n\nWith that in mind, let's get to the reason why I keep coming back to this thing.\n\n1. Space combat is excellent.  Once you get used to the interface (I know some people find it awkward) it's very fluid.  As a long-time Eve Online player, I can honestly say that I prefer the STO mechanics; managing flight controls, a wide variety of offensive and defensive powers, and wrestling with keeping the enemy lined up with your weapons while keeping your shields boosted is a wonderful challenge.  It's also pretty as sin and really feels like Star Trek.  Diving at a Borg cube as the Defiant with all cannons blazing or seeing phaser fire bloom off your Galaxy as you maneuver at a stately pace around a hostile D'deridex is a great feeling.  Some of the powers also really give a suitably epic feel.  Using Torpedo Spread engulfs entire enemy squadrons in fields of photon torpedoes, while Fire At Will will make every beam you have fire at every enemy in range.\n2. Flexibility.  When making a character, you pick faction (Federation, Klingon or Romulan) and a 'class'; Tactical, Science or Engineering.  In World of Warcraft, that would be it: you'd have just picked your playstyle for the rest of the game.  Not so here; your class only governs a set of basic powers you have, and what powers you can use in ground combat.  You still have the full range of ships, weapons, secondary powers and equipment available.  Just because you picked an Engineering 'tanky' character doesn't stop you from flying glass cannon Defiants, and a high-damage Tactical can use the resilient, sluggish Galaxy.\n3. Events.  This is the one saving grace for all the high-cost real-money ships; on a regular basis, you'll be able to grind for special limited event ships.  These are high-end and very effective; one of the recent ships is considered by some to be one of the tankiest ships in the game.\n4. The story is actually pretty good.  MMO storylines tend to turn me off; they're clunky and ignorable.  While that certainly applies to a fair amount of STO, there are some excellently crafted set-pieces and missions.  Being kidnapped and brainwashed, seeing friends massacred after a peace conference goes wrong - and let's not forget the Romulan tutorial, where everyone you know is killed or kidnapped as you barely escape in a rusting hulk of a warbird.  Mass Effect it ain't, but I've been pleasantly surprised.\n5. Speaking of which, you can tell that it's written by real Star Trek nerds.  Despite an incredible range of enemies, locations and concepts, just about everything can be tied into one of the episodes or movies.  Two of the endgame enemies are spun off from a couple of stand-alone episodes of Voyager, but they feel in-character and match up with what we saw of them in the series.  The Elachi, a recurring enemy for Romulan players, were designed from a single episode of Enterprise where we barely saw them, but the elaboration works perfectly.  Creepy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  You'll also hear some very familiar voices - Worf, Sela, Harry Kim, Tuvok, Spock (RIP) and a fair number of minor characters from the series have lent their voice talents.\n6. Levelling is fairly painless.  I remember attempting to get through WoW and giving up around Lvl 40 (Lich King era).  By comparison, STO has far fewer missions, and you can get a character to Lvl 50 in a week's casual play.  50-60 is a lot more tedious, but it's a lot less noticeable; you've unlocked all the important things, and it would be fair to say that the game really starts at 50.  Everything prior has been a warm-up tutorial.\n7.  Endgame gear.  Many games require endless farming of a given boss in the hopes of a drop.  STO completely drops this idea; endgame gear is all obtained from Fleet (guild) equipment or the Reputation system.  Endgame content merely provides the means to afford this equipment.  It's entirely predictable, and I personally would prefer to know that I need ten runs to get what I want, rather than roll the dice of potentially getting it first time, but likely needing to run fifty times.  I get enough RNG nonsense from Warframe.\n\nIn conclusion... STO is by no means a perfect game.  That said, I would be comfortable in saying that it's one of the better offerings on the market.  Give it a week, and you'll be pleasantly surprised - or at least, you won't be bemoaning your lost time.","April 8, 2015","true","168.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

While undoubtedly more loyal to its source material than any other star trek game I've ever played, this game really does count on its franchise name, rather than the actual merits of the game, to draw players in and create the experience. One of the very first enemies the starting missions will have you fight are the borg, which I and the NPC ship that was joining me for the quest defeated easily. The game constant throughs the most terrifying and iconic aliens of the Star Trek franchise at you (such as the borg, species 8472, the klingons, ect.), as if to remind you that this is in fact a star trek game, and you merciliously gun them all down. Part of what made those enemies so terrifying on the show was just how out-matched the federation ships were against them. When you see a borg cube one your screen, you should be weeping and just as scared as Picard was when he faced off against them, not happily blow one up after another with two other ships. The appearance of these enemies strikes me as fanservice--and bad fanservice at that, which there is plenty of throughout the game (did I mention that the captain you work under in the starting zone constaly refers to you as his Number 1?) If they had spent even half the time they spent thinking up stupid references trying to balance the combat and making the multiplayer exciting (which, by the way, you'll either be curb-stomping your way through or getting curb-stombed, there is no in between or concept of "fair fights" or "evenly matched" opponents, but no one really does PvP anyway) they'd have a great game one their hands. In trying to make the game as "iconic" as possible, and not spending more time working on how to make the game as diverse, challenging, and as balanced as possible, the devs really delivered a watered-down Star Trek experience here.\n\nTL;DR?\n\nBeam me up, Scotty! There's no Star Trek game down here worth playing!","December 2, 2014","false","16.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

I have WAY more hours logged on this game it's just that I had been using the non-steam game and launcher for a LONG time until I finally figured out it was also on steam. meh.\n\nOkay ladies and gentlemen, I've gotta put first things first. This game is NOT, I repeat, NOT, pay to win. Now keep reading.\n\nAnyway, let me get straight to the point. If you've never seen Start Trek before you'll be confused at first, because of the fact that you don't know $#!T about anything going on, and you won't understand almost anything in the game. However, the game does an excellent job of introducing all of the storylines and basically everything in the Star Trek universive to you, so basically, if you play this game long enough, you'll become a Trekkie, without even having watched any of the shows.\n\nSTO also has great missions, which are very immersive and interactive. Once you're done with one storyline, there'll always be many more to complete, as the STO team uploads new ones almost every 2-3 months. (Don't quote me.)\n\nThis game is absolutely free to play, which is of course, awesome. Every single weapon and ship can be aquired through a great system. Time and effort. Of course, it'll take much less time to aquire certain ships by purchasing them with Zen Points (Currency that is bought with real money), but it all depends on how you'd like to approach the game. I personally have not made a single ship purchase with Zen Points, and I still have a very strong ship that is capable of taking on any foe.\n\nThe game also has two im-game currency systems, Energy Credits and Dilithium. You'll be using these two currencies to buy most of your ships and equipment. Both of these currencies are easy to earn and the prices for items are never too high.\n\nIt has a great ranking-up and skill-tree system, and also has great PvP missions and PvE missions as well. And in PvP, your'e paired up with people of the same level, so you won't get obliterated by people who are much higher ranked than you.\n\nThere are many many things that I haven't mentioned in this review. The devs have put a great amount of time and effort into this amazing game and I think that they deserve praise for it.       But to sum it all up, you get to run around, shoot lasers at people, shoot bigger lasers at ships, get in game credits, buy really cool things, shoot at people more, and play Dabo. Yes, dabo. This game has gambling. What more do you want? Now download the dang game.","August 7, 2015","true","273.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I am a huge fan of anything science fiction. When i discovered this game and found out that you can captain your own ship, I nearly exploded from excitment. The game did not disapoint. In the following paragraphs I will state things I enjoy about this game, and the very few cons that I have.\nPros- This game lets you captain a starship and fight any enemy the federation has ever faced. You fight Klingons, Romulans, Borg, Gorn, Cardassians, and even more! The stories do an extremely good job of putting you in the shoes of a captain and the space combat is fantastic. This game is extremely customizable and hundreds of different abilities for space comabt, and ground combat are available making each players build unique! Some people complain that once you reach level 60, the game is a cash grab. For people that aren't patient, yes it is. They complain that in order to receive tier 6 ships, you need to spend money. This is not entirely true becasue every year there are two or three events that give you the opportunity to win t6 starships. Sure, its a long process to win them but in the long run it's worth it! Or, if you've been a veteran for a decent amount of time, you may receive a free t6 ship from arc games thanking you for playing their game. Thats how I got mine! Also, going back to the campaign, the Iconian War story is fanominal! Also you can captain Klingon and Romulan ships. Nuff said.\nCons- I don't have many issues with this game except for a couple small issues. I think the ground combat could be a little better improved. Unless you're extremely duked out in shields and weapons at level 60, you will die alot. That being said, I do agree with some of the issues that many people have about the game being a cash grab. Yes, you can get free t6 ships, but if you want a t6 ship without waiting, it will cost 30$ of real money. Thats way too much to spend for just a decent ship in an MMO. For people that may not be as patient, this game is such a cash grab.\nOverall, I have enjoyed this game alot. There is so much to do in it and its space combat is extremely engaging and addictive. If you aren't the most patient person out there, this game could potentially become a cash grab but if you have the patience at level 60, you will receive a t6 ship in time. All in all, get this game. Its so much fun!","January 15","true","228.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bjb101/recommended/9900/","bjb101","benny-boybrown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bjb101/","134 products in account","So, I decided to finally write up a review for this game. I figure that around 370 hours of play is enough to be able to know what I'm writing about.\n\nSo, the first question you have to ask of Star Trek Online: Does it feel like Star Trek? The short answer is kind of. The long answer is yes and no. Whilst it has familiar staples of the franchise, it is also lacking in some elements. For example, more exploration that DIDN'T invariably lead into combat encounters wouldn't go amiss. I won't say it doesn't feel like Star Trek, but it feels almost exclusively like seasons six and seven of DS9 and season three of Enterprise. It has some Trek aspects, but it feels more like a Trek skin for a generic Space MMO and action based MMO. It does, however, have some nice fan service in appearances by existing characters, with several, including Spock, Worf, Sela, Tom Paris, Harry Kim, Seven of Nine, Neelix, the Doctor and Miral Paris, being voiced by their actors from the shows. An opening narration by Leonard Nimoy and an EMH voiced by Zachary Quinto are also both nice touches.\n\nWhat's worth considering on the lack of Trek feel to this game, is that it is somewhat remedied by the foundry; the user generated content is, in my experience, of great quality more often than not. In fact, there have been occassions where I've felt the foundry content had come out better than the content released by Cryptic / Perfect World / Whatever they want to call themselves now. A prime example is the Breen missions; whilst a fun little arc, some of the missions involved in it can be awkward to play. That's not to say all user created content is amazing and infinitely better than the stuff the studio puts out, just that it often has a more Star Trek feel to it.\n\nMy next point is in regards to the playable classes. At the start of the game, you pick one of three factions, between Federation, Klingons and Romulans. It's worth noting that, while playing as a Romulan, you play as a member of the new Romulan Republic faction, NOT a member of the Romulan Star Empire, so if you're hoping to be the bad guy, your bubble's burst, I'm sorry. Each of these factions have their own stories, with the Federation being my favourite, the Romulans proving suitably intriguing but the Klingon story feels somewhat closer to how they have been portrayed in Trek before, so I find myself with a bias towards them over the Romulans.\n\nOnce you've chosen your faction, we then get into the actual classes, broken up into the three basic areas of Starfleet; Tactical (i.e. Worf, Tuvok, Reed), Operations (i.e. Scotty, Data, O'Brien) or Science (i.e. Spock, Jadzia Dax, T'pol), with each filling their own role not quite typical of MMO's; Tactical tends to work best with the smaller, faster ships with run and gun tactics, Operations works with the big cruisers and dreadnoughts, and Science works with a sort of intermediary with more buffs. That's not to say you can't play a Tactical character in a Dreadnought (I do!) or a Science character in a light escort, it's just their abilities are more geared towards the ship types mentioned before.\n\nMy one gripe with this game is the micro transactions; they aren't micro at all! Zen works out as almost 1p per 1 Zen, so when you see a ship for 3000 Zen, you're looking at about £30.00! Of course, Zen can be farmed via Dilithium mining. However, at the moment, it is 260 odd Dilithium per Zen, with an 8000 per character per day cap on amount you can refine; that translates to a lot of grinding for Dilithium. It doesn't help that the Z-store ships are noticably better than those found in the ship store that you get a free ship from as you go through. Wit hthe introduction of the new T6 ships, this is more noticable than ever, and I hope to see some real F2P T6 ships implemented soon!\n\nOverall, it's a good enough game. It's not a great Star Trek game, but it does pay fan service in the right places at least. My final opinion is; I'd reccomend this, but Trekkies, be patient with it, it'll take roughly as much patience as the Trek reboots do, so if you enjoy them, you'll enjoy this, if you don't, maybe give this one a miss.","January 10","true","414.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

It feels like I am playing in the Star Trek universe. I LOVE playing with the starships.\n\nIt feels like a mess of systems with a weak focus, but that may be because I like single player games as opposed to MMOs. (I feel similar about The Old Republic) Although this one is less focused due to the dual systems of space and ground combat. Which means that both are less developed that might be expected if the game only used one of those.\n\nThat said, both space and ground are not bad, but really don't feel like a part of a triple A title.\n\nIt's free! so give it a shot.\n\nIf you love star trek, you will probably enjoy it. Otherwise it may be best to give it a pass.","November 18, 2014","true","44.6"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","22","39","0","0"

It's a fairly mediocre game as of late.\n\nMany bad/questionable choices have caused major imbalances in the game, frustrated long time players, and shown that PWE/Cryptic is trying to heavily monitize the game at the expense of the players.\n\nHowever, that being said, there is much good to be said about STO as well.\n\n1) Decent storylines that pick up where the TV episodes and movies left off.  Cryptic has done a great job of revisiting many of the lesser known races in the STO universe, and bringing many unfinished story lines to a close.\n\n2) Ships, ships, and more ships.  All the amazing ships we know and love as well as quite a few retrofits/refits that bring our favoties up to par with the 25th century.  I love taking out my 23rd century Excelcisior class cruiser and wiping the floor with the Borg or even other players.  Nothing is more embarassing then a 200 year old ship tearing your brand new top of the line cruiser to shreds.\n\n3) Decent player base.  Social interaction is recommended, but not required.  You can go a long ways without ever having to say hello to another player.  However, joining a fleet should be one of the first things that you do, so that you can get further, get better gear, etc.\n\n4) Decent selection of real world money ships, costumes, etc.  Some of them are obvious money grabs, but some of them are just plain awesome too.\n\n5) Seasonal events like the Summer event at Risa and Q's Winter Wonderland help break the slowness in 'seasons' (aka expansions).\n\n6) Ground combat is 'okay'.  Its not up to par with the space combat, but it is certainly playable and how you best explore the main story lines.\n\nAll in all, if you like Star Trek, then you'd probably like STO.  If you've never played an MMO before, or don't have much experience in the Star Trek universe, you can try this game, but be prepared for a learning curve.","December 13, 2015","true","200.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

I decided to come back to see if things had gotten more interesting.  What I found is, if you're a new player, it is nearly impossible to do much of anything in this game anymore.\n\nYou will spend hours waiting for a pve que to fill up to get currency for a grindy reputation system that everyone who plays already has finished.  The EC exchange currency has been devalued to a point where anything useful is unobtainable without saving for months, or possibly years, due to the lack of ability to collect valuable loot because no one does pve ques.  The crafting system will take years to complete without any money invested, or you could throw money at the game and it will still take a year and a couple thousand dollars, just to allowed to have the random chance at something that may or may not be useful.\n\nMany more examples exist, but to sum up the problems:  Lack of players makes a grindy game an impossible grind.  If you've never played before, don't waste your time.  If you haven't played in a while, it's more waiting for the same thing you've done already.","March 8","false","31.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

Even bought a lifetime supscription for the hell of it. It was on and off. It reintroduced me to Star Trek, and it can be fun to play even with some of the big problems it has\n\nI'm going to revise this review and make it shorter and less bias. It does have some of the original cast members from the shows providing their voices of the original characters like Worf, Nog, Tuvok, etc. And Morn is played by well...Morn. It has an active but small role playing community where one could feel like a real character in the Trek universe. The guild or fleet system is pretty robust with many benefits to fleet members like access to ships and gear that only fleet members can get. The game's crew does regularly add new content almost monthly. And there is plenty to do here like random events, play adventure zones, fight in battlezones(yet few of these are pvp zones), practice your character's crafting or R&D, and play STFs and other more team-based instances with firends or complete strangers.\n\nTo top it all off, it is ALL FREE! Almost anything can be bought without using any real money whatsoever. You will have to prioritize what you want if you want to play to earn, but one can just get whatever they want in the game just by grinding it. I wish I discovered this before I bought the lifetime supscription. Biggest DOH moment in my life. LOL!XD. But I still payed some money here and there to support it anyway.\n\nNow for the negatives. This game does get vary buggy. So buggy even old bugs will come back from time to time. Many of these bugs are funny, but some are game breaking like a broken mail system. And there are bugs and borderline exploiting bugs that have never been fixed for years. The community can get a bit too negative or toxic in places. And the gameplay can get unbalanced as its  seems to be about damage and not much else.\n\nEven though I give this game a thumbs down for all those cons, this game can still be vary fun. And this game is vary generous for an MMO as its vary possible to get whatever one wants without paying for it at all if one knows how to budget and set in-game financial priorities. For that sense, I recommend this game 100%. But a fair warning, it will have some serious rough edges that can hurt your experience.","October 9, 2015","false","84.0"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

This is actually a nice singleplayer game, in a way. The missions are nice, its the Star Trek Singleplayer that could have been, really.\n\nBut everything else is suffering on the multiplayer department. Tier 6 ships are the way to go-- and you have to grind to hell and back to get these, not to mention the T5-X trap that they laid down as a moneygrab. PvP has been junked by both the playerbase and the devs(Its all about one "best" playstyle, everything else has been junked and the playerbase that usually does PvP is elitist as hell, to the point of threatening the devs and the devs generally acting like amateurs when talking back to them).\nIt also has a huge amount of time locked events. If you weren't there to get the items, your character is locked out, and that's what. Hope you're here for the next event because you're gonna regret it if you aren't.\n\nOverall, this game gets 5 out of 5 meme points.

Did you think I wanted to turn this game into a grind, spend hundreds of dollars a year for lockboxes and DLCs I don't need? Of course not! But when you have an evil corporation like Cryptic/Arc putting psychotropic drugs into your food administered by former SS officers who worked for Dr. Mengele, what else can you do? I have no choice but to keep pouring tons of money into a FREE MMO.\n\nThis game has scammed so much money out of me that as of today, I am selling my daughters into white slavery to pay for my gameplaying.

I know that technically, the DLCs are all cosmetic and don't add in the way of gameplay, that players can level up all the way from 0-60 without any paywalls, that players don't have to spend a dime on lockboxes or fancy ships that go pewpewpew.

I have 1 account that i paid money on and 3 accounts that are Free to Play.  I use the STO ARC game client only.\n\nPositves:\n\nSTO is great if you want to play for FREE as a simple starship captain in the Star Trek MMO universe.  You don't have to pay any real money to experience the complete Star Trek universe.\n\nYou can make 3 different faction captains ( Federation, Romulan, Klingon ) on 1 account.\n\nThe level cap is now level 60.  Plenty of extra specializations and traits you can add to your captain to improve ground and space combat.\n\nIt is easy to get to level 50 in a short amount of time, but going to level 60 will take much grinding and time.\n\nBasic gear is plentyfull in loot drops and mission rewards.\n\nPlenty of free cosmetic customization is available for your captains, bridge crew and ships.\n\nYou can play minigames to earn dilithium ore that can be sold for a little store currency or buy a ship.\n\nPlenty of PVE missions that are soloable and a few Co-Op battle areas.  Plenty of missions and areas for you to explore with you and your 4 bridge crew. There is player created missions in the Foundry to try out.  Plenty of Events to play through out the year.  STO has Crafting.\n\nFree players get a ship each rank up to tier 4. You can buy some extra ships from the exchange, if you can earn enough energy credits or if you find free giveaway codes or earn enough dilithium.  3 types of ships: Escort = DPS, Science = Support, Cruiser = Tank.\n\nHas a mini-game that you can send your duty officers and your fleet of ships on their own missions and you reap the rewards of their success.\n\nSTO is also Free to Play friendly, not as bad with limitations added to free accounts as other games. Usually e-mail / chat unlocks with 20 plus hours in-game.  Inventory and bank is big enough, has in-space access to bank and email.  Free players have enough slots in exchange to sell items. But Free to play account are limited in number of bridge officer slots.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nNegatives:\n\nThe game is still very buggy, but it has been Expanded, nerfed, simplified, reworked and changed over the years.  The game is pretty laggy at times, it has not always been.  Lately, The devs keep breaking old things and not fixing anything.  Game client crashes happen often now.  When the game works for you, it is great.\n\nSeems like the Steam game client is buggier than the STO website game client.  If you have Mac, learn to use a Virtual Machine player or dual booting with Windows 7 loaded and use the Windows Arc game client.\n\nIf you are into playing PVP, forget about PVP, it is dead because of power creep.\n\nVery few reasons for players to team up in STO, except for the Co-Op instances..\n\nVery Pay to Win and very Grindy game close to end level.  PWI is milking this game for money, but if you can buy PWI money cards they can be used to buy STO stuff.  You have to spend real money to play in style or be competative at elite end level content.\n\nGive it a try. Play it for FREE only.\n\n\nfor more info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIAxgO_hqsU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-ndfgqSneY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjiBig9TArA\n\nhttp://www.reaxxion.com/6900/how-star-trek-online-is-boldly-ripping-off-its-players\n\nhttp://www.usgamer.net/articles/cryptics-long-trek-star-trek-online-five-years-later\n\nhttp://www.mmorpg.com/?val=1&uh=9FD03C6C14E09D11628DB4DF36C744F1\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Online\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGdrMcqP_oU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCU4ms8l8GY\n\nhttp://sto.gamepedia.com/Main_Page","November 10, 2015","true","0.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

Certainly flying in circles during drawn out battles can be boring, but there is enough going on, with the strategic choices, the balancing of shields, positioning in 3 dimensional space to best use your speed, or lack there of, weapons and special tactics can make even the more tedious battles at least moderately interesting.\n\nThe space map is less pretty than it should be, but it's certainly not terrible and transwarp travel can get you around quickly at least in one direction.\n\nthere is some charm to having access to some of the known "landmarks" such as DS9 as well.\n\nOther aspects of the game are generally typical affair - items are colour coded, a la everquest and world of warcraft, and as a free-to-play, most the desirables are available, for a price.\n\nFor free, the game is worth it for the space alone.

The ship combat is very solid, but the ground combat is very basic and not very engaging. Some of the missions are better designed than others - I hope you get through the Cardassian storyline, but you will have to endure the chore that is the Romulan storyline to get there. There are a huge amount of customizations for you to choose from for your ships and characters, however most options are locked behind the paywall. Once you've reached the end of the storylines, there isn't much to do other than reputation grind and PVP, but the game permits player-created content, which definitely extends the life of this game.","November 28, 2013","true","776.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They also added ability that stuns all enemies for 30 seconds, inside AoE. who uses stuns or disables in PvE in this game? NOBODY! more stuff that makes the game harder for everyone else has been added, that is just 2 examples.\nWith addition to the endless grinding, they released update with new level increase, from level 50 to 60. as result, all your items are outdated, last 3 years of gridning and upgrading to your best gear was turned into waste, have fun, spend 300 euros to game to upgrade your items with the new crafting system or alternatively spending another full year into getting more dilithium so you could possiply upgrade your items to highest mark.\nIn addition to all the bad releases to PvE, and PvP content, speaking of PvE content, instead of releasing something new to PvE, they made PvE content harder by increasing the amount of damage and health the enemies have, what changed? NOTHING! 5 man Glass cannon teams are still rolling in PvE, you still don't need ANY crowd control in PvE!\nMany of my veteran friends that have played multiple years, have had ton of dedication for the game, but have stopped playing...

I mean, a franchise I did not care for, a MMO, sci fi setting..\nGuess what- it didn't happen as the world was well presented, immersive, and I was given total freedom to set up my character, own my own ship, and even configure that one to my likings generously. You can play it entirely free, the added bonuses of subscribing and/or buying cash store items tend to be rather marginal, I ended up paying mainly to support the developers, but at its core it is still a nice looking RPG-style thing with variety between character-ground combat, or exciting ship to ship fights, and no need to do boring grind quests as you can level up with an interesting storyline mission. There is still ongoing support for this, too. watch out though, you might learn a bit more about the series than you wanted..","October 7, 2012","true","84.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I play a lot of games and I've played a lot of MMOs, not for a long time, true, and that is because my expectations are usually too high from F2P, usually asian oriented games though I still try every and each one which looks good, but still, none has captured me like Star Trek Online did, and none of them made me play them so much, so... continuosly.\n\nWhen I first got STO I thought It'd be just another short quality and fun factor test like I do with other MMOs after which the game would go directly to the recycle bin, but boy was I proven wrong. The moment I started playing everything appealed to me! I was the captain of a ship in a futuristic, believable universe, not just another soldier or nameless hero, sure I still kinda was a nameless captain of a nameless ship but at every chance the game got it spelled out my name and my ship's name, which I choose btw, and man was that awesome or what! And then there were the quests which made me play it continuously, and I mean absolutely continuously for about a week, after which I kinda let it easy, made a few breaks...\nI strolled to lvl50 like... it was nothing! In other games its like hell to level up but in STO its an actually fun adventure! The quests continued to give you that sensation of badassery and importance.\nAnd if that ain't all, just wait until you get to lvl50! Well, actually you don't need to wait that long, I did because I'm an unsocial ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but the point is that the game also has this awesome, growing fleets system, basically guilds and clans, which are incredibly awesome and really important since they offer all the max level content and fun.\n\nThis is what STO knows how to do best, make you feel powerful, important, tactical and utter badass, even if you aren't...! The game is just incredibly big and complex but by playing it and paying attention it gets very addicting and fun!\nIt also gets tons of updates if you're wondering with fixes, new content, expansions, new content, ships, new content... Did I mention how much new content it gets through updates? For free, of course.\n\nBeing a F2P game you'd expect it to have heavy monetization, and well it kinda does but you can basically get EVERYTHING that is monetized with in-game currency which is obtained with some heavy grinding. Still better than what most F2P games do anyhow.\n\nAfter I played this I thought of giving the tv series a chance, but I only managed to watch Enterprise which was the one most grounded into reality series and had a Stargate feel of adventure to it. The others still feel too silly and exaggerated to me, not to offend anyone, just my opinion.\n\nSo, Star Trek Online, is it good? Coming from someone who played/tried basically every MMO there is out there always looking for high quality in both gameplay and graphics, DEFINITELY YES!!!\nOne of the greatest, coolest, most awesome and badass games out there! So go play it already!","January 21, 2014","true","737.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Generally, the MMO formula doesn't appeal to me, but after reading several positive reviews, I gave this one a try.\n\nThe game itself is very attractive, especially with the graphical settings turned all the way up. This is definitely a Star Trek universe, with lots of visual cues  from the TV shows.\n\nThis game delivers lots of solo content, which is what piqued my interest. And it's true, this MMO is mostly a solo venture. You'll see other ships flying around, and other people at stardock, but you rarely interact with them. It's like 1,000 people playing solitare together.\n\nStar Trek Online has a compelling space-combat system. You can really trick up your ship, too, if you care to. But this doesn't save the game from it's very repetitive missions, and very complicated economy.\n\nEnd result: I lost interest. Total time invested, about 10 hours.\n","February 21, 2012","true","10.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

What a snowball bad start right? Klingon not finish no story line in klingons also pvp based. And the lag disconnection issues account that was so bad i even cry a little because i love star trek. However 2014 The game is change a lot. New contend new ships new missions new events is it good yah it is, is it the best hell no. But its for sure 200% better than at start. The Free to Play model is fine its not pay to win because you`re doing more pve than pvp at the end pvp is not worth looking for in this game so ignore that one. Still you can pvp but its cheesy bad that you think Elder Scrolls Online is better.\n\nHowever there is a downside to everything like every mmorpg the end game is really the endgame you can farm special items or crew or whatever you want to do. So thats the downside of the game however there is also a more elite missions you can do or turn your story line to elite to get better loot.\n\nYou can change everything not only your ship or you but even your crew your deck of the ship and even costum your engine increasing it at your taste. There are cookie builds on the net to squeeze the maximum of your char and ship. But thats your taste of gaming.\n\nGive it a chance play its free you know no money is needing to it. Perhaps if you like it badly you can buy a great ship you like. Fear deal right?","April 14, 2014","true","277.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/recommended/9900/","femboyancy","♥Princess Vaxi♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/","510 products in account","Star Trek Online is a game made by Cryptic Studios and Published by Perfect World Entertainment. The game had a very poor start, and was labelled as a 'dead MMO' a very long time ago. Since those dark days however, Star Trek Online has taken a miraculous turn for the better. It's as if someone got up from their depression in the developpers studio and said 'Let's kick some serious ***, people!'\nWell, whatever the case may be? It worked. Star Trek Online is an absolutely 'amazing' game, with everything from brand new graphics, to hourly events, to monthly special events that do not simply throw new content at you, but actually introduces it through an event!\nThe game also has a huge amount of Roleplay potential, with the ability to enter the bridge of your own ship, and even, if you have Starfleet/Klingon standard ships, go into the rest of the ship, such as crew quarters, etc.\n\nStar Trek Online, at first release, took place in 2409, 30 years after the events of the movie Star Trek: Nemesis. It largely follows the storyline of Star Fleet, but can also include the Klingon Empire(After rank 25 has been achieved). Since Legacy of Romulus has been released, you can also now play as a Romulan.\n\nGameplay:\nStar Trek Online has two gameplay modes. It has ship control, and it has regular person control. Much of the combat used to, in the old terrible days, happen in space, and ground combat was an eye sore. Now, Ground combat is just as viable(albeit a bit harder) than space combat, and features everything from Melee to healing to ranged to ballistic artillery. There are more types of weapons than you care to think about; Rifles, snipers, miniguns, dual wielding pistols, swords, bat'leths, Vulcan lirpas, shotguns, grenades. And for each of those? There's a different style of damage; Phaser, Disruptor, Plasma, Antiproton, each of which look different. The choices in terms of weaponry are literally endless, you couldn't make enough characters to try them all! The same goes for ships, giving you everything from torpedoes to cannons to phasers to custom special weapons unlocked through events.\nThe gameplay of this game has gone from an F, to an A++.\n\nCharacter Creator:\nYes, this thing needs its own subsection, deal with it XD\nThe game features 3 different classes, each of which have some specific strengths and weaknesses, but dont in any way limit you to a certain type of ship etc. Any class, can fly any ship, use any weapon, etc.\n\nTactical Officer(Red shirt): A strange mixture between DPS and Support, the Tactical officer lends a hand to his allies with buffs to damage and evasion, while also dishing out some impressive damage. They primarily fight ground combat with either melee, ranged, or grenades, and in space, they prefer small, agile escort fighters.\n\nScience Officer(Blue Shirt): The primary source of physical healing and support in the game. They suffer in damage, but do healing and support where others cannot, such as Heal over Time and defense bonuses. They prefer to fly Science Vessels, or Carriers.\n\nEngineering Officer(Yellow Shirt): The primary source of damage and shield healing in the game. They do a little bit of everything, and are profoundly Overpowered in the game at the moment. An engineer can lay down turrets or Mortar gunners, and can absolutely obliterate enemies with orbital strikes, grenades, mortars, sentry turrets, and an impressive affinity for melee weapons. They are also the primary tank of the game, taking impressive agro with their damage and having the strongest Shield healing capabilities in the game, keeping them alive while doing RIDICULOUS amounts of damage. Did I say their damage is crazy? They prefer to fly the large, hulking cruiser ships, nicknamed 'Space whales' due to their slow turn rate, but what they lack in maneuverability, they make up for in brute strength, and survivability.\n\nAs for races. There are more races in this game than I care to list. There is pretty much every single species ever to be featured in Star Trek, EVER. And if none of those appeal to you? Heck, MAKE YOUR OWN! Yeah! The character creator lets you custom design your own alien species! Wanna hail from the Gamma Quadrant? Never been seen before by Alpha Quadrant inhabitants? Not a problem! Just design it and write the lore for it!\n\n\nWhat kinda ships are there, then? (Let me again repeat that EVERY CLASS above can actually fly ANY ship thrown at them, except they have their 'best choices' all the same.)\n\nEscorts: The most iconic one being the USS Defiant(Deep Space Nine). Small, and very powerful damage dealers. They are the only type of ships that can fit Dual Heavy Cannons, some of the most serious weapons you've ever seen. They're tiny ships that can set a galaxy ablaze, blasting everything in front of them into nothingness. Though they're fragile, and will be easily overpowered if focused by enemy ships.\n\nScience Vessels: The most Iconic being USS Voyager(Voyager). They're not too strong with their weapons, but they have a little ace in their sleeves called 'exotic damage'. Their primary weapon is their deflector dish, and they can conjure up all manner of strange phenomenons in the universe, from rifts to gravitational anomalies that rip ships to pieces. They might be the healers, and supporters in a firefight, but don't corner one and force it to fight back. You'll regret it.\n\nCarriers: The largest of all the ships. These ships are a sort of sub-ship for Science Commanders to choose if their aim is to tank. The ship itself is no longer the primary source of damage, instead its allowed to focus entirely on defenses and shield power. Instead, they leave the damage to their arsenal of fighters. They dispath squadrons of tiny, very hard to hit fighter ships that can, in unison, utterly overwhelm a larger ship. Flying a carrier well takes skill, but once you have the control of the fighters down, you're a force to be reckoned with in a space war.\n\nCruisers: The most iconic one being USS Enterprise series. these are the massive, floating citadels of the galaxy. They sport crew sizes as big as small cities, and have the largest potential for tanking of any ship. Despite their affinity for survivability, they still have an impressive array of offensive weaponry, and can, if flown right, be a serious problem all by itself for the enemy. Nicknamed Space Whales.\n\nSpecial Ships: These can only be unlocked by opening lockboxes, which cost real money, OR bought for very high prices in the in-game auction house. Some can also be unlocked by buying them with a special, hard to gain currency called Lobi Crystals.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are a little bit hit or miss. In terms of their fuction, they are adequate, however they are by no means as good as other, new-age titles. Still, the graphics are impressive considering the hardships this game went through, and are still great eyecandy when floating around in space :3\n\nOverall Score:\n\nI'm gonna give this game 9.2/10. It is just doing too many things right to not deserve it. I would have preferred giving it 10/10, but the ONE draw back this game has, the MAJOR archilles heel of this title? It's free to play nature. The game gives you everything for free, that's true, 'except' for special ships, new outfits, and even some specific races, like Federation Klingons, or Caitian/Ferasan(Cat people for the furries <3 ) The game is, largely, a 'lockbox' hell game, and if you are not interested in that, and can ignore it? The game is at least a 9.8/10, ALMOST PERFECT, but not quite.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Honey, there's no MMO out there which I can safely recommend more earnestly, than this one. If you like Star Trek, and MMOs? This is a game you absolutely have to play.\n\nIf you live in China, Taiwan, Russia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Macau, Vietnam or Egypt? You will not be able to play this game!","October 6, 2014","true","568.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

FINALLY!  No more switching traits during a story mission!\n- Armadas.  These are in essence "metafleets" of up to 13 different fleets each.  One is an Alpha that can invite three Beta fleets, and each Beta can invite three Gamma fleets.  Each fleet can donate toward other armada members' projects.  This feature has potential but I don't believe it's been fully realized just yet.  It does come in handy for using fleet marks when your home fleet is already at max level on all projects.\n- Dry Dock.  Allows you to free up active ship slots for use.  Only complaint I have with this is that the equipment on a ship being dry docked doesn't stay with the ship but returns to your inventory.  Use of the loadout feature can mitigate this, but loadouts are still a bit buggy for some players.\n- Admiralty.  Basically, this is a duty officer (DOFF) system using ships instead of people.  Each ship in your inventory generates a card for the Admiralty system with fixed engineering, tactical, and science specs.  Missions show the required total amount of each spec, and you can slot up to three ships on each mission.  It has a pretty good XP return on some missions, so it takes some of the drudge out of leveling from 50 to 60.\n\nAs of late, it does feel like the devs are listening more to the players and making useful changes instead of just cosmetic ones.  The storyline is maturing well, though it does seem that exploration is again taking second place to combat, even though Cryptic indicated this season would be more about exploration.  I'll withhold judgement on that until the season has progressed further.\n\nDilithium prices for ZEN have skyrocketed since my original review.  On average, they're running in the 220-240 dil / 1 ZEN range.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (12/27/2014)\n\nFor those who eat, drink, sleep, breathe, and live Trek, Star Trek Online is as close as you can get to being a part of the universe, short of time travel.  This isn't to say that the game doesn't have flaws, but overall it works quite well.\n\nPROS\n\nYou get to fly and even (somewhat) modify canon starships, plus some pretty cool designs not seen in films or on TV.\n\nThe game is rich with content...in fact, it's a bit staggering just how much you can actually do in game.  Colonization?  Yep.  Ground fighting?  Got it.  Space battles?  You bet.  Exploration?  It's in there.  I strongly recommend that you read and bookmark the Star Trek Online wiki.\n\nCustomization of both ships and characters is possible, though more extensive customization will cost you eventually (either money or lots of grinding).  Still, the amount you can do in F2P is good.\n\nThe story arcs are interesting for the most part, and mesh well with canon Star Trek.  Finding out what happened in the Delta Quadrant after Voyager had been there is a good example...you'll also get to find out what happened to the Jenolan Dyson Sphere after Starfleet sent two science vessels to study it, how some of your favorite characters turned out and what they're doing circa 2410, the name given to Species 8472, and other tidbits along the way.\n\nSome of the special events are fun and funny, especially the Winter Wonderland event in progress as of this writing (12/27/2014), and offer decent rewards.\n\nCONS\n\nIf you don't like grinding, don't expect to get too far too fast.  There's plenty of it.  For example, you can collect all the dilithium ore you want, but you can only refine 8,000 per day plus a few small bonuses here and there.  As you unlock reputation levels, refined dilithium is required to purchase the stronger and better items...some require 15K, some require 32K, and so on.  That means you're going to be doing lots of minding...er...grining...er...GRINDING.\n\nTo really customize ships and characters, you'll be spending ZEN (Cryptic's currency) which costs either real money or LOTS of dilithium.  Typical cost as of this writing is 165 dilithium to 1 ZEN.  Considering that most of the best items for purchase run anywhere from 500-2500 ZEN, I'll let you do the math.\n\nThere are a couple of long-standing bugs in the game (read the wiki and the game site for more info) that can be either a minor nuisance or a major pain, depending on your tolerance level.\n\nPET PEEVE\n\nI thought dilithium could be recrystallized as early as in Star Trek IV, which was confirmed in TNG.  So why do I have to keep mining dilithium for everything?  Can't I just reuse a small amount?  :P\n\nOVERALL\n\nRecommended.","December 27, 2014","true","937.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

My hours on Steam are not accurate as I have played this through the STO launcher, Champions Online launcher, and Arc. As someone who has well over 1000 hours invested into this game, I feel obligated to tell you this game is in no way P2W or paywalled. The people who say these things are either bad at the game or can't be bothered to get dilithium and buy ships. NO ship is overpowered, bar the Scimitar which is just ridiculous. Some ships excel at their role, yes, but there is no overpowered. PVP is dead, so anyone using that as a measurement is fighting against people who have invested time into their characters.\n\nOn to the actual review. STO is a Star Trek MMORPG developed by Cryptic Studios, a company that is really passionate about their babies. There are glorious space battles to be had, as you go from ensign to admiral over your character's career. You start off against the Klingons in tradition Trek fashion and things quickly escalate. Missions are divided into arcs that act almost as seasons, with some very impressive set pieces that are played around with.\n\nThe character customization is almost overwhelming, with just about every species having a place and the ability to customize your own alien species. This customizability extends to uniforms and bridge officers, who are like your companions in other games. You choose their looks, their weapons, and their abilities.\n\nEvery character, yourself included, is divided into three careers: Engineering, Science, and Tactical. These give you basic abilities that you can use regardless of your ship, all of which are fairly useful. Tacs excel at damage, sci  toons can pull some space debuffing magic, and engineers are gods of fortifying their hulls with extreme amounts of health. Any captain can pilot any ship, regardless of what type of ship that is. There is no forced progression path into a certain ship.\n\nI'll touch on ships here, since that's what we're looking for. There are dozens of ships ranging from Tier 1 to Tier 6. You get a new ship every ten levels, stopping at 40. 40-50 is T5, with everything above 50 being T6. T6 ships can be bought for real money, earned frome events, or bought by converting dilithium to zen.\n\nThe conversion rate is around 160 dil per zen, which fluctuates a fair bit. T6 ships cost 3000 zen, which might seem like a lot because it is. You can refine 8000 dilithium per day as a basic player, so it'll take a while to earn and refine that much. Once you fall into a nice pattern, this isn't something that seems grindy.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is fairly low, although the average player might have some difficulties if they aren't aware of how the game works. This is a simple, but shockingly deep game. Don't worry about loot until you hit 50, then find what you want to do. The game doesn't have to be just about damage, everyone has a place. Check out r/STO and r/STOBuilds if you have problems, and join RedditChat ingame.\n\nYou may see me flying around as Johnny B. Obvious@prrah-khet, so feel free to add me as a friend and ask as many questions as you need. As long as you are willing to learn, I can help you.

Obviously, PW makes their money by having microtransactions. However, despite this, it's still equitable for the F2P player. As the game description says, it's like being inside the show. Sector narration is done by Leonard Nimoy, Michael Dorn reprises his role as Worf and there are other familiar characters. If you're a Star Trek fanboy like me, then you'll see this game as a time suck. It's not the most visually stunning game out there but it's a lot of fun.\n\nEdit 1: Recently, Tim Russ reprised his role as Tuvok during a Dyson Sphere event.\n\nEdit 2: Now that I have more time on record, I can add a few things. My view about the game above is still the same. However, I will take the time to add a few things. As I said before, it helps if you're a Star Trek fan to begin with. You get to play with the ship types you saw in the different series and you get to visit the places you could only see on TV. I will caution you that the story takes place some 30 years after the events of the last Star Trek movie (no, not the new ones...I mean Nemesis). If you take that into consideration, you'll realize that it's a whole new take on the franchise.\n\nEdit 3: I mentioned before that there are microtransactions. Really, the best ships are there and it wouldn't hurt to drop some money on Zen to get a few of them. That being said, you seriously don't have to. What you're really paying for are the consoles that come with them that give you some neat abilities. When you hit max level, you can get all kinds of equipment by running PvE/PvP queues that evens the playing field. So, you don't need to buy anything at all.\n\nEdit 4: With the Legacy of Romulus update they did, the current mechanics seem to favor the Romulans since you can choose a side. Their ships seems to have the advantage in fights and function in multiple capacities. That being said, the disparity isn't actually there. Each race has their strong suit and each race is deficient somwhere.","January 27, 2014","true","565.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

There are places where you can see the amount of money necessary to get the former end-game gear to the new end-game gear without spending a full year grinding to get it there.\n\nI loved the game, played competitively in PvP with a lot of great people.  I was not a free player.  Probably spent around $3-400 on this game before the cap inrease.

The support department refused to return it, didn't have the decency to tell me why they wouldn't/couldn't and even threatened to ban my account if I pressed the matter.\n\nThe developers of the game openly have contempt for their players calling them morons, exploiters, whiners, you name it.

I came here looking for a fix after not being impressed by the new movies and I found it for a while. There is plenty to explore and the ships are done well and can be fun to fly.\n\nThen you start to realise that every mission is essentially the same. Warp in, kill a few waves of bad guys and warp out. Starfleet don't do diplomacy or exploration anymore, they just kill everything. No questions asked.\n\nThe endgame is the same. Repeating the same few missions over and over to gain slightly better equipment to do the same few missions over and over but slightly quicker. Everything is a pointless grind.

The main offenses after the new expansion lie in the realms of balance. Release after release, there seems to be very little deliberation about releasing new items and mechanics. They are, for the most part, terribly broken. PvP is utterly a joke, and even PvE now suffers the consequences, as the empty queues can tell.\n\nMany other systems are equally aggravating. Crafting and upgrading, both tied behind time gates and random number generators. When you craft or upgrade an item, you cannot choose the mods - they're random. Which may turn your crafted item into vendor trash, and your resources spent for nothing. Not to mention the terrible long time gates -- 20 hours to craft a single endgame item. I haven't seen any of this in the other good MMOs I used to play.\n\nTo not be completely negative about this, certain areas of the game get proper attention and listen to player feedback. They're mostly related to art: costumes, ship models, and environment. The new Club 47, released a couple weeks prior to the date of this post, is truly awesome. But you can only go so far dancing all night long in this game, if anywhere.\n\nAs a fan of the game genre (flying a starship, having a crew), it is sad to see this game being destroyed by poor development decisions. If you are a fan of Star Trek (I am not really), you may find the stories interesting.","December 3, 2014","false","925.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I think many of the story mission sagas would actually make good comics or novels but most players lament not having conversation choices impact the story in a significant way, even though there are many opportunities to play as evil or good. The lengthy Rep system and new Research schools and specialization trees cretainly breathed life into the game for dedicated players, as well as new ships available to all players who complete events during winter and summer. "No player need be left behind" in terms of ships and equipment, if you trade longer playtime for an outright buy. Important here to note is the store in this game has exorbitant prices, a ship can cost you $30 dollars only to be outclassed later and there are many "packs" that range in the hundreds of dollars, "WTH"? right? but believe me, I've played a long time and any player can earn and buy any ship the free way and it won't take THAT long maybe like a saving a month in-game at the most for a good ship. Lock box ships can also be purchased on the exchange I know many people who get them this way. All in all, what with events and discounts and giveaway's and dedication, I don't feel leftout as a non-subscriber and over the years I can say the game earned what I spent, at least I wasn't dumb enough to get into Lockbox keys but If you want to gamble 100's of dollars you deserve a good ship! crazy. Anyway, Graphics are good with many story options, some actually stunning enviroments like summer Risa, hours of fun for Trek fans or sci-fi ship combat fans, although ship combat is some of the best I've played, its done in a third person view with a more stategic take in that the skills and manouvering you use in combat are all important since all  combat is auto-aimed. Same with ground combat strategy is all important and headshots non-existant but for a skill tree which gives a crit bonus for aimed shots.  Anyhow, I would say check it out, I don't offer many criticisims because the game is quite open ended and everyone finds a different nche of activities they like, Over-all it's impressive work but I would say suffers like all MMO's because they also incorporate alot of "mindless" grindiness into into it, if you know what I mean, something like being presented with a mountain of dull paperwork to do to get some rewards but again it's up to the player if they "feel" like it or not.","March 30, 2015","true","431.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Anyone familiar with PWI knows they're at about the level of nexon for terrible support, outrageous prices, and poor to nonexistent communication. Well, I'll give cryptic this, they do blog posts and announcements about everything, have frequent livestreams, and devs will occasionally chime in on forum topics, but when it comes to support? Good luck. You may or may not get a canned response when you submit a ticket, and may or may not ever get a real person to reply to you after you reply to the canned response, and they know their support is beyond terrible because they completely removed the satisfaction survey people could fill out after their support ticket was closed.\n\nThe prices for most of the premium content is also ridiculous (especially ships.....$25-$30 per for endgame ships), and even things that are basic in most MMOs cost money here. Want to rename your character? Pay up. But the rename tokens don't even work properly and it shows your old name in a lot of in game dialogue. Did you pick a wrong skill somewhere in the newly revamped skill tree that just made things more confusing? Guess it sucks to be you, pay up for that reskill token. You can buy 30+ character slots, but the game has been made so alt unfriendly with all the reputations and specializations to grind for that it's mostly pointless to play more than one character anymore unless you're really hardcore and can juggle 2 or 3. And the expansion themed bundles? $130 for a few ships, a handful of costumes, maybe a title or two, and some master keys? I don't know about anyone else but I can't justify dropping $130 unless there's some physical goods to go with it.\n\nNew "content" is frequently added to the game but it's almost always just a tie-in to some new cash item, most often gacha style lockboxes which aren't cash items themselves but require master keys to open, which are cash items. Lately any new features are just tweaks to or revamps of existing mechanics, which always cause a slew of bugs that get reported on the test server but usually make it into the live build anyway. Some bugs have been around for years and have never been fixed, eventually cryptic just gave up trying to fix most of them and either labeled them as "working as intended" like cloak deactivating on dialogue popups, or just decided to ignore them. This is compounded by the fact that all of the original devs either quit or were let go and the new ones have little knowledge of how the game's base code works. One of them even posted in a forum topic about bugs that "working on STO was like trying to untangle spaghetti, you're going to end up with a mess no matter what you do."\n\nPower creep has gotten so disgusting in STO that it's even hard for the devs to keep up with it. One of the most popular queued missions (Crystalline cataclysm advanced) has been broken because player damage output can get so high the boss with hundreds of millions of HP sometimes dies before one of the objectives can be completed. A lot of people just shrug and say "oh well", but when you consider that the objectives are tied to events that trigger at certain HP threshholds and it often dies before the first one finishes so the second one can trigger.....yeah. But instead of addressing the runaway damage output it gets buffed even more? It used to only be the hardcore elite players that could hit the 75k DPS mark, then it was 100k, now they're pushing 150k and people hitting 50-75k is becoming common. Instead of giving enemies better AI and more skills to use to mitigate or heal damage cryptic takes the lazy route and just increases HP and damage output for them, then puts out the next set of shinies to boost player damage output and the cycle repeats.\n\nThe game was fun while Atari owned it, and still was for a while after, but it's been turned into just another cash cow that milks a popular franchise. There is very little "Star Trek" material in the game in it's current state aside from the general theme, if the ships and outfits were replaced with generic designs nobody would be able to tell it was a Star Trek themed game. There's no exploration (there actually was an exploration system but it was removed because cryptic decided it would be too much work to update it) and the theme to every mission is "kill them all", there's no diplomacy options that actually matter (there USED to be diplomacy missions and even first contacts with minor species, but they were removed for the same reason as exploration) since no matter what dialogue choices you make you don't affect the outcome of missions at all, it's basically just flavor text with no substance. The only reason I still play occasionally is I've invested too much time into it to throw it all away, so I log in every now and then to blow things up for a bit or chat with friends.\n\nTL;DR:\nIf you think you'd like a generic grind MMO with a Star Trek flavor you may enjoy it, but if you're a Trek fan who's looking for a Star Trek themed MMO, sadly this isn't it.","May 6","false","209.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

(Buff, buff, buff, Guns to lower shields. projectile to destroy the hull, cloak, rinse and repeat)\n- The character customization had a lot of options. (What I thought was tanned was actually kind of Orange LOL)\n- The missions were also pretty great, just the right amount of challenge.\n- The inside of the ships were magnificent.\n- Pet Varens in one of the ships.\n- Space and ship graphics were good.\n- And holy ♥♥♥♥, your guild house is a massive space ship/station, that is all.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The non-ship combat was clunky. (Clunky drop kick was my favorite thing.)\n- The grinding was just... Mind numbing.\n- Character graphics looked weirdly like rubber.\n- The physics for out of ship combat was weird.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n- PWI's Free-to-play but pay-to-win scheme.\n\nWould I recommend this game? The honest answer is yes, it's a good game and if you have money to spare or parents who can spot for your game cards then why not buy a few account upgrades or IRL cash ships. If you're into the long term grinding experience then you can eventually buy ships that are decent with in-game currency. Yes, you can complete the game without shelling out cash except for buying the DLCs.\n\nDo I hate the PWI experience? A little bit, yes.\n\nWill I not recommend this game simply because it's a PWI game? No, the game deserves it's praise and it's time, Cryptic made this game, not PWI. PWI is simply milking the game for all it's worth because they're a business and that's how they choose to run things.","July 18, 2015","true","1.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

But when my main character became really badly bugged, affecting something I had spent money on in the cash shop - and it was affecting other players too - could I get them to fix it?\n\nNo.\n\nI bugrepped it. Months went by. Nothing. I bugrepped it again. Waited again. Nothing. So I lodged a ticket with customer service. After jumping through hoops (taking screenshots etc.) to prove there was a problem they told me they couldn't fix it and I should bugrep it. Which I'd done. They also specifically told me never to contact CS again about this problem or any like it.\n\nEmail records from CS were produced.\n\nSo nearly a year later I lodge a complaint with BBB. PWE's initial response was dishonest - saying I should have contacted CS, as if I hadn't. They then ignored BBB's attempts to follow up with them for several months until they gave up and advised me to lodge a complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission.\n\nMeanwhile in their forums, their head of community relations took to slagging me off and perfectly innocent posts of mine were being moderated away. And their developers tried to make me out to be unco-operative, when I had been anything but.\n\nEventually in the thread about this bug I told them about BBB's advice to complain to the US FTC. Voila! The bug was fixed fixed. That's all it takes to get bugs fixed in this game. A year of bug reporting, CS tickets, complaints to consumer groups and threatening them with an FTC complaint.\n\nI had played and enjoyed the game for a very long time (outside Steam), and spent a lot of money on it, but when a company behaves like this - well no game is worth that. Plus given how aggressive and dishonest they were in relation to the BBB complaint and in their forum, I could never trust that they wouldn't mess with my characters.\n\nSteer clear.","December 29, 2014","false","108.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I say give it a try since it's free after all :) You dont have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy it, but i guess it helps :p","March 8, 2013","true","725.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike other MMORPG's there is a special feature in this game where players can create their own custom content. This is in the form of maps and missions. With in these there are missions or goals, tho the rewards for these games are standardised by STO (star trek online). If your a fan of star trek online then you'll more than likely enjoy the game for a long time. For even beginers (F2P Free 2 play), there is enough slots open to play 1 character from each faction. With in the game you have choices of engineering, tactical, and science captain. There are similar ships to choose from with appropreate abilities. If you want a little compairison, think of tactical like a fighter, engineer like support/aid/tank (not as high dps as tactical), and science to be along the lines of support ability wizard/cleric (offencive/defencive) Most of the game is available to play for free. In fact you can level up to the maximum level and pilot some top end ships. However special or eliet type ships are much mroe time consuming to get. There are story lines for federation, klingon, and romulan factions (playable). Then as you level up there are chapters about older star trek oddities like tribbles. Missions with the actual Warf as a voice actor. Borg missions, species 8572, volcan, and much more. My personal favoret is to visit deep space 9, Earth space dock, and to fly around where ever I want. I think this game as at least compairable to most other mmorpgs with pets, quests, items, character customization is far supperior than most. There is a lot of content that is available to those willing to spend the money to get it. Rather than monthly subscriptions there are free to play accounts, Monthly subscribers, and life time memberships.  The Life time member enjoy certain rewards and perks continuesly while other perks become available immediately on purchase.","June 25, 2014","true","378.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It tends to lose itself in the background noise of every other MMO around. It does nothing really special, but it is fun to try to design your own ship and uniforms, and pick your own crew. The only real criticism of this game is the same that I have of every MMO: you are not unique. You have the same gear, access to the same missions, and are captain of a starship just like every other player. Areas around planets and space stations are clogged with dozens of starships, all captained by players. I feel this is evidence of a systemic assumption in MMO design, that players don't want to work for anything. I feel it would have been far more compelling if they required you to work up to being a captian with your own ship.\nFrom a technical standpoint, I have constant issues with the servers being down. I often get significant lag followed by the termination of my connection and (when I try to log back on) the server is down. This is not an occasional thing. Just about every time I sit down to play. I'm pretty positive this is not an issue on my end, as I don't encounter this problem anywhere else. As a result, I've not been able to play this game as much as I'd like.\nOver all, I think it has some value in the idea that you get to see a lot of cool Star Trek stuff. And, if played for free, this can be worth while (and the reason for my recommendation). But I wouldn't pay for a rather bland game with so many server issues.","April 7, 2015","true","21.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would say about 7/10.\n\nFirst, as a Trek fan I enjoy that it continues the story of the Prime universe, and that there are tons of call backs, references, and even cameos.\n\nNow, when I started, I admittedly felt like the controls were a tad awkward, but once I got used to them. I've found that that's all I really needed: to get used to them.\n\nThe space combat is highly reminicent of what's seen in the shows/movies, even including attacks/abilities that can be traced to commands given by the various captains across the generations.\n\nThe ground combat/missions could be better, but I personally find them tolerable.\n\nThe graphics are good, but not fantastic, and it tells a good story overall.\n\nAlso, if you love the ability to customize virtually everything(no, that's not an exageration), you'll get a kick out of this game. You can customize your outfits, your ships(with some restrictions based ship's class/type etc), alter your bridge officers, and even create your own species.\n\nThe crafting system is a bit tedious, and materials are hard to come by, but it's not horrible.\n\nNow, if I had to name my biggest issue with this game, its the same as most MMOs: the microtransactions. By using real money to by 'Zen'(100 Zen = $1), you can unlock a lot of stuff, but some of it is kinda petty and/or overpriced. For example if you want to get a new ship past level 50(that's appropriate to your level), you better be willing to pay out $25 PER SHIP. Granted,, there are other ways to secure new level appropriate ships, but most are geared for LV 50, and require grinding for special currencies to aquire.\n\nAlso, I have to say I've notice the community tends to be a bit juvenile.  Even though there do appear to be some more mature people among the community, by and large I would recommend just soloing unless you really need help.\n\nSo, overall the gameplay is enjoyable and good for Trek fans, plus it also has some good storytelling and decent graphics. But, the petty money stuff and largely immature community are a bit offputting.\n\nIf you are a Trek fan, or just love MMOs with lots of customization and decent story, check it out, and enjoy some nostalgia.\n\nIf you aren't a Trek fan, can't stand stupid players, or hate microtransactions...feel free to give it a try, but it may not be for you.","April 6, 2015","true","237.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On the plus side, this is easily the best looking, most expansive and most realistic Star Trek game ever, that offers the best way to expericne the Star Trek universe yourself. Team games are also a lot of fun, especially death macthes. On top of that, it's easy to learn, highly customisable, and doesn't require you to throw money at it. Sure, you can pay your way up to bigger ships, but you loose the sense of achievement of ranking up. You're more likely to like it if you're more into the ships than anything else, but overall it's an authentic and enjoyable game.\n\n7/10","February 10, 2014","true","33.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ypou start by creating your character, You can choose between Federation, Klingon Empire or Romulan Empire... I picked Starfleet of course!\n\nUpon creating your character I was expecting your normal 6 races that were peoples most favs but I soon learned that you could go as far as being Andorian and even a Trill(Joined or not) BUT it does not stop there, They have also included the tools to create your own Alien Race complete with special abilities custom looks and the lot. Imagine Spore Creature Creator in an MMO!\n\nThe Tutorial began and I was celebrating graduation from starfleet Academy which for me was a real shame because I would liked to have spent some more time and perhaps even my first 10 levels just learning about the game and the Star Trek Universe. I mean would you take up the chance to do a class on Warp Engineering?\n\nThis is where the excittment stopped for me, There is ground combat but I refuse to even Awknowledge that part of the game as its severly lacking in every possible way. (I remember one time I was being chased around a tree by a Klingon... all my friends just stood and laughed at me)\n\nSpace battles are extremely intense and provide a great bit of stress relief though I felt there could have been a little more.\n\nSUGGESTION: Not something I can really complaoin about but I'm going to rant and suggest it here... this is Star Trek and there is no ability to command your ship from the captains chair... I want to be able to walk around my ship issuing commands to my crew, not steering and fighting in 3rd person from outside the ship!\n\n\nNow that is all I can say but would like to also note it is a Theme Park MMO and I find these rather boring so this is not one I have played a lot of but it is one that has earnt itself a spot on my shelf and it will remain there defiantly.","February 1, 2012","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well... roleplaying here is very nice. The lvling up is easy until lvl 50, after that you grind alot to lvl 60. The PVP and PVE lost the strategy. The game is now DPS (Damage Per Second) dependent. For you to get a good build, either you grind alot or you use real money as shortcut. The Grind is sometimes boring (spicy it up a bit with mass effect music and other epic musics). Some ships and consoles from previous events cannot be claimed by players that didnt participate in those events. Special Uniforms and Ships are only caracter unlock, not account-wide (C-Store Uniforms and ships are account-wide).\n\nWhy i recomend it?\n\nI just play the game because i like roleplay, i like to grind at the sound of Suicide Mission or The End Run, i like the advanced tailor customization, i like the part where you name your ship anything you want (with the typical restrains like profany)","May 30, 2014","true","916.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is relatively engaging for an MMO, and the graphics are nice. If you are even a little bit of a trekkie, there is a great deal of fun to be had here.\n\nThat said, like most MMOs, it gets samey rather fast. It takes longer than most, which is something I really have to give the developers a great deal of kudos for, but eventually, you're going to feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again. Something that helps combat this is that it has the concept of user-created missions. You can actually get on a special account type and create missions for others to play. These range from the awesome to the "meh", and is another unique feature to STO.\n\nThe fact that this is free to play, and the paid addons are reasonable, makes it definitely one of the better MMO's out there.

I will recomend this to people who like Star Trek and to people who don't really know anything about it as through the story telling you will get to grips with basics of Star Trek knowledge. This game is still being updated regulary and has seasonal and daily events that add hours of gameplay added onto the 100+ hours of storyline, side quests and PvP. As this is a Cryptic game the customization is superb from the ships you fly to the crew who fly it. Now this game plays in two ways, one way is with your ship and the other is on the ground. As this is a mmorpg you can get together and play with your friends and play through the missions together or you can play on your own. This game is completely different to other popular mmorpg's as this brings another aspect to the gameplay as it's not just a grind fest on the ground but in space with a whole galaxy to explore meeting different races and player along the way. Now when you start the game you can pick from 3 main races, Starfleet, Klingon and Romulan all having different quests, ships, planets, weapons, armors and gameplay styles so they all offer a different way to play. Now as this game is made by Cryptic it does have some Pay to Win ascpects or in this case pay to unlock before unlocking as about 60% of the items and ships you can get from the 2 non payed currency, zen being the payed one.\n\nI am going to give this game a 8/10 as it has 100's of hours of gameplay, regular updates and a vast community; but let down by its small glitches.","January 12, 2014","true","246.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradewinston/recommended/9900/","comradewinston","ComradeWinston","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradewinston/","302 products in account","An all around good game in many ways. First off you have three factions, all with at least a few races in each. Both ground and space combat are solid however space combat is easily the better of the two. There is of course the Federation, the Klingons, and the newest faction which are the Romulans.\n\nThe Romulans have a story of liberation and resistance against a nearly rogue sect of the now shattered Romulan Star Empire. You fly warbirds which at each new rank grant you a new ability only usable on warbirds. All of them can cloak and a later version can even split into two.\n\nThe downfall of the Romulans in my eye is that they have no great massive ship of their own. I find the Ha'apax Advanced Warbird a bit lacking in that department. And even though you are in fact forced to join either the Federation or Klingons you cannot actually gain access to their T4 and higher ships. So I must recommend a mightier faction, one of glory and honor. The Klingon Empire.\n\nThe Klingon story is far more diverse and even includes a small portion of the Romulan story, even including the Romulan end mission around lv32. The story ranges from house rivalries and betrayals to the return of Klingon enemies from ancient lore among other interesting developments. The Klingons are a faction with many mighty ships designed for head-on combat that have hull strength only rivaled by ships you'd have to spend $150 opening gambling boxes to get your hands on. And this does not even diminish their offensive capabilities as their greatest ship is a carrier armed just as well as any warship.\n\nThe Fedration offers little that can compare to the might of the Klingon Empire. Their ships seem to be designed around a doctrine of agility as many of their ships are far smaller but probably just as effective in combat if used properly.\n\nThere is also a system for crew missions, where you deploy your crew to go do things like sacking a colony, bribery, espionage, fighting in tournaments, trade agreements, asteroid mining for arguably the most valuable currency dilithium, among other tasks. These all net rewards which vary by the rarity of the mission, its difficulty, who's on it, and of course what the mission is in the first place determines the base set of rewards. You can even send one of your crew to be executed for incompetence as a Klingon, which even though its useless is just great to have sitting there as an option.\n\nThe visuals are good, the game hasn't crashed once for me, the UI is customizable.\n\nAll in all, a great MMO.","June 17, 2013","true","349.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Trust me... I've played plenty of the other trek games which have been very poorly implemented and are buggy... *cough* Star Trek: Armada *cough*\n\nTo absolute trekkies, this game gives plenty of 'nods' to all of the series such as Planets, ship systems, characters, races and many more.\n\nTo give a balanced view of the game, I must say that the lockbox side of the game isn't in the spirit of the trek universe but I understand that Cryptic have to make money to keep this game going to keep publishing new content and refreshing older content... if they don't, it'll go the way of WoW and become stagnant.","November 25, 2013","true","750.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is highly customisable from yourself to your ship to your ship crew.\n\nThe stories are excellent if your a fan of Star Trek which I am, theres loads of reference to all the franchises with episodes of time travel to get your origianl series fill.\n\nThe ship battles are my favourite. This isn't Dota you have a full array of abilities to chose from, my Naga gets a lot of use. I am really enjoying the Science vessel it is my kind of play style and feels like a character in itself. There are hundred of different ways you can play the ships. Having a science vessel but then having a tactical team or a mix of all. You even chose the different officers on your ship which then opens up different abilities which you can choose from.\n\nYou get duty officers alos which you can send on mission and this can level you, get skill points and dilithium.\n\nI havent finished learning the game, there seems like there is much more and they are always improving it and adding new seasons.","December 24, 2013","true","141.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That, then, leaves space "events," PvP and guild activities, the last of which depends wholly upon how organized your guild is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ceadol/recommended/9900/","Ceadol","Ceadol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ceadol/","88 products in account","I haven't played Star Trek Online since it launched back in February of 2010. I can say without a doubt that I was excited for this game when I first pre-ordered it. And then I played it. It wasn't the worst MMO I had ever played but it definitely didn't live up to my expectations. The ground combat was clunky, the early story and missions were boring and there was little to no voice acting. About the only thing I did like was the ship to ship combat. But that couldn't save it for me. I just couldn't bring myself to buy the full version.\n\nNow, 4 years later, I find myself picking it up again after hearing about how many changes have been made. It piqued my curiosity so I began to play last week. Trust me when I say, this isn't the same game that I decided against buying 4 years ago. Pretty much everything has been revamped. The game is now in it's 8th major update since launch, so there's quite a bit of new content.\n\nStarting out, the first thing I noticed that the whole intro has been scrapped and is now completely different. Instead of finding yourself in the middle of a Borg attack, you are now an Ensign at Starfleet Academy, who has just graduated and been given his (or her) first assignment. You have been chosen to be the First Officer aboard a not-so-new Miranda Class ship. Your first mission is to go out and collect some data samples with your cadet crew. Then things go wrong.\n\nThe story is engrossing from the very first moments. It's a major step up from what used to be.\n\nThen there's the C-Store. Currently, the game is Free To Play, which is good for someone like me, who's on a budget. Usually I hate the Free to Play options in games because I feel like my version is severely diminished. That's not the case in Star Trek Online. As a matter of fact, aside from some nifty cosmetic stuff and things like different styles of ships, I haven't really seen anything different between the Free to Play stuff and Paid subscribers. There are a few things, such as more costume slots or extra Duty Officers, which are nice but not necessarily hindering you if you don't have them.\n\nWhat really impresses me about the C-Store is the ability to buy Zen (the currency used in the Cash Shop) with in-game Dilithium. Admittedly, it's at a pretty steep cost. About 125 Dilithium per 1 Zen. That means that if you want to buy the cheapest item in the C-Store, you'll need about 31,000 Dilithium saved up. Which is going to take you quite a bit of grinding. But still. The option is there and that's more than most other games will give you.\n\nOverall, I have been having a blast. Currently I've only made it to Level 20 (Commander) and I have yet to join a Fleet but that hasn't stopped the fun from rolling in.\n\nThe only thing I could really ask for is some good PVP or better PVE Instance queues. But that's not to say I wont keep playing.\n\nAt the moment, I am going to give it a 7 out of 10. I've seen some bugs but those are nothing that can't be fixed in later patches.","January 23, 2014","true","35.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I will recomend this to people who like Star Trek and to people who don't really know anything about it as through the story telling you will get to grips with basics of Star Trek knowledge. This game is still being updated regulary and has seasonal and daily events that add hours of gameplay added onto the 100+ hours of storyline, side quests and PvP. As this is a Cryptic game the customization is superb from the ships you fly to the crew who fly it. Now this game plays in two ways, one way is with your ship and the other is on the ground. As this is a mmorpg you can get together and play with your friends and play through the missions together or you can play on your own. This game is completely different to other popular mmorpg's as this brings another aspect to the gameplay as it's not just a grind fest on the ground but in space with a whole galaxy to explore meeting different races and player along the way. Now when you start the game you can pick from 3 main races, Starfleet, Klingon and Romulan all having different quests, ships, planets, weapons, armors and gameplay styles so they all offer a different way to play. Now as this game is made by Cryptic it does have some Pay to Win ascpects or in this case pay to unlock before unlocking as about 60% of the items and ships you can get from the 2 non payed currency, zen being the payed one.\n\nI am going to give this game a 8/10 as it has 100's of hours of gameplay, regular updates and a vast community; but let down by its small glitches.","January 12, 2014","true","246.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradewinston/recommended/9900/","comradewinston","ComradeWinston","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradewinston/","302 products in account","An all around good game in many ways. First off you have three factions, all with at least a few races in each. Both ground and space combat are solid however space combat is easily the better of the two. There is of course the Federation, the Klingons, and the newest faction which are the Romulans.\n\nThe Romulans have a story of liberation and resistance against a nearly rogue sect of the now shattered Romulan Star Empire. You fly warbirds which at each new rank grant you a new ability only usable on warbirds. All of them can cloak and a later version can even split into two.\n\nThe downfall of the Romulans in my eye is that they have no great massive ship of their own. I find the Ha'apax Advanced Warbird a bit lacking in that department. And even though you are in fact forced to join either the Federation or Klingons you cannot actually gain access to their T4 and higher ships. So I must recommend a mightier faction, one of glory and honor. The Klingon Empire.\n\nThe Klingon story is far more diverse and even includes a small portion of the Romulan story, even including the Romulan end mission around lv32. The story ranges from house rivalries and betrayals to the return of Klingon enemies from ancient lore among other interesting developments. The Klingons are a faction with many mighty ships designed for head-on combat that have hull strength only rivaled by ships you'd have to spend $150 opening gambling boxes to get your hands on. And this does not even diminish their offensive capabilities as their greatest ship is a carrier armed just as well as any warship.\n\nThe Fedration offers little that can compare to the might of the Klingon Empire. Their ships seem to be designed around a doctrine of agility as many of their ships are far smaller but probably just as effective in combat if used properly.\n\nThere is also a system for crew missions, where you deploy your crew to go do things like sacking a colony, bribery, espionage, fighting in tournaments, trade agreements, asteroid mining for arguably the most valuable currency dilithium, among other tasks. These all net rewards which vary by the rarity of the mission, its difficulty, who's on it, and of course what the mission is in the first place determines the base set of rewards. You can even send one of your crew to be executed for incompetence as a Klingon, which even though its useless is just great to have sitting there as an option.\n\nThe visuals are good, the game hasn't crashed once for me, the UI is customizable.\n\nAll in all, a great MMO.","June 17, 2013","true","349.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are given a high level of customization over your characters, crew, uniforms, weapons, and ships.  While you can spend money on items, simple Dilithium mining, grinding, and ship-to-ship combat can provide most of the currency needed to buy items.  Larger battles can provide all manner of weapons and ship upgrades you can sell, equip, or trade.  Story writing is excellent and puts you in several famous locations throughout the galaxy.

As long as you keep getting new equptment it's actually pretty good at keeping your quests to not being too hard for your level and having a lot of activities to do. For the most part the community is very helpful and nice but there are a lot of horrible people as well to watch out for but it's not very previlient.\n\nThere are some quests who do feel over powered and just can cause you some problems but if you just get friends to help it'll usually cut the difficulty down, which is the nice thing, you can do your quests with friends and help each other out very easily.

Unlike other MMORPG's there is a special feature in this game where players can create their own custom content. This is in the form of maps and missions. With in these there are missions or goals, tho the rewards for these games are standardised by STO (star trek online). If your a fan of star trek online then you'll more than likely enjoy the game for a long time. For even beginers (F2P Free 2 play), there is enough slots open to play 1 character from each faction. With in the game you have choices of engineering, tactical, and science captain. There are similar ships to choose from with appropreate abilities. If you want a little compairison, think of tactical like a fighter, engineer like support/aid/tank (not as high dps as tactical), and science to be along the lines of support ability wizard/cleric (offencive/defencive) Most of the game is available to play for free. In fact you can level up to the maximum level and pilot some top end ships. However special or eliet type ships are much mroe time consuming to get. There are story lines for federation, klingon, and romulan factions (playable). Then as you level up there are chapters about older star trek oddities like tribbles. Missions with the actual Warf as a voice actor. Borg missions, species 8572, volcan, and much more. My personal favoret is to visit deep space 9, Earth space dock, and to fly around where ever I want. I think this game as at least compairable to most other mmorpgs with pets, quests, items, character customization is far supperior than most. There is a lot of content that is available to those willing to spend the money to get it. Rather than monthly subscriptions there are free to play accounts, Monthly subscribers, and life time memberships.  The Life time member enjoy certain rewards and perks continuesly while other perks become available immediately on purchase.","June 25, 2014","true","378.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Such as more inventory space for free, and bank space. We are currently in Season 9.5 A New Accord. The .5 generally brings some modifications to game performance and what not. We should expect some new things, in Season 10. For now however, I have been exploring the STO Universe, making new friends, discovering new things, and more! I still do greatly recommend the game, for newcomers to STO, you guys get an updated Tutorial :3, but have fun, and never give up!\n\n*REVIEW POST UPDATE 4/6/2014 1:12 PM (PST)*\nThe game has greatly improved over the past year that I had been playing it. Although, the Dyson Sphere can use some work, as there is a huge bug where the ground below you spazzes out, but other than that, a very great game. You might see other people that are Vice Admiral(Level 50 [Max Player Level]) and might make fun of you or something related, just ignore them. There are very few Vice Admirals' out there that would help newcomers into the STO Universe. I became one of these people and help any newcomer that I see that is in trouble, when it comes to a mission, friendly stroll in Sector Space, or some casual talk. I think every newcomer into the STO Universe, should remember one thing, Never give up.\n\nWhat you see there, was something I learned when ranking up within STO. If you need any help, low level or not, you can always message me In-Game(If online), or send me a Friend Request through Steam, message me and I will get back to you ASAP. I really care to help out newcomers into the STO Universe, it's a really fun and addicting game. So just download the game, and come on and join us!","April 6, 2014","true","458.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, recently I downloaded the game again and found it to be absolutely amazing. Not too difficult, yet still challenging. Great storylines, and engaging missions. It took me until I reached Captain to fully understand the intricacies of the game, but now I've got it, I'm loving it! I've put in ~60 hours of game play and I haven't spent a penny.\n\nIn summary, for a free game, even if it was a paid game, it's a great one to have. Hours of fun, prepare to become addicted.

It tends to lose itself in the background noise of every other MMO around. It does nothing really special, but it is fun to try to design your own ship and uniforms, and pick your own crew. The only real criticism of this game is the same that I have of every MMO: you are not unique. You have the same gear, access to the same missions, and are captain of a starship just like every other player. Areas around planets and space stations are clogged with dozens of starships, all captained by players. I feel this is evidence of a systemic assumption in MMO design, that players don't want to work for anything. I feel it would have been far more compelling if they required you to work up to being a captian with your own ship.\nFrom a technical standpoint, I have constant issues with the servers being down. I often get significant lag followed by the termination of my connection and (when I try to log back on) the server is down. This is not an occasional thing. Just about every time I sit down to play. I'm pretty positive this is not an issue on my end, as I don't encounter this problem anywhere else. As a result, I've not been able to play this game as much as I'd like.\nOver all, I think it has some value in the idea that you get to see a lot of cool Star Trek stuff. And, if played for free, this can be worth while (and the reason for my recommendation). But I wouldn't pay for a rather bland game with so many server issues.","April 7, 2015","true","21.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would say about 7/10.\n\nFirst, as a Trek fan I enjoy that it continues the story of the Prime universe, and that there are tons of call backs, references, and even cameos.\n\nNow, when I started, I admittedly felt like the controls were a tad awkward, but once I got used to them. I've found that that's all I really needed: to get used to them.\n\nThe space combat is highly reminicent of what's seen in the shows/movies, even including attacks/abilities that can be traced to commands given by the various captains across the generations.\n\nThe ground combat/missions could be better, but I personally find them tolerable.\n\nThe graphics are good, but not fantastic, and it tells a good story overall.\n\nAlso, if you love the ability to customize virtually everything(no, that's not an exageration), you'll get a kick out of this game. You can customize your outfits, your ships(with some restrictions based ship's class/type etc), alter your bridge officers, and even create your own species.\n\nThe crafting system is a bit tedious, and materials are hard to come by, but it's not horrible.\n\nNow, if I had to name my biggest issue with this game, its the same as most MMOs: the microtransactions. By using real money to by 'Zen'(100 Zen = $1), you can unlock a lot of stuff, but some of it is kinda petty and/or overpriced. For example if you want to get a new ship past level 50(that's appropriate to your level), you better be willing to pay out $25 PER SHIP. Granted,, there are other ways to secure new level appropriate ships, but most are geared for LV 50, and require grinding for special currencies to aquire.\n\nAlso, I have to say I've notice the community tends to be a bit juvenile.  Even though there do appear to be some more mature people among the community, by and large I would recommend just soloing unless you really need help.\n\nSo, overall the gameplay is enjoyable and good for Trek fans, plus it also has some good storytelling and decent graphics. But, the petty money stuff and largely immature community are a bit offputting.\n\nIf you are a Trek fan, or just love MMOs with lots of customization and decent story, check it out, and enjoy some nostalgia.\n\nIf you aren't a Trek fan, can't stand stupid players, or hate microtransactions...feel free to give it a try, but it may not be for you.","April 6, 2015","true","237.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Can sometimes be a little repetitive at times but that rarely takes away from the fun. From the creative story mode to the awesome end game STF missions, there is a little something for all Trek fans. Well except J.J. Trek fans as this game's story is a continuation of the "Prime" Star Trek universe, meaning the game takes place in same timeline as all the T.V. Shows and 10 of the movies. (The story takes place in 2409 about 30 years after Nemesis.)\n\nFederation, Klingons, and Romulans are the playable factions and while on the surface they play similar; there are more than enough differences to make each faction unique and make you want to try each one at least once.\n\nThis game has microtransactions that include ships, uniforms, sevices, and extra characters but in all honesty; you can play the entire game and have a blast and never spend a penny. Also, it is possible through farming and grinding to purchase anything from the ingame store without spending real money. The entire game is available if you want to work for it and since the game is so much fun; it never really feels like work.\n\nAll in all if you are a fan of Star Trek you should give this game a try. It's F2P so there is nothing to lose but everything to gain. RPG and Science Fiction fans will also get many hours of enjoyment out of this game.","April 8, 2014","true","957.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ypou start by creating your character, You can choose between Federation, Klingon Empire or Romulan Empire... I picked Starfleet of course!\n\nUpon creating your character I was expecting your normal 6 races that were peoples most favs but I soon learned that you could go as far as being Andorian and even a Trill(Joined or not) BUT it does not stop there, They have also included the tools to create your own Alien Race complete with special abilities custom looks and the lot. Imagine Spore Creature Creator in an MMO!\n\nThe Tutorial began and I was celebrating graduation from starfleet Academy which for me was a real shame because I would liked to have spent some more time and perhaps even my first 10 levels just learning about the game and the Star Trek Universe. I mean would you take up the chance to do a class on Warp Engineering?\n\nThis is where the excittment stopped for me, There is ground combat but I refuse to even Awknowledge that part of the game as its severly lacking in every possible way. (I remember one time I was being chased around a tree by a Klingon... all my friends just stood and laughed at me)\n\nSpace battles are extremely intense and provide a great bit of stress relief though I felt there could have been a little more.\n\nSUGGESTION: Not something I can really complaoin about but I'm going to rant and suggest it here... this is Star Trek and there is no ability to command your ship from the captains chair... I want to be able to walk around my ship issuing commands to my crew, not steering and fighting in 3rd person from outside the ship!\n\n\nNow that is all I can say but would like to also note it is a Theme Park MMO and I find these rather boring so this is not one I have played a lot of but it is one that has earnt itself a spot on my shelf and it will remain there defiantly.","February 1, 2012","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Same damn game, less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\n\nI do not recommend this title AT ALL.  Trolls run free through the game, harassing roleplayers AND taking fleets (imagine a guild where you have to spend thousands of man-hours building the guild's home) from the other players.  Beside that, Cryptic, the original owner, were bought out by perfect world.  Items which were originally affordable through the dilithium-FreemiumBucks exchange are no longer, so it's impossible to get any new clothing that has come out since launch for free.  Most new, pretty ships are horribly over priced.  Don't ever expect to get the best stuff in this game.\n\nNext, the gameplay.  Gawd the gameplay.  Imagine, if you will, a Star Trek.. that has nothing to do with Star Trek.  We're not talking 2009 the video game here!  I mean this game has nothing to do with star trek 9/10ths the time.  If I weren't green, I'd think I was in a totally different game.  Which is forgivable.  That's immersion in other games.  Not here.  Here, the gameplay itself isn't even remotely complimentary to the license.\n\nYou get your choice of Science, Tatical, or Engineering officer.  Coolio.  That's fine.  The difference is the powers you can use in the space combat and in the awayteams.  Tatical gets some team buffs for DPS, engineer can create items out of thinair, and science has some stuff such as stasis fields.  That's cool, right?  Nope.  None of that actually solves anything.  You still have to kill the targets to move on.  No diplomacy, no alternate route, you have to murder the NPCs to move on.\n\nOkay, lets move on to out of combat stuff.  WHAT OUT OF COMBAT STUFF?  You'd think you'd get a minigame that's like "Oh, reallign these chips and then order some members of your crew to replace some plating that got blown off."  Nope.  None of that.  Anytime you get to do anything REMOTELY tech related, it's part of a dialogue tree.\n\nDialogue tree?  That's a bit of a lie.  The story is linear and there's no way to affect a battle.  There's no talking your way out of any combat, unlike SWTOR in which you can occassionally choose whether to fight someone or not.\n\n\nSTO story missions:\n-We have received a transmission from deep ♥♥♥♥face space, and are sending you on a mission to one of their important worlds to do some ♥♥♥♥.\n-OH LAWD ITS A ♥♥♥♥FACE AMBUSH!!\n*3 tiny raiders against your dreadnaught*\n-Ready to beam you down captain, along with the top officers of your crew because we're stupid as hell\n-Woooosh\n-Eyy lmao, we'd love to help but there's too many ♥♥♥♥faces here and they'll ♥♥♥♥ our faces if we help starfleet!\n-♥♥♥♥FACE GROUND AMBUSH\n-Ay thnx.\n-Captain!  ♥♥♥♥faces have warped in!  Prepared to beam you up instead of turning on shields and handling it ourselves because we sent down all the competent crew with you!\n-GO TO RED ALERT!\n-Woooosh\n-*one cruiser ambush*\n-That'll not be the last ♥♥♥♥face we see.\n-Hail starfleet\n-Hai, I'm either Quinn or doing his job for him.  here's your leveeelll~\n\nThis is 95% of the starfleet mission in STO.\n\nImagine if in Skyrim, the only time you could use your dragon shouts is when a dialogue tree with a npc found it useful.\n*insert picture of a pesant with "FUS-ROH-DAH" as one of the dialouge options*\n\nSame goes for nerve pinch.  It disables a npc for 10 seconds in combat, then they recover and continue fighting.  Meaning it does jack ****.  Okay!  Well, when it's important to the story, then?  Once.  There is only one time in the entire game where you can use nerve pinch as a solution to a dialogue tree's problem.  Orion's seduce ability?  Same.  Except this time, it can never be used, because the npc you could nerve pinch before IS A FEMALE HUMAN.  The KDF equivelant to nerve pinch does nothing at anytime.  In combat, it's an ability that can make the target attack it's friend for 10 seconds.  But the target is always SO WEAK that it doesn't matter.\n\nWhat can you do in space then?  Not a damn thing.  Ship combat is as involving as Star Trek DAC.  It's dull and colourful.  Imagine if star trek was just watching a ship shoot at a cube for a hour while the synthesised computer voice says "RED ALERT" every few minutes..  That's what this game is based on, not any star trek I know of.\n\nImagine if you took the storytelling from The Old Republic, slapped World of Tank's pay to win on it, then added TF2's hat system for cosmetics.  That's what you get in this disfunctional mess.  Why do I play it then?  'Cause my friends do, and it's one of the last MMOs where I feel comfortable socializing.  Not many MMOs I've played in recent years HAVE hubs designed just for socializing.\n\n\nIt gets woooooooooorse thooooough.\n\n\nThe grind.  Oh gawd the grind.  It's coming for me.\n\nThe grind is horrible in STO right now.  There is 170 levels, though you will basically max out after 120.  When you reach level 50, the game calls it "enggame" and your levels take 10 times longer.\n\nLevel 1-50 took me 3 days to do.  50-60?  I still haven't had the patience to do it on one character.\n\n\n\nEdit: I came back to try out the admirality system.  In it, the ships your characters have can be sent out on missions.  Theoretically, this would be a fun way to get items while using your old ships.  Only problem is these ships take forever to get out of "maintence" once you're done using them.  So you'll complete two missions, then have to wait 8 hours before you can do more.\n\nUnless you bought ships ONLY for the admirality system...\n\n\nAll in all, a sad result for a game that could have become something cool.","February 6, 2014","false","668.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You unlock a new ship every 10 levels, and new ships are occasionally available for free during event missions.

The endgame isn't lacking in PvE, as of this writing there is a battlegrounds area for ground combat, and plenty of task force missions for space combat.\n\nIn summary, the game is worth taking a shot at, even if you aren't a diehard trek fan.","July 7, 2014","true","127.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First they send you on a stupid quest to exact some justice on some lame fool who did something bad (insert short mission story line here), and when you finally get the guy and retrieve the spoils of battle from his cold dead corpse you have to run for days back to the quest giver to turn the mission in. So, for over an hour of gameplay you actually only played the game for maybe 5 minutes.  Not the case with Star Trek Online.\n\nIn this space faring MMO you are the captain of your ship. You get to go out and have adventures and all that of a regular MMO with the flare of Star Trek. Along the way you can meet some characters from the shows. All that is to be expected. What was surprising was they way can get your quests.\n\nLike most MMOs you can walk up to a quest-giver and talk to them and they will give you the quest. In Star Trek Online you have the option of Calling them from your ship and selecting the mission from the list of available missions. It's almost as if the creators knew that you'd be a long, long way out in the middle of nowhere and wouldn't want to continually run back to to them just to turn in a quest. It is Star Trek, after all, why not just put them up on the main screen, Number One, and we can get on with our mission?\n\nOverall the graphics are basic for what systems can pull these days, and the voice acting in ok. The gameplay is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥me so you quest a lot. If you are a fan of Star Trek like me then you can forgive the game a lot and play for fun. At the sweet price of free, you don't even really need to be a fan to try it and see if space adventuring is right for you. Just keep in mind, if you are looking for the next blockbuster MMO to scale the mountain and dares all to knock them off of it, you're looking in the wrong place. This game is made for fun not necessarily to dazzle or impress you.","June 21, 2014","true","70.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sarcastic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/docsarcastic/","359 products in account","Personal Rating: 6/10\n\nI've yet to play more of this game and I'm definately looking forward to it. While it is missing some essential characters such as Kirk or Spock, the impeccable voice acting and character emotion is amazing. Naturally, like all MMORPG's there is a lot of collecting x amount of y monster. But it doesn't feel overdone or underdone in this game. I'm not a Star Trek fan but I'm enjoying it! The combat is fluent and the dialogue is near-perfect.\n\nHowever, there are only two things wrong, small things, but non the less they are essential. The frist point being my character has no voice and for such a star studded audio presentation it deterierates into laughable situations where it's a very serious moment, everybody panicing and there's me, stood there, emotionless and voiceless.\n\nMy second and final complaint it the ship. I hate controlling the ship, it just feels clunky and I can never get it to the right speed.\n\nBut other than that it's a thoroughly enjoyable game (so far) and I'm looking forward to playing more of it. Unfortunate lack of Simon Pegg though.","February 23, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though it suffered from a difficult start and bumps along the way, the game has continued to evolve and grow. The PvE aspect of the game has become expansive and can seem a bit overwhelming at times for new players. With so many systems integrated over the years from Duty officer missions and abilities, Reputations systems, countless gearsets/combinations, greatly improved crafting system finally in place, and of course the missions both official and player created, the game feels mostly complete and whole finally. Like any MMO it will continue to evolve and not always in a direction everyone will be happy with. That said the Development team generally gets it right. The free to play aspect is among the best I have encountered in all my thirty years as a gamer and the last ten or so with my encounters with free to play models. There are items a player would need to purchase for endgame such as ship upgrade tokens, fleet modules, and a removal of the energy credit cap. All items mentioned can be purchased with either cashy money or in game dillithium converted to game currency through the dillithium exchange.\n\nNow for the bad. The PvP is woefully lacking in improvement and attention since launch. While it can be entertaining the public qeues are so one sided and have been since a few months after launch. Abilities are often unblanaced to a fault. Often you are stuck with either the cookie cutter flavor of the month builds, abilites, Duty officer combinations. Even if you have a great build you can expect to lose unless you have a mostly coordinated team all geared and built to provide the DPS and support needed to win. I would not recommend PvP to any new player without first consulting with a PvP group in game sadly.\n\nAs for the bad part of the PvE side, The Special task Force missions and Advanced Qeues have become a DPS race. You need to participate in advanced Qeues to get items needed for reputation gear. Often if you need reputation gear you are not in a position to contribute much to the team. another. Another issues is the complete lack of need for the Enginner and Science professions in game. In space missions and PvP they are vastly less valuable than a Tactical captain because they cannot produce the same kind of DPS. Having had thirty eight Max level characters before Delta Rising and Six after fully geared and tested to a minimum of 15k DPS and some to as high as 35k (Good but far from great measured by the Infected Space Advanced Standard) and often coordinating for PvP and having written a few of the build guides over the years I feel qualified to say this. It is just the nature of the game for now and may change with balancing as time goes on. On a final note for the PvE is a lack of attention to some bugs, though not game breaking, they can be irritating.\n\nAll that said if you are still here I completely recommend this game. The good vastly outweighs the bad and I will continue to play so long as this is true. See you out there.","March 20, 2012","true","829.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rosstrimboli/recommended/9900/","rosstrimboli","Trimaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rosstrimboli/","568 products in account","I joined this game only after it transition to the Free-to-play model and am basing this review off of that experience, and is a well above average concept for a free-to-play MMO. With a high production value, quite remarkable music score and high quality dialogue for what little dialogue there is the game feels quite polished to date. For the Starship junkie such as myself, the ships look detailed and true to canon. The main quest is gripping and enjoyable, it makes levelling a breeze with a good balance of investment and reward as your character levels.\n\nIn contrast to other free-to-play MMO’s, the micro-transactions in this game are kept to a minimum; most purchases made from the Cash shop are entirely cosmetic, which have little to no impact on game-play, and are not necessary in the progression of your character. In addition to that, the in-game currency Dilithium can be converted to large sums of cash shop credit, offering economical alternatives for those that don’t wish to outlay any cash, but spend vast amounts of time playing.\n\nSpace combat is one of its strengths, you will have direct control over your ship and its stations with everything laid-out in front of you. Basic Starship operation and commands are very intuitive with control tight and concise. Yet, ground combat is another story. On the ground, your skills are vastly different from that in space, how effective your combat will be will be dependent on the your chosen away team, with the focus on movement, your equipment and environmental hazards, as well as the groups of varying enemies. Coupled with the rather basic RPG style of button mashing to complete your attach, ground missions will wear out their welcome sooner rather than later.\n\nSpace exploration itself is somewhat of a disappointment, for an open-world title, the experience you’ll have amongst the different sectors and its planets are at best, predictable and simple. Most missions comprise of destroying ships or scanning structures. While the strong story arc helps break the monotony and generally tie pieces together, most of the open-world encounters have little to no plot or reward for your time invested.\n\nIn comparison to other MMO’s, the amount of content can be scarce, once you have reached your characters level cap and completed the official episodes you will have very little to do, especially if you’re the one to play solo. Playing with a friend or joining a guild will be highly recommended to break the monotony of grinding and the entertainment flowing. While all MMO’s have their fair share of grinding, the problem here is the lack of variety on what to grind at.\n\nFor a free-to-play MMO, this game does stand-out amongst the rest. It’s well-polished, true to Star Trek lore and canon and an enjoyable experience within a group, and on the plus side, you get to be a Star Ship Captain. As a relatively high-quality product, it’s the community that will once again let it down. Every on-line game has its fair share of elitists and career orientated players that often need to stop and brush the Dorito crumbs from their neck-beards every once in a while and thankfully the community can be filtered out.","May 19, 2014","true","28.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But there was something about STO that i just love, the fact you can basically play the entire game without spending a penny [and this doesnt mean you have to spend hours and hours grinding on mulitple characters] As i am a fairly new player to a game thats been out for over 2-3 years it meant i could jion a fleet that had experience, helpful players. I love the game, by far one of my favourites, since getting i got the 1 month Gold sub, as this unlocks many things but then most stay open if you go back to silver [f2p] ive bought some of the ZEN [which is paid with real world money] as i fancied a new ship and as i enjoyed the game so much without spending a penny i thought £20 to have a 1 month GOLD account and then enough ZEN to buy a special ship was worht it. Theres so much to do, and it gets updated regularly, and at certain times of the year they have events where you can get free ships, costumes etc.","July 3, 2014","true","753.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

PU-LENTY of starship combat, which is why this is the primary i play. random starship combat means if i want to go fight, i fly there.  in the other races, i cannot enter the same combat area's, EXCEPT the main "starbase que" areas (one or 2 per sector), thereby reducing my starship time.\n\nklingon campaign is a bit more linear than feds, a bit more fun, but little extra ship combat.  the storyline is easier to follow than feds.  i havent found any missions that are downright annoying yet on the klingons.\n\nromulan campaign is linear, levels are pretty easy, but you have to finish one piece for the next piece. no random combat in space (yet atleast - very linear) (a bit of a bummer), but its nice and everything makes it feel like a good story.  i think this may be the easiest to go up, as i did so faster than klingons, and much faster than feds (who i think take the longest).\n\noverall i do like playing, but, i would prefer to not have feet touch the ground, and stay in my ship.\n\nfed starts w reliant, then you can choose from there\nklingon starts w ship KINDA, i dont want to spoil it.\nromulan doesnt START with a ship, but you get one within a few levels.","January 17, 2014","true","205.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rosstrimboli/recommended/9900/","rosstrimboli","Trimaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rosstrimboli/","568 products in account","I joined this game only after it transition to the Free-to-play model and am basing this review off of that experience, and is a well above average concept for a free-to-play MMO. With a high production value, quite remarkable music score and high quality dialogue for what little dialogue there is the game feels quite polished to date. For the Starship junkie such as myself, the ships look detailed and true to canon. The main quest is gripping and enjoyable, it makes levelling a breeze with a good balance of investment and reward as your character levels.\n\nIn contrast to other free-to-play MMO’s, the micro-transactions in this game are kept to a minimum; most purchases made from the Cash shop are entirely cosmetic, which have little to no impact on game-play, and are not necessary in the progression of your character. In addition to that, the in-game currency Dilithium can be converted to large sums of cash shop credit, offering economical alternatives for those that don’t wish to outlay any cash, but spend vast amounts of time playing.\n\nSpace combat is one of its strengths, you will have direct control over your ship and its stations with everything laid-out in front of you. Basic Starship operation and commands are very intuitive with control tight and concise. Yet, ground combat is another story. On the ground, your skills are vastly different from that in space, how effective your combat will be will be dependent on the your chosen away team, with the focus on movement, your equipment and environmental hazards, as well as the groups of varying enemies. Coupled with the rather basic RPG style of button mashing to complete your attach, ground missions will wear out their welcome sooner rather than later.\n\nSpace exploration itself is somewhat of a disappointment, for an open-world title, the experience you’ll have amongst the different sectors and its planets are at best, predictable and simple. Most missions comprise of destroying ships or scanning structures. While the strong story arc helps break the monotony and generally tie pieces together, most of the open-world encounters have little to no plot or reward for your time invested.\n\nIn comparison to other MMO’s, the amount of content can be scarce, once you have reached your characters level cap and completed the official episodes you will have very little to do, especially if you’re the one to play solo. Playing with a friend or joining a guild will be highly recommended to break the monotony of grinding and the entertainment flowing. While all MMO’s have their fair share of grinding, the problem here is the lack of variety on what to grind at.\n\nFor a free-to-play MMO, this game does stand-out amongst the rest. It’s well-polished, true to Star Trek lore and canon and an enjoyable experience within a group, and on the plus side, you get to be a Star Ship Captain. As a relatively high-quality product, it’s the community that will once again let it down. Every on-line game has its fair share of elitists and career orientated players that often need to stop and brush the Dorito crumbs from their neck-beards every once in a while and thankfully the community can be filtered out.","May 19, 2014","true","28.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It was awesome to fly these awesome spaceships I grew up watching and walking around on all these different planets and such then.....the newness wore off as you can pretty much make lvl 1-50 1 lvl a mission and you can only replay so many times before it just gets boring. There is alot to do when you first reach max lvl(which is 60 but will take you longer to make 50-60 then 1-50) you have the PvE missions for marks to advance thru your rep systems and crafting and patrols but again after awhile of the same thing every day it gets old I guess but prior to this in Nov of last year I said what the hell and dropped a huge chunk of change to go lifetime as I was liking the game so much and had invested real money for ships and whatnot so it was all good....then.....Delta Rising came out and suddenly everthing was different, they revamped main mobs to make it really hard in the PvE missions to win without dying 30 times which is ok to a point but then people started leaving....and more people....and do not let cryptic fool you STO does not have one of the largest up and coming player bases just the opposite. So, both my fleets (fed and kdf) both crumbled as mass people left the game due to unstabilities, bugs and the fact that it seems the devs are not concerned with fixing the current issues instead, they pump item after item into the zen marketplace (real money) trying to bleed people dry. If you plan to just play here and there and love the sto world then I say go for it but do not look forward to investing your time to make it your primary game however, to each thier own and you like others may not agree with this review and thats cool. Overall, STO is not a wothless game and with over 2k hours I can say I have enjoyed the hell out of it till late and hope that cryptic changes their ways before its too late because I would love to see this game regain its former glory!\n\nSPACE COMBAT: The ships are nice to look at though the fed ships tend to all sort of look the same they are awesome to look at with the renderscale turned up. Combat is functional and easy to pick up using main attacks combined with abilities aquired by different bridge officers. One of the recent changes I do like alot was the ability to train a bridge officer with all the skills they are able to learn and change them on the fly rather than having to have multiple officers with different skills. each shi[ has 4 sided shields guarding its hull unlike eve and whatnot with a single shield that drains from all damage no matter the facing. Groups on the Federation side are still relitivly easy to get for PvE mark missions. I do like how you can go to the bridge of  your ship and look around and on most fed ships can go to the different decks and such.\n\n[u]GROUND COMBAT[/u]: Here I feel there is alot to be improved as you fight either in 3rd person targeting each target manually or you can go to FPS mode by pressing B allowing you to aim and get more involved. there is quite alot of different gear you can equip giving you different abilities and skills. I do feel that there is somthing missing from combat here and it feels kind of rough in fights. There is a battlezone where after 50 I think you can go and fight dino's with lasers and the ability to call down orbital strikes lol but they are fun to fight.\n\n[u]OVERALL[/u]:[b] Until the devs step up and fix some issues and start listening to us the players I can not recomend this game at this time[/b] . Try this game out if you dont plan on spending any money or dont plan on it bieng a primary game, if you are a trekkie you will prolly have some fun at least going and reading the planet lore for system to system : ) . Hope this helped somewhat and hope you have a great day even if you decide not to play!","April 3, 2015","false","611.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Their endgame ships have Countless abilities that can overwelm some people but in the right hands they can be amazing, Being The Head admiral with a Romulan Scimitar Dreadnaught Thats nearly unkillable i can say that it worked out well for me.The only negative Aspect of this game is how repetitive it gets especially at end game where all you do is try to grind marks for the advanced reputation end gear.\n---------Clans/Fleets--------- As for clans theres alot of things you can do clan wise which are known as fleets in this game\nFleets are unique in that they have their own Starbase that Players can Contribute to in order for the base to grow.Having multiple Fleet Projects that can upgrade the base in generall and give access to New Gear /Assigments and Income being dilithium Ore,their endgame gear is Extremely powerful and can overshadow some Mark gear if built Correctly.\n---------Crafting---------In one of the recent updates a Crafting system was added to the game which allows you to make almost anything you need if you have the materials for it.This is generally usefull if you want to make Ingame currency and generally make your self better.\n--------Economics--------Theres 3 Main currency types are EC/Dilithium/Zen Secondary are Fleet Credits\nEC is the standard ingame currency thats used for most of the Ingame commerce and Exchange\nDilithium is the Currency thats rewarded for daily activities.It can also be mined through Daily events as well.This is the Currency that can be traded for Premium Currency which is Zen and can be used to obtain the high end fleet gear combined with Fleet Credits.\nZen is the Premium paystore currency that will buy you most of the Ship/items you see in the store it can also be exchanged for massive amounts of Dilithium.\nFleet Credits are what you get for Contributing to Fleet Projects and is what you want if you want the High end fleet Gear and Equipment.\n----------Paystore----------The paystore is huge and you will need to pay to get rid of the ingame money limit but thats in every MMO nowadays especially F2P.Most of the best ships ingame can be bought through microtransactions and i know this may seem ugly to some but they need to make money somehow in order to keep making Revenue and running their game, it being attached to the most sucessful show in history this is not suprising on how expensive most things are.The Extremely Unique ships I guess you could say "Supporter" ships can be Expensive Some totaling in around 160$ USD to get and this is from combined Lobi crystals from opened lockboxes.Some of these ships have amazing abilities though but ill leave that to you to decide.The normal Endgame ships id say go for about 20$ usd however the higher endgame ships can go for about 30$ each,most of them being the Tier 6 Ships.Some of these can be worth it with Some of the abilities they have but ill leave that to you to decide.\n-------------Pros/Cons-------------==Pros== Tons of stuff to do\nBoth space and ground combat\nClan/Fleet Progression\nSome Voice acting\nEntertaining combat\nTons of story missions\nStar trek lore Everywhere\nGreat character customization\nDecent enough leveling\nGood and helpful community in General\nSome endgame Reputations Are easy to grind\nCan run on almost any PC with as low as 2-4 GB of ram==Cons(For some)==\nVery large paystore\nSome bugs here and there\nChanging UI:Every few updates somthing new gets added that makes the UI alot more Complicated for some people.\nEndgame Reputation Grind is painful for some reputations====Extreme Cons/Warnings====  Spammers: Shady Third Party Spammers,Every so often you will see someone in chat advertising about some website and in some cases even Adding/Spamming/Removing you from their Friends list in order to promote these websites that sell cheap ingame goods at prices that are Heavly Reduced such as Lockbox keys and Founder/Lobi ships.All of these websites are Run by identity theves that just want your Personal info And/Or Account so just ignore them\nSo just take the high route and just ignore them and report them if you do encounter them. ( not like it will do much anyway but still do it  ).\nTLOverall id say this is a Game worth playing even if you arent a Star trek fan its worth giving it a try.and in some cases paying.","October 4, 2015","true","398.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Back then it was like a hollow shell, filled with boring things to do, not many cool things and mostly it was just kind of bland. Now, however, they've totally revamped the game it's no longer what it used to be. It's fun, engaging, exciting and for us Trekkies (LLAP!   \\//,) it's become the game we all wanted it to be. I highly recommend it for any Sci-fi fan, Trekkie, MMORPG'er or mixed FPS/3rd Person style gamer, it doesnt play like any other game I've played. It has an incredibly versatile battle system for fighting in space and on the ground. They've bulked it up with exsquisitely created fan mods which are stories you can playthrough...basically player created DLC. They've added all kinds of new types of missions: diplomatic, space missions, research missions, ground missions of all sorts, away team missions and lots of sweet new gear to boot. The characters themselves look the best they've ever looked; when I first began playing I was very disappointed in the way they looked, they were all sort of the same looking. Now, the characters have tight gear and outfits that are totally unique (assuming you have some epic stuff to equip and in some cases, even if you don't!).\n\nAs you continue to level up, you just look cooler and cooler. The ships are sick as well and since you can choose 3 separate factions (Klingon, Romulan, Fedreration) then you have a choice of some sweet Romulan ships (which are all epic thanks to their singularity warp drive ftw) or if you want a cool Klingon Bird-of-Prey or a classic (or newer!) Federation ship (also, any race can play any faction). The weapons have become more and more epic over the years just like everything else in STO. 100% Worth a shot, if you've been uncertain about whether or not to go for it, now would be the time.

You have away missions on both ships and planets. You can explore the inside of your ship real time and interact with all department heads in each area plus your bridge crew. All ships are fully customizable from interiors to exterior colors. You get a free ship choice on each Rank level you make.\n\nAll in all I am saying a good game and you really can accomplish a lot with the total free play. But I have to admit there are a few aspects that you might want to put a dime or two into it like for the lock box keys and increaseing your inventory size because you can loose some stuff once it is full and you forget to sell what you do not want.\n\nYou can play dobble, drink at bars, interact with people on planets and many star systems to explore. And missions are easy to find and get tossed at you often.\n\nAll I can say is try it out for free see how you like it and then go from there.","August 11, 2014","true","420.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There are LOTS of missions to go around and they are fine to level you up to the highest levels. Once you reach those levels, there are STILL more missions to go around. Lol.\n\nGround AND space combat. <3\n\nLots of customization options for character and starship appearance and equipment.\nAll the customization options yield a variety of different playstyles, so there are lots of things to try.\n\nCo-op play is actually beneficial, and there are events in missions that only specific classes (tactical, engineering, or science) can do. If you have a buddy who plays a different class, then you can take advantage of more events than you would playing alone.\n\nWHAT I DISLIKE\nPaying into the game definitely yields an advantage, especially in PvP. However, for the most part, it SEEMS that free players can still acquire the fancy combat equipment and what not by putting more time and effort into the game. There are aesthetic elements that can be acquired only with Zen (the currency you get by buying with real monies), but they don't really affect the outcome of battles; they're just for looks.\n\nPvP can get really annoying with hardcore players who have MUCH better equipment than newer players, and who will not relent, thereby spoiling the experience for others.\n\nAfter a while, it can get repetitive. The vast majority of missions involve space combat, ground combat, then space combat, travel to a different system, and have more space combat.\n\nOverall, I like it, but wouldn't pay for it.","December 6, 2014","true","369.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

It's heaven for theorycrafters. Every so often however, Cryptic might release a new skill or item that makes one type of build the flavour of the month and in one case it can shadow all other builds, which are left in the dust.\n\nThat's always the risk in a game where every class can access virtually every skill.\n\nThe game merges two types of gameplays, the ground combat and the space combat. They work and feel different and you are able to concentrate only on one if you don't like the other. While levelling you might need to do a little bit of both, so depending on your tastes it might be either welcome variety or a minor annoyance, until you get to end game and are completely able to pick what kind of content you want to play.\n\nThe ability to walk around your ship and starbases also allows plenty of opportunities for RP if you are into that. Talking of which the character costumisation in this game is on par with games such as Aion, if not better. The graphic style is not Asian, but when you can pick things like the length of your fingers, you know you can do almost anything.\n\nThe game isn't necessarily pay to win, although items from the Zen store do have their advantages. If you have the time to grind, you can exchange in game currency for Zen (which you can buy with real cash) but the process is considerably slower.\n\nOverall Star Trek Online is an underrated game which has kept me busy for way more hours than most other MMOs I have played. In fact only one other MMO managed to beat it.","July 26, 2014","true","184.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Not going to lie...I'm a bit of a geek when it comes to Star Trek.  This MMO continues to surprise me. Namely, I started playing it when it first launched (and it was a subscription based MMO). Cryptic did a good job, but to be honest, they launched it too early, and it felt like it was halfway done.  The Federation side had a good amount of content, but the Klingon faction, did not.  So after playing it for about a year, I took a break from it (a year plus break).  Coming back to it after so long, even after it went F2P and Cryptic was bought by Perfect World Entertainment, I must say, Cryptic has done an excellent job in expanding the universe.  Not only did they launch a third faction, the Romulans, they also fully fleshed out the Klingon faction.  They also updated the trait system, kit system, and R&D system, while continuing to create Featured Episodes.  That, along with a more robust Foundry (a system that let's the community create playable missions to share), I must say, I've gotten hooked on this game once again.","August 12, 2014","true","245.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It has an ever growing end game,  regular free content drops,  regular free item giveaways and special events open to ALL players not just subs or spenders,  the game itself is free with /THE/ best free to play model i have EVER seen.  The ever expanding story is good and you feel like you are a captain shaping the fate of your galaxy. The leveling process is quick and painless allowing you to focus on a good endgame featuring queued missions,  a newly revamped crafting system,  duty officer missions (a game within a game where you send your crew out to perform tasks on timed away missions,  they can suceed,  fail,  become injured,  die! Better duty officers provide special bonuses that improve your space or ground game by slotting them)  a newly revamped character trait system with meaningful and very well balanced traits to give to your captain that make very noticible changes in their abilities or give them whole new abilities!\n\nThis game is highly recomended for anyone that enjoys start trek..

After Delta Rising, there was a simultaneous heavy double-nerf where raids and queues were increased in difficulty by large measures, while simultaneously slashing queue rewards.\n\nThe grind, especially after level 50 just to get decent equipment is huge and extreme and the rewards underwhelming.  Pair this with the fact Cryptic and PWE aren't able to clearly communicate even basic information to the user makes for a very frustrating experience for new users or users that expect basic competence from a development entity.\n\nThe game is slowly dying, Delta Rising itself has seen a pretty big downturn in users, and most of the late game mission queues are never populated as they are too difficult to complete for the rewards.\n\nIf you jump in, don't spend a dime on the game.  You are probably better off finding a new MMO with a more stable technology base.\n\nThe fact I had to write a non-recommend for this game makes me sad.

You don't need to actually use the said ship to use the trait, all you need is to buy it, then "level" the ship(which is quite fast if go somewhere where you can destroy many ships).\n3 - Every new ship can use one of the specializations(atm there are intelligence(incredibly strong), command and pilot), the old ones can't, and cryptic made it clear they never will be capable of using it, in other words if you're using old ships, you're locked out of new game content, isn't it amazing?\n\nNow for that exception, there is a ship called the scimitar, which is by far the best ship in the game due to the sheer amount of damage you can dish with it(which is kinda fair, since it was OP in the movies too), but make no mistake, cryptic has made it clear they intent on releasing every old iconic ship as a tier 6 version, so you can re-buy everything again(isn't it nice?), so its a matter of time till they re-release the scimitar.\n\nCryptic also added "crafting" which is basically RNG-based gambling so you can get a weapon with the mods you wish, you also need to use it if you want take your weapon to highest tier, which is VERY costly, even more so if you're trying to get them to increase in rarity(unless you happen to be a bored billionaire from dubai or something, don't try to increase rarity, its stupid).\n\nSo to summarize, cryptic took a game with a booming population, which had a very casual, forgiving and fun playstyle, and turned into a boring grindfest, outright lied to the playerbase, and refuse to fix it, even though the population continues to drop as a direct result of said changes. Cryptic has been trying desperately to reverse this by doing everything BUT reversing/improving on what they did, its not working and it will not work, because in the end, the game is still boring.\n\nMy recommendation? stay the hell away from this thing, if you insist on playing this trainwreck, be a romulan tactical captain aligned with the klingons, get a scimitar and the 1000 zen nausicaan ship of the klingon side, it will give you the best console in the game, the plasmonic leech, you don't need anything else.\n\nI'll change this review if cryptic fixes those issues... which i seriously doubt will happen.","June 1, 2015","false","177.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

You don't need to actually use the said ship to use the trait, all you need is to buy it, then "level" the ship(which is quite fast if go somewhere where you can destroy many ships).\n3 - Every new ship can use one of the specializations(atm there are intelligence(incredibly strong), command and pilot), the old ones can't, and cryptic made it clear they never will be capable of using it, in other words if you're using old ships, you're locked out of new game content, isn't it amazing?\n\nNow for that exception, there is a ship called the scimitar, which is by far the best ship in the game due to the sheer amount of damage you can dish with it(which is kinda fair, since it was OP in the movies too), but make no mistake, cryptic has made it clear they intent on releasing every old iconic ship as a tier 6 version, so you can re-buy everything again(isn't it nice?), so its a matter of time till they re-release the scimitar.\n\nCryptic also added "crafting" which is basically RNG-based gambling so you can get a weapon with the mods you wish, you also need to use it if you want take your weapon to highest tier, which is VERY costly, even more so if you're trying to get them to increase in rarity(unless you happen to be a bored billionaire from dubai or something, don't try to increase rarity, its stupid).\n\nSo to summarize, cryptic took a game with a booming population, which had a very casual, forgiving and fun playstyle, and turned into a boring grindfest, outright lied to the playerbase, and refuse to fix it, even though the population continues to drop as a direct result of said changes. Cryptic has been trying desperately to reverse this by doing everything BUT reversing/improving on what they did, its not working and it will not work, because in the end, the game is still boring.\n\nMy recommendation? stay the hell away from this thing, if you insist on playing this trainwreck, be a romulan tactical captain aligned with the klingons, get a scimitar and the 1000 zen nausicaan ship of the klingon side, it will give you the best console in the game, the plasmonic leech, you don't need anything else.\n\nI'll change this review if cryptic fixes those issues... which i seriously doubt will happen.","June 1, 2015","false","177.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

These include gameclient.exe errors, random crashes to desktop (without a report feature), crashes to desktop (which do trigger the report feature), disconnects, and memory leaks.\n\nIn the 36 hours preceding this review, my client crashed out 23 times on an Asus 673JH-A1 with up-to-date drivers, making STO one of the buggiest games I've ever encountered. (This also takes the prize from Trion's "Defiance," which gained quick post-launch notoriety for its bugs, glitches, and other game-breaking features.)\n\nCompany technical support, or lack thereof, complicates the picture. Cryptic is known by this point as "Chronic" due to their persistent inability to launch a major patch without breaking at least one major feature - leading to at least 2-5 subsequent patches to fix whatever was originally broken. Technical support is also nonexistent, meaning you're on your own for troubleshooting and support.\n\nIn short, definitely would not recommend this game.\n\nUpdate: After not playing the game for about 4 months, I reinstalled it on a whim and was promptly met by 3 crashes in an hour.

However, I think it is fair to say that I will lay down what I feel about this game in a rather fair form. For the longest time, there have not been many great attempts at recreating the Star Trek universe in a game. Some of the best Star Trek games I would argue; go back to the late 1990's and early 2000's; where Star Trek Armada, Klingon Academy, Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force and Bridge Commander were some of the best titles. Later down the road; such as the mid to late 2000's, you had some titles but none were particularly worth playing.\n\nStar Trek Online comes around, and yes: The launch was dissapointing for many who expected it to be a in-depth Bridge Commander style game; not to mention other details seem to have went missing from the game. This is partially due to the collapse of Perpetual Entertainment and the acquisition and development over to Cryptic. The game originally was a monthly fee based game; but eventually it turned Free to Play. I played it for a while years ago but have since been convinced to pick it up and see how it is.\n\nI have to say, I am quite impressed with it. The game overall makes you feel like you are in charge of a ship and you even go under the sensation of living in the shoes of a captain; the amount of things to do and the quality of the mission narratives makes the game rather interesting and not so much a typical boring MMO.\n\nPros:\n1. Free to Play system is fair. (There is purchase content, but it doesn't upset balance.)\n2. Customization galore. (Ships, uniforms, officers, loadouts, etc. Lots of cosmetic choices.)\n3. Solo friendly environment. (You don't need to be with others to succeed. You can team up; but the game doesn't require it.)\n4. Large Officer roster. (Bridge officers that can operate your ship's systems. Assign teams to go away on missions outside your ship.)\n5. Space combat mechanics. (Want to focus shield energy on a given side? Want to increase power to weapons? You are in control.)\n6. Not a grindfest game. (Want to hit the level cap? This game doesn't make you spend countless hours of your life to get to that point.)\n7. Foundry missions. (User generated missions that have their own plot and objectives. They can vary in quality; but it is player freedom.)\n8. Star Trek MMO. (Star Trek fans like this. This is totally not obvious, right?)\n9. Mission types. (Not every mission involves combat or fighting, some are simple scan or repair missions.)\n10. Mission narrative. (Some missions make you think of yourself fulfilling the role in a Star Trek episode.)\n\nCons:\n1. Player community. (It is a free to play game, so this is sort of expected. Players get too political sometimes and often immature. Sometimes it is difficult to make inquiries in chat, etc. Not everyone likes this kind of environment.)\n2. Enemy bosses. (This is more of a annoying trope than a real problem. Enemy bosses such as the "villain" type always seem to escape you.)\n3. Linear missions. (There are plenty of them that offer different solutions to a problem; but many missions don't have multiple outcomes.)\n4. Away team issues. (The away teams that you bring into combat will never try to revive you unless they are not fighting. Sometimes Away team members don't maintain unit coherency.)\n5. Some visuals. (Some planet textures on even the highest settings still look blocky and ugly.)\n6. Customer service. (The customer service is known to be on the poor side. Lack of sincerity and cooperation when issues arise in cases.)\n\nOverall, this MMO is definitely worth playing; even if you are not into Star Trek; the game itself is quite entertaining and full of things to do. There is a lot of purchase content; but it isn't required to actually succeed in playing and enjoying the game.","March 24, 2015","true","77.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This game was excellant and had great potential up until the release of Season 8: The Sphere; Legacy of Romulus was genius and I personally married it. Ever since then, their definition of "Expansion Packs" and "Seasons" has become seriously skewed and the content in these supposed major updates is the amount of a hotfix or 1/2 a season about 1.5-2 years ago.

This is the reason the game is still going, in all honesty.  Once it adopted the F2P model(largely pay-to-win, but not REQUIRED) it slowly went downhill.\n\nWithout going into too many specifics, the game is on a downhill slope that will end this game's life prematurely.  As anyone knows, MMOs thrive on "the grind" and STO is no different.  The problem is that there is no REASON for the grind in STO anymore.  There is no such thing as an endgame.  You will find yourself making more characters to do different things on and only finding there is no endgame for any of them, only an endless grind for currency which is no longer useful once you've met the current "endgame".\n\nThe game has also completely gotten rid of all exploration (a staple of Star Trek).  I love blowing things up, and that's the main reason I play but many hate that the game has also become a DPS race.  This wouldn't be an issue if all roles were DPS but they are not.  There is Science, Engineering, and Tactical.  80% of players seem to be Tactical because of the emphasis on DPS at every turn.  Science and Engineering really only exist to break up monotony of tactical captain play.  Even so, both of these classes still try to obtain high DPS(always falling short of what Tac is capable of).\n\nFaction-wise, there is the Federation, Romulans, and Klingon Empire to chose from.  Romulans and Klingons are grossly ignored in all aspects(even so, Romulan is my favorite and I even deleted my Fed character to make another).  Romulans may chose to be sided with Klinks or the Federation and enjoy a few benefits from their choice(even using there ships that are Tier 4 or lower).\n\nAnother issue is the constant nerfing of your equipment/builds at every turn.   Devs promised Tier 5 was the max (endgame ships, as you will) so they were always the goal to hit.  Get your Tier 5 ship of choice then outfit it till it can reach no higher DPS, at that point you work on piloting and such.  A few months ago Tier 6 were announced, but you can pay to upgrade your T5 ships to T5-U(almost on par with T6) for some cash(real cash).\n\nThese are just some glaring and annoying issues but the game is fun for casual play(an hour a day or so).  If you are a hardcore gamer or serious enough to want to be the best at anything you play, you will come away from the game with hundreds of hours and no satisfaction.  You will also see money disappear from your wallet somehow.\n\nTL:DR:  Fun for awhile, terrible if you want an endgame that is enjoyable.  Avoid if you always want to excel in a game or life.","February 16, 2015","false","112.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The base game is fun, and worth exploring if you are a Star Trek fan but as you progress to end game more and more of the content will be locked behind a paywal till eventually your reach a point where you will be simply inferior to someone who has dropped cash, from a little to a lot, to improve his or her ship or crew. Through the various systems in the cash shop you can directly buy power in-game.

There are bugs almost everywhere in the game. The developers don't care about fixing them. They turn a blind eye to feedback from the playerbase. On the forums topics are being locked that provide negative feedback about the game. They only focuss on filling their own wallet's. They keep adding broken content and the amount of bugs keeps getting bigger. They fix 1 bug? 10 new bugs appear to replace the one they fixed. Their hardware is crap. Everyone gets disconnected from the game every few hours due to "server not responding". Yet the developers keep saying everything is working as intended and that the problem always lies on the side of the customers.\n\nThe 5 year anniversary is the latest example of Cryptic's incompetence. The first 48 hours after the 5 year anniversary launch the game was unplayable because of the high amount of players logging into the game at the same time. What was the developer team's response? They told us to wait 2-3 days until everyone has finished patching their clients. Yet again this new content is filled with bugs and some of it isn't even playable because missions can't be completed.\n\nI have never, ever seen an MMO go downhill as badly as Star Trek Online. MMO's are supposed to be stable due to the high amount of players playing the game. But with Cryptic? With them: "everything is working as intended". I'm a big fan of Star Trek, and this game is the closest thing a Star Trek fan can have to an MMO representing the Star Trek universe. But it all gets ruined by a company that is only interested in filling their own pockets. I have endured this mess long enough.

After all, I never got that far because tech support was unable to answer a simple query concerning which domains to whitelist (other than perfectworld.com) in order to get it running on a secure system. Let's start from the beginning:\n.\nMy system is specially set up so that JavaScript, etc.,  runs correctly on my system only when served from a whitelisted domain. From any other domain it gets shut down - which is how I know that STO is served, in part, from unspecified domains other than perfectworld.com and these other domains are, consequently, not whitelisted by my security.\n.\nWhat takes the cake is that, when I asked tech support for the domain names which needed to be whitelisted for the game to work, they responded by stating that the game works for “millions” of other people - which dodged the question by employing an argument by irrelevance; a form of sophistry known as a fallacy. I have to wonder if these guys even bothered to read the support ticket I lodged (given their total failure to comprehend the problem I raised) and why they couldn't simply address my question (as opposed to addressing some purely imaginary complaint).\n.\nNow, when support techs start engaging in sophistry, it can mean that they are more interested in griefing the customers than doing their job. Moreover, this reflects very poorly on management, for obvious reasons; principally because it demonstrates the attitude that they can do no wrong and it is always someone-else's fault which, ultimately, gives rise to a fundamental disrespect for the customer base.\n.\nThe bottom line is that I recommend strongly against STO and, moreover, I will not be reviewing this game again until I see some sort of evidence that key management changes have been made which facilitate policy implementation designed to ensure that customers are not systematically marginalised for the apparent crime of asking for some technical support.","October 30, 2014","false","0.3"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","17","33","0","0"

Additionally, the character movements are very jumpy on ground missions\n\nAnyway, it was fun for a while, but didn't have anything to hold interest. Just more and more of the same grind, essentially.","August 14, 2014","false","97.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greywardenrogue/recommended/9900/","greywardenrogue","trivan_23","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greywardenrogue/","204 products in account","So right off the bat, I'm going to make the claim that if you're a Star Trek fan, you'll find something to love about this game.\n\nWhether it's the episodic campaign that draws heavily upon the series and films. Or the vast overworld that allows you to beam down to many of the iconic locations you've come to know and love, such as Deep Space Nine, Starfleet Academy, Earth Stardock, Risa, and, taken directly from the most beloved film of the series, Paradise City from ST V. (Kidding.) Or just being able to run around your own ship or shuttle, most of which are inspired by, or are of the same class as, the ones from the show/films, and pilot it around the galaxy. There's something in this game for everyone.\n\nSince most people here have already covered the big parts of the game, I'll point my own personal list of Pros and Cons:\n\nPROS:\n\n- Fantastic Campaign: The devs for STO are big time Trek fans, and you'll definitely discover this once you start making your way through the campaign of your choice: Starfleet, Romulan, or Klingon. Each episode is formatted like an episode of the show, most of which are heavily inspired by plotlines from the show and films. Some of the episodes even continue the stories of some ST characters. Some devolve into shoot-'em-ups, but most -- especially the recent ones -- are 100% Trek, on par with the show. There are also player-created missions available to play through by way of the Foundry, which is awesome and something I wish more MMOs would incorporate.\n\n- Frequent Updates: Cryptic update the game with major episodic content a few times a year, most of which have featured actors reprising their roles from the series, such as Michael Dorn (Worf), Tim Russ (Tuvok), and Denise Crosby (Tasha Yar). Leonard Nimoy also narrates many key parts of the game in-character as Spock. Each new episode has added new story content, dailies, and general updates -- and all of them have been free. We've had one full-fledged expansion, Legacy of Romulus, and another one on the way in October called Delta Rising.\n\n- The Star Trek Experience: A lot went into making the game feel like a genuine Trek experience. The general atmosphere, the scale of the overworld, the missions, the visuals, locations, and characters. You take command of your own ship, and you can pretty much roll up any character you can imagine: from the stock races, such as Human, Vulcan, Romulan, Klingon, Betazoid, Trill, Orion, etc., to a custom alien race that you can define. There are also a lot of RP opportunites: Dabo(!), asteroid mining, ship interiors, and seasonal events. Just a lot of great stuff.\n\n- F2P Model: If I had to make a list of the most ethical F2P MMOs on the market... it would be a short list, but STO would be near the top. All of the story, PvE, and PvP content is free, as are all the updates. Most of the things Cryptic are making money off of are cosmetic items (uniforms, ship interiors/exteriors), ships (but the free ships are just as competitive), and services like inventory space, character slots, bank space, etc. The two things that I would count against it are the lockboxes, which can be easily ignored, and the two races locked behind a paywall, though with nearly infinite races available to you, it doesn't make much of a difference in my opinion. With a model like this, I've been happy to support it since I started playing.\n\nKHANS:\n\n- Sector Space: Initially, it's no big deal, but after some time you start to realize how unintuitive Sector Space can be, sectioned off the way it is. Can you land here, orbit, or do nothing? Why are there invisible walls in space? There's an event here, but is anyone participating? What does the event even entail? Cryptic have stated in the past that they want to give Sector Space an overhaul, which would be awesome, but we still have it for now.\n\n- Instance Stagnation: There are a lot of PvE and PvP instances to queue up for. People play a select few, but most have stagnated -- not from lack of players, just lack of interest. I'd much rather them not be there if no one's going to play them, so that Cryptic would be able to put more focus on the ones people still enjoy.\n\n- Community: Do yourself a favor and find a good fleet that you can get along with, because the community in STO, at least the vocal part, might just drive you insane. This is nothing new to online games, but it seems abnormal in a Trek game. Part of the reason might be how fragmented chat is in STO, which makes moderation rather difficult. Making chat universal across individual sectors would make things better, I think, but for now reading ESD chat might just make you go blind.\n\nI think that about covers it! Like I said, if you're a Star Trek fan, you owe it to yourself to give this a try, especially now that we're on the verge of a new expansion.\n\nLive long and prosper!","August 17, 2014","true","345.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is not, however, a good Star Trek game.\n\nFor me, the main draw of Star Trek isn't so much the science fiction, which let's face it, is on the silly side.  It is the characters, the dynamics between the crew that makes it interesting.  In-game, however, crew members are treated as little more than equipment, so that personal connection is gone.  You gain the ability to customize your officers however you want, true, but you lose what makes them characters.\n\nAnother problem of the game is the randomly generated sidequests.  Sure, it's fun to pretend that you are the star of your own Star Trek show, routinely investigating strange species, artifacts, and negative space wedgies, but the mad-lib style of quest generation means that after a while, all these quests seem to blur together.  So aside from the story quests - which are well done, by the way - none of the other content is memorable.\n\nThe saving grace for these sidequests is the Foundry, which allows users to create their own quests and stories.  Sturgeon's Law is in full effect here; 90% of the custom content is lackluster, but the other 10% makes it worthwhile.\n\nWhile the game has problems that prevent it from being truly great, I would still recommend it for ♥♥♥♥♥♥mers.  The universe feels big, the ship-to-ship combat is frantic but tactical (although sometimes you fight with the UI more than the enemy), and the amount of reference to the Star Trek shows can make Star Trek enthusiasts giddy.  If these sound exciting, that this is the game for you.","July 25, 2014","true","265.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game contains a lot of elements I enjoy, lacks in a few areas, but mostly is a great game! I tend to take my time, with my own method of how I play the game, making logs for every mission I do. Like an actual Starfleet Officer would do, as far as I know. The whole Star Trek franchise is my 3rd favorite (set of) show(s). The games story throws me off, the Federation allied or has a peace treaty with both the Klingons and the Romulans, I don't know why they are considered enemies. Especially when the 3 sides that you can be on, don't really fight one another. I haven't gotten much into the campaign yet to really know and understand the story, but as far as I can tell, I just enjoy being able to be a Starfleet Officer and having my own ship, and of course making my own logs.\n\nIssues I have with this game:\n1. You can't customize your ship fully. You can, somewhat, but I wish there was a more detailed way to modify your ship.\n2. You can't change your first officers information. This kind of bugged me, I wish I could change my first officers details just as I can change my first officers appearance, but the game doesn't allow it.\n3. You can't train your officers in like a holodeck program, which I wish you could build your own training programs and have access to a holodeck program. That way you can train your officers and even earn experience for yourself, maybe?\n4. You have to buy a lot of things with no free way really to earn a few Zen coins every now and then.\n\nOther than the issues I have with the game, the game is really fun and enjoyable! Even for a MMO. Although having it a single player game would have been cooler, that way they probably would of payed attention to how you build your ship, or design your character, and all of that rather than focusing on how the PVP system will work. Like with most MMO's, you can't really summarize the story without going through most of the game. So I can't summarize the story for this game.","August 26, 2014","true","67.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

It's pretty fun. However I feel at some times the game can feel a little generic or basic, but it makes up for it. While the "on-ground" combat seems to be really easy, the ship combat is very fun and requires a lot of strategy, it can get really intense during some points in the story.\n\nHowever the lack of explanation and walkthrough after you finish the tutorial is horrible, I had to figure out how to navgate the menues all on my own.\n\nGenerally overall it's still a really fun game I'd give it somewhere between a 7/10 to 8/10, the game has room for improvememts.\n\nAlso if the game looks blurry to you look for an option that says "resolution" and slide it all the way to 100%, I almost stopped playing because I thought the game was supposed to be this blurry.","November 30, 2014","true","14.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The crafting system is simplistic, the build mechanics complex enough to provide lots of diversity, and the ship battles are ultimately quite fun and engaging in ways that few other MMOs can manage.  The game's bugs and shortfalls (ground combat in particular) are more than compensated by the range of content and useful ways to spend your time, and this MMO is among a very select few MMOs which has an in-game system designed to reward you even when you're not playing.  Since it's all free, it's worth your time to try it out.\n\nIf that's all you needed to see, then you can stop reading here.\n\nHowever, I want to spend the bulk of this review explaining the "negative" reviews you see, because they all stem from the same common attitude that an increasing number of gamers tend to suffer from: an unwillingness to put forth the effort to EARN things.\n\nSomething you may notice about this game is that many of the top negative reviewers have two things in common:\n1) They're mostly bashing the studio (not the actual game) for perceived slights and its "pay to win model".\n2) Despite their supposed hatred of the game, they've sunk hundreds if not thousands of hours into it anyways.\n\nIt's not as hard to understand how this is possible, if you spend a bit of time playing the game for yourself.  STO is, simply put, a lot of fun to play, and this is something many of these negative reviews either ignore or begrudgingly admit somewhere in the footnotes of their massive rants against the game's payment structure.\n\nThis is, of course, mostly misplaced rage from people who either don't understand the currency system or lack any semblance of patience (the "gimme" crowd that is all too common to MMOs).\n\nThe payment system is relatively simplistic: Everything that can be bought for real money uses the "zen" currency (at a rate of $1 per 100 zen).  Some ships and a multitude of other ship devices and items cost dilithium, which is obtained in-game for free at a relatively slow pace.  This game also features a trade system whereby you can trade zen for dilithium and vice versa, meaning that anything you can buy for real money could potentially be bought entirely for free, with enough time and patience.\n\nIt takes a LOT of dilithium to do this, naturally (usually 150 dil for 1 zen), so you will be doing some grinding for it.  However, the grinding is not that bad by comparison to typical MMO grinding as dilithium can be obtained several ways (dilithium farming can be done through a variety of daily quests across the entire universe, as well as through duty officer missions and PvE queues).  The only real limiting factor is the fact that you can only produce 8k "refined" dilithium per day, per character (and dilithium must be refined in order to exchange it for zen), which generally doesn't prove to be much of a problem for me.\n\nIf I were to pick at anything, it would be that the Zen-based costs of ships do feel prohibitively high (ranging from 500 to 3k zen, or $5-$30), but this is primarily a consequence of the fact that they are account-wide ship unlocks (meaning any character of yours in that same faction gets access to them), as well as the fact that dilithium can be used to supplement part or all of these costs with enough time and patience.  The people who are whining about Cryptic's "pay to win" model are mostly complaining because these items cannot be obtained for free very easily if you lack the time or patience to put in the work for them.  In my own experience with many MMOs, this one is hardly as "pay-to-win" as they want it to sound.  Cryptic gives you a chance at a unique top-tier ship via the lockbox system if you're willing to spend your dilithium on keys for the lockboxes instead.  And on top of that, they even throw events which allow you to unlock a top-tier ship entirely for free (such as during Q's Winter Wonderland) with enough time put in.\n\nSo suffice it to say you can do far, far worse than STO if you want to talk "pay to win".  This game by no means fits that bill, not when you can buy anything in the real money store for free with enough hard work.  It's attitudes like those of the "popular" negative votes against this game which help fuel the stereotype of "gamer entitlement" that many often refer to.  Truthfully, this is a great game, and you ought not to let these people fool you into thinking otherwise.","December 6, 2014","true","201.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's also my first MMORPG, a category that I was never interested until I decided to install STO. Boy, am I glad I decided to give this one a try. The fact that it's free to play gets rid of a major obstacle. If you enjoy the rich world created by Gene Roddenberry and built upon by hundreds of other writers and artists, you may love this game. The developers of this game clearly studied the various Trek series and have infused the game with that knowledge.

You can get whatever you want in the cash shop without spending a dime, you do this by mining and trading on the Dilithium market which is basically a form of currency that you can exchange for Cash Shop Zen. HOWEVER, be prepared to put in the time if you choose to go that route.\n\nBiggest problem I have seen with this game is the players who actually play it. Those that dont put money into the game are constantly ♥♥♥♥♥ing about the "advantage" other players have over them and Earth Spaceport has become a literal soapbox for these people to voice their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Despite the fact that if these people simply just put some time into the game they could have everything a paid player has access too as well. Putting money into the game is simply a time saving convinence, not a game breaking flaw. As many of these people would lead you to believe.\n\nBesides, there is a mission where you take a current generation Ship, slingshot around the sun, go back in time to TOS. And get drink recipes from Scotty... That alone should make you want to play. Graphics I have noticed are getting a bit dated and certain aspects of space combat will take you a moment to learn. But, other than that the game is enjoyable and fun.\n\n10/10 Would go back in time to get alcohol recipes from Scotty again.\n\n","February 26, 2015","true","276.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game screams "Generic MMO" and has done for its 5 year life cycle. There is one thing though that no other Star Trek licensed or really any Licensed Sci-Fi games have ever done, Made you feel like the Captain of your very own ship and your very own crew that you build yourself through hours of work. For so long i have craved a game that could make me feel like i was part of such a universe like Star Trek's and that i could create my own story and be that Starfleet/KDF/Romulan Captain. If i am quite honest if you are someone looking for an MMO and do not have the faintest idea of Star Trek's lore or have no interest in Sci-Fi then turn away as this will be frustrating and excruciating to the core.

This game screams "Generic MMO" and has done for its 5 year life cycle. There is one thing though that no other Star Trek licensed or really any Licensed Sci-Fi games have ever done, Made you feel like the Captain of your very own ship and your very own crew that you build yourself through hours of work. For so long i have craved a game that could make me feel like i was part of such a universe like Star Trek's and that i could create my own story and be that Starfleet/KDF/Romulan Captain. If i am quite honest if you are someone looking for an MMO and do not have the faintest idea of Star Trek's lore or have no interest in Sci-Fi then turn away as this will be frustrating and excruciating to the core. But for those who want "To boldly go where no man has gone before" and are self declared members of Starfleet then this game will provide hours upon hours of entertainment, even with the games numerous issues. I should know, I have played the blasted game for almost 195 Hours...","February 19, 2015","true","204.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Every ship you want to fly will cost  you 30 dollars or spending all day every day collecting pink rocks like full time work to buy them for free. They give one faction that no one plays insane damage (romulans) and anything other factions get is nerfed to nothingness. They increased monster health 10x while maybe increasing damage 50% so you can spend half an hour shooting at same guy. They turned a casual exploration based game into a full time job.

and this whole process will cost you hundreds of dollars in real life money. now imagine you have to upgrade the warpcore, engine, deflector, shield of your ship and now even imagine you have 50 ships all with different gear. this will cost you thousands of dollar just to upgrade all your old stuff that you have already aquired and paid with real money. they let you pay again and again and again your stuff that you have already bought. sto is not worth the insane high costs, its maybe worth 10 bucks per month at all. you could fill a 1tb drive full with games for the money sto wants from you. i had a little trick i have used to avoid the insane high costs in form of real money. i had in the end 27 chars and 20 alts all level 50 that i have used to farm ec, dilithium, commodities, contraband and i was a heavy multibox user. because of this little trick i could aquire everything in the game, i had everything and all ships you could get. this means i have started sometimes up to 10 game clients and i was logged in with 10 different accounts at once. i did cycle though all 47 chars to get all the doffjobs done on all of my chars. i mainly used the refugee, prisoner, officer doff exchange assignments to get more very rare and rare doffs and sell them on the exchange. all i did was switch between the game windows and do doff assignments for doffs, contraband and commodities or i did path to 2409 or did mine dilithium with my 47 chars or did the cristalline entity event and idled with 10 chars at the startpoint lol. sometimes i have played more than 18 hours per weekend day! i made trillions of ec and millions of dilithium(trade 5 contraband for 2000 dil ore every 4 hours with my 20 alts chars plus 1 main char). i did not pay a dime for the new greed rising extension, i have farmed over 2,5 million dilithium and traded it for zen and bought the dr pack ingame for 12,5k zen. i was very dissapointed by the delta rising pack, the new t6 ship are ugly beyond imagination, the stats of the ships are horrible, everything is broken in delta rising nothing works. i couldnt even login more due to crashes and server timeout and game freezes every few minutes. sto has no beta testers, we the endgame customers are the alpha and beta testers. i said to myself enough is enough, screw that. i have deinstalled sto and sold my main account. i will never again play a mmo or sto. i bought now battlefield 4 with premium and all unlocks. now i play maybe every 2 or 3 days bf4 for 2 or 3 hours per day. i only play bf4 if i really have the time and nothing else to do. i have also no monthly followup costs like in sto. i bought bf4 once and have never again to pay anything and bf4 is now 99% gameplay and fun and only 1% grinding and for the first time in 3 years i have seen a real working game support, thanks for that. now after my horrible sto experience my whole life has changed to a very good life, i have now more sleep, more energy, more money, more time, more friends, more sun, more of everything, im so glad i stopped playing sto.","November 12, 2014","false","32.4"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","1"

But this game is riddled with bugs, glitches, display problems, choppy fps drops, and hilarious lag issues. If cryptic can stop sucking up the players' money for a month or so and genuinely patch the game, this may improve. PvE events are non-existent, the grind is still horrible. The tutorial sticks you with skills and abilities you may not want and doesnt even let you respecialize to your own liking. You have to buy a token which you can obtain without spending actual money, but it'll take weeks of grinding for Dilithium Crystals just to afford it. My overall rating on this bug-ridden distaster is a 2 out of 5. It seems Cryptic has lost its sense of gaming and just dove for the players' wallets. Patches are meant to improve the game, new content is supposed to add new things.. but clearly its just layering on more time wasted grinding away for a ship or loadout you can't do without paying actual money.","August 24, 2015","false","333.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So I probably have a couple weeks worth of actual game play time.\n\nI used to like this game and I will always be a Star Trek fan but as much as I wanted this game to suceed it has always fell short.  One it's left many promises unfulfilled even after years and the fans asking again and again doesn't matter.  What made the game good was it's stories which made me feel like I was in a interactive Star Trek episode but they have now all but stopped the featured episodes in favor of these large exploration zones, that would be alright if a player felt like they were accomplishing something but for example the Dyson Sphere your given a general objective clear out the enemies you do that and the enemies just keep respawning beind you in the same place making it feel like you're accomplishing nothing, no sense of progression.  There is no real attachment to your crew or ship, this is one of the unfullfilled promises from the developers, other than the bridge variants the rest the ship is exacty the same no matter what class or size ship you are in, there is nothing really interactive or things to do inside the ship and doors and hallways are disproportationaly large making it feel off.  One of the worst things they implemented was the Doff system which makes the make feel like Facebook's Farmville where the player has to constantly log in every few hours to re-que missions to earn better equimplent and skills.  These Doff missions also require resources which require grinding of a few missions hundreds of times to det top tier, this gets boring real fast.  The game has severly suffered from lack of PVP, it's in there just there is no real point to it and it's not really fun with no real rewards to playing it.  One of the worst is Cryptic won't let you post any negative feedback on their forums about game improvement or critiques doing so will get the person a warning or banned.  There's a lot more but like I said I really wanted the game to succeed but it's just not going to happen.","August 11, 2014","false","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is constant updates and new missions, but there is no startrek diplomatic or scientific missions, like those you see on the show; unless they are player built. All missions seem to be shoot them up, space lazer operas of no diplomatic possability.\n\nYou can get the biggest and best stuff simply by playing a lot, which is great, considering the market design and functions of the game are based on free-to-pay additions; new content in the form of ships, interiors, pets, species, acocunt upgrades, ect. Honestly, I love how they do things, and although the ship prices are steep, they do provide ways to have such tier 6 ships simply through investing your time and intelligence; a beautiful consideration to the general player base.\n\nsound is amazing, and often there is voice actors from the show(s) making apperences in the new release miussion content. Space battle - although a strange auditory concept and impractical possability - are great. I love the sound of battle in this game. Likewise, the score is great. The music really makes the feel of the missions.\n\nThe graphics are great. A tad cartoonish, granted they could make this game feel a little more realistic and gritty, it still provides an adventuristic sense; like the original series innocense that keeps the game psychologically positive, and you the obvious good guy.  The worlds are well done and there seems to be a pretty good adherence to startrek universal cannon in their design. The space battles are amazing light shows. This game was graphically made to be played in the space regions and in ship-to-ship battle. Here, unlike when 'on the gorund' or as an "away team", there is a dark gritty feel to fighting. Space battle starts to feel merceless, with hardly any quarter asusmed for the 10 thousand ships you will destroy over your carrier in starfleet. This game also renders PC wallpaper or generally artistic screen shot of one's ship or space combat. The graphics are brilliant in this realm of the game, and over all, good througout the game as a whole.\n\nHints: go tac captin for captin abilities. Always pick an alien race for the efficiant and other space based bonuses. Save money for all "efficiant" crews and build a ship with a high priority for damage dealing. DPS is the god of this game, where cruisers with survivability to certain energy types implimented into their deisgn comes second. PVP is a buyers market, where you will be crushed by those who bought better ships/gear/gold unless you are a master captin in skill and timing, or a cloaked oppertunist who can swoop in and kill fast.\n\nThis game is great. I will continually play it - a mission here or there over a week - for the next 4 years as I have for the last 4. 10/10 game","June 14, 2015","true","629.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trevornt/recommended/9900/","trevornt","TrevorNT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trevornt/","154 products in account","This game, like so many, has its ups and downs.  On the list of positives, there are things like the ship designs (which are really cool), the missions you get to go on (they all feel like actual things you would do if you were in a Star Trek episode), the fact that featured episodes are voice-acted (the most recent, involving the Sphere, has the actual voice of Worf from The Next Generation), the multiplayer element of the game (incl. PvE and PvP missions both on the ground and in space), and the events they run from time to time.  On the other hand, it gets really repetitive after a while...most of the things you do in missions are in text, not in actual minigames that you can play.\n\nOne way this MMO departs from others is that the combat is not "click-click-click you're dead", to put it that way...you actually have to dodge the grenades the Romulans across the room throw, or set up turrets and lure Klingons into a trap.  The game also has a difficulty controller; if you think your missions are too easy, you can change to a higher difficulty for better loot and more of a challenge (seriously, enemy disruptor blasts consume a lot more shield HP in Expert than they do in Normal!).\n\nIts downfall is that it gets repetitive after a while.  Missions are usually "oh, go kill that small fleet of Reman ships" or "take an away team down to the planet and scan relics".  The crafting is also super boring; you need to collect (or purchase) a lot of items to put ship components together.\n\nThe game has a slight pay-to-play nature, not nearly as bad as I've seen but still very existent.  You'll need ZEN (the microtransaction currency) to purchase some of the best ships, though if you collect enough Dilithium (an in-game currency that everyone is available to collect in fair quantities) you can trade it in for ZEN.  But it's going to take a lot of Dilithium to buy that Osperey Cruiser or Advanced Obelisk Carrier (the best ships cost 2500 ZEN, which is ~350,000 Dilithium, and you can only collect a few thousand per day at most, even if you're subscribed).\n\nNaturally there is an element of player-formed alliances; in this game they are called Fleets, and they can participate in otherwise closed battles against AI or other people, but I haven't gotten there yet.  You don't need to be any particular level to join a fleet, but lots of fleets will require that you reach the highest level in the game (currently lvl. 50, which translates to a Federation Vice Admiral).  The community doesn't seem too bad.  Also, leveling is a piece of cake.  All it usually takes is a single mission to gain a level.  Every 10 or so you get a newer, larger, better ship.\n\nAll in all, I say give the game a shot.  You may find that its repetitiveness gets the best of you.  Or you may be taken away by the scenery as you blow other starships to bits (oh yeah, the graphics are pretty cool).","December 8, 2013","true","301.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can level really quickly, though part of that was due to the Delta Rising promotion they had going on when i joined, and the ships were great. Then I got to level 50, and was given access to the Delta Quadrant and Dyson Sphere. All the sudden, the wonderful mission's I'd been completing turned into 5-6 part grinds spanning over different areas, in different systems, in different sectors.... and I had one that I spent almost 2 hours trying to complete because even though I have the best ship in the "free" fleet, it does not match up to these enemies. So, unless I feel like spending money of upgraded ships and weaponry, I've gone about as far as I can in the storyline.

I've played this game to max out my level, achieve the highest score, get the most out of my characters.\n\nBefore I explain why I dont like this game,\n\nI would recommend this game if you are looking to have a fun time, if you are a casual gamer and a star trek nerd, you should definately give this game a shot. You can play through the campaign and have fun with your friends easily without spending a dime. Anything beyond that, I am not so sure, unless you like grinding your organs to mush. So, if you are in it for fun, and not to win it, then absolutely go on and download this game, skip the rest of what I have to say.\n\nNow, if the above does not apply to you, I would not recommend this game if you are looking to do what I did in this game, play to win. Before I start my review of the game as a whole, which might turn into a rant, let me say one major turnoff to all non-casual gamers, and that is that this game is SUPER DUPER POOPER SCOOPER Pay 2 Win, it's really pay 2 win, and every update that the devs stick into the disgrace of a game that it is right now, make it more and more pay 2 win.\n\nOriginally created in a sort of rock paper scissors manner where you needed different classes of ships and types of captains to win in pvp or pve, (which mainly become the game after the storyline, and becomes a repetitive grind anyhow), the developers are slowly getting rid of this concept. It is common knowledge among all veteran players of this game that all that matters if you really want to win, is DPS. The usefulness of players that run ships like cruisers and science ships is so miniscule compared to those of escorts (the tactical officers main ship), and high dps cruisers, a more recent addition, (disgusting imo), that at high levels, after long hours of grinding, you will find yourself obsolete as anything but an escort player or tactical officer. This problem is so large that you will find that when you enter PvP especially, that players will exploit the broken game mechanics enormously, pairing different equipments, bonuses, and abilities, (there are so damn many), in ways that they are not intended, but allowed by the developers, that they are impossible to beat. The exploitation of everything at high ranks, the balancing of statistics to get the most out of escorts and such, really retracts from the star trek atmosphere. There are so many flaws I can go on and on about in the game, and before I run out of breath talking about this one flaw, exploitation, ill just lay them all out for you:\n\n1. Players exploit the game at high levels\n2. The game is unbalanced for different playstyles at higher levels\n3. Most players are at max level so you cant do anything in pvp\n4. After you finish a set of missions, you will find yourself grinding the same PvE events for countless hours for just a few pieces of borg tech for example, unless you deem yourself a wallet warrior.\n5. The in-game economy is very limited and boring.\n6. The actual storyline is repetitive and sparse.\n7. Broken game mechanics brings little variety to ships (if they want to win and be useful)\n8. They are always adding new ways to spend money or grind your organs to mush, they add plenty of new ships, plenty of new equipment, and new missions to get equipment, they hardly work on REALLY fixing the game and polishing it's mechanics. Instead of revisiting problems, they will simply expand. For example, if cruisers are underpowered because tanking and drawing fire is useless in PvE, they simply increase the damage of cruisers)\n9. Besides the main storyline, side missions or personal missions are just as boring and typical, almost 100% of them are just rinse and repeat. Go shoot some ships, shoot some people on the ground, and run around pressing F to do some scan sci-fi stuff.\n10. Did I mention scans and the F key? Yes, everything besides shooting ♥♥♥♥ up, (which is easy because your character and ship locks onto everything automatically, making every enemy encounter just repeated buttons to press over and over, even with autofire on you are simply using your simple and boring abilities over and over to kill your enemy, waiting for abilities to recharge, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, grind GRIND GRIND!!!!\n\nSorry, went on a bit of a tangent. Anyway back to the F key. Anything besides shooting ♥♥♥♥ up is basically going around, pressing the F key, whether you are healing wounded patients or scanning asteroids, you simply press the F key and wait for the bar to reach 100% and yay thats all. This isn't completely true, there are a few things in the campaign and side missions and stuff in the game that require a bit of skill, but 90% of these tasks have the same mechanics, and the way they are set up (easy as hell and boring to tears), you can probably set up a couple of macros to solve them anyway if you really cared. There are only a few instances in the newer campaigns that aren't the same damn easy puzzle, repeated over and over. The only useful mini-game is the one that you use to go dilithium mining, and that one is... Ok. :)\n\nBack on course, I think the #1 problem is the broken mechanics at higher levels:\n\nYou will encounter players using dyson ships (completely STO-unique ships), firing romulan weapons (disruptors), using only beam weapons, (because multi-weapon ships are useless besides the occasional special weapon, and torpedoes are largely useless too thank you game mechanics), using borg ship modules, while using tholian engines and shields.\n\nNow this above issue isn't just an isolated thing, like you will see one in a handful of people doing this. Absolutely not, unless you are a low level player that doesn't know what he is doing, when you achieve higher ranks of Admiral, which everyone does pretty quickly, you will find that everyone is forced to do completely uncharacteristic things. You will find starfleet ships using antiproton weapons, and only antiproton cannons, or only antiproton beams, because adding a torpedo to a weapons slot would be useless, as torpedoes are quite useless without wasting plenty of skill points on them anyway and you need those skill points for beam weapons becuase torpedoes do nothing against enemy shields. (I could go farther but that would probably bore you)\n\nThe worst thing that ever happened to this game was Perfect World Entertainment acquiring it from the original creators, Cryptic Studios. From the stories told by my clan mates, who have played this game from the creation, the game was a lot better, focused a lot less on giveusmoneygiveusmoneygiveusmoneygiveusmoney with PWE.\n\nI quit it a bit ago after getting fed up with all of the ♥♥♥♥ updates that were just excuses for PWE to make more money.","June 18, 2015","false","698.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But this game is riddled with bugs, glitches, display problems, choppy fps drops, and hilarious lag issues. If cryptic can stop sucking up the players' money for a month or so and genuinely patch the game, this may improve. PvE events are non-existent, the grind is still horrible. The tutorial sticks you with skills and abilities you may not want and doesnt even let you respecialize to your own liking. You have to buy a token which you can obtain without spending actual money, but it'll take weeks of grinding for Dilithium Crystals just to afford it. My overall rating on this bug-ridden distaster is a 2 out of 5. It seems Cryptic has lost its sense of gaming and just dove for the players' wallets. Patches are meant to improve the game, new content is supposed to add new things.. but clearly its just layering on more time wasted grinding away for a ship or loadout you can't do without paying actual money.","August 24, 2015","false","333.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I always have, and I'm pretty sure I always will. I loved this game for a long time, too.\n\nWhat I'm not a fan of, is the way things on this have turned recently within STO.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is wrong. When I first started playing, it was a happy, very lore-friendly place filed with lots of people trying to get their way into the TV screen we all watched our first episodes on. Recently, the lay of the land has become confusing. To say you have to grind a lot is the understatement of the milenium. EVERYTHING is a grind now, unless you want to pay for it. It has also become increasingly apparent that PWE is searching for money: In-game purchases are fine, but when you give us 3 new ships and 10 new costumes every other week, it gets ridiculous.\n\nI think one of the things I have been experiencing serves as a perfect explination. The game only launches on safe mode. In the time that this bug began to now, I count at least 19 new ships that have been added to the game (not including fleet model ships).\n\nThe new way of grinding is... well, bad. Horrendous. An abomination. A lot of the new grinds require vast sums of dilithium, which is hard to farm for, and is quantity capped at 8000 units a day, which is a penny in the well of what you'll actually need. Now, dilitium is hard to farm for, but guess what PWE sells. Zen. Guess what you can by dilithium for, kiddies. Zen.\n\nAll in all, this game is very good. I wouldn't have spent so much time on it otherwise, but I'm terrified that this will turn into Guitar Hero. A good game, a great idea, but driven into the ground harder than a Mack truck hitting a freight train because they produced too much new content too fast, and people got sick of it.\n\nAlso: when you advertise an upgrade to your existing tier 5 ships to make them "tier 5u" ships, make them equal to the tier 6 ships. The imbalance is ridiculous. I have top-tier gear on my odyssey (including your $5 upgrade). It can't keep pace with anything on tier 6, and thats not okay.\n\nTo Perfect World Entertainment:\n\nFix your mistakes before you turn into another guitar hero rerun.","July 16, 2015","false","220.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Travel across the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta quadrants of the Milky Way Galxy, fighting numerous opponents such as Klingons, Romulans, Cardassians and many many more. Pilot your ship in ever-challenging combat scenarios and send yourself along with an away team to different planets to fight intense ground combat battles. You will ascend through the ranks of the Federation and gain new and more powerful ships along the way, choosing either a Science, Engineering or Tactical path as you become one of the most powerful captains the Federation has ever seen.\n\n\nSo I have around about 45 or so hours on this game on steam, around the same amount off of it also, and let me tell you it's my favourite game outright on PC. It's one of those games where it's so rich in lore and exciting combat, I can hardly get off of it. The story has clearly been designed by people passionate about all Star Trek lore, including the newer J.J. Abrams movies, as you'll see in the story. The episodes you play are exciting, clever and challenging, so much so that I find myself engulfed in a battle against a huge Romulan D'Deridex warbird in my reasonably large Intrepid Long-Range Science Vessel.\n\nThe combat GUI and controls are very nicely assigned allowing fluid and immersive combat on ground and exhilarating space combat, paired with gorgeous 3D visuals and beautiful particle effects it fully immerses you into the Star Trek galaxy. This game is beautifully designed by a great team; Cryptic have successfully made a game woprthy of being canon with the Star Trek Universe.\n\nSo I should do a traditional "Pros V Cons" list so here goes.\n\nPros:\n~ Great Servers, never experienced any lag and loading times for large areas are decent.\n~ Nice Selection of Ships, huge lists of small shuttles all the way to the monstrous "Obelisk Carrier"... it's big.\n~ Great Story Missions, facing a huge selection of enemies from all the Star Trek TV and Movies.\n~ Beautiful Visuals, maps and particle effects are great, along with the ships too.\n~ Lovely community, never seen any kind of hate war on the chat, only people willing to trade and help eachother out.\n~ Combat difficulty is dependent on your level, not the mission order.\n~ Custom Player, Bridge Officers, Ship, Ship Name AND Ship Designation Number (NCC-1701 style)\n~ EPIC MUSIC, nuff said.\n\nCons:\n~ Pay to play is evidently the case for higher level players wanting more ships or ships of better quality.\n~ Some ground tasks within missions can seem more like a fool's errand more than "Investigating" however of course that sometimes is the life of a starfleet officer.\n~ Patch download the first time is quite substantial and is always increasing with every update.\n~ Really Nitpicking, the planet's aren't full scale.\n\n\nAll together I completely recommend this genious brilliant game, you'll enjoy it massively if you've evr appriciated any star trek series OR film. Seriously, start the download now.","February 17, 2015","true","102.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
