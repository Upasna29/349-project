Прохождение занимает 15 минут игрового времени и несколько часов душевной ностальгии. При этом игру стоит оценить и западным игрокам - это приоткроет им часть знаний о русской культуре. Не смотря на старую дату выхода и определённые проблемы с игрой - он всё ещё способна принести приятные минуты за прохождением.\nТак же игра обязательна тем, кто помнит начало 2000-ых и первые Российские квесты. Купив её мы можем отдать дань памяти тем воспоминаниям, которые у нас связаны с развитием компьютерных игр в России в те времена.\nХотя стоит отметить - она крайне устарела...\n\n-----------------------------------------ENGLISH---------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNice old Russian game. Passage in 15 minutes of playing time, and a few hours of spiritual nostalgia. In this game should evaluate and Western players - is slightly open to them of the knowledge of Russian culture. Despite the old release date and some problems with the game - he's still able to bring pleasant moments of the passage.\nSo, the game is obligatory for those who remember the early 2000s and the first Russian quests. After purchasing it, we can pay tribute to the memories that we have associated with the development of computer games in Russia at that time.\nAlthough it should be noted - it is very outdated ...","January 5, 2015","true","3.7"," 39 of 58 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","39","58","4","0"

The game has some catchy tunes and is based on a Soviet cartoon which is also pretty fun.\n\nIt is also nice to see that 1C have done some work to it and it works great on new computers, and the interface has also been upgraded.\n","December 27, 2015","true","0.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","6","6","3","0"

Alrighty then.\n\nNormally, with this kind of game, the main questions are about the story and puzzles, but in this case, there's a matter of basic functionality.\nThis game is old. Modern features like canceling a movement or skipping a line of dialogue are not here, so you will have to wait a few seconds every time they shake their head or say "I don't understand", and then wait a few more just because. There are also some scenes where things are moving and it doesn't consistantly react to clicks.\n\nThe story is quite short, but mildly amusing, with minimal dialogue and some decent animation. Some of the cutscene text hasn't been translated, so I'm not sure if I missed a joke or two there.\n\nThe puzzles are a mixed bag, though nothing great. Some of the puzzles require swapping things around or trial and error until you find a solution (or give up and watch the video guide included), and with the clunky interface, this can be a slow, repetitive process.\n\nOverall, the game just doesn't meet modern expectations. The animation is good, but unless you are willing to put up with an outdated interface, it's not worth it.","March 11","false","1.0"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"
