You feel her forehead tenderly with your\nhand's exterior before checking her temperature.\n\n"Seems like it's going down..." You tell her, while\nshe pulls a long face. You open your laptop and\nengage the Steam client, looking for a game to\nplay together, a simple one, to take her mind off\nof the fever. Suddenly she grabs your arm, and\norders you to stop scrolling in your library.\n\n"What's that one? I've heard of it, but it doesn't\nseem familiar." Summer-Rain points at a game\nyou remembered buying on the franchise sale.\n\nRED FACTION.\n\nYou tell Summer-Rain about how you were ten\nyears old when the game came out and you had\nto play as a miner named Parker who started as\na disenfranchised worker on Mars before leading\nan entire Revolution against his evil company,\nUltor.\n\nSummer-Rain pulls the sheets up to her nose and\nsays she wants ice cream while she watches you\nplay Red Faction. After a short trip to the kitchen\nand fetching her a bowl of vanilla ice cream, the\nintroductory cutscene plays as Parker narrates\nhis down-on-his-luck life as a miner on Mars.\n\nThe introductory level opens quickly enough. A\nfellow miner is provoked into assault with the\nguards, and all hell breaks loose, with you quickly\nobtaining a stun baton to bludgeon guards with\nand a 9mm pistol as a basic firearm.\n\nRemote charges that stick to targets and grenades\nround out your arsenal in this starting stage,\nand Summer-Rain laughs while you latch remote\ncharges to the oncoming Guards, their arms\nflailing wildly as they scream and run about\nbefore you detonate them.\n\nYou encounter an APC amid a rocky bridge as\nSummer-Rain tells you to be careful, expecting\nyou to face the APC head-on with your Rocket\nLauncher which has minimal ammo. You opt to\nblow up the two edges of the rock bridge, which\nsends the Guards and the APC falling to their\ndeath down the ravine below.\n\n"How-?!" Summer-Rain exclaims, before telling\nher that this game has Geo-Mod technology, a\nprecursor to DICE's Frostbite engine and their\ndestruction 2.0. "Although this game is from\n2001, almost everything you see that isn't part\nof the preprogrammed story is fully destructable."\n\nYou are soon taking on Guards in drilling vehicles,\ntravelling between sabotaged power plants in\nSubmarines and even taking to the skies in one\nlevel in one of Ultor's AESIR Fighters. By now, you\nhave obtained an Assault Rifle, a Shotgun, the\ndeadly Precision Rifle with 4x zoom scope and\nalmighty Sniper Rifle with 10x zoom scope.\n\nThrough it all, Summer-Rain mindlessly munches\nice cream in anticipation of what comes next,\nwith Parker laying waste to everything before him\nin his quest to be free of Ultor and Mars.\n\nThe villains of the game, Dr. Capek and later the\ncold, calculating mercenary Masako, prove to be\nsome of the most difficult boss fights in the game\nwith your meager health and zero modern-day\nmechanics a player takes for granted, such as\nshields and auto-save checkpoints.\n\nWhen you die and you had the unfortunate habit\nof not saving in a game like Red Faction, you find\nyourself at the beginning  of the Miner Uprising\nat the start of the game, having to do it all. over.\nagain.\n\nThe supporting characters of Red Faction are\nminimal, but they all compliment the story very\nwell. The hacker Hendrix is a non-annoying\nversion of Otacon, Summer-Rain observes, while\nshe likes the no-nonsense attitude of the Red\nFaction leader Eos, and her right-hand man\nOrion, who appears only a few times, but chews\nup scenery well with his sincere voice acting.\n\nThe enemies of Red Faction progress incredibly\nwell. First there are regular guards, then the\nOfficers, with their rough-and-tumble black\nassault rifles, red visors, yellow trim and biting\nattitudes to match.\n\nLater, armored Mercenaries take over the\nenemy role, armed with heavy machine\nguns, one-hit-kill Railguns (which can see\nand shoot through walls) and the dreaded\nFusion Rocket Launcher.\n\nThe end comes, and you have to disarm a\nbomb that Eos is strapped to, but the controls\nto disarm the bomb make no sense, and you\nswear to the High Lords of Valhalla that the\ntimer is rigged. Summer-Rain has long finished\nher vanilla ice-cream, cowering under the\nblanket and hoping you can save Eos in time.\n\nThe screen fades to white, and both of you\nfind yourselves at the main menu of the game,\nwhere you load your last save and find that\nyou have to fight Masako in her AESIR Fighter\nagain before you can try to disarm the bomb\nshe strapped to Eos. Summer-Rain heaves a\nsmall sigh of disappointment.\n\n"I could never figure out the sequence in time\nback then anyway." You shrug, apologizing\nto Summer-Rain. She sets aside your laptop\nand draws you in for a hug. Summer-Rain\nthanks you for showing her a game from\nyour childhood, and if anything, she enjoyed\nthe ride with you, watching you play as\nParker and try to take down the Ultor\nCorporation has her feeling better than\nthe fever that got her down.\n\nYou smile and say that you have to go\nand prepare some things for tomorrow's\nclass before you can join her for the night.\n"Go on, go on... hurry back so I don't get\ntoo cold without you!" She says. You nod,\nand reach for your laptop, before her hand\ncloses on yours. "Leave the laptop." She\norders, and you shrug as you leave to pack\nyour bags for the class tomorrow.\n\nAs you leave her room, you hear the sound\nof swooshing doors of the main menu theme\nand a guard shouting the familiar words to\na certain Parker...\n\n"HOLD IT, MINER!"\n\nYou turn round and see Summer-Rain\nlooking away from you at the ceiling, her\nmouth in mock whistling. "Better red than\ndead, huh Summer?"\n\nShe beams back at you.\n\nRED FACTION.\n\n\n","October 20, 2015","true","5.8"," 110 of 138 people (80%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","80","110","138","45","12"

The first game on the Red Faction franchise featured a narrative and playable style very similar to Valve's first title and was set on a martian colony in a dystopian future like the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Solid gameplay (very similar to the first Half-Life with a low gravity twist thanks to the martian surface).\n- Non-Stop levels (the maps doesn't count with a "beginning" or "end" per se, just like the first Half-Life game).\n- Multiple fully controllable aerial, marine and land vehicles (each one counts with a precise control and multiple weapons/modes of fire).\n- Lots of cool futuristic weapons (each one with its corresponding primary and secondary fire mode).\n- Multiple ways to reach an objetive or location (alternatives routes prevent the game to be fully lineal).\n- Destructible enviroments (the Geo-Mod Technology allows you to use this to your advantage for destroying enemy cover, finding secrets, create shortcuts, alternative routes, etc).\n- Some great graphical aspects for its age (dynamic lighting and water effects).\n- Despite its age, the Multiplayer game mode remains active with more than 30 servers with players (at the moment of writing this review).\n\nCONS:\n\n- Given the Non-Stop character of the maps, the game does not save your progress automatically (there is no Auto-Save, so you have to be very aware to Quick-Save from time to time. Also, you only have one Quick-Save slot, so you have to know when and where to do it).\n- some dialogue and characters are cliche and even generic (from my POV).\n- The IA tends to cheat towards the end of the game, firing weapons that pass through walls/cover out of your vision range (although some weapons allows you to do the same thing).\n- A little short.\n\nIf you liked the first Half-Life game regarding narrative, design, shooting mechanics and adding that you can control several vehicles, plus the atmosphere of the original Total Recall movie (1990) you have a winner in here.\n\nThere are Mods that allows you to play the game with widescreen and modern resolutions, in addition to correct some bugs (although i played the original Steam version).\n\nMy Score: 7.6/10\n\nNote: Played it on Windows XP - SP3","February 2, 2014","true","11.9"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","8"

And this maybe, I guess is the first game to introduce, destructive buildings and objects. Although, I started playing new games I got addicted to the game until I finished it, if you dont mind dated graphics, you must try it and the gameplay and mechanics are awesome for its age. In this game you can drive submarines and jeep at some points which was a surprise as I didnt expect it. The story is good but , not great, The protagonist seems a bit hot-headed guy at some points who only wants revenge  . The AI could act foolish sometimes, but that dosent matter much to me. The enemies get harder to kill as you progress through the story, and new and overpowered Weapons are unlocked and  its always fun to blow walls and things up with the rocket launcher.And the music of the game is also great, really matches the mood of the game.\nAnd the great part is the multiplayer is still alive after all these years, although only 10-11 players , but after getting the pure faction mod you can get more players and more new maps to join.\n\nNow my conclusion is: Its a must play for those who like old-school FPS games , and I would also recommend others to give it a shot , A great game overall . I give it a 9/10.","December 29, 2013","true","13.9"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"

It's almost like they didn't even try\n-The conclusion/ending of the game felt void and unrewarding\n-The villains were boring\n-Some levels were way too big to enjoy\n-Vehicle controls were awful\n-The jumping felt a little too floaty\n\nFinal thought:\nThe game was really fun to play through. However, as mentioned before, the game felt a little too long and the outcome was unrewarding. The story was okay, but wasn't oscar-worthy. I'm half and half about this game, which really makes me wish Steam had a "Maybe" option aobut recommending this game.\n\nP.S. (spoilers, kinda)\nThere's a part in the game (that many have experienced) where a submarine you need to progress explodes for no reason. You can't get it back, either. There's another part similar when fighting a giant robot, you have to trick it into falling into a giant spinning fan. The robot sometimes glitches and refuses to move. This robot deals massive amounts of damage, making it extremely frustrating to deal with. In times like these, I recommend using the cheatcode "vivalahelvig" to get passed them. You can enter that cheatcode in-game by typing it into the "~" commands. It's the god-mode cheat, and you can turn it on and off as many times as you like by simply just typing "vivalahelvig" again. You should get a message on the lower center screen if it worked.","October 16, 2014","true","11.1"," 32 of 44 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","32","44","3","3"

If you like a twitch-shooter, you'll probably love it.\n(I started on RF Guerrilla and Armageddon and love them both, and played this one for some context.)\nYou can view the game's opening here.\n\nGuns are great, and destructible terrain is fun. Game-play rewards tactical thinking and choosing the correct weapon for the right situation. Game-play and gun-play are smooth, and graphics are pretty good for a game from 2001; I never had my immersion broken b/c of low-res textures. Level design never felt boring, though it was sometimes mildly confusing.\n\nSome things are just outright frustrating, though. Maybe I've been spoiled by the recent generation of games that have direction finders and maps (though I didn't have a problem in Max Payne or Max Payne 2), but lack of directions and small switches to press to proceed can equal many minutes of running around aimlessly, looking for the way forward. Health is at a premium on any difficulty. Story is meh. Voice acting (except for Hendrix) is sub-par. Music is annoying and repetitive. The final levels felt tacked on, making the game too long - though, at 6 hours for a run-through, the game is actually anything but long.\n\nAnd while I didn't have the bugs that other gamers have encountered (like the submarine exploding for no reason), I could only play an hour or so before the voices stopped sounding. I had to exit the game, and verify the file cache. There were usually 3 files that had to be re-acquired. Once done, the game proceeded normally - for another hour or so. Annoying, but not really game-breaking (I wasn't playing with any mods).\n\nWorth a look for for any Red Faction fan, or someone who enjoys old-school shooters. But there will be no hand-holding. Or clues. Or detailed directions.\n\nEDIT: Played with the Pure Faction mod installed, and the above problem with the voices disappeared.","May 24, 2015","true","28.0"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

And if you don't do your saves right, the last 10 minutes of the game can leave you stuck and you'd have to start a new game.

Red Faction is the start of an amazing series which provides a possibly reality to early space colonization.\n\nStory:\nYou play Parker a man who travelled to Mars in order to work for Ultor Corporation and create himself a future. Ultor Corporation lures miners with the promise of a future. Little do they know the corporation is manipulating the media to show people a completely different light of what is really going on. Breaking basic Human Rights Ultor is essentially torturing miners forcing them to work in terrible conditions. But all is about to change as the Red Faction rises up from the dust and who is going to be unwittingly a part of the rebellion, but Parker. As you progress through the campaign you learn more about the horrible tortures that Ultor is actually conducting.\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign is broken up into 12 levels: Mines, Registration, Abandoned Mines, Gryphon, Canyon, Comm Center, Barracks, Docking Bay, Geothermal Plant, Capek, Subway, and Shuttle. The game takes you through the underground of mars, through canyons, and to space itself. Throughout the campaign you will be put against bosses, environmental hazards, and hordes of enemies.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game has an array of difficulty levels that allow you to enjoy a casual simple first person shooter to a hard-core gaming experience. Red faction has a variety of weapons: FCA-26 Rail Driver, UAR-42 Assault Rifle, F-1TL Fusion Rocket Launcher, URL-6T Rocket Launcher, UBS-4 Riot Shield, UFT-1 Flame Thrower, UCB-24 Control Baton, USP-16 Pistol, UAP-32/20 Sub Machine Gun, UAS-18 Shotgun, UHG-90 Offensive Hand Grenade, URC-15 Remote Charge, JF60 Heavy Suppression Machine Gun, MK/SG-1 Defender Pricision Rifle, and USG-50 Sniper Rifle. The massive combination of weapons provides a very deep gameplay experience allowing you to go for a close and personal combat all the way to a long-distant assassin. The scenery is highly destructible allowing you to blow holes into walls, destroy furniture, and even destroy parts of scenery making it fall onto enemies below.\n\n\nResults:\nRed Faction is an amazing first person shooter that offers amazing combat and a fantastic story. Red Faction may be an older title, but it offers features still not fully offered in games today. The campaign has pretty decent length and you will not be regretting the purchase. This game is a fantastic experience, and I would recommend getting it as part of the Red Faction Collection when it goes on sales. As the other titles of the series are definitely a great group of games.\n\nPros:\n+Loads of weapons.\n+Destructible environment.\n+Great difficulty curve.\n+Boss fights\n+Fun vehicle scenes.\n+Great gameplay that varies throughout the campaign from full blown action to assassin style.\n\nCons:\n-Audio levels make it hard to hear cinematic scenes when action is occurring.\n-Make sure to save a lot or when you die you will be wishing you did.\n-It is old, thus it has poor GFX (if you can't enjoy games for their content alone and you need them to be pretty you may want to avoid this).","August 2, 2014","true","9.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

It's one of the classics so if you're a fan of the original Half-Life you'll love this game too. It's a tad too long though with a mediocre story...\n\n\nPros:\n+ Great old school FPS action\n+ Great old school FPS movement\n+ Large choice of weapons\n+ Good level design\n+ 'Fully' destructible terrain\n+ Mediocre storyline\n+ Average voice acting\n+ Average characters\n+ Runs on a potato\n\n\nCons:\n- Jumping feels 'floaty'\n- Repetitive Enemies\n- Bad Dialogue & Script\n- Disappointing ending\n- A few frustrating game mechanics\n- 2001 graphics\n\nI really enjoyed this game, it's one of the classics that you need to pick up and play at least at one point. It took me around 8 hours to complete and I'd definitely recommend it anyone looking for that nostalgic feeling.\n\n\n\nMy personal experience:\nIt probably looks like I didn't enjoy this game from the pros and cons I labelled above but that's just because the game doesn't really offer much besides the whole FPS action it delivers. It's a great game and I love it! I can't really say the same for the second one though... I'm still trying to pull myself to continue with it... The HUD in that game... Urgh!\n\nI'll start with the obvious, the graphics are terrible but you can't expect much - the game was made in 2001. It's not like it actually matters though but if it really does bother you; then chances are you can find a mod somewhere on the internet that makes it a little more pleasing to the eyes. That being said; I'm not sure they could be considered 'good' for 2001 standards either but don't hold me on that!\n\nThe terrain and environment is where this game really does shine though, it has fully destructible terrain (bar a few materials here and there) really completing the feeling of shooting a rocket and blowing something up. The only real gripe I have here is that they could have really emphasised on it a little more, you use it once at the beginning to cut around a jammed door but that's really it, it's a shame but that may have improved in the future games - I'm still in the process of playing them! The level design is good as well, they all have the 'Outside Black Mesa' kind of feel to them and it's always nice to relive the old Half-Life feels every now and then...\n\nIt's the combat that really makes me love this game. It was made back in the days where Iron-Sights weren't a thing - the golden days of FPS in my opinion; but it's making a comeback! - the movement is solid and the player has complete control over it all. Remember, this is back in the days when scripted movement wasn't a thing, there's no cover based shooting, no vaulting, and most certainly no chest-high walls!\n\nThere are a few frustrating game mechanics though, some of the vehicle levels are just plain terrible, bumping into anything has the potential to instantly blow you up and overall the vehicles are just way too weak that you're better off going on foot half the time anyway  - you'll find yourself saving the game every 5 seconds if you're playing on Hard mode too. There's also one enemy which - in Hard Mode - is the worst thing I've ever had to play against, they're basically hackers; they one hit kill, they can see through walls and, shoot through walls. I panicked when I spawned and instantly died - I thought I had to restart from older saves - equally you also get the same gun and the same abilities as them so it's all pretty fair in the end... Well, except that there's only one of you!\n\nThat's about all I can say about this "Old but Gold" Classic, I'd recommend it to anyone who liked Half-Life, Quake or any of the old FPS style shooters out there. However, don't expect a good story - it's more of a filler.\n\n\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","April 6, 2015","true","8.9"," 32 of 48 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","32","48","3","8"

Our martian manpower will no longer be abused and neglected for corporate greed!\n\nThat's right, we're taking some Irreverend Opinions into Red Faction!\n\n---\n\nThe Blurb\nA first person shooter where you are the only one who can save the miners of Mars from oppression and effective slavery.  The exploitative and heavy-handed mining operation on Mars advertises itself as something very different to their workbase, and the corporation in charge seems happy to live up to the 'bad guy' template.  Spearhead the independence of the Red Planet!\n\nThe Good\nEnjoyable gameplay, though as of today (2015), it's a bit dated.  The AI is simple, but not unintelligent - giving yourself away means guards will track you down.  The plot is simple, but gives a good pace and leaves little doubt to who is deserving of the 'hero' title.\n\nThe weapons have a decent variety to them, and let you choose your preferences for taking opponents out, with their own feel and method of play.  You also get the feel of the main character being a miner, not a professional soldier, with the way that accuracy is handled - even with the reticle dead on, your shots may spread.  It's easy to visualise that as being drift from an inexperienced shot.\n\nThe Bad\nThe sound quality was a bit average, even for the time, with some noticeably cheap voice acting and special effects more akin to an arcade game than a first person shooter.  It's not bad enough to be cringeworthy, but it does break immersion pretty badly at times.\n\nAs said, the game's dated now, with graphics having been left well behind*.  The AI is a little predictable, running to you, shooting/hitting at you, and then running away if they get hurt, before returning to repeat the cycle.\n\n* The Pure Faction patch[www.purefaction.org] can fix many features for modern systems.\n\nThe Ugly\n"Destroyable terrain", huh?  For a game that made a big scene about this being so much of an important feature, they let the ball drop.  A handful of walls and floors can be broken through, but this amounts to a bit of padding around the rooms, and certainly doesn't carry into anything akin to walls collapsing, rockfalls, or anything else that this might engender, and certainly doesn't allow you to bypass set checkpoints arbitrarily strewn about.\n\nSuggestions\nHonestly, use the "Pure Faction" patch (listed above) to quickly get a big improvement to your game.  NB: The PureFaction patch will not display you as playing according to Steam's tracking.\n\nThe Summary\nWas a good game in it's time, much worth the 8/10 I'd give it.  Tried to break the mold for shooters and left an imprint on the industry.  Today, I'd still give it that - but this is from someone who doesn't mind the graphics in Minecraft.\n\n---\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","December 26, 2012","true","0.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Valerie-Valens/recommended/20530/","Valerie-Valens","~★PetSquirrel★~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Valerie-Valens/","647 products in account","There is a lot to say about this game, both good and bad. This game has a lot of design elements that aren't seen any more in other shooter franchises, for better or for worse. Seeing this game's multiplayer years ago during the early days of Counter Strike, I was enthralled by its advanced destruction physics and somewhat detailed gibs. Playing through the single player again recently, I nociced how fresh and different the weapon behaviours were.\n\nThe gameplay is fast and brutal, the enemies don't have a lot of health, and they have weapons that can rip you apart in an instant, encouraging players to play either carefully, or agressively. The weapons sound very meaty and are very satisfying to fire. There are also the inclusion of NPCs that react to your actions, either firing at them, pulling your weapon out, or approaching certain NPCs with an injury. In a way, there is a lot to be compared to Half-Life 1 with the fast, brutal encounters, the linearity with some tribute paid to exploration, the interactive NPCs, and the general Sci-Fi theme. What sets it apart though, are the advanced destruction physics which allows you to blow open walls and structures, sometimes revealing secret passages or shortcuts, giving players a feeling of agency.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of issues that hold this game back, the most noteable of which is the pathfinding AI, which frequently gets enemy NPCs stuck on geometry or simply shut-down, turning them into still statues until you start shooting at them. The stealth sections felt crowbared in as a very flimsy excuse to reset the player inventory for each act, and they are not very compelling or properly implemented as the enemy AI creates scenarios where stealthing through each section are nigh impossible. It is often better to just run through the enemies, as they're too inaccurate to land enough hits on you to kill you, or blow through them, as they provide more than enough supplies when they die. Not only that, the stealth sections are programmed so that you can never fall below 1 health. Another thing is that the weapons that the enemies use during the third act of the game pretty much makes it so that the best way to get through a section would be to save-scum after every encounter, since the snipers can shoot at you through walls with their Rail-Drivers and it's extremely random whether they would hit or not. There's also the weak major boss battles where the only weapon capable of defeating them is the flamethrower, and the ending which throws an arrow guessing game at you at random instead of an epic battle.  One more final thing that holds this game back is that, unlike Half Life 1, the graphics and model quality simply didn't age well.\n\nDespite its flaws though, there is a very good game underneath and I feel that had Volition had more time to polish and do QA testing, this game would be able to stand abreast of Half Life 1 as a landmark piece of gaming curios. Do I recommend this game? Definitely! There is a lot to like about this game, and for just $9.99 you can definitely do a worse than play this game. If you decide to pick this game up though, it is imperative that you download and install the Pure Faction 3.0 patch and the Pure Faction 3.0c beta update, as it adds a ton of fixes that improves the experience immensely, like widescreen resolution support and mouse raw input.","February 9, 2014","true","10.6"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/20530/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","A few years ago, I would have said to you: Red Faction? No way! And you would have probably told me: You never played it. Well, for once, you're wrong. Back then, I did try to play Red Faction. The problem is that I was already lost after a few seconds and my younger self didn't like open-world or games with multiple paths. And on a sale, months ago, I bought the four Red Faction games.\n\nRed Faction puts you in the shoes of a Martian miner, oppressed by the Ultor Corporation (who is also doing illegal stuff). One day, a guard triggers a riot in the mines and Parker (it's you), to survive, takes a weapon and begins to find his way while shooting the enemies. He knows about Red Faction, a rebellious group fighting Ultor. He becomes that day one of them and a hero. But Parker uncovers also nasty secrets...\n\nWhile the plot is basically common (the corporation doing illegal research and oppressing its employees), it's still interesting to see where it leads. To my big regret, I didn't really understand it. One moment, you're told about the plague, another one, it's about nanotechnology and the final one, it's about mercs. Anyway, the universe that was set seemed to have evolved into something more coherent but the fact is that the game isn't really answering some questions: Who is Eos? What's Masako background? And why are the guards so cruel? What about Parker? How come the Red Faction managed to infiltrate the Merc base? See, many questions, no answers.\n\nI know the gameplay: shoot, lock and load. But I must say that I really appreciate the passages where you can take control of a vehicle: submarine, helicopter, jeep, etc.. It was refreshing back then. Not even Half-Life had that diversity. Besides, when you consider the weapons, while they're the usual ones (rifles, pistols), some of them are just great to use... Too bad they arrived way late in the game. But still they're there. My only concern is the overpowered Merc. They can kill you quickly and sometimes, you don't know from where they're coming from, they're spawning endlessly (and you can see it actually). But put a Merc with a Railgun and you're dead immediately. Game over. Well, it's fair because if you use the weapon, it's the same result but sometimes, you're wondering how they can touch you when you're hidden. Or when the door is just opening. Also, the end of the game is pretty hard: so many enemies, so few health packs. Its result was that I was with 5 HP knowing that I had a Merc with a Fusion Rocket Launcher after the corner and that I couldn't run far enough before the explosion. I managed to survive. But after I don't know how many tries.\n\nAnd when I said that I was lost, it's true. I was often wondering what to do. I mean, I didn't have an objective put somewhere and given the Geo-Mod engine that will let you create your own path by destroying walls or floors, you can ask yourself where to go. And the developers made sure to make hesitate about the right way. For example, during your first stealth mission, Hendricks is only telling after a few minutes that you need to go on the third floor. So, the time I've wasted checking every office was frustrating me. And I didn't know where to go as some doors were guarded. That's an example of objectives not being precise enough.\n\nI can't really complain about the graphics: after all, the game was done at the end of the 90'. When you see graphics now, it's logic to think that they're ugly. However, I find them pretty good for the time. A little too brown for my taste but it's due to the time that the character spend in the underground, mines or other canyons. I really enjoyed the lab and the space station and part of the Merc base. What was also good was the fact that you could destroy nearly everything on your screen and kinda make your own path. It's something I didn't do apart if it was part of the story, because well, let's be honest: I'm not into explosive stuffs.\n\nAnother good thing is the soundtrack. It's suiting the game well. And the voice acting of Hendricks and Eos is good. Parker, though, sounded like a spoiled angry kid. And there is something that may contributed to my confusion and my misunderstanding of the story: sometimes, sound (voice and music) weren't playing and dialogues in the cut scenes weren't in sync. I don't know if it's a problem of old game - new computer or if it was already the case back then.\n\nAnyway, I don't know if I should play it again or not. Yeah, there are several levels of difficulty. But given my experience at the end of the game, I don't know if I would able to do harder than I did.\n\nRed Faction was also a game including multiplayer. I didn't try it, so I can't say anything about it. But I suppose that it was involving Red Faction and Ultor and that the Geo-Mod Engine played its part in it.\n\nAnd this is it. I can't say much more about that game. What is staying is that you should at least try it. Get over the graphics, get over the weird plot and enjoy the experience. After all, who doesn't want to be the hero of a revolution?\n\nPS: yeah, I published that first on another site and forgot to paste it here.","December 11, 2015","true","10.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

The controls are smooth and responsive, and whilst the default mapping is not entirely intuitive this can obviously be corrected quite easily. This smooth control scheme lays a solid base over which the rest of the game is very competently assembled.\n\nVisually, Red Faction is head and shoulders above many shooters of the time, offering varied locals (from claustrophobic mines, to sterile office environments, to sprawling underwater caverns), a good dose of atmosphere, and of particular note - fantastic lighting. The lighting in this game holds up so well that I often found myself just walking around the environment observing how the lighting effects the various surfaces around me. The levels are often non-linear, which can be confusing at times, but more often than not simply makes the environment feel like a more realistic, lived-in place. You can play multiple times and find new things every time, which for a game that is essentially a corridor shooter, is pretty cool, I think.\n\nGameplay is quite varied with well-designed gunplay supplimented with stealth, driving, flying, and submarine sections. The stealth is passable, and if you follow the rules everything works. The flying and diving vehicles control beautifully and blowing up an enemy sub underwater results in some great underwater explosion effects which are imaginative and impressive even in hindsight. There's a raft of fun weapons to use as well, most of which have their own alternate fire, including the most fantastically OP flamethrower in video game history.\n\nThe soundtrack is a standout, with wonderfully moody electronic tracks perfectly supplimenting the action, and giving the game an irreplacable personality.\n\nAnd of course I have to mention the environmental destruction. Whilst it isn't exactly a gameplay staple as much as it is a useful gimmick, it absolutely improves the experience when your battles dynamically scar the environment around you. Walking away from a gunfight with holes in the walls and scorch marks on all surfaces is a great feeling, and it's the moments when you forget about the mechanic, and then an enemy blows a hole in the wall you're hiding behind that you truly appreciate just how much this little touch does to improve the immersion. It's worth noting as well that this mechanic completely changes your multiplayer experience for the better, as you can strategically shatter your opponent's cover around them - I've never played more local VS. in my life than I did this game when I owned it on PS2.\n\nNow it's not perfect, of course - the voice acting for the NPCs is repetitive, and the quality of some of the character is often poor, but in saying that, it's not uniformly bad, so I can personally let it go. It's also a game that occasionally leaves you wondering where to go as there is no mission objective screen as far as I can tell. However, there's a number of problems that I solved by simply blowing giant holes in the wall until I made a path around the obstacle, and I'm still not sure if I did the right thing or not. I, for one, call that the mark of a pretty cool game. Other than that though, I'd have to nit-pick to name issues that really bugged me.\n\nRed Faction has single-handedly restored my faith in the quality of games released around the early 2000s - a time in which I feel a large number of developers' reach exceeded their grasp. Sure, it's not the most ground-breaking shooter, and it has its issues, most of which were somewhat characteristic of games at the time. But when it plays so well, and is so much fun, who cares? Given that I'd played it so much when I was younger, I expected nostalgia to be playing a large part in my judgements, but it's been so long that it was like playing it anew, and I just found myself genuinely excited by what the game offers.\n\nI'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun, well-designed shooter, with a decent amount of variety and some neat gameplay mechanics.","December 5, 2014","true","0.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weekendgameguy/recommended/20530/","weekendgameguy","Weekend Game Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weekendgameguy/","369 products in account","So let’s jump right into it. Red Faction is a first person shooter that was released in 2001 for the PC and PS2. It eventually found its way to other platforms including Mac and the Ngage (of all things).\n\nHere’s the plot…which was obviously inspired by Total Recall. The year is 2075. The Ultor Corporation is running a mining operation on Mars. The living conditions for miners suck at best and other miners are getting taken out by an incurable disease known simply as “The Plague”. You follow Parker a miner drawn in by Ultor’s promises of a new life as a miner. Parker finds himself at the forefront of a revolution.\nSo what can I say here; the story is actually quite good. The game itself is actually quite long; so there was several times that the story was what kept me from getting bored and quitting. The story is compelling there’s enough twists to keep things interesting….well until the very end at least. I found the ending to be a bit disappointing. But overall I dig it and for that I’m giving it an B.\n\nRed Faction is an older game. I mean it was originally released in 2001. I have to remind myself of that quite a bit because in my opinion the look has not aged well. The graphics have a jagged style typical of the time. I remember back when I first played it the games look was amazing. Things have changed. The game as it stands is displayed in a 4:3 format, but there’s a way around that. There is a community made patch called Pure Faction. Installing the patch opens up higher resolutions. And interesting thing to note is that playing this older title on newer hardware seems to have issues. I’m not sure if this is a problem with the game itself or with Pure Faction, but I encountered at least one glitch. In the sub bay before the underwater lab when you attempt to launch the sub; the sub just explodes. Why does this happen? Well it’s all about frame rates apparently if the games framerate goes above 200 frames per second the game glitches out causing the sub to explode. Fortunately with the help of Pure Faction you can counter act this issue. All you have to do is use Pure Faction to adjust the frames per second. I’ve left a link to the moment I figured it out in the playthrough.  While it’s true that the graphics haven’t exactly aged well I certainly wouldn’t toss them into the junk pile. So…B\n\nThe Cinematics in the game do their job. They convey the story during the in-between-bits. The game used in-game graphics rather than pre-rendered cutscenes. I usually like it when games do this. The game also throws on these little communication cinematics (Hendrix talking to you, or Eos bossing you around). I find these to be nice touches, and it certainly helps keep the story moving. Interestingly enough the cutscenes are probably the times that I noticed the age of the graphics the most. Jagged character models and choppy frame rate are typical of what you’ll run into. It’s entirely possible that some of the choppy framerates were because of the screen capture software. The cinematics aren’t bad…but they certainly aren’t great, and tossing in a lackluster ending….meh C it is.\n\nThe audio in the game is good but nothing to write home about. The only reason I say that is because there was nothing sound effects wise that ever really stuck out to me. Everything was pretty much what I would expect from a game of this type. As for the voice acting….well I’ve definitely heard better. The delivery seems off for me; all of the dialogue seems forced and unnatural. Once again…C\nThe soundtrack….holy crap the soundtrack…it’s cinematic…it’s huge…it’s well orchestrated. It’s awesome. The unfortunate fact is during the playthrough I muted all of the music. I had to. That is the nature of the Tubes. Just take my word for it….fantastic soundtrack. So the Music is an A all the way.\n\nControls are typical for FPSs. Keyboard and mouse all the way. This is where the age old argument continues. Keyboard/Mouse vs gamepad. Console gamer vs elite PC Master race. I’ll say this I have both the PC and PS2 version. And I have to say the PC control scheme is much more ideal. Honestly I get quite frustrated playing this with the pad. But that’s just me and that’s a personal preference; I’ve always preferred playing FPS titles on a PC with a mouse and keyboard. That being said there are ways to use a controller with the PC release of Red Faction, but I haven’t explored it. Using classic and what I feel the most ideal control scheme for a PC….that deserves an A.\n\nAll right let’s hit the gameplay. Overall you’re looking at some pretty standard point shoot bang bang action. However, the Geo Mod engine does add another layer of gameplay dynamic. The Geo Mod engine allows the user to modify the level. You can blast your own tunnels circumvent doors by going through walls….the world is your oyster.  When I first found this game way back when; I fell absolutely in love with the Geo Mod engine. I was obsessed with burrowing my own tunnels. But here’s the deal with Geo Mod it starts out really cool….and YES I will readily admit that it is a very cool idea…the thing is you end up using it less and less. To be entirely honest I barely used it after the first few stages. To kind of go with Geo Mod the game has included some pretty nice weapons…a healthy chunk of them are explosive in nature…that brings us to the fun of sticking mines to your enemies….good times….good good times. There are some other great weapons…sniper rifles, precision rifles…heck even the pistol is great. I have to recommend that you stick with the precision weapons. Like the precision rifle, sniper rifle or the rail driver….if you’re feeling crazy go with a rocket launcher. I had a tendency to steer clear of automatic weapons because the shot grouping for all of the automatic weapons is ridiculous. It’s nearly impossible to hit a target without using dang near all of your ammunition. My personal favorite weapon would have to be the Rail Driver. You see the Rail Driver allows you to 1. See through walls 2. Fire through said walls to take out enemies. The Rail Driver is even strong enough to take out hover crafts….I guess that’s what they are. Heck I even shot one through a wall without seeing it….probably one of the coolest accidental shots I’ve ever done. So, gameplay is pretty standard, Geo Mod is awesome but it wears thin…and the weapons are great (with the exception of the automatic weapons). Gameplay is good just not great…B\n\nThe final thing I wanted to discuss is the multiplayer mode. When I first got this game I think I ended up playing multiplayer mode more than the solo campaign. Playing it today really takes me back to the Good Ole Days of multiplayer gaming. No voice chat….it’s like heaven. The game is pretty old but I was pleasantly surprised to find that there is still a bit of a community playing the game. It’s funny because you’ll run into a lot of the same players quite a bit. As best I can tell there are still folks creating custom maps. This is pretty impressive in my opinion. It bears mentioning that it’s really in multiplayer mode that Geo Mod shines bright. In the course of a match a map will start out pristine and end up completely trashed. Sometimes it’s by design there will be hidden paths and powerups that are only accessible by blowing holes through stuff. So much fun. Multiplayer mode is awesome well worth playing… A\n\nSo let’s look at the report card. After looking at the arbitrary grades I gave the aspects I’ve discussed and assigning them a numeric value….and then calculating an average. Red Faction gets an overall B. Red Faction isn’t the greatest game in the world, but it has some nice aspects. Gameplay is solid, the soundtrack is excellent, and the multiplayer mode is still a boat load of fun. Overall it gets my recommendation.\n","January 1, 2015","true","0.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Yes, there still are at least 1-2 populated servers at all times. Why should one try it? First, you can "modify" the levels with explosives (there even exist hidden rooms with guns on some - if not all - maps). Second, the arsenal has some variety - for every FPS-fan's taste (featuring classic weaponry set + sniper rifle + rail-gun + some sweet rocket launchers - the latest are there not only for frags, but also for "creativity"). Third, if you like(d) Half-Life 1 DM, the old CS or Quake, you should definitely try this one - it's a really great old-school hardcore kill-playground!","March 12, 2014","true","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is pretty good, although the game can make it a little hard to follow at times.\n\nI have found that it can be easy to miss certain buttons that you need to properly complete the game, but overall the layout of levels and such is very good. The AI for enemies is pretty terrible, and increaing/decreasing the difficulty will basically speed up the strafe rate of enemies. You've probably experienced this before if you've ever played an old game.\n\nPlayed using keyboard & mouse. No issues with controlling throughout the game.\n\nGraphics are ok for the age of the game. Everything is ok until you start blowing the environment up, then things start to get a bit wierd.\n\nSome of the parts of the OST are a bit too overly dramatic and loud, but most of it is pretty good. Very dramatic when needed and the base ambiance music is very nice. The sound quality is ok considering how old the game is.\n\nSurprisingly, there are still some multiplayer servers out there running.\n\nThis game is a ngihtmare to get running initially (If you don't have DX8), but once you have everything set up it will work fine. The URL "purefaction.org" will come in handy, and check out the forums & guides for more detail on how to get everything set up if you have issues.\n\nTo reiterate, definitely worth it if you are a fan of the series, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend getting it.","June 2, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Beating this game again To my joy I still zipped thru the levels with ease and remembered alot of the hidden weapon stashes along the way.

So a little bit of previous knowledge will help here. I got this with Red Faction 2 and 3 but I played 3 first because it was new and recent.. (at the time at least). So basically what's so great about Red Faction? Its basically just another Half Life ish game... though with its own unique stuff. Its hard to really say what makes it great but I honestly really enjoy it. Its not long or hard but its fun. Its fun for its time and even fun for now. Its old yes but I think it has charm. It tackles the FPS genre from a cool angle.. what if everything was destructable? You need to get past a laser grid.. just blow up the wall next to it and walk around it. Need to go to the basement.. just blow up the floor and drop down. Its about mining so the vehicles are diggers and drillers which althrough maybe terrible to drive due to games not having figured out vehicles in FPS games yet.. they are cool.\n\nIts hard to really review this.. but it is good.. and if you liked some of the new Red Faction games you might end up liking this one.","January 21, 2015","true","9.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What impressed me the most is the destructible enviroments this game has to offer. You can break or destroy virtually anything; rock walls, metal walls, etc., and make a sort of "cave" out of the destruction. The only con that I can come up with is that there is only manual saves and no auto-save feature. This game is worth the money, even when it isn't on sale. Later when I play more of it, I'll review for the story.\n\nSo far, I really recommend this game. I can't wait to play the following games. "-/10" coming after I beat the game.\n\nSUGGESTION: I would recommend getting the Pure Faction 3.0 mod for this game and installing the "beta" patch. It includes mainly a new launcher, widescreen options including 1080p resolutions, and enhanced graphics options including better polygon models. There is a community guide explaining how to properly install the mod.","August 1, 2014","true","0.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

You have to remember the graphics are from 2001 and keeping that in mind the game was great, although it did have a few downfalls. Some good things were the fully destructible environments; the story was easy to follow, although simplistic. The guns felt unique and different, with lots of creativity put into them. And the levels felt big, and somewhat open. Not to mention the voice acting wasn't bad either. But some of the bad things come from the voice syncing itself. Sometimes it would get so bad that characters lips would move and 5 seconds later they would talk. I’m not sure if this is just a problem on modern systems, or if it’s just a bug in the game itself. Also some parts feel more cheap that difficult, but that can be remedied quickly by trial and error and LOTS of quick saving (F6). And the two main bosses are pretty much the same, repetitive shoot until they fall, then shoot them until they die. The worst part about this game though is probably the ending; I don't want to spoil it for anyone reading this so I’ll just say it’s a completely random puzzle. All that aside this game turned out to be great, and holds up today. I had a blast playing it and was pretty much glued to my computer while playing it. I would recommend this game with a solid 8.5/10\n\n~Hobo With A Shotgun(Agent 13)\n","October 26, 2014","true","11.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

D:<\n\n\nOk so after letting this out of my chest, I gotta say I enjoyed that long walk on (underground) Mars.\nThe game feels very nice for its time, it has a very nice set weapons selection and some very good elements regarding destroyable environments.\n\nThe story is not reaaaaaally that interesting, but it has its twists and 2 good hard boss battles to take care of. What bothered me is that it just throughs you right down in the pit of action not really knowing what is going on and why everything is going on. The story lacks to explain to you why the red fanction even exists at the very beginning. On the very first minute of the gameplay you are just left to rush your @ss into a riot against your employers. Why? "because life is hard being a miner on Mars with those evil @ss employers that's why!!" which is barelly a reason enough to motivate you join the battle moral-wise. Later on, the story gets a bit better and the action feels satisfying as your guns get better, you get to ride some vehicles, your enemies get harder to kill and you even get to visit a huge-@ss spaaaace statiooon! Story-wise, provided that the riot has already happened for its own reasons (hard way of living as a miner there), the script gets some interesting plot twists as you slowly get to witness a series of experiments done on the people who work there by the EVIL CORPORATIOOooOON!!. .\n\nIn addition I was surprised there was such a good job done over voice acting in this game. Your main character is cool too.\n\n\nThere's nothing else to say really. If you find this on a special offer you got one more reason to join this cool franshise!!

I thought it was amazing, blowing holes through terrain to create other paths through the mines and gameplay in the Half Life vein. I never got to play past the mines and for some reason never bought the game even though I loved the demo. Playing it now I can see what a missed opportunity the game was. After the mines the game takes a turn for the worst, with the destructability and improvisation of the mines replaced by static office environments with no destructabilty or walls that can be destroyed looking the same as walls that can't. The levels turn into box shaped rooms with hardly any detail and just feel empty by design. The weapons for the most part are pretty good except for the weak feeling pistol but it still takes a lot of ammo to put down the enemies even with the bigger weapons and so can make them feel weak.\nThe acting in the game is also terrible, back when the game was released it may have been acceptable and I'm just spoiled by todays voice work in games but it's bordering on Resident Evil quality.\nI'm still recommending this game to anyone who wants to get into the Red Faction series because there are plot points continued through the sequel it would be useful to know but don't expect it to be a good experience because the game has not aged well.","December 21, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But i had to say that Red Faction is s-hit, and its not a decent shooter. But don't forget that Chaser is also a s-hit too. Both games are on mutual agreement of a long time running competition of s-hitty games world championships. In b4, all games that are related with mars s-hitty cliche stories are sheet at that time. And I think that you're the one to blame for, Total f-ucking Recall. Dont get me wrong, Total Recall is a good movie, but it inspires s-hitty devs to make tons s-hitty games.\n\n"Give it excuse will ya its from 2001, what do you expect?".\n\nf-uck no. Quake 2 and Half Life has already out at that time. There's no excuse, you wanna make a good shooter games?  Then make a shooter like Quake 2 and Half Life. Otherwise make a game about something else. Maybe a game for stupid kids to play? Or make a game about s-hitting in a restroom where the walls are actually mirrors that can be seen from outside (people can see you taking a s-hit). Just stay the f-uck off from shooter genre if you can't make it as good as Quake 2 and Half Life.\n\nYes, if you're saying there's a decent shooter from early 2000's, then I expect it to be as good as Quake 2 and Half Life. Everything about this game is bad. Stay the f-uck away unless it comes from a bundle.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIt's a short game, I finished it under 3 hours.

It's coupled with simple lighting/fog effects and the killer sound track that is unforgetable that fits situations and feelings perfectly.\n\nThe geo mod was a pretty sweet feature back in the day, where sometimes instead of killing in death match, you just wanted to see how far and large you could dig maze like structures or go secret finding. There is a large varity of weapons with signature sound effects and some really neat level designs.\n\nWhat hasn't aged well is the cutscenes and multiplayer. Most the multiplayer is shooting across large maps with the infintly accurate sniper and precision rifle which with mouse aiming, makes it pretty boring.\nThe characters are mostly forgetable and story somewhat hokey, but you won't care as you are immersed in blasting your way out of Ultor fighting for your freedom and an answer to the plague.\n\n9/10 easily\n\n","March 17, 2015","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/recommended/20530/","OperationalOperator","Ridah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/","519 products in account","The biggest diffrentiator between this and many other games of the time is the Geomod technology. Unfortunately the actual in game usage of this really cool tech is extremely limited. I really liked it at first, using this tech to dig around locked doors was cool....but I only got to do that once along with blowing up a bridge and then the game turned into another sub par shooter of the time.\n\nA couple of the biggest issues are how innacurate guns are regardless of how you use them, there is always a ridiculously sized cone of fire which is espeicially terrible when your shooting long distances as often as you have to.\n\nThe AI is ♥♥♥♥ing bat ♥♥♥♥ crazy and will strafe all over the place and run back and forth like theres something wrong with them. They will rarely attempt any sort of tactics or sample any sort of intelligence. Most the time you can just leave the room they are in and they will be unable to follow you because they are so stupid. They arn\'t fun to play against, combine the poor accuracey with their movement and its like shooting squireels on crack from a hundred yards away with a .22lr.\n\nThe bossbattles that are here suffer from really bad AI and really bad scripting. Theres a point where you have to lure a robot into a garbage disposer which is really terrible because the AI just don't want to follow you unless you really try your best to bait them. Even then its sheer luck if they decide to follow you. Which made a condition where I had to just try the same thing many times over trying to bait this stupid robot only to die and then load the save and try again before he jankily ended up above the burning pit of garbage disposing. At which point I opened the doors to it and he slid slowly down the wall of the pit then dissappeared. Completely anti-climatic and what I thought was a fun set peice turned out to be a huge ♥♥♥♥ing waste of time.\n\nAnd in general the game isn\'t really at all interesting or fun. Alot of the time the voice mixing will be so bad you don\'t know where your supposed to go or the game will downright not tell you what in gods name your supposed to do next so your forced to waste time backtracking and guessing.\n\nDifficulty is very poorly balanced. Medium/Normal can be ridiculously hard bordering on nigh impossible while easy is so easy that you don\'t have to worry about getting shot or dying at all unless you let the enemies kill you. Its either climbing everest or walking up a small hill. I don\'t even want to try impossible.\n\nIn summary its just not very fun. They offer a decent amount of variety but at its core the shooting gameplay just isn\'t fun. It isn\'t fun to play against spazzing NPCs and its not fun to have a game be overly easy or overly difficult.\n\nHalf Life 1 was released 3 years prior to this game and it feels like they were still behind in every way but physics and technology in general. I would rather play \"On a Rail\" than continue playing this game. It would have been an okay game at the time I would imagine but the base gameplay here just isn\'t very fun and theres little actual variation. Its just not fun or satisfying to kill anything in this game. Thats all I can really say, at the end of the day the core gameplay of an FPS is more important than anything to me at this point and Red Faction just isn\'t a very fun game to play in alot of ways similiar to the later game RF Gureilla which the shooting and AI were also very poor and not fun.\n\nI also found plenty of forum posts detailing the same issues they had with the game that I did that were dated around the time the game came out. This isn't an issue of entiltled modern consumer whining but rather the game was always ♥♥♥♥.","June 1","false","1.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

As the game progresses you and enemies become more and more like glass cannons which makes certain areas a chore to get through even on medium difficulty.  At a certain point it goes from challenging to tedius, and that happened in a few places for me.  Also, IT DOES NOT SAVE AT CHECKPOINTS!  I want to stress that point as that's a  feature we take for granted now, and I paid for that assumption about an hour into the game when I died for the first time for a stupid reason and had to start all over.\n\nI also used the Pure Faction mod others talked about and it worked really well.  I don't think it's a requirement to use it to enjoy the game but if you don't mind taking a bit to set it up, it doesn't hurt anything.","August 2, 2014","true","5.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's not a terrible game, but it's not really worth the time to play it, and it gets really boring very quickly.\n\nYou don't need to play this one.

The game is a "Half-Life clone" in the same way a lot "realistic" games in this era attempted to be but ended up inferior to Half-Life. I found this game to be very annoying and a lot of elements to be arbitrary form many reasons in both story and gameplay. Note; This review is done with someone who has already played this in mind. Reading won't ruin the experience however. No multi-player review, only single-player campaign.\n\nStory\nThe voice acting is hilariously bad although I can't blame it considering the time.\nHendrix's motivations are never explained  So I don't feel the least bit symapathetic when he dies\nPlot feels like its being made as you go along with no clear goal. Things like mercenaries and space stations are thrown at you out of no where. A clear example is that there is no clear villian and new enemies are constantly introduced (Ultor, Capek, Masako)\nPlot doesn't get to much in the way of gameplay\nCutscenes are kept to a minimal but are unskippable (which gets annoying when your replaying the same section for the fiftieth ♥♥♥♥ing time that day)\n\nGraphics/Sound/Technical\nGraphics haven't aged well, but then again barely anything from this time did.\nEnemies possess the wizardry to be able to see and shoot at you through walls.\nIt it sometimes unclear what environments are destructable\nSound design is fine. NPC dialouge and soundtrack get repeatative.\nThere is a glitch/bug in the middle of the game that stops progression by exploding a submarine you need just because you have a high framerate. I was forced to install external mods to fix it. The section can be passed without it but it is a major inconveniance.\nLevels become increasingly dull with the exclusive color palette of red, brown, and grey corridors/caves take about 75% of the game.\nGAME HAS NO AUTO SAVE. IF YOU DIE WITH NO SAVE/QUICK SAVE FILE, YOU HAVE TO START FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE DAMN GAME. Would've been nice to warn me before my first death.\n\nGameplay\nAn FPS clearly inspired by Half-Life but fails to capture the elegance in design and story. Various nitpicks I have which pile up to get annoying.\nThe melee weapon takes way to long to activate which defeats the purpose of a melee weapon in the first place which is something to whip out when in close range and in a pinch. Some weapons become virtually useless in the later parts of the game (shotgun, pistol, grenades, flamethrower). Speaking of grenades I almost never used them because of their wierd detonation timing, throwing and pitiful range. Most of these problems occur because enemies tend to stay afar and fire from medium to long range, whereas in Half-Life there would be aliens that required close ranged and flanked based combat.\nEnemies lack variety with their guns being the only varient.\nGeo-Mod technology is pretty pointless. It can be used to find secrets and stuff but the game never actually encourages it use and it doesn't have to be used for the whole game.\nRocket launchers have pitiful splash damage and terrible accuracy.\nVehicles are clunky and awkward to control\nButtons are necessary to progress and are tiny, easy-missed things that are put in stupid locations\nGames gets relentlessly difficult at some points. I was at the point of frustration where I had to turn on God Mode. This will no doubt give demoters of the review so-far the impression that I suck at the game. But I was at one point forced to face 3 combat vehicles and a hallway of about 20 enemies near the end of the game with 3 health. I was going down a tram when I stopped to a group with enemies that carried one-hit kill weapons. The fight with Capek is not won by skill with weapons aquired so far or through clever use of the Geo-Mod technology, but with hitting him with the flamethrower one time, a boss fight being a test of the skills you learned up to that point. That is not good game design.\n\nI liked some parts like the pseudo-stealth sections where you pretend to be someone else, and the times when the game gets more fast paced with good old fashoined shooting using cover and such. There also multiple paths sometimes which can get you different results.\n\nOverall, I don't recommend for $10. Get it for $2 or less on sale and only play if you are excrementally bored.","November 6, 2015","false","8.6"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","12"

Yet it feels right either way. Other than that thats where i begin to dislike the game.\n\nFor one, lets just start with dialog of the guards, Either every other guard is bipolar, or just cant make up their mnd because they go from being overly-cocky saying they'll kill you, then running away saying they surrender, and then go back to shooting you, saying more cocky things.\nThen there is the voice acting, Hardly any of the voices in the game could be really considered good. Most are at most, annoying.\nAfter that there are parts of the game that make little to no sense. Such as getting to use a Submarine for the first time; You were told to grab a submarine, Well, Its connected to a magnet on a ceiling, and there is a control room nearby. The door is locked, and the guy inside isnt doing anything. So you blow down the wall with a rocket launcher or some other explosive and press the button. The magnet lowers towards the water. and then out of nowhere, the Submarine explodes for little to no reason. As i found out, the Submarine was required, since you end up having to fight other submarines, which is kind of hard to do since not many weapons work underwater, and the torpedos they fire seek into you. So just to proceed, I was forced to cheat just to get on to the next area. Which brought me to a stealth section of the game.\n\nDont get me started on how stupid stealth sections are.\n\nEdit: Some other things about this game i dont like i forgot to mention;\nFor one, the lack of autosaves. This really bugs me whenever i die and have to go back at least 10 minutes or more. It gets really tedious and frustrating at times. Especially during some fights. However once mercs are introduced, so is the Rail Driver; The other thing i hate with this game.\nNo seriously, ♥♥♥♥ that thing. Its a one hit kill. So many time i forget to save and im punished by being ripped a new one for going too fast or not focusing down the guy with the rail driver.","May 26, 2014","false","5.4"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

But honestly a very mediocre game.\n\nPositives\n-Gun Variety\n-Weapons and explosions sound good.\n-Geomod Engine\n-Vehicle controls top notch\n-Soundtrack pretty good\n\nNegatives\n-Story extremely dry, especially towards the end with new main characters being introduced more than halfway through the game.  The main character is completely unlikeable and the other characters who I assume you are meant to care about are very 2D with almost no personality. The guards all have some hatred towards miners for a reason that is never explained. You are reminded of this with them saying 'Miner scum!' every 5 seconds. There is no incentive to go anywhere and it feels like the reasons to go from one place to the next are just made up on the spot.\n-Voice acting and cutscenes are alright at the best of times and ususally cringe inducing.\n-Graphics are bad even for a game that came out in 2001.\n-Landscape is boring and levels are often the same corridors/red caves OVER AND OVER. There is almost no variety in the level design and the levels are often stuck together very badly e.g. when you are in a mining/disposal area and you take a 5 second pipe journey to the science labs.\n-Enemies are overpowered for the majority of the game (when playing on normal) mainly the railgun guys who ONE SHOT you whenever you turn a corner, forcing you to save the game before almost every corner at the end of the game.\n-Geomod Engine used about 5 times throughout the game in very scripted formats.\n-Online seems impossible to use for a new player as the servers all say that my level is not high enough when I try to join. It doesnt even display what level I am.\n-Endgame was awful with a recycled boss fight and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ timed puzzle as the last thing you do. One of the most unsatisfying endgames ever.\n-So much more to say e.g stealth missions, useless companions, npc glitches, those aliens in the caves that were almost impossible to hit, things like monitors which seemed like they were going to be useful but didnt get used at all properly.\n\nIn conclusion this game seems very dated and a lot of the game seems rushed and copied from half life.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkaChoWee/recommended/20530/","SkaChoWee","little Lord Titty Slamma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkaChoWee/","61 products in account","this is a really long review. So please, bare with me.\n\ni got this game and it's terrible. But at the same time there is something intriguing about it that kept my playing until the Gryphon pseudo stealth part. Which was absolute nonsense. I am surprised people have good things to say about this game. but i have to say otherwise.\n\nto start off i don't understand the comparison to half life at all. the only kind of resemblance it shares is that it takes place in a facility. Thats it. there is nothing that comes even close to half life . From the puzzles to the enemies or intriguing storyline. i think it's kind of insulting to compare this garbage to a classic first person shooter. call me neckbeard or an elitist for it but lets face it this game doesn't hold a candle to half life.\n\nas far as story goes,you play as some guy, who has a name but i didn't bother to remember, going through this facility blasting ♥♥♥♥ on behalf of some rebellion and that's truly it. There is no other challenge other than maybe a stealth section or figuring out where the hell you are supposed to go. i made progress not because of interesting level design, but because out of pure accidental luck. there was so little variety in environment that i m surprised i got to where i am now. it's monotonous to say the least.\n\nenemy variety is limited. they really aren't tactile enemies. their main tactics include and are limited to: running straight at you. standing in one place, shoot. cower or not even notice you until after you have taken out at least half a gang of mindless cronies. the only time they pose a threat is on higher difficulty settings. But that's purely artificial. You take more damage and they take more shots to kill. Also. there might be something wrong with hitboxes in this game. Since you can shoot an enemy at point blank with a shotgun and they will still take three shots to kill. And i'm not talking about the slightly armored ones i'm talking about the regular dummies that are supposed to be a threat.\n\nthe controls aren't exactly a benefactor. It feels so light and floaty. There is a lack of weight behind certain actions. Like reloading a gun, recoil or even things like jumping and character interaction. it feels hollow and it makes the game lacking in any sort of feeling.\n\nthe graphics are outdated to say the least. that's all there can be said about the graphics. But they aren't ashamed of the fact that a lot of elements were copy/pasted which lend to the games boring feel. You'll run into countless clones on both sides of the fight. and yeah, that's not to say Half life wasn't guilty of the same thing. But in that game there was creative level design that used the visual assets to good use. and also a plethora of enemies, characters and assets that kept the game from becoming a repetitive snoozefest. But this isn't supposed to be me talking about half life. I'm supposed to talk about this game. this game is so bad that i'm talking about other, more better games in this review. the character concepts in this game are as vanilla as bad guys can get. The only interesting thing i ran into was a ♥♥♥♥ing fish out of all things.\n\nthe sound design is awful. Voice acting is okay, but nothing outstanding or worthy of praise. Guns sound stupid or generic. The enemy punchlines are hilarious in the worst way. and the supporting cast of allies come across as whiny or ♥♥♥♥♥y. There is no reason to feel sympathetic towards the people telling you what to do or where to go. Because all they do is nag. i just wonder if they have enough cheese to go with all that whine. also everybody sounds the same. There is no variety in voice actors. you know what i mean with that.\n\nSome shooters survive the test of time. Games like half life, halo, duke nukem, doom, wolfenstein, etc... are all games that till this day are still a blast to play through from beginning to end. Red faction is not one of those games. This game aged very poorly. And it's just sort of sad that people give it praise because of it's "revolutionary" engine or just for pure nostalgia's sake. But we're (mostly) grown ups here. And it's time to move on. If you still have red fever. Just play red faction guerrilla. Sure, it's not an FPS, more like a free roaming game in space. But that game is fun. Albeit not great. It's still a million fold better than this game. and even then. You are doing yourself a big disservice just getting his game for nostalgia. Spend that money on something better.

I bought it for a buck and heard it was really good. However on the PS2 the only thing I could seem to concentrate on were the really inaccurate controls that were so bad that the auto aim system simply made the game playable. Without the auto aim the game was impossible to play. So when I got into PC gaming I decided to pick this version up for 2 bucks because of mouse and keyboard controls. Well, mouse and keyboard didn't help me out as much as I thought they would which brings me to my first issue with this game. The enemies move abnormally fast which would be ok if they didn't take an absolute ton of bullets. They will take less if you shoot them in the head all the time but if you hit them anywhere else they are like sponges and alot of times your ammo supply does not allow for tons of sloppy shooting or body shots. Then there is this amazing story and unparalleled humor that everyone raves about in this game. It might have been something back in it's day, but it dramatically pales in comparison to a game like Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. I played through the entire game and never had any laugh out loud moments.\n\nFortunately the game was not a complete waste. Halfway through the game you do get some much better and very well deserved weaponry that makes the already difficult game much more enjoyable as you are not horribly underpowered anymore. The game is still very challenging and you will die, but it will actually be fun instead of feeling so one sided. The end boss fight made you feel helpless and bored at the same time as you would get your ♥♥♥ handed to you until you discovered where to run and hide. Then it was so easy it was almost insulting. Overall if the first half of the game had been as balanced as the second half it may have been worth while. Just when I started having fun with the game it ended.","June 17, 2014","false","14.8"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

Being the chonologically obsessive guy I am, I had to start rom the beginning. I was surprised that this game was originally released in the first month or so of the PS2's release. I was even more surprised on how absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game was.\n\nThe overall story is pretty simple. It's your basic FPS with a variety of weapons killing the same guards over and over as you try to escape Mars from the oppressive mining organization Ultor. Later, you realize Ultor has been experimenting on the miners for some undisclosed reason. Must be a new evil pasttime. As soon as you dispatch the evil cyborg scientist, who evidently is also a magic user somehow, you continue your quest. However, then you have mercenaries drop in on you, along with their ruthless commander, who ALSO has unexplained magic powers.\n\nGraphics seem like they belong in the old Quake games, characters forgetable, and the voice acting is laughable. Gameplay is as simple as it gets; go from point A to point B while shooting down anyone and anything within sight. I do applaud the little bits that break the linear paths. Every so often, there's an alternate path in which you can traverse, and end up completely skipping a wave of enemies you'd normally face if you went the obvious route.\n\nThe biggest problem I had was the enemy AI. At the beginning, the evil guards are laughable, the way they seem to dance all over the place and shout at you in a very cartoonish manner. "Miner scum!" "Where do you think YOU'RE going, miner trash?". For those who enjoy sneaking behind a group of enemies and catching them unawares will be repeatedly disappointed, as the enemy seems to have eyes in the back of their head. And as soon as ONE guard notices you, everyone and their mother unloades on you. It gets even more difficult in the second half of the game when the guards take many more shots (and multiple headshots) to kill, and your still as weak as ever. These armored up baddies also can blast you with one-shot killing rail guns, which they tend to fire just as soon as you pass around the corner. Sometimes, they don't even have to see you; their rail gun shots go through walls. Many rage moments were had.\n\nThis game has so many glitches in it that I could go on and on about all of which that I've encountered...but I think you get the overall message.\n\nDon't. Just don't.","September 17, 2013","false","8.0"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","0"

It’s a damn shame they almost forgot to use that feature at all. You’ll get few spots here and there where you can blow stuff up and it’s mostly cosmetic. The game looks way worse than Unreal which was released three years earlier. It is also a lot emptier and the enemies are more boring. It’s weird that unlike in Crysis shooting the aliens in Unreal feels a lot more satisfying than shooting the soldiers in Red Faction. There’s just no feel to it at all. At first I was a bit intrigued by the levels since there were some interesting little bases on the red planet but then it just turns literally into running through corridors and shooting everything. The story might’ve been interesting if not for the horrible writing.

I believe part of this is due to the save features, which can screw you over in certain parts of the game. I could be wrong; I don't exactly remember my play-through of the PS2 version. All I know is, you can doom yourself in the exploding space shuttle stage if you save without enough time to possibly escape and you've neglected to keep older saves to back you up. The PS2 version also featured only a few of the PC multiplayer maps, which mainly included ones that were small enough for 1 on 1 fights. Considering the game only supports two players, this made the experience faster than on the PC, where players would be lacking and large maps would quickly become boring hunts for players to kill. The single player is relatively easy and trite, not to mention that it only lasts about, what, four hours? I could be wrong, but I swear I beat it that fast. Not sure I'll play through it again. Still to the PS2 version maybe? It's only good for playing with friends in the same room.","December 9, 2013","false","2.3"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","0"

Man, was I a fool".\n\n(Story)\n\nThe year is 2075.  Earth's resources are dwindling forcing the colonization and resource mining of other planets.  The Ultor Mining Corporation has set up shop on Mars and regularly brings work and security personnel to the planet via shuttles from Earth.  Aimless protagonist Parker decides to spend a year working in the mines in an attempt to figure out what he wants to do with his life.  Upon arriving on Mars however, he sees a very different picture than the one Ultor's recruitment campaign painted on Earth.  Forced to work in terrible conditions, miners live under the authority of Ultor's private military.  Making matters worse is the mysterious "plague" spreading among the miners and Ultor's restriction of flight's back to Earth.  The flash point is reached on a seemingly routine day and Parker soon finds himself in the midst of a revolution.\n\n(Gameplay)\n\nPlayed in first person, gameplay is mostly shooting and exploration, with a few stealth levels thrown in for variety.  Red Faction is very akin to Half Life, requiring you to solve puzzles and defeat bosses/enemies in special ways without too much hand-holding.  Levels load as you play and string together much as they did in Half Life.  What made Red Faction unique was the Geo-Mod technology.  Using explosives or drills, Parker can blast his way through rock, concrete, and other materials, giving Red Faction a degree of player freedom.  Enemies driving over a rock chasm?  Destroy the bridge they are on and watch them fall.  Can't find a way to open that door?  Use C4 to make a tunnel next to it.\n\nThere are several vehicle segments in the game, where Parker may pilot drilling equipment, submarines, tanks, or fighter craft.  On foot, Parker has a vast arsenal of weapons from shotguns and assualt rifles to rocket launchers and even a flamethrower (hilarious to use).  The stealth levels require Parker to use a disguise, silenced weapons and to hide bodies.  These segments are my least favorite and can be aggravating at times.  Boss fights are occasional, though some are more memorable/innovative than others.  Ammunition can get scarce at times, even requiring you to go into a fight with a few rounds in each weapon.  Make no mistake, this can be a difficult game if you do not play it a certain way.\n\n(Design)\n\nUltor's underground facilities and mines feel vast thanks to good environment design.  Mine tunnels, vast caverns, underwater bases, executive offices, military installations, and the Martian surface are all different in sight and sound.  Guns have a nice sharpness to them and exlosions create debris and balst marks.  Voice acting is good though at times the characters sound a little mono-tone.\n\n(Final Comments)\n\nHalf Life with vehicles and destructible environments is a good metaphor for Red Faction.  Parker's story is different than Freeman's but if you enjoyed the journey through Black Mesa, you will likely enjoy traversing the mines of Mars.  Challenging yet oddly satisfying, Red Faction will slick your thirst for destructible landscapes and a decent stroy in retro fashion.\n\nJust don't forget to quicksave!\n\n","December 2, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your job is to aid the revolution as best as you can, and call in the Earth Defense Force to free the miners permanently from their slavery.

The game gives a fair amount of background to the setting, you play as Parker a miner on the planet Mars and a member of the Red Faction, a rebal group. From what the game tells you the conditons of the mines are horrible and everone is worked to death and the guards don't give a rats ♥♥♥, there is also a plague going around in the mine that is killings hundreds of miners. The goal of the game is to overthrow the Ultor. I played through the entire game in about 3 hours and 15 minutes, so yes this is a very short game. I can not stress enough this game is short but very hard, It's been a long time since I have considered a game to be "hard"  but this game delivers! There are really only a few things I didn't like about the game the main thing was the MASSIVE difficulty curve about half way through the game, your just running around with your handgun and assult rifle killing guards easy as pie, then all of a sudden a new enemy type is brought up called "Mercenaries" a LOT of them carry a gun most of us know as a Gauss Rifle which will kill you in one hit no matter what, oh also the enemys can shot it through objects. The final thing I don't like is that it lacks in originality, IMO, if you have played Half-Life a game that came out around 3 years before Red Faction you will notice a unsettling amount of similarities, the game feels the same to play, the textures are similar the doctors have the exact same animation when healing you. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS that none of that bad stuff matters, it doesn't take away from the game at all, like I said before the game is very short but it is a fair story that for once makes sense. I had a large amount of fun playing this game and I recomend it to anyone who likes a FPS with a good challenge.\n\nMy final rating of the game is a 88/100\n\nMined alien rocks, would do it agian.","August 5, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

There is a lot rage potential since there are a lot explosive weapons as well as a railgun that allows you to see and shoot through walls.\n\nThe weapons are definitely a plus in this game. We have the usual stuff such as shotguns, sniper rifles and machine guns, but also flamethrowers, railguns and rocket launchers.

Man, was I a fool".\n\n(Story)\n\nThe year is 2075.  Earth's resources are dwindling forcing the colonization and resource mining of other planets.  The Ultor Mining Corporation has set up shop on Mars and regularly brings work and security personnel to the planet via shuttles from Earth.  Aimless protagonist Parker decides to spend a year working in the mines in an attempt to figure out what he wants to do with his life.  Upon arriving on Mars however, he sees a very different picture than the one Ultor's recruitment campaign painted on Earth.  Forced to work in terrible conditions, miners live under the authority of Ultor's private military.  Making matters worse is the mysterious "plague" spreading among the miners and Ultor's restriction of flight's back to Earth.  The flash point is reached on a seemingly routine day and Parker soon finds himself in the midst of a revolution.\n\n(Gameplay)\n\nPlayed in first person, gameplay is mostly shooting and exploration, with a few stealth levels thrown in for variety.  Red Faction is very akin to Half Life, requiring you to solve puzzles and defeat bosses/enemies in special ways without too much hand-holding.  Levels load as you play and string together much as they did in Half Life.  What made Red Faction unique was the Geo-Mod technology.  Using explosives or drills, Parker can blast his way through rock, concrete, and other materials, giving Red Faction a degree of player freedom.  Enemies driving over a rock chasm?  Destroy the bridge they are on and watch them fall.  Can't find a way to open that door?  Use C4 to make a tunnel next to it.\n\nThere are several vehicle segments in the game, where Parker may pilot drilling equipment, submarines, tanks, or fighter craft.  On foot, Parker has a vast arsenal of weapons from shotguns and assualt rifles to rocket launchers and even a flamethrower (hilarious to use).  The stealth levels require Parker to use a disguise, silenced weapons and to hide bodies.  These segments are my least favorite and can be aggravating at times.  Boss fights are occasional, though some are more memorable/innovative than others.  Ammunition can get scarce at times, even requiring you to go into a fight with a few rounds in each weapon.  Make no mistake, this can be a difficult game if you do not play it a certain way.\n\n(Design)\n\nUltor's underground facilities and mines feel vast thanks to good environment design.  Mine tunnels, vast caverns, underwater bases, executive offices, military installations, and the Martian surface are all different in sight and sound.  Guns have a nice sharpness to them and exlosions create debris and balst marks.  Voice acting is good though at times the characters sound a little mono-tone.\n\n(Final Comments)\n\nHalf Life with vehicles and destructible environments is a good metaphor for Red Faction.  Parker's story is different than Freeman's but if you enjoyed the journey through Black Mesa, you will likely enjoy traversing the mines of Mars.  Challenging yet oddly satisfying, Red Faction will slick your thirst for destructible landscapes and a decent stroy in retro fashion.\n\nJust don't forget to quicksave!\n\n","December 2, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aaronqaz/recommended/20530/","aaronqaz","MonkeyWrench","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aaronqaz/","229 products in account","My review of Red Faction,\n\nAt the start of the game you have the option to do a tutorial to learn all the controls, and I have to say it was one of the best tutorials I have ever played through. The game gives a fair amount of background to the setting, you play as Parker a miner on the planet Mars and a member of the Red Faction, a rebal group. From what the game tells you the conditons of the mines are horrible and everone is worked to death and the guards don't give a rats ♥♥♥, there is also a plague going around in the mine that is killings hundreds of miners. The goal of the game is to overthrow the Ultor. I played through the entire game in about 3 hours and 15 minutes, so yes this is a very short game. I can not stress enough this game is short but very hard, It's been a long time since I have considered a game to be "hard"  but this game delivers! There are really only a few things I didn't like about the game the main thing was the MASSIVE difficulty curve about half way through the game, your just running around with your handgun and assult rifle killing guards easy as pie, then all of a sudden a new enemy type is brought up called "Mercenaries" a LOT of them carry a gun most of us know as a Gauss Rifle which will kill you in one hit no matter what, oh also the enemys can shot it through objects. The final thing I don't like is that it lacks in originality, IMO, if you have played Half-Life a game that came out around 3 years before Red Faction you will notice a unsettling amount of similarities, the game feels the same to play, the textures are similar the doctors have the exact same animation when healing you. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS that none of that bad stuff matters, it doesn't take away from the game at all, like I said before the game is very short but it is a fair story that for once makes sense. I had a large amount of fun playing this game and I recomend it to anyone who likes a FPS with a good challenge.\n\nMy final rating of the game is a 88/100\n\nMined alien rocks, would do it agian.","August 5, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You play as a miner who has had enough of his oppressive employers and has joined a general rebellion against them. This game is a classic FPS, with some really well designed levels and enemies that still hold their own today. It is also a difficult FPS, with certain bosses that require not only skill and strategy, but luck to take down. It is quite a short campaign, unfortunately, but is well worth the inexpensive price for a bit of FPS fun, and definetly worth a look during a sale. The game runs fairly well on modern systems, but I have had problems with save files disappearing. The solution is to not rename your save file in game. Other than that, it was a surprisingly smooth ride for an older game such as this. I would recommend this as a bit of classic FPS fun, with some great level designs, but be warned of the short playing time and potentially difficult points in the game.","December 15, 2013","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The highlight being the destructible environments in both singleplayer and multiplayer. An example from multiplayer would be a map with two buildings three stories high. What strategy will you choose? Blow up the walls protecting your opponent? Shoot through them with a rail driver? Use a rocket launcher to tunnel to their base? Sadly singleplayer doesn't manage to fully capatalize on it. It's used in a few sections but isn't as prevalent as you may think. Despite that flaw the singleplayer remains entertaining and fast-paced. The story is passable although not amazing, and the voice acting is somewhat mediocre by todays standards. The music is pretty good and the majority of the sound effects are good to boot.

The story is pretty good, although it does get boring and predictable at times.  I came across quite a few bugs going through including a game killing glitch that forced me to get an outside version of this game called Pure Faction.  However I found out the game killing glitch usually just appears on steam copies, and is easily fixed by pure faction.  The game plays like Half Life with a linear, story-based, shooter.  Stealth parts can be very frustrating with guards recognizing you from far away, but I'll give it credit for being more than 10 years old.

Since they seem to be able to time it really well. The story is quite good, and its pretty insane going through all that.\n\nBeware of missions that has timers (like when you set a bomb or you have to escape etc), there are times when you have to escape in the split second (crazy huh?), so make sure you have a backup save if you dont want to end up having to start ALL over even though it looks like it has an autosave but it doesnt. I was lucky to get out one time when i made it through in a split second on timer. Oh and beware of the final part, you will probably be annoyed hahahah.\n\nAs for Multiplayer, its still kicking but its dying.

The Geo-Mod engine lets you blast holes through most walls/floors/ceilings/terrain, which is pretty amazing for a game from 2001 and it's very unfortunate that most modern shooters still don't let you do that.\n\nThe single player campaign is solid, with a good story and some interesting vehicle/stealth sections mixed in. There's a nice variety of weapons as well. Unfortunately, the game is still very much a product of its time and the game is a very linear, twitch shooter. There's a few sections with multiple paths and places where you can use the Geo-Mod engine to create an alternate path, but these are sadly underutilized. There's also a major difficulty spike about 3/4 the way through the game and the AI has some issues as well and can be quite annoying at times. Still, it doesn't have any major shortcomings compared to other shooters and is worth playing through once, especially if you're a fan of the newer games and want some more of the backstory. The story is good, but the game is a bit short and ends rather abruptly.\n\nMultiplayer is where this game really shines. The Geo-Mod engine provides lots of tactical opportunities that are lacking even in modern shooters.\n\nAudio is good, with well-done voiceovers for the campaign, unfortunately the graphics have not aged well and the game requires a 3rd party patch (PureFaction) to fix some issues with running on modern machines.\n\nOverall, a fun game and definitely a classic.","March 2, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing this on a modern computer with widescreen monitor will stretch the game out, but had no trouble running and loading the game and even though that it is stretch it did not bother me (but to those who do, there is a mod called pure faction mod that will make this game have a proper widescreen than a stretch)\n\nnow the rest i will keep it short.\n\nPros:\n\n-able to destroy some things, can't have you blast through the entire levels now can you.\n\n-Has interesting guns.\n\n-Gameplay is still fun dispight being 14 years old\n\nCons:\n\n-repeatitve enemys\n\n-some areas have non stop enemy respawn\n\n-Lets take a gun that can instant kill anyone and put it on common enemys.\n---(small spoiler)------no seroiusly there is enemys that you will face at a common bases that will have a gun that can kill you with one hit regardless of your health and or armor. lucky they are near the end of the game but still, When you see them, Kill them at all cost. first\n\n-easily can get lost,\n------(this is going to be long so buckle  up)----This game does give you ANY, i mean any clear direction of where to go. at the begining, you dont have a weapon and the guards will attack you. no prompt to tell you "go pick up the dead gaurd's weapon that your fellow miner  attacked" i been running around trying to figure out how to defend myself. not only that but there is no clear indication of where to go, should i stay and help my fellow miners or should i bring the fight to the corperation on man army style. But doing the "find group of enemys to go to the right direction" trick works till respawning enemys comes to play (but by then i figure out where to go)\n\n-Buttons can easily be overlooked\n-------- the indcator that will tell you to "press this button" is really hard to detect as is a 1 pixel thick box letting you know which button you should be pressing. some are obvious such as elevators and side door buttons, but on machine panels, good luck add on top of that respawning enemys shooting at you.\n\n\none last thing to mention that this game is also what some time called a stright forward linear levels as in, you could at some point of the levels before getting to the first part of "no return" points, you could turn around and run all the way back to level one, unlike most modern game, that goes; cutscence -> Linear lvl 1 -> cutscence -> linear lvl 2. this game will load the next Linear lvl and the prevoius linear lvl if you go back a couple of steps. now i did say that i did get lost in one of my list of cons. and usually linear lvls have a set path to keep the player in line to the exit with only a few side trip to a room with goods and or easteregg.

And 'Red Faction' was a pretty popular game upon it's release, but for the most part nobody really cared about it all that much after that. Which makes sense I suppose, I mean, 'Half Life' had the mod 'Counter-Strike' and it's revolutionary multiplayer, and 'Red Faction' had the gimmick of being able to destroy everything in your path, which was actually a pretty big deal back then if I remember correctly.\n\nBut still, 'Half Life' was the game everyone cared about, the game everybody played; so it's safe to say that 'Red Faction' was swept under the rug for the majority of kids growing up in the 90's. Which isn't all that surprising actually, games were much more hit or miss back in those days, so when people found something that was great, they stuck to it and played it til they could no longer. To say it best, 'Red Faction' was the Utah Jazz to 'Half Life's' Chicago Bulls. Yeah, let's see how many of you get that reference.\n\nHowever, after coming back to this game after almost two decades, and having never beaten it until just recently, I can honestly say that 'Red Faction' is just as good as 'Half Life', if not better. You would think that such an early game with the premise for total destruction would be mediocre at best, but the developers nailed it the first time around. Combine that with combat that's just as fun as any other first person shooter on the market today, controls that feel natural from the get-go, and the ability to drive vehicles much like in the 'Halo' games, and you've got yourself one hell of a timeless shooter.","March 16, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing this on a modern computer with widescreen monitor will stretch the game out, but had no trouble running and loading the game and even though that it is stretch it did not bother me (but to those who do, there is a mod called pure faction mod that will make this game have a proper widescreen than a stretch)\n\nnow the rest i will keep it short.\n\nPros:\n\n-able to destroy some things, can't have you blast through the entire levels now can you.\n\n-Has interesting guns.\n\n-Gameplay is still fun dispight being 14 years old\n\nCons:\n\n-repeatitve enemys\n\n-some areas have non stop enemy respawn\n\n-Lets take a gun that can instant kill anyone and put it on common enemys.\n---(small spoiler)------no seroiusly there is enemys that you will face at a common bases that will have a gun that can kill you with one hit regardless of your health and or armor. lucky they are near the end of the game but still, When you see them, Kill them at all cost. first\n\n-easily can get lost,\n------(this is going to be long so buckle  up)----This game does give you ANY, i mean any clear direction of where to go. at the begining, you dont have a weapon and the guards will attack you. no prompt to tell you "go pick up the dead gaurd's weapon that your fellow miner  attacked" i been running around trying to figure out how to defend myself. not only that but there is no clear indication of where to go, should i stay and help my fellow miners or should i bring the fight to the corperation on man army style. But doing the "find group of enemys to go to the right direction" trick works till respawning enemys comes to play (but by then i figure out where to go)\n\n-Buttons can easily be overlooked\n-------- the indcator that will tell you to "press this button" is really hard to detect as is a 1 pixel thick box letting you know which button you should be pressing. some are obvious such as elevators and side door buttons, but on machine panels, good luck add on top of that respawning enemys shooting at you.\n\n\none last thing to mention that this game is also what some time called a stright forward linear levels as in, you could at some point of the levels before getting to the first part of "no return" points, you could turn around and run all the way back to level one, unlike most modern game, that goes; cutscence -> Linear lvl 1 -> cutscence -> linear lvl 2. this game will load the next Linear lvl and the prevoius linear lvl if you go back a couple of steps. now i did say that i did get lost in one of my list of cons. and usually linear lvls have a set path to keep the player in line to the exit with only a few side trip to a room with goods and or easteregg. This game (mostly near the begining of the level) have path that will make you do a loop till you find the right path.\n","March 17, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember playing it back in the day, but don't think that I ever finished the story - was more interested in the environmental destruction at the time.\n\nAnyways, RF has a decent story (no where near Deus Ex, of course, even though it is a more recent game), does not look as good as well (definitely better than the garbage called Red Faction 2), but the gameplay is really good (especially considering it's age), it has decent environmental variety, plenty of guns and the enemies don't get boring (even though there's not a lot of different ones) as the game does not throw then in droves (like in RF2) and they seem to have personalities.\n\nYou need to get Pure Faction mod to be able to play this on a modern system (16:9 and 16:10 resolutions, Win7/8.1).

The Geo-Mod engine lets you blast holes through most walls/floors/ceilings/terrain, which is pretty amazing for a game from 2001 and it's very unfortunate that most modern shooters still don't let you do that.\n\nThe single player campaign is solid, with a good story and some interesting vehicle/stealth sections mixed in. There's a nice variety of weapons as well. Unfortunately, the game is still very much a product of its time and the game is a very linear, twitch shooter. There's a few sections with multiple paths and places where you can use the Geo-Mod engine to create an alternate path, but these are sadly underutilized. There's also a major difficulty spike about 3/4 the way through the game and the AI has some issues as well and can be quite annoying at times. Still, it doesn't have any major shortcomings compared to other shooters and is worth playing through once, especially if you're a fan of the newer games and want some more of the backstory. The story is good, but the game is a bit short and ends rather abruptly.\n\nMultiplayer is where this game really shines. The Geo-Mod engine provides lots of tactical opportunities that are lacking even in modern shooters.\n\nAudio is good, with well-done voiceovers for the campaign, unfortunately the graphics have not aged well and the game requires a 3rd party patch (PureFaction) to fix some issues with running on modern machines.\n\nOverall, a fun game and definitely a classic.","March 2, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your job is to aid the revolution as best as you can, and call in the Earth Defense Force to free the miners permanently from their slavery. The journey takes you all over the surface (and under it) of Mars.

The overall game is a steal for the price. You get your monies worth with this one. The story take awhile to beat and will give you alot to do while playing.

I fell in love with the story of miners on Mars, rising up against thier corporate overlords and towards a peaceful and free Mars society.\n\nGenre: FPS\n\nStory: Miners rise up against corporate overlords and you're their only hope.\n\nStory length : 10-12 hours, more if you mess with Geo tech.\n\nMultiplayer: KIA\n\nPros; Beginning story starts off fast and intresting. Geography destruction is cool and can lead to some cool goodies. Guns pack a punch and usually have a secondary use, alot like the Half Life series weapons. Can run on almost anything.\n\nCons: Stealth sections are horrendous. Some mission objectives can be very unclear. Ally and enemy AI are lackluster, to say the least. Graphics aren't the best, but detract hardly at all from the overall expirence. Lack of enemy of variety.\n\nOverall, a very fun a cheap game (price wise) that doesn't destroy your PC in the performance department and is mostly a title to play to say that you've played it and get to expirence the awesome, though limited use of, Geo tech.","March 24","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehmawnster/recommended/20530/","tehmawnster","Mawnster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehmawnster/","458 products in account","Okay so I have a problem here. I don't understand why I enjoyed this game. I had to go through so much ****.\n\n(note: I played on medium difficulty)\n\nI had to reload a save and lose half an hour of progress because a submarine exploded itself before landing in water.\n\nI had to jump around crates hoping there were items to refill my ammo and health because they were invisible and I had to guess where they were.\n\nI had to deal with a boss I couldn't really dodge, just hop around like an idiot hoping the seeking magic missile didn't hit me (also sometimes it just passed through walls) because it kills in two hits, bypassing armor.\n\nI had to reload an older save (again) because I had a detonator in hand while having my weapons removed, which left me locked on the detonator and unable to switch weapons when I got new ones.\n\nI had to kill 4 flying vehicles (equipped with machineguns and rocket launchers) and a good dozen of enemies (some equipped with large area of effect explosions rocket launchers) at 5 health without any health or armor refill. Then I got one +25 health medpack and had to kill 2 more vehicles and a boss (that could one hit kill me, too).\n\nSometimes, some of the sound just stopped. No footsteps, most gunshots quiet, no music. I had to save and restart the game to fix it. It happened only a few times.\nOn top of that, there are enemies that can kill you in one hit even at full health/armor and that can shoot through walls or instantly around corners. And there aren't only a few of them.\nAnd, last little note, the land vehicles feel atrocious to drive. But that's minor.\n\n\nBut somehow I still had fun. The combat was satisfying (except what I mentioned earlier). The fact that enemies can kinda strafe at lightspeed feels a bit cheap but it adds some challenge.\n\nWeapons are okay, some just feel useless though. Mostly the SMG, because it uses pistol and assault rifle ammo, but the pistol is way more accurate and the assault rifle is more accurate too and has burst and auto firing. You also get the assault rifle before the SMG. Grenades were just extremely uneffective. I didn't really use explosives on enemies overall, just sniped people with the pistol, precision rifle or sniper, which was just about as effective, if not more. Also, note on the railgun: you can aim through walls with it, apparently... but I only learned that after I finished the game. Because someone told me. I didn't notice it myself at all and nobody tells you about it.\n\nVehicle sections... well, not remarkable. They're done in 5 minutes, you get back to the interesting part and forget about them. But atleast they're not really annoying.\n\nThe geomod destruction is impressive for a 2001 game... But in practice it just felt useless to me. Maybe I just didn't think about using it sometimes but it didn't feel like I really had time to set up explosions to destroy a building or bridge instead of just shooting the enemies. Only used it a few times, twice because I was forced to do it, a couple times out of curiosity to access other paths (which really wasn't rewarding, only unlocked shortcuts instead of secret items, and since I didn't want to miss on anything I went back to the main path anyway).\n\nThe stealth parts were really basic. I just had to not get too close to cameras and guards, and spotting distances were really small so it felt pretty easy once I got the hang of it. And they also just end into more shooting, they can't be finished without just starting to shoot your way through some rooms, as far as I noticed. But since you can't get armor and only have a pistol during these, you pretty much have to try getting as far as you can without having to shoot (or get spotted anyway, which is almost the same).  You can hide bodies but I really couldn't find any use for it because when I shot any guard it just directly triggered an alarm.\nStill, the stealth parts were kind of nice.\n\nOh, and also, the game is manual-saving only. No checkpoints or autosaving. Force yourself to quicksave (and sometimes do a manual save in the menu just in case something bad happened) or else you're gonna have to go back to the start everytime you die. And if you don't save often you're just gonna have a way harder time overall.\n\n\n\nSo, overall, I'm still not sure how I had fun with this game, so I'm recommending it hoping you will have fun too, but be ready for some annoying parts.\n\nOriginally posted by Ultor soldier, assault rifle in hand:Don't shoot, I'm unarmed!","April 15","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a great FPS and an absolutely fantastic, classic experience. A strong first person shooter of a classic era, the destruction lets you do anything. Got a locked door in your way? As long as you have ammunition, you can blow a giant hole around it, or even under it.\n\nMars is to provide more resources and possibly become a new Earth. It is commanded by Ultron, a conglomerate familiar to fans of the Saints Row series, that commands slaves to do all the work of gathering resources for them. You begin as a miner, soon freed by the rebel group known as Red Faction, quickly finding no alternative, you ally yourself with the rebels. Quickly working your way above ground and destroying all the things important to Ultron, only to finish the game by cutting off the head of the snake, letting the body die. Who is the main character, you ask? Why Parker, of course, a character that has a section of the planet named after him in Red Faction: Guerrilla. If you like going back to classics or trying to understand the appeal of a classic game, or maybe want to know more about the history of the Red Faction series, then prepare to be excited because this game is fantastic.\n\n+ Complete and total destructibility\n+ Powerful weapons\n+ A huge arsenal of weaponry\n+ Epic soundtrack\n+ Challenging classic\n+ Interesting lore\n+ Level-design\n\n- Clipping issues\n- Sometimes explosions don't destroy enough and you run out of ammo, with a little peep-hole into where you were trying to get to\n- Accidentally destroying your only route, making it unable to progress","December 19, 2011","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though the graphical capabilities of the game are ok, even geomod, just not as impressive as I recall.\n\nThat being said, I still thouroghly enjoyed this game(then and now).\nThe gunplay is good, and it's alot of fun blowing big holes in the map(at least in the sections that allow you to do so).\n\nIs is a descent first person shooter with a neat gimmick.\n\nGive it a go.","June 5","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
