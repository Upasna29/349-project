However, it is NOT Titan Quest, don't be fooled with the title. I will compare it with TQ time to time but basically just to show differences than similarities.\n\nIs it good or bad? Neither. It is just another game. It inherits many features from TQ - the same engine (that's what makes some people to think the game is just a masked TQ), dual mastery system, basic skills ideas, itemization principles, inventory management and others. However, gameplay and overall feeling is not the same. I wonder why some people look at Grim Dawn as at skinned TQ because it feels very different in terms of pace, combat, quests, athmosphere. It is... err... faster. It's the best description I can imagine. Everything happens quite fast in the game. You start to feel your character powerful relatively fast - pretty since the first level. Many things support this feeling - from the actual raw power to hits animation which makes you feel impact on most of your hits. It could get boring soon if you would not unlock new skills with levels so you still will have something new to play with :)\n\nBasically, it's the game about doomed and dying world where mankind was pretty much eradicated by two powerful magical races. You're one of few remnants survived the just happened Apocalypse and trying to establish themselves in the changed world. So there are lot of remaining ruines and lore in the world. I actually like the way Crate has placed world information and story in the game - it does not come in forms of long quest dialogs but as pieces of paper here and where which you can read if you are interested or skip if you are not interested in learning the story and want just to kill things. I tried both and must say the story is very well-written which is rare case for ARPG genre. Just try to read that diary of the dead child... The world is also well-detailed with many small pieces adding the feeling of doom pretty everywhere. Overall graphics is probably not that detailed and eye-catching as it was in TQ but I guess TQ had it somewhat excessive while GD looks just fine for the fast-paced game where you won't pay too much attention to details most of the time anyway. It is still look fine when you stop for a while and zoom in to see details like a doll on the stairs. So the graphics is just fine on my taste. It looks much better with AntiAliasing and AnyzotropicFiltering turned on though ;) Overall story and graphics is much more mature than TQ with some of dark humor and some serious emotions it causes but much less pathetics. Bad guys actions are basically better reasoned and logical based (if you bother to read the story pieces).\n\nQuests. They are various enough to not get bored. You will meet those "kill X monsters" and "collect Y pieces" things along with exterminating big bad guys, securing areas (the last looks quite stupid with the monsters respawn but anyway), finding lost people and even uncover the treachery... or cover it. Yes, some quests seem to have several endings. Crate promises that you will meet consequences of your decisions later. Quests aren't necessary to finish the main story except first few ones which you will need to complete to get access to the stash. You can do even without them though - in my first playthrough I have got that access only after finishing the act as I just did not found the way to sewers to complete one of these quests :) Basically, if you have done what the quest requires already and then got to the quest giver, it will offer other dialog and accept the quest. Quite a reasonable system on my taste. You can just go forward and kill everything on your path and once you get to the end you will complete most of quests - just get back to the town and talk to people.\n\nAdvancing the game. GD has other ways to advance than TQ had. First of all, the game is not linear. You have a single base and move in various directions from it but still return there for supply and rest. Second, directions you move are not a narrow long path but quite wide areas where you can just move along the road skipping pretty much about 60-70% of content or go exploring. In the last case you will find many optional areas some of which offer significant rewards. So you are free to advance fast from riftgate to riftgate or stop in the every area until you find everything in it. Or you can advance fast and then return to the areas you've been already to explore them in details. The last way has the hidden benefit related to monsters level scaling. You can find new more dangerous monsters in the previously explored areas.\n\nMonsters scaling. Monsters have limited scaling their levels with player in GD. So you can either advance to next area or just re-run the same one to find monstes have higher levels and you still get enough exp and better drops to advance in levels. Some people find it good, some blame the game for it. I personally think it is good because scaling is not infinite and if you run the same area for 3-4 times you usually will outlevel monsters there. So you still can feel yourself a stomping giant in you want :) Or you can just move forward as fast as you can - monsters will be either equal or slightly higher level than you. The system looks very well balanced and entertaining.\n\nMonsters. What can I say... incredible. Especially considering this is only Alpha (close to Beta already) and the first act of the game. Monsters variety is amazing. You will find about 8-10 basic types of zombies and other Aether corruptions (almost every type includes 2-3 variations with distinct look and properties), the same amount of mutated animals types (again, with several distinct variations inside every type), two semi-inteligent races, two types of human enemies and two types of Chaos creatures (all of these type groups have several variations as well). There are lot of hero monsters (they exist for every monster type in the game) with unique abilities which offer much greater challenge with an increased reward (sweet loot :)). Believe me, combat never feels boring and you never will think "ahh, these zombies again..." - GD has almost infinite surprises to you :) Moreover, as I said above, if you return to the area you've been already when you get 3-4 levels you most possibly will find new monster types there. Some of these types are unique to particular areas and don't meet anywhere else in the game. So if you want to see all enemies be sure to revisit areas you've met every unique monster type when you get max level.\n\nCombat. It is quite fast-paced but yet is quite controllable and leaves enough time to think your actions. Impact feeling is great due to various animations and screen shaking on crits. Crate has entertained new feature opposed to potions spamming - out of combat health regeneration (OCH). This feature is still questionnable and perceived differently by players. Some praise it while others blame. What does OCH mean? When you not get hit and don't hit for 2-3 seconds your health starts to regenerate rapidly and get to the max in 4-5 seconds. Some players are against it because think it can be abused and make the game too easy. Others argue that if you want to play reckless you can just continue hitting mobs instead of running around and avoiding hits. Anyway, this system really makes potions an emergency solution and rare used. Besides that, there are many ways to replenish your health during combat. I myself love this system and was upset when it was nerfed once already. However, we'll see what it will look like in the end of development. Comparing to TQ, combat looks ages ahead. Ah, I almost forgot about the new targeting system! Be sure to uncheck "Classic targeting" option in the game menu and try how it feels. I can't return to classic system now. The new one is pretty much the same you could get in Diablo 2 with right mouse button. Well, I could say more but seem to run out of space :)","January 14, 2014","true","014.5"," 360 of 397 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","360","397","0","9"

It's definitely one to keep your eye on.\n\nI'm a massive Action RPG player/addict with 1000s of hours in Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight, Van Helsing & countless others. Hell, I've even made a career out of making YouTube videos for them. Grim Dawn was little more than a curiosity to me when I first checked it out in the Alpha. But since then I have repeatedly come back to it whenever a new build is released and each time I play it I fall a little more in love with it!\n\nDevelopment progress has been slow, I wouldn't expect a launch this year, but the quality of updates has been phenomenal. The devs at Crate have their finger of the pulse of the community and have a very clear vision for the game they want to make - it's the game they want to play. I recently spoke to Mediera one of the developers and he said that he barely even played Titan Quest when he was developing it - but while developing Grim Dawn he can barely tear himself away from it, with 100s of hours spent 'playtesting'.\n\nThis game is the spiritual successor to Titan Quest, with some of the developers that originally worked on the game now making up the indie dev team at Crate Entertainment. The game is built on a heavily modified version of the same engine Titan Quest was built on. You'll notice the similarities between the games if you're a fan. But this game is not Titan Quest reskinned - it's a much better game in my opinion. It's taken some of the best features and mechanics from that game, put them into an immersive post-apocalyptic world and expanded themin interesting ways.\n\nGrim Dawn is the type of game early access should embrace - supporting great and communicativbe developers make games the fans want to play. Keep this one on your radar!\n\nIf you want to see more of the game and my thoughts on it you can find me on YouTube & Twitch as 'ZiggyD'.","June 20, 2014","true","146.0"," 280 of 302 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","280","302","0","9"

Furthermore there is a multitude of sidequest that often allow you to make meaningful decisions and sometimes even determine the fate of a whole village.\n\nUnfortunately these stories are hard to follow for someone who doesn't read through all the text. As much as I know the devs plan to voice the main story towards release.\n\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe graphics present you with a harsh and sinister environment which is further emphasized by the great music and sounds. The handcrafted maps are quite large and feature hidden passages from time to time. It also feels great when you encounter hostile factions attacking each other and follow the transformation of Devil's Crossing from a small survivors-enclave to a small town as you progress through the story.\n\nOnly downpoint for me was the repetitiveness of some maps, especially the 3 swamps in act 1 and arkovia/broken hills in act 2. I was told that the devs are planning to rework some of these areas though in terms of visuals.\n\n\nGameplay:\nGritty, fun combat, just as you would expect from an ARPG. The constitution system makes sure that you don't just wait to regenerate and the scarcity of potions underlines the fact that you are survivor of a perished world. Unlike Diablo 3 leveling feels rewarding and presents you with relevant decisions that influence your progression later in the game. The dual-mastery system of Titan Quest opens up a ton of possibilities and will further improve the more classes are available. The locational damage will probably not suprise TQ-veterans, but for ARPGs in general it's a really noteworthy feature that adds further depth to the game. (On a site note: There is an existing faction system that will be dramatically improved in the upcoming build)\n\nSince build 20 there is a well-working multiplayer, unfortunately the damage monster deal is also scaled if you play together. Resistances don't show much effect if they are not pushed quite high and casts and even aoe skills can miss enemies. Coming from WoW I was never very fond of a "accuracy" stat as it pretty much forces players to cap it.\n\n\nItemization:\nThe game features a multitude of stats to choose from: many types of retaliation, skill bonuses, damage modifiers, resists, etc. etc. This and the fact that there are procs and even entire new skills on items massively increases the number of possible builds and the fun collecting every item. Unlike other games in the genre there are not only random rolled yellows and greens but also static epic items which helps to reduce "bad luck", legendary items will drop from 50 onward, but are not available yet. Like Titan Quest there is also a huge number of augmentations to further personalize your gear. The two unqiue blacksmiths to choose from make use of these augmentations to craft a bunch of new items and relics from blueprints found in the world. All items are fully tradeable with other players.\n\nIt seems there are some apparently obsolete stats though: Armor and physical resist pretty much do the same and "increase resistance x by x%" isn't really needed either.\n\n\nInterface:\nThe game has a multitude of options and a fully scalalbe interface, which makes it highly customizable. The data sheets are well categorized and easy to access.\n\nSometimes the text on items can get a little bit long though.\nSame goes for several skill descriptions, some of which only offer vague information, e.g. Solaels Witchfire - what exactly do the 1st and 2nd rune increase? You will have to try that out for yourself.\n\n\nContent:\nGrim Dawn is not finished yet, but it already has act 1-3 which offer fairly much to do and even on the second playthough reveal some suprises. Hallowed Hill, Depraved Sanctuary and Steps of Torment provide some lasting "endgame" content, the latter even comes with a cohesive and interesting story. Due to the fact that the current maximum level is 40 the number of build possibilites is limited of course, nontheless there is plenty of them already. I'd say there's roughly 150-200h of playtime right now if you don't try the more fancy builds.\n\n\nBugs:\nI haven't encountered many bugs which is refreshing for an early access title these days, here are the most prevalent ones:\n- Getting stuck especially when using teleports/charge\n- Hit detection sometimes doesn't work for aoe skills like "shockwave"\n- Some attacks can clip though walls, both hostile and friendly\n- Items occasionally drop through the floor, especially annoying with epics\n* The devs seem to be aware of these bugs and will address some of them in B24\n\n\nTo sum it up:\n- in no way generic or boring quests that offer real decisions; story may be hard to follow if you don't read through every text though\n- dense atmosphere, brilliantly handcrafted world that sometimes feels repetitive because of the lack of different textures\n- good mix of fun gameplay, diverse builds and multi-layered mechanics with only minor problems here and there\n- interesting and complex itemization with a few debatable stats\n- well done interface, many options, but sometimes useless skill/item descriptions\n- reasonable quantity of well thought out content, likely 150-200h\n- few bugs, very polished for an alpha\n\nI have never had so much fun coming up with new builds and testing them right away. The gameplay is mostly fluid, the graphics and audio help create a unique atmosphere that supports the many stories you find about the world of Cairn and it's residents. It may take some time though to see through the complexity of the skill tree and items and appreciate the thought that has gone into it. All in all I'd say that Grim Dawn even in it's currents state is worth every penny as it not only offers the usal ARPG features, but also comes with it's own fresh ideas and shows promise of even more.\n\n\nP.S. I have noticed that many reviews on youtube are from people/magazines who invested less than 20h and therefore don't go really deep into the many mechanics Grim Dawn has to offer. This doesn't do the game justice in my opinion. Please don't take those reviews seriously and give the game a chance if above points take your fancy.","February 13, 2015","true","208.4"," 198 of 211 people (94%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","94","198","211","10","6"

If you loved Diablo, Torchlight, & Titan Quest then this is the game for you.    Combat is solid, the story is well presented, monster design is top notch.   Spiffy animations.   Art direction takes a few cues from Fallout 3 & Borderlands.    A few shout outs to H.P. Lovecraft.    No crashes for me & almost no bugs.    Very stable game!\n\nCons:  has pretentions to being a 'Ye Olde Skool' hard core ARPG game.    Thus the game lacks modern rpg conviences like quest markers.     Expect to wander lost for stretches at a time.    Game balance is nightmare.   Playing a caster is easy mode.    Loot drops are a bit sketchy, but it is getting better.    Crate employees are swell & willing to listen to feedback.   Crate fans on the other hand...     Well, let's just say they are a bit defensive.    Saying that there are flaws with Grim Dawn is tantamount to calling their baby ugly.    The Crate Forums are going to be very interesting when the final product ships...\n\nIn conclusion: post apocalyptic, low fantasy that doesn't pull any punches.    Some of the game design choices are real headscratchers, but they're being ironed out.     Crate entertainment is a pretty decent indie outfit  & deserve support.   It's a work in progress that takes you on fun, brutal journey.    8 out of 10, Above average.

But then, it has been in early access for some time now.\n\nIf you like Diablo, you will definitely like this game. Because it offers the same hack&slash loot fest gameplay as that game, but without the frustrating bull****, such as the permanent character damage of Diablo 1 and the excessively restrictive builds (And rare respec) of Diablo 2.\n\nThe game offers at present 5 different classes, of which you can combine any 2 of them to create hybrid classes. There is the Soldier (Typical warrior), the Nightblade (Rogue with a melee focus), the Demolitionist (Archer type, but with versatile crowd control options and traps), the Occultist (Debilitation and pets) and the Arcanist (Spellcaster). There are skills in each class that well complement those of another, but a pure class build is just as viable.\n\nThere are no skills that are purely support, since the developers have made a conscious decision to make singleplayer just as playable as multiplayer. Instead, most classes offer some form of skill that applies a bonus or ability to you, as well as an equal one to other players and pets, allowing increased power and versatility in multiplayer without compromising the viability of the skill in singleplayer.\n\nIt's a lot less restrictive than most similar games in how each class can be built and still be viable, but it is worth putting some advance thought into your build. Skill points can be refunded if spent on skills, but not if spent on class mastery (Which increase your stats linearly and unlock further skills).\n\nContent wise, the game currently contains 2 full chapters of reasonable length and 2 out of 3 parts of the 3rd chapter. A total of 4 chapters are known to be planned for the full release. There is a lot of various equipment to find with interesting items offering unique skills to complement the arsenal of your chosen class. There is also a lot of varied enemies to use your weapons and abilities on, with especially dangerous (mostly) randomly spawned unique Heroes to contest with, each with their own special skills and abilities.\n\nFour difficulties are planned, each which will be unlocked for a character as the previous is completed. At present there is only two difficulties available, Normal and the optional Veteran. These two difficulties can be alternated between at any time from the main menu and share the same campaign progression. Completing the game on either will unlock the next one, once it's added.\n\nI strongly recommend playing on Veteran difficulty in singleplayer, as Normal mode is a tad too easy. In multiplayer, the game scales the difficulty based on the amount of players, making Normal mode offer a decent challenge and making Veteran very challenging.\n\nEnemies do scale to your level, but as I understand the scaling will be lesser in the full release and is only set as high as it is now to offer a continuous challenge for higher level players.  Right now, the maximum level is 40, which is still plenty enough to allow the construction of very interesting character builds that do end up feeling extremely powerful in spite of the scaling enemies.\n\nStory wise, the game features an original world by the name of Cairn, with has an Victorian-esque aesthetic and technological level. It offers you the usual swords and shields but also black powder guns, bombs and magic. In this world mankind is at the brink of extinction with the event dubbed the "Grim Dawn" as it's cause, where the otherwordly and malevolent Aetherials and Chtonics invaded the world. The Aetherials seeking the enslavement of mankind as hosts of possession, while the Cthonics would rather mankind be wiped out, as to deny their use by the Aetherials. These two factions are enemies and will actively fight one another, in addition to humanity.\n\nThe Grim Dawn led to the total collapse of the empire, leaving only scattered groups of refugees and army remnants trying desperately to safeguard their own survival. You join one of these groups in trying to secure shelter, supplies and to strike back against the invaders and Cairn native monsters threatening you. All in all, it's an interesting universe that manages to put a somewhat new spin on the overused post apocalyptic and dark fantasy settings. The story also feels much more grounded than many similar works, with the player not being a chosen one destined to save the world but is just another survivor struggling to survive. This is reflected in the quests you undertake as well, with quite a few of them simply being about securing the base needs for survival, such as drinking water, food and usable materials for clothing.\n\nUnlike most games of this style, Grim Dawn offers choices with permanent effects on the world. So for example, your choices can decide who lives and who dies as well as influence what equipment you can access. Or they can even turn another faction of humans against you, for siding with their enemies. There is a reputation system, where you earn the trust of factions by completing quests and fighting their sworn enemies, with increased trust letting you access faction unique bounty quests and a store offering equipment unique to that faction. You also accrue a negative reputation with the hostile factions, where you face stronger opposition the more of a threat you become, culminating in them sending especially strong unique enemies to deal with you. The choices and faction system feel very well integrated and can only become more interesting the further along in development the game gets. A sense of personal investment in the world makes it unique from it's genre brethren. Of course, you might make a choice that ends with an outcome that you don't like, so if that's a concern you would need to refer to a guide to make the choice you want.\n\nThe game does however suffer from some unfortunate bugs, primarily a tendency to crash. This combined with rather extensive dungeons can make for a frustrating experience where you lose your progress and have to start over. The characters however do save properly though, so it's not an insurmountable chore to go through those dungeons again.\n\nThere's a few performance hiccups here and there and some minor graphical bugs as well, but it is an early access title and such things are to be expected. If you can't deal with that, stay away from any and all early access titles.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes.\n\nBut with the reservation that it is in early access and thus not yet finished and full of bugs. If you can deal with that, buy it. If you can't, then wait.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImportant note: If you have a router, to be able to host multiplayer it needs to support Upnp or be able to port forward UDP and TCP ports 27016.","May 26, 2015","true","214.1"," 135 of 140 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","135","140","2","1"

The class system involves mixing two classes together (you unlock a second class at level 10), which is pretty unique to the genre. Titan Quest had this system and now the same developers have incorporated it into Grim Dawn. This adds an additional layer of depth to the character building process.\n\nLet's say you're looking to build a poison focused Nightblade. You can pair your Nightblade up with the Occultist class for even more poison capability (Nightblade combined with an Occultist makes a "Witch Hunter"). If you want your Soldier to have some of the abilities/theme of a magic user, you can pair him with an Arcanist to make a "Battlemage".\n\nThere are six classes in the game, known as "masteries". With the dual class system you end up with 15? total class combinations, which is exponentially more classes than your average ARPG.\n\nThe loot in the game is fantastic. Grim Dawn loot isn't some dumb-downed main stat+health type of system. There are a plethora of stats in the game, and each stat may have multiple functions. For example, the Spirit stat will increase your magic damage, duration of magic effects, boost your energy pool, and increase you energy regeneration.\n\nWhile there is a gear hierarchy, there is a lot of overlap between the different gear rarities. Usually epics are better than rares, but you may find an exceptional rare that is better for your build than any epic you've found. Legendaries are the "best" items in the game, usually. You may find items known as "monster infrequents" that can potentially roll better stats than Legendaries have (depending on your needs). This system insures that players are never stuck only getting gear from one loot pool, which can be frustrating and boring. It also makes for interesting decisions because you may have to do some math/theory crafting to determine which item really is better for you. Just because loot is a certain color, that doesn't necessarily mean it's best in slot for you. Even well rolled magic items have their uses, even though magic items (yellow items) are only one step above vendor trash.\n\nThe combat in Grim Dawn is impactful and has some nice crunch to it. This isn't a game with floaty combat where you feel like you're just swinging at air. Both the combat animations and the audio convey a feeling of power. When you smack an enemy with a big two-handed weapon, there's a definite crunch and you feel like you've done some real damage.  The spell/ability/status effects are well done and give the player all the information he/she needs. There are seldom situations where I don't know exactly what's happening, or whether my ability went off, or how I died, etc..\n\nThe skills themselves are fun and disparate in design/function. Some games suffer from overly homogenized classes; one class casts a red ball that does fire damage and another class casts a blue ball that does ice damage, etc.. This isn't the case with Grim Dawn. The masteries (classes) feel unique and they all bring something different to the table. Even though you may be simply left clicking a large portion of the time, the play-style will feel varied from one class combo to the next.\n\nThe skill trees (hooray skill trees!) are really flexible, allowing the player to build-out characters however they please. Do you want a skill that's fairly deep into the tree? Well, unlike other games, you don't have to wait until you hit some arbitrary level to unlock that skill. You can use your mastery/skill points to race down the tree and get that skill fairly early on in the leveling process. The trade off is that you won't be able to pump points into earlier skills. This system provides a lot of flexibility and thought-provoking decisions for leveling strategies.\n\nThe monsters in the game are gruesome and come in huge packs. Their attacks and behaviors are varied and interesting. Some mobs stealth and strike you for big damage like a rogue. Rock-like creatures will hurl boulders at you that deal huge damage. Poisoned zombies will leave a pool of toxic goop upon death. Caster mobs rain meteor showers on you. Etc., etc.. Most of the boss fights are interesting and have various phases/ mechanics to learn. Unless you over-gear the encounter, these mechanics can't be ignored (there are exceptions though, particularly with characters that are built like tanks and can just stand there).\n\nGrim Dawn also has an supplementary skill system know as the "devotion" system. Devotion points can be earned by purifying shrines spread throughout the game world (some require an offering, some will involve battling waves of difficult monsters). Devotion points can then be spent in various  constellations that will augment your character and their abilities. The various devotion nodes give bonuses to damage, health, crit, block, etc., depending on what constellation you're in. At the end of a constellation, there is (usually) a "chance to proc" ability that you can bind to one of your character's skills.\n\nIn order to unlock more powerful constellations in the devotion system, you need to acquire bonuses gained from earlier/weaker constellations. So there's some strategy involved if you want to try and unlock specific things. This system isn't just tacked on as an extra customization feature. If you don't make smart decisions with your devotion points, you're going to have a hard time in the later levels/harder difficulties.\n\nSome additional positives to mention:\n\n-There is multi-player.\n-There will be modding.\n-If you're new and want to do everything, it might take 40+ hours to get through your first play through.\n-There is a crafting system, with recipes for rares, epics and legendary items\n-No online requirement.\n-Developers are active on Steam and the official Grim Dawn forums. They actually listen too!\n-Game has all the features of a $60 AAA title, yet costs less than half that.\n\nIf you're a fan of action RPG loot hunt games, you're really doing yourself a disservice if you don't pick this one up. It might be the best game in the genre to date.","February 25","true","008.5"," 118 of 123 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","118","123","3","9"

After about 6 years of development, Crate Entertainment's Grim Dawn has finally been released. A game that had been in early access on Steam for so long due to the developers experiencing some personal difficulties. Not only that, they also greatly expanded on the game's original content due to fantastic support by fans along the way. The result is a superb aRPG that is currently among the very best. Having owned and closely followed the game for about 2 years, looking at the (finally) complete game is a pure joy. Hold on tight aRPG lovers, because you're in for a most wonderful ride with this one.\n\n<<<Story>>>\n\nEnter Cairn, a dark and mysterious world that was once a great empire, but now on the brink of extinction. At fault are the overly curious arcanists who brought Aetherials into their world. These spiritual beings seek to use humans as hosts and consequently turn them into powerful, yet abhorrent creatures. If that wasn't already enough, survivors also have to battle the Chthonians: they have the malicious intent of offering as much blood as they can to their almighty god. You, the player, awaken at the worst time possible: a grim dawn. For a little while, you yourself were possessed by an aetherial and thus have no memory of your former life. This possession almost cost you your life. However, those aetherial remains dwelling inside your body seem to grant you odd, yet useful powers ...\n\n<<<Gameplay, fun factor and replayability>>>\n\nGrim Dawn is an aRPG like there are quite a few others in the genre: Torchlight, Diablo, Van Helsing, Path of Exile, Victor Vran, Titan Quest ... While each game differs and has its uniqueness, they all have the same core gameplay: run around, kill monsters, find loot. And all of that in an isometric perspective. Even though a bit repetitive in gameplay (which is no problem if you're a fan of the genre), they have great replay value, mostly due to their theorycrafting: how to create and finetune the 'perfect' build(s). In trying to do so comes a lot of experimentation and farming, which can take quite long.\n\nUnlike certain other aRPG's, Grim Dawn does not force you into a specific class. Mages don't necessarily have to wield wands and warriors don't have to wear heavy armour and shields. Every character has access to all gear. However, you are required to invest in specific attributes in order to wear different equipment. Another feature that is quite welcome, which was present in Titan Quest also, is how the game lets you combine any of the 6 available masteries to create your personalized class (= 2 masteries combined). A first mastery can be chosen at level 2 and the second at level 10. There are so many skills that one can choose to build around, that even within the same mastery, there is a lot of room for variety. This allows for an insane amount of experimentation and theorycrafting, which is sometimes even more fun that actually playing the game!\n\nOne day, Crate decided that character customization wasn't deep enough already, so they released the devotion system. What is this system exactly? It is basically another (yet smaller) layer of customization where players have a total of 50 points to invest in certain passives (e.g. +10% piercing dmg, +20% elemental resistances etc) or actives that enhance your main skills. Those actives can be bound to certain skills and will proc under various circumstances (e.g. 100% to occur when critically hitting). Devotion points can be acquired by restoring old shrines that are spread throughout the whole world and between the 3 difficulties (normal -> elite -> ultimate).\n\nSeeing the amount of customization, being able to (partially) respec is a relief. Reallocating is done by visiting the spirit guide in one of the major cities and can be done at any given time, granted you have the currency for it. It starts out pretty cheap, but can get extremely expensive for those who experiment endlessly. Both skill and devotion points can be reallocated; mastery and attribute points can not. This allows for decent experimentation, but also reminds you to choose carefully when needed.\n\nCairn is a place full of mystery and secrets and is not afraid to reward players who feel like exploring everything. Exploration is rewarded by various things: one-time chests containing extra rare loot, hidden devotion shrines and notes. More loot is always good to have (this is an aRPG after all), devotion shrines keep your character's customization up to date and lore notes inform you of the story - which was better than expected - of Cairn.\n\nBesides the deep character customization and satisfying exploration, Grim Dawn offers other features that may interest you. The first thing that comes to mind is the 'fast travel' system. Your character can use rift portals anywhere, anytime (except in certain challenging rogue-like dungeons), which sets the game at a good pace. Don't worry about picking everything up, as you can sell it right away by teleporting back and forth. Another feature that is a nice 'extra' is the faction system: by killing certain enemies and completing certain quests, you gain reputation. This reputation allows you to buy certain goods and complete certain objectives. A last feature that is definitely more than welcome is the ability to play with up to 3 other people. There are no dedicated servers though, since the game is more single player focused. But the fact that it is there, is what counts.\n\n<<<Controls, graphics and sound>>>\n\nLike many other aRPG's, actions are mostly executed via the mouse: killing enemies, opening doors, speaking to npc's ... everything's done with the mouse, with the exception of using your skills. They are activated by pressing the corresponding keys. All keys are rebindable if desired.\n\nGraphically, the game seemed a little outdated in certain places, however, it is not too bothersome. Aesthetically on the other hand, the game is very well made and really brings that atmosphere of eeriness and desperation to life. Most animations are ok.\n\nThe soundtrack was enjoyable to listen to for the first x amount of hours and certainly added to the atmosphere. However, certain tracks get replayed over and over again in way too many areas. A little bit more variation certainly wouldn't harm the game. Tracks that are most excellent are the boss tracks. They sound exciting and make the fights more epic.\n\n<<<The verdict>>>\n\nGrim Dawn is one of the finest aRPG's I have played in the last couple of years - if not my favourite of all time. Victor Vran seems a little too simplistic, whereas Path of Exile can be overly complex. This game brings the best of two worlds together: being indepth enough without being overly complex. Therefore it is recommended to all aRPG lovers for 100%, but even regular rpg/hack & slash fans might enjoy this one, if just for 1 playthrough.","April 18","true","241.8"," 138 of 150 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","138","150","11","16"

There are obvious builds just like in D3 (Pet-master, Fire-builds etc.) but you are not limited to them.\n- No allways-online, you can in fact play this game completely in offline mode, characters are saved on your harddrive. (similar to Titan Quest)\n- Many items with the same system as in TQ where rare pre- and -suffixes can occur on normal items. Also Epic and Legendary stuff (including sets and abilities granted by items)\n- Farming: A combination of TQ and D3, boss runs are still effective (TQ) but there are also Hero spawns in normal locations that can be lucrative (D3)\n- Simple Multiplayer system, you can either host a game (and others might join you, you can set a password or kick others) or you can join a game yourself (direct join to your steam-friends or browse existing hosted games)\n- almost no bugs, the few that are there allways get fixed ASAP\n\n\nThings i personally dont mind but might be important to you:\n- performance issues when ALOT of stuff is going on (R9 290, 16GB RAM, i7 and dropping to 20fps on high settings, can be improved by lowering the settings though)\n- Multiplayer MIGHT not allways work, make sure you have administrator rights when searching for games or it can crash (just like in TQ)\n- even though they are not popular, you might find cheaters online (since save-files are on your harddrive you can just manipulate them). In that case just host a game yourself and kick them :P\n- no voice acting and average grafics might scare you. but keep in mind that crate entertainment is a really small studio ("Crate Entertainment has grown from one man with a dream to a team of ten with veteran developers....") so what they achieved is actually really impressive.\n\n\nConclusion: A really good ARPG. not a tripple-A title like D3 with millions of budget, still managed to entertain me more than D3 personally.

They are:\n\nBuild diversity\nItemization\nFun combat\n\nBuild diversity:\n\nThe game features dual classing. I can play the exact same two classes as my buds and all of us would have a character that behaves and functions completely differently. Want to be a melee summoner? Dual wielding spell caster? Tanky totem user? Alright, we gotchu. Stuff just sort of works. Maybe not for the highest difficulty, but that's part of the fun of this game. Because playing it is actually fun.\n\nItemization:\n\nI've gotten items for character ideas in this game I've never even thought of. I've gotten items specifically built for the character I'm playing as. A plus? They actually look pretty cool, too.\n\nLet me put it to you like this. I have a tanky totem guy who uses spells to tank and does vitality damage. There are items specifically for this. Do you understand how cool that is?\n\nFun combat:\n\nAlright, so, let's be real here. You are going to make characters that just don't work. You'll get to a point and maybe you didn't spend enough points in to your mastery and just don't have enough health. Maybe you don't do enough damage. Maybe you just kind of walked around and made it to the final difficulty and now you're stuck. Well, you had fun doing it.\n\nAnd you had fun doing it because the combat is a blast. Oh, you want to shoot a laser beam at enemies? We gotchu. Want to use a shield to destroy your enemies? Hey now, I got something for you. Want to use that same skill but make it spammable and useable with two handers? Yeah dude, no problem. Want to put a bunch of mortars on the ground and run around like you would in the real world? Ayyyy, yep.\n\nThis game has it all.

If you thought that developers won't invest in this style of game again, think again. Love has gone into this.\n\nYou start with a classes character, if you are a titan quest fan - you know the drill. If you do not, you start out without a class, think elder scrolls. Then you pick up an item, do some damage, and eventually you get some gear. By this point you will have leveled up and you can choose your class. Usually the player chooses something depending on what they have picked up, however you can choose something completely different and scour for items to match what you are going for.\n\nOnce you level up some more, you can choose a second class. Allowing for two to coexist concurrently - also like it's father titans quest. There are large number of class combinations. I don't find that every combination is satisfying, however most are at least interesting and fun to experiment with. One issue I have with the second class choice is that they are usually targeted at a specific item combination. For example, the soldier tree has many two handed skills, whereas the rogue tree has many duel wielding. That means you won't be able to pick the major skills in either tree. Since it's wasteful to be good at a two handed weapon and duel wielding skills. Unless you hotkey weapon switching. It's far better to just invest fully in whatever items you choose. Which means you are scouring the second tree for non-weapon based skills. It's not ideal.  However almost any combination you choose will be viable. And thats good enough. At least it represents freedom. If you want you can just stick to the one class.\n\nThe loot system is solid, although it lacks the "pop you got a legendary" sensation that diablo managed. The melee combat, while being weaker than magic, feels better due to the hitting animations being beefy feeling good on contact. This may make you want to play as a melee character even though magic is technically more damaging. A little more balance in this area would go a long way. That said, you need to take into consideration that this game still feels better to play at it's worst - than many action rpg's do at their best. It's just not quite as crunchy as diablo 3. This game's freedom of choice and depth of systems makes up for that. But clearly it would be great to have the best of all worlds. I find that visually the game can sometimes be a little bit over dark. And on certain monitors it may be an issue for players. VA panels in particular.\n\nOverall, I think this game is great. I've spent 150+ hours in the game, and have only scratched the surface. Restarting and playing new builds before I even got to the second act. That's right, that's 150 hours of build experimenting and grinding. And I loved every second of it.\n\nIt's content rich. It's systems are deep. It's carefully crafted in many ways, without being as limited as diablo 3 yet not as free as sacred 2. Combat feels better than van hellsing and sacred 2, yet not as good as diablo 3. Although not that far off. And the world is more original than all of the mentioned games.\n\n9.5/10 - A master class in game development. One of the best examples of early access on the market.\n\nI'd love to see workshop support.","November 29, 2015","true","155.9"," 118 of 125 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","118","125","0","0"

Crashes were rare, nothing felt glitchy or unfinished. You'd just hit the level cap, or hit the wall of the next unopened area.\n\nWhich meant, even when there was only 1 complete Act and a couple of class choices, there was a lot of fun to be had. It stood as a testament to how the rest of the game would play, and Crate has delivered. It's been a long time coming, and I mean a solid 5 year development, but it was always consistent enough to never have felt abandoned or misled. A trait I'm finding more and more important with Early Access titles.\n\nI'm not going to compare it to other ARPGs, as I'd much rather compare it to other early access titles in general.

With Diablo 3 and Path of Exile now being moreso known as the top two of these kind of games, there's in between Grim Dawn.\n\nGrim Dawn for one, has the same customizations like the old Titan Quest, you don't have any skills to start with and you have no class, you make your class by progress. What makes that so special, is that there isn't a single class to choose from, one character can specialize into two paths(You don't have to).\nSurely not all will be fully suitable for another, but it takes a little curve in knowing what to choose and why. Rather then a path being chosen for you, you can make yours from scratch.\n\nAlong with this in terms of skill customization, the game features a nice amount of loot, along with the entire factions offering you their items for trade as well, given you are on their good side. As for the looks of the game, its like the name suggests. Its grim, dark and grimy. Nothing in this world is given to you on a silver platter, and don't think you'll be quick to make friends.\nAlong with the nice bit of gunpowder skills and weaponary given to you, it gives another feel to the usual magic and swordplay world that is like PoE and Diablo 3, the combat is nice and beefy, strikes feel like they hit hard and enemies are plenty, either to be vaporized by magic or chopped to bits by a gaint sword.\n\nHaving played this game a fair bit, I can say it bring back the old feel of Titan Quest, in a new and fresh setting, unlike the PoE and Diablo 3 universe.\nI can surely say, to those that enjoyed Titan Quest back in the day or want something different from the two big boys that are Path of Exile or Diablo 3 to check out Grim dawn, its not done yet, and its not perfect. But its a really nice change of pace and well done so far I can say.","December 20, 2015","true","146.4"," 112 of 121 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","112","121","4","7"

Grim Dawn brings something fresh to the table that I have found lacking in POE and D3.\n\nThe Pros:\n\n- Attention to detail (for example piles of burning bodies in fields and outside of burrwitch lead one to believe there was a major fight against the rampaging Aetherials, which leads me to my next "pro".)\n\n-The story telling ( while it does lack in lore like some of the AAA games (Diablo) it does  a masterful job at telling a story  without spelling it out for you. Different scenes you come across throughout the world really get you interested in what had happened as you put it together.\n\n-Itemization ( the loot is both unique and visually appealing)\n\n-The Combat (the melee and spells feel really good)\n\n-The MUSIC ( is just amazing, nuf said)\n\nThe Cons:\n\n- The Combat ( Ranged combat is somewhat underwhelming, althought it has come a long way since initial release)\n\n-Skills ( while I am not one for super flashy skills like D3 some of the skills feel relatively underwhelming, for example the soldiers and cultist last tier skills, while useful, just don't look or feel all that impressive)\n\n- Multiplayer (multiplayer is not all that great as there are relatively few people who have public games open and the latency with the person hosting is often terrible, if one day they can have their own dedicated multiplayer server, it will be amazing!)\n\n-It's not done yet!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/symb0lic/recommended/219990/","symb0lic","King Eccy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/symb0lic/","194 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGrim Dawn  is one of the best  Early Access  games on Steam right now, and one of the few Early Access games that I totally don't regret purchasing. I'll be using a few comparisons to other popular games in the ARPG genre, and giving some reasons on how Grim Dawn differentiates itself.\n\nGrim Dawn is developed by  Crate Entertainment. They are only a small indie team of 7 or so, but they have some noticible talent from from titles like Titan Quest and Diablo 2. It's actually amazing what they have managed to accomplish with such a small team as the game was originally going to be a lot smaller in scope, but Crate had a fairly successful Kickstarter Campaign, which let them increase the scope of the game substantially.\n\nSo what does Grim Dawn manage to do right? What are some key features that are different from most ARPG's?\n\nHuge Open Map\nGrim Dawn features one giant interconnected map. Every Act has it's own feel and tileset, and areas connect and loop back to each other in such a clever way that at times, it reminds me of the level design of Dark Souls. There are plenty of Dungeons and Caves throughout these maps to explore, usually rewarding you with a cool side-boss. The big map design is a really cool feature considering games like Path of Exile have really small maps in comparison.\nExploration\nMost other ARPG's mostly focus on the combat, which obviously--should be a big focus for any ARPG. But Grim Dawn kind of encourages you to explore and pay attention to the environment a bit more then the others. There are breakable walls in Dungeons (which are quite well hidden), but if you manage to find them, you tend to be rewarded with secret areas and enemies, meaning every Dungeon is worth fully exploring.\nCombat\nSince Grim Dawn is running on the Titan Quest engine (though, it's been modified and upgraded), there are some very satisfying physics and ragdoll effects.\nMonsters tend to explode into gibs!\nCombat is slower paced compared to games like D3, but it is responsive and punchy.\nAnimation quality ranges from good to excellent. There are some really nice looking abilities, but I have noticed a few animations could use a bit of work. The monsters are fantastically animated though!\nCombat and movement in general is smooth.\nMonsters Drop Weapons They Are Using!\nThis feature was in Titan Quest I believe, but I'm glad Crate decided to include it in Grim Dawn, as it's an awesome feature that most ARPG's should have.\nWhat this means in more detail, is if you see a creature holding a weapon that looks unusual, and you notice after it hits you, you were drained of some energy for example, there is a good chance that monster is going to drop the same weapon it used to drain your energy.\nThis adds such a cool dimension to the game, as monsters can already have random affixes on them.\nLoot\nEvery ARPG needs good loot. Good thing Grim Dawn delivers on that too! I'd say the loot system is a bit more old-school in it's design and approach, as there are a lot of % based modifiers, which is pretty standard, but a lot of items also have abilities attached to them. Other then that, you have your usual loot rarity system that are similar to most other ARPG's (Common, Magic, Rare, Epic) and Legendaries--which are not in the game yet.\nLooting in general is just satisfying as hell. I love how loot explodes out of chests, and you even get loot piñata's from killing bosses/mini-bosses.\nCrafting & Components\nThe crafting system is actually quite in-depth and deep. It's perhaps not as deep as Path of Exile's crafting system, but it's not as simple as Diablo 3's either--it falls somewhere in between. One great thing is it's not as RNG focused as other crafting systems I've come across in other ARPG's.\nComponents are basically upgrades for your gear. They are found and crafted, and they can be attached onto most armour pieces. Components can also have abilities attached to them. Overall, It's quite an interesting take on an upgrade system, as components let you easily fix some flaws in your builds.\nSound Design\nAbsolutely amazing soundtrack! It's probably one of the best soundtrack's for an ARPG since Diablo 2, and I don't say that lightly.\nThere are some very well done ambient sounds, such as hearing flies buzzing around corpses, crackling around fires, etc--which adds a nice layer of detail to the sound design.\nThe Combat sounds are quite well done. The guns are punchy, spells sizzle, and weapons thud like you would expect.\nDay & Night Cycle\nThis really adds to the games presentation and atmosphere, while also adding a layer of believability.\n\nNow, some cons:\n\nLack of Cinematics & Voice Acting\nThere is some voice acting, and what's there is actually pretty well done, but there is no voice acting for quests and dialogue. The writing is overall pretty high quality, but I think some more voice acting would help sell the story more. This is only a minor con imo, as I think Crate are planning to add in more voice acting towards the end of their development schedule.\nSlow Start\nI gotta admit the game didn't immediately click with me at the start. This seems to be a problem with most ARPG's, as you have a general lack of abilities and gear in the first few hours. But, it gets a whole lot better if you decide to stick with it for a couple of hours and get a few abilities.\nLack of Visual Customisation\nGames like Diablo 3 let you dye your armour, as well as transmogrify a peice of armour to look like another piece. Path of Exile has microtranscations for those things too. This is a great thing for games that are so focused on character development, and it's one feature that is sadly lacking in Grim Dawn. It does suck when your character is wearing armour that is not matching, with random colours and such. I'm hoping Crate adds a similar feature in the near future.\nLack of Randomised Dungeons & Maps\nThere is a rogue-like Dungeon which is meant to address this, and admittedly it is meant to be a pretty kick-♥♥♥ dungeon (I haven't checked it out yet, but I have seen videos). Compared to Diablo 3's Rift System and Path of Exile's Maps, it's missing a lot of Enemy and Tileset variety.\nDevelopment is a little slow...\nThe game has been in full development since around 2012 (counting from the Kickstarter date). The general consensus seems to be that new builds take a little bit longer to release then most would like.\nMost of these cons were only minor cons for me, but can be major cons depending on how you feel about them.\n\nOverall, Grim Dawn does A LOT of things right. It has some features that should be standard for ARPG's, and those features make Grim Dawn feel like a very believable, detailed and rich gameworld. There is a lot of depth and replayability here, and if you even have a remote interest in ARPG's--Grim Dawn should be a no brainer.","August 24, 2015","true","31.7"," 92 of 98 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","92","98","0","2"

Grim dawn has exceeded my expectations by miles so far. I like the graphics, I like gameplay and I like the way you can improve gear by using collectable items. Gameplay is great, resources are not too scarce but its still a challenge. I just love it!\n\nYeah, progress is slow, the game is still in early access state. That's because developers resources are low and mostly because they are doing it right instead of releasing a half baked thing. Where I live we use to say "do it right, or it's not worth to be done."\nYou guys seem to do it just perfectly, keep on doing so well! And don't listen to the voices of impatient kids, they know nothing about hard work...\n\nAfter playing another 80 hours I have to say that it's getting even better. I have played around with several builds and it has not become boring yet. New Items with incredible stats and abilities keep popping up from time to time, which then inspire me to make some new builds.\nThe faction system and the long promised changes that devotion will bring seem to add some additional depth to the game as well as some new goals. Which means it's going to cost me even more of my lifetime... :)","December 1, 2014","true","455.1"," 105 of 117 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","105","117","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/219990/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Grim Dawn let me make a sorceress with a shotgun. More than that it encouraged me to, because that shotgun happened to be the perfect fit for the build I was working towards. I could have given her an enchanted pistol, or a giant warhammer, or really any of the countless weapons to be found throughout the world, and made it work. But as I was dashing through the ruins of a seaside town, ducking in and out of crooked doorways to blow zombies and floating eyes to hell with burning buckshot, I knew I had found my calling. At least until I find a bigger gun.\n\nFreedom of choice is the chief takeaway from Grim Dawn, one of the most recent entries in the crowded ARPG/Diablo lootsplosion genre. Unlike its peers, Grim Dawn decouples weapons, armors, and even skills from specific classes, letting you be anything from an armored shaman with a lightning scythe to an arcane fire-slinging gunman to a demon-worshipping hammer-wielding assassin. The only thing limiting your gear choices are your level and your three base character stats, which all rise as your character grows and you invest in your classes. And yes I said classES because Grim Dawn lets you choose two of its six archetypes to mix into your character.\n\nThe classes themselves can be a bit of a hangup for new players because of the unique level of control you have over your skill progression. Rather than unlocking skills at certain levels, each class tree has a Mastery bar for you to spend skill points on. This bar grants you important base stat boosts and unlocks your actual skills with enough points invested. Of course, then you have to balance spending points on Mastery or the skills, and across two class trees to boot. It can be a bit daunting until you realize your greatest gains come from your Mastery, so you'll generally want to one-point your skills until you unlock them all.\n\nMany of your skills are passive, meaning combat tends to be less technical than Diablo or other competitors. Indeed, more than a few battles are won or lost in the preparation of auras, toggle abilities, and weapon selections. You'll also find skills baked into the gear and upgrade components you find, some powerful enough to design an entire build around. In another liberating design decision, class skills are much more focused and specific while item skills are your more general fireballs and lightning novas, allowing you to make a pure caster out of literally any class combination.\n\nUnprecedented freedom means nothing if there's nothing to do with it, but Grim Dawn does not disappoint here, either. The world of Cairn is in the throes of a magical apocalypse, with ruined towns and valleys and forests full of unspeakable horrors to bludgeon. Enemies and allies alike are divided into factions, with new quests and gearing options availiable from those that like you, and new bosses and challenges from those who don't. The main quest will keep you busy for a good 30 hours just putting down one of the major threats to the world, but building reputation and uncovering new secrets can last you dozens more hours.\n\nAnd my God, the secrets! I'm a big fan of exploration in games and few reward you so richly as this. Unmarked dungeons and unique bosses can pop up just about anywhere, providing unexpected challenges at any level. Virtually every map has breakable walls and hidden chests, and much of the best loot to be had is found in hard-to-reach containers. I once found a secret dungeon beneath a side dungeon inside a completely optional dungeon! On top of all this, there's another character progression system called Devotion that uses points earned from hidden shrines all over the world, a genius system that more ARPGs would do well to ape.\n\nGrim Dawn doesn't hold back in challenge, either, with some brutally hard side dungeons and optional bosses right from the first few hours. The main quest is easy enough to get through for even the inexperienced, so you have your choice of difficulty through exploration as well. All of this is presented with a gritty, moody look and some meaty sound work, though the soundtrack is pretty lacking and gets repetitive in a hurry. The Lovecraftian themes are well-realized and there's a ton of detail to the world, from engaging lore to morally gray decisions to make. Even if there wasn't so much to work with in the gear and skills systems this would be a solid competitor to Diablo and its ilk, but the wealth of options and progression systems easily makes Grim Dawn one of the top titles in the genre.","April 30","true","57.2"," 79 of 82 people (96%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","96","79","82","7","1"

Even when they used the same engine as Titan Quest, the graphics in this game looks amazing and stunning.\n\nIts like the developers didnt want ANY place in this game to look like it has been created on a hurry. Every single bit of environment you encounter looks just right. The trees, the little abandoned cottages, the looks of mobs. As far as I have played, which isnt that much yet, even the most outlying places looks great.\n\nI am a fan of multiplayer, and the way this games handles the ''drop-in'' and ''drop-out'' of multiplayer works like a charm. Indeed, they dont support their own servers for multiplayer, but they did an awesome job here. No port forwarding needed. Just enter if you would like to play single player, multiplayer using LAN or INTERNET, or joining one of those. Everyone with a decent connection should not have any problems with this game playing over either Lan or Internet.\n\nThe dept of this game overall is amazing. The skilltrees, the devotion points (Points that can be acquired through shrines around the world), the dual specialization, the different classes. The blacksmith who can craft amazing and lots of items and add-ons for your character. The shared stash tab, so you can share items between other characters instantly.\n\nAlthough Grimdawn is an ARPG, the different playstyles you can combine with or without friends feels so good. I have played a lot of RPG's and ARPG's before, but Grimdawn feels like something ''new''. Not the standard hack and slash experience, but something feels different in this game. All the variation in it makes it so great. You even have an option to turn your camera around, so if you're bored with this game (I cant image why), you could turn the camera 180 degrees and its like you're playing a whole new world!\n\nWould I recommend this game?\nWell definitely I will!\n\nAnd that for only 25 euro's?

Besides that I've also put time and effort in Torchlight II and Path of Exile, which I both found to be better than Diablo III but which still couldn't satisfy my ARPG need. Now I've purchased Grim Dawn early on but due to performance issues I was unable to play it at that time (which have been fixed) and I left it until recently.\n\nMy experience comes from playing Act I in Hardcore Veteran mode, both solo and with friends in multiplayer. The difficulty at Veteran -which is a modifier to Normal difficulty, increasing the amount of "Hero enemies" and the rewards that you reap from them- is very solid. You will roughly level from 1 to 18-20 during Act I, during which I got the feeling that this game is quite well balanced. Sometimes you will feel weak, but most of the time that is to be fixed with reassigning your skills.\n\nThe overal look and feel of this game is, like the name implies; Grim. It's dark and "serious", like Diablo II and Path of Exile. No cartoony art-style as Diablo III or Torchlight II. Personally I find this to be a big plus, seeing as this gives the game a more serious presentation.\n\nThe unique point of this game is that you start the game without choosing a class, called masteries in Grim Dawn. Once you reach your first level you gain the option to select one out of six masteries; Arcanist, Demolitionist, Nightblade, Occultist, Shaman, Soldier. Each mastery has an unique and fun skill tree with enough skills to keep you trying out stuff for a while.\n\nJust like in Diablo II you will have to assign attribute points to either Physical (health), Cunning (melee) or Spirit (mana). A lot of gear you will find will require X points into Physical and either X points in Cunning or Spirit, depending on the kind of gear (weapon type, heavy or normal armor).\n\nThis goes on until you reach level 10, at which the game presents you to choose a (optional) second mastery. You can choose to combine masteries to supplement your character with additional skills that would otherwise be impossible to get, or to ignore this and go deeper into your previously selected mastery. Based on the combination of masteries you've chosen, your character class title will change to something else. The option of adding a second mastery will stay definitely once level 10 has been reached. The current level-cap is 85.\n\nAll in all this game feels refreshingly good and comes close to the feeling I've got while playing Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, but without the bots running all the games. If you need something different from Diablo III, Torchlight II or Path of Exile, this is it.","January 5","true","127.1"," 80 of 87 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","80","87","2","0"

After the first 5 minutes the game totally got me. Just like Diablo 2 did, years ago. The atmosphere is wonderful and dark, graphics are nice but not kick a.s.s, Sounds are also very dark and just fitting. The Skilltrees are the way they had to be in Diablo 3 and the whole itemsystem with blueprints (not yet working though!) is really motivating and interesting. So far I´ve played 70 hours, testing alot of nice builds, checking out fix ideas and such on this ALPHA on GREENLIGHT, which gave me TONS more fun than Diablo3 ever did.

It's hard to describe here, but the overall "smoothness" feel of build 31 is significantly better than it was in b29/30.

Also at 491 hours and rising it should tell you i've enjoyed this game greatly, and have paid for two other copies that i gave to my brother and a friend. Now lets get to the actual Review.\n\nGrim Dawn as a game does not hold your hand, in quests you are told to seek out something or someone at a location, after that you are left on your own to search for your objective, only once you get near your objective(about near the edge of your screen) does a marker show up. This encourages exploration of areas in full and i also reccomend that you fully explore an area there are many secrets in the game to be found, from loot, to quests, to bosses that may or may not kill your character when you first meet them.\n\nThe world is also not sectioned off like say as it was in Titan Quest or Diablo, it is instead one continous worldspace, akin to Sacred, some complain about this giving the games world areas too similar to one another, i personally enjoy this as it creates a more cohesive world.\n\nAs for the games story, i find it enjoyable enough, when you start the game your character was to be hung at the gallows for being possessed by an Aetherial spirit, said spirit abandons ship before it dies with you, you're cut down, then asked if you want to stay you need to earn your keep by assisting the settlement of Devils Crossing, i wont spoil much more, but another thing i would like to address about the games story is that some NPC's you meet arent helpless sods needing rescue, bar some casses. theres quite a few times in the game where you find the odd NPC camped out somewhere surrounded by slain monsters, I find this a refreshing change of pace compaired to other ARPGs. Lastly much of Grim Dawn's history, backstory, and lore are found via notes scattered throughout the world, some are journals from before the game, others history of the world, or just the odd bit of why a particular foe is with a faction. Again encouraing more exploration of the world.\n\nNow to the meat and bones of any ARPG, Character customiztion, progression and loot. Lets start with the Masteries, in Grim Dawn there are 5(and a 6th coming in the next build, Build 27) Masteries, Soldier, Demolitionist, Occultist, Nightblade, and Arcanist, and soon to be the Shaman.\n\nthe Soldier is your melee specialist,  hearty and strong, a robust choice for someone new to grim dawn.\n\nThe Demolitionist is all about explosions and fire. Like seeing the world burn? then this is the mastery for you.\nThe Occultist Focuses on debuffs, pets, and debilitating attack spells. command minions to maul your foes or debilitate them with vile curses.\nThe Nightblade is your melee dual wielder, focusing on speed, and very fast attacks, want to shred your enemies into ribbons? chose the nightblade\nThe Arcanist is a pure spellcaster  that rains down destruction and devastation. the glass cannon of the game\nEach of these masteries can be combined with another to create a dual class, covering one masteries weakness or bolstering anothers strengths. in my opinion this lends the game a great deal of replay value because i am the kind of person who will explore all avenues of play. with the varied skill pool of a single mastery there are quite a few dual class combinations you can take advantage of and explore different playstyles.\n\nThe loot in Grim Dawn is quite good, the qualities ranging from White(basic), Yellow(magic), Green(rare or rare monster infrequent), Blue(epic) and Purple(Legendary, not yet in the game). Curiously magic rare and epic are competative, in some character builds a good yellow might be all you need to properly outfit an equipment slot,  while another can get by with some basic epic items, or builds looking to gear in all rare equipment. there are a number of affixes to suit any and all builds, as well as epics.\n\nThere is also a Faction system in Grim Dawn, there are many groups you can aid, and many you can anger. Increasing your standing with friendly factions allows you access to their equipment and augments. these augments offer additional bonuses to your items and can be worth the effort to obtain access to them. Conversely further angering hostile factions makes them send more dangerous enemies at each threshold, culminating in the chance to encounter a Nemesis, a random boss linked to the faction you angered. these nemesis bosses while rare drop incredible loot, and assure an epic from their defeat, and once they are in the game, an increased chance of legendary drops.\n\nthis last section I am going to adress some deal breakers: Many ask "will there be secure servers?" at this time there are no plans for such, it is however under consideration if Grim Dawn sells enough to pay for the required infrastructure and personel to maintain them. Tying into that, Grim Dawns files are all stored locally, every game file and every save file is on your hard drive, to those with the ability to edit and modify them, they can. this leads to seeing some oddities in multiplayer games, like players exceeding the current set level cap, items that are unobtainable legitamately, and stats that are likewise impossible. Grim Dawn is going to be moddable, this is why the games files are on our hard drives, so that once we have the mod tools we can edit the files as we please. Lastly while there is PvP, it is not the focus of the game and is not balanced accordingly, in fact most pvp matches tend to be whoever gets hit first dies. Grim dawn is primarily PvE and will remain as such.\n\nTo close this out, if you want an ARPG that offers very deep character customization and itemization and great gameplay and atmosphere then this game is for you. If you want a secure multiplayer experience away from what you would consider cheaters this might not be your cup of tea.\n\nthank you for reading my long as hell review.\n\nsee the full version on the forums here: http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?p=249496#post249496","July 13, 2015","true","896.4"," 62 of 64 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","62","64","0","0"

I suppose I'll write a review after testing the game for over 1k hours though after the game's release I will definitely update this.\n\nSo. Let's start with the company. Crate Entertainment currently consists of a team of 8 people who not only communicate with the community (this is amazing) - but also know how to create a kick ♥♥♥ game. They started with only 2 people for quite some time while receiving off and on support from people they knew who also worked on TQ - gradually and with help from Kickstarter + Steam Early Access sales they have managed to expand and continue to amaze the fans who are eagerly waiting for this game to be released (even now it is defnitely worth it imo).\n\nGrim Dawn takes all the good things from Titan Quest and makes it better while also distinguishing itself in it's own way. The game plays and feels like Titan Quest while it also reminds me of Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 when it comes to the grittier/darker visual appeal. This to me is the ultimate combination of ARPG games and to be apart of the development process in testing and providing feedback for such a game is an amazing experience.\n\nNow to the game.\n\nStory - Grim Dawn is actually what the peope of Cairn (world of Grim Dawn) call what is pretty much the apocolypse in that an invasion of 2 otherwordly races have invaded the world. One race, the Aetherials want to possess everything that lives all the while pretty much terraforming the planet in order to make Cairn a more liveable place for them - while the other race, the Ch'thonians want to stop this from happening which means butchering those that the Aetherials are interested in possessing which includes you and any survivors that managed to live through the initial invasion.\n\nThat is the overall plot in which the beginning of the game is more stressing the survival aspects of living in a now ruined world - while also building a foundation for future encounters with the Aetherials and Ch'thonic invaders. The danger is very real - and there are other nasty beasts, creatures and outlaws that also pose a threat to your survival.\n\nThere are Quest Options for choosing different outcomes in a quest, and there will be factions that will be added later on in development (perhaps late this year or early next year hopefully).\n\nCombat - Very much like Titan Quest but having a faster pace. So far it's been quite good and the devs continually update animations, balance skills, and fix bugs with skills when they can. Definitely not Diablo 3 which admittedly has some good combat that flows very well (one of the few things that I'll give to the game) - but it's still pretty good. Hopefully as development continues whatever issues that people find will be fixed and improved upon.\n\nCharacterization - Creating a character has only male/female options but this will probably change later when it comes to having different options for faces/hair as pertaining to a dev post. As this isn't hugely important it will be done later on I would imagine. However the main thing: replay value and creating Skill Builds. This is definitely there. Just like Titan Quest, Grim Dawn has the dual mastery system where you start off with one mastery/class at level 2 and once you reach level 10 you can choose a second one. With 5 Mastery's that is 15 combinations of either sticking with 1 mastery or using the dual mastery system. Itemization also expands character builds by a lot which brings me to...\n\nItemization/Crafting - Really good. Common/White items are useful for the couple low levels in which you can then turn them off (making them more of a visual look when it comes to enemies dropping stuff they are wearing/using(!!!)), Magic/Yellow items are next in line which although not usually as powerful as later tiers they can roll a lot higher with their affixes, Rare/Green items have affixes that are unique and can be quite powerful, Epic/Blue items have set affixes with merely the rolls being varied + they can be set items, and Legendary items are not yet in the game.\n\nNeedless to say the itemization in this game is fantastic and compliments both the skill building aspect of the game and the loot hunt part of the game.\n\nLevel Design - Handcrafted world means the level design looks really good but of course trades that off with less randomization. Enemy camps can be randomized in some cases and there are randomized barriers which players can encounter and have to find a way to get around them via an alternate route - giving some slight randomization and also promoting exploration. The level design for each area is done in such a way that the player can continue on in the direction of the next area quickly - or spend time to explore the area for loot/dungeons/caves/quests. Essentially levels are short but wide - so later playthroughs you can choose whether or not to spend more time exploring or continuing on with the quests. The game isn't finished yet so content on Act 3 and perhaps the miniature Act 4 that may be added will also be quite interesting to see.\n\nEnemies - Are quite diverse and are also in their own faction which means you can actually see Aetherials and Ch'thonic enemies duking it out before you even get to the fight. As with Titan Quest later difficulties means secret bosses/challenge dungeons that would have been locked in the previous difficulty.\n\nSome more Positive things:\n-Modding - is amazing. Titan Quest and Diablo 2 both have great mods that I have enjoyed and since GD's modding tools will be better I am hoping for some amazing mods later on in the future.\n-Survival Mode. Sounds just like it says in that you need to survive against waves of enemies, modding can definitely expand on this.\n-Open World PVP. Though the game's skills/itemization isn't based on PVP modding could definitely create balanced PVP and probably some interesting game modes I would imagine.\n-Camera that is fully rotatable and has decent zoom.  Might not seem like that much of a deal but after playing GD - trying other ARPG's or even Moba's can be relatively frustrating due to lack of camera control.\n-Weather + Day and Night System.\n-Will be DRM free on release - for those that are wary about Steam and want to fully own the game.\n-No economy.\n\nSome possible Negatives:\n-Single player based with optional multiplayer. Single player mode is perfectly fine while multiplayer can be a bit iffy mainly due to it being just released - optimization will definitely improve on the multiplayer experience.\n-No closed servers. Like TL2 and TQ there aren't closed servers. Should the game do amazingly well the devs have expressed their interest in such a thing but they would rather spend money on more content before considering closed servers. That being said public games are usually pretty good and if someone joins in with a modded character you can always ban them from the game/server. A con when it comes to modding but the pros definitely outwheigh the cons.\n-No economy.\n-Slow development. Though I expect the game to be finished either early or middle of next year - the pace is relatively slow due to having a small team. That being said they do communicate well with the forum users and give updates every other Monday.\n-Costs $25. For some reason people really like F2P games but I'd rather pay a flat price for a full game rather then have a gimped free version of the game. For what you get out of the game $25 is super cheap even with the content that is available now.\n-Not optimized. Though I can run the game at max fine, that doesn't mean everyone can. Obviously lack of optimization is a given that will be improved later on in development - however both the devs and the community are pretty good in trying to help those who are having issues with running the game.\n\nConclusion: Grim Dawn is definitely worth $25 if you enjoyed Titan Quest and perhaps Diablo 1 or 2.\n10/10 for an excellent Early Access game. Will update on release.","October 9, 2014","true","529.0"," 67 of 72 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","67","72","0","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/219990/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","In the grim dawnness of Crate Entertainments' ARPG, there is only excellence...\nGrim Dawn has had one of the longest journeys through Early Access, I've been there right from the start, when it was a very rough and ready prototype with the first act, when the frame rate was choppy and the scenery was a little bit flat to say the least. But gods, the core gameplay was satisfying. It scratched the itch that only Diablo 2 and more recently Path of Exile had scratched in a very specific, and pleasing way. Over the intervening timeframe, it has grown, evolved, and refined itself, and matured into this majestic, noble thing.\n\nScalable across a wide variety of systems, able to look beautiful on the very highest of rigs and still managing to look good on systems of modest means whilst maintaining a good framerate, the levelling and class development has grown with six base classes available, and the ability to dual class means that in effect you've the choice of no less than fifteen possible combinations from which to pick your build from. Twenty one if you decide for whatever reason to stick with a purely single class setup (which is eminently possible, but who wants to just go one way these days when you can swing two...). That's not even touching on the brilliantly insane devotion system, which unfolds like something that looked at Path of Exile and went "You know, we can go one better..."\n\nAnd unlike Diablo 3 and Path of Exile, you can play THIS ARPG entirely offline.\n\nWaking to misery, trudging through despair, fighting through bleakness...\nThe backstory of Grim Dawn is suitably black, tinged with plenty of sadness and horror along the way, and the story gets really dark in places, make no mistake, there's bits of the narrative which would serve as excellent nightmare fuel. This is going on for some of the less pleasant bits of Path of Exile, and makes Diablo 3 look like a nice and cheerful jaunt through the land of happy and merry. You -start- by fighting resurrected corpses and the recently raised villagers, sometimes loved ones of the very survivors you're actually trying to help, and things will only get -worse- as you take on demonic beings, aetherials and creatures dragged up from the very depths of whatever plane they saw fit to drag themselves up (or down) from.\n\nDespite this, the world manages to retain plenty of detail and colour, even if the overall atmosphere is unremittingly one of a world that has seen the coming of the end of days, and now clings on to existence by its' very fingernails. Villages are forced into fortified structures and natural defensive choke points, clinging to any kind of survival they can scratch out in this new, terrible world, everyone is on edge, and trust is hard to earn.\n\nThis is particularly the case since you've had the "good" fortune to escape your demise by hanging as whatever posessed you decided to take leave, but in turn has left you the ability to create riftgates, these tears in reality are your fast travel around the world, but as it turns out, enabling them can just as readily draw aetherials to your location, a harbinger of what messing with such things might portend.\n\nThe sweet rhythm of loot...\nOn a mechanical level, the game will be instantly, and comfortingly familiar to anyone who has played Diablo 2 or Path of Exile, and reasonably familiar to anyone who has played Torchlight or any ARPG along these lines in the last five years. You move from place to place, picking up quests, clearing out monsters and champions, collecting escalating piles of loot, slowly building up your hero from a nobby nobody into a churning engine of destruction that can bring havoc upon the battlefield. In this the game works exceptionally well, the combat feels meaty, the skills are well balanced, most classes harmonise together in various ways (even class combos you wouldn't initially expect to work CAN work with the right gear and devotion star signs), and the loot drops at a steady clip.\n\nThere's always new places to explore, new dungeons to plumb, new points of interest to look at, new shrines to cleanse and new things to -do-. Going back to your character is a bit like settling into a comfy sweater, it's comfort gaming at its' finest, and a great way to sink a few hours if you need a time out from the world. It's terrifyingly addictive and you'll find at every step of the way there's something to hook you in to keep you going just that little bit further, and it's not the skinner box approach, here it's the interest of "what shiny will I grab next" or "what new dungeon will I get to see" or "What awesome new boss might I fight?" or "What will the story reveal?"\n\nThis game eats time. It eats it with an appetite that borders on the scary. You'll sit down thinking you might do a quick session, you'll blink and two hours will have elapsed. It's that easy to get into, and it makes it that easy to just settle into a rhythm that is practically hypnotic. Don't play this game if you have deadlines to meet the next day, bad, bad idea.\n\nClosing thoughts...\nCrate Entertainment have finally answered the calls for a true blooded ARPG in the vein of D2 and D2X, a proper old school game that can be played whenever you want, wherever you want, that showers you with insane loot with all kinds of prefixes and suffixes, a game where builds are many and varied, where working out what KIND of Arcanist you want to be might need an A3 sheet of paper just to fit the devotion starmap onto, but would I have it any other way?\n\nAbsolutely not. This is the ARPG that Diablo 3 wasn't, and Path of Exile, despite being -good-, sadly falls short with the need to be online all the time. This is the one I can take with me wherever I go. This is the one YOU can take wherever you go, that it's thoroughly excellent on top makes this a complete no brainer.\n\nVerdict : Essential","March 4","true","80.4"," 68 of 76 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","68","76","3","16"

The short answer is that it is "Titan Quest" 2.0. The long answer is that Grim Dawn is an ARPG from Crate Entertainment. The game takes places in the world of Cairn, where it is basically destroyed by 2 supernatural warring factions (Chthonians & Aetherials). The Chthonians seeks to rid the world of all humans, while the Aetherials seeks to possess the humans and use them for their own gains. You are the survivor of one of those “possessions” and this is where you begin your adventures.\n\nThe game has some great features (PROS) and not so great features (CONS), which I will be detailing below.\n\nIn terms of greatness / Pros:\n\n6 core classes with the ability to select a 2nd class (at level 10) to further customize your character. (various character builds)\nLots of customization for different playstyles & characters, including the Devotion system.\nCrafting systems is really cool, especially once you start collecting the difference recipes.\nMultiplayer is fun once you get a session started and are in a good group of players.\nOffline play / no “always online" requirement to play the game.\nModding Tools.\nDev updates (aka: Grim Misadventure).\nDark but beautiful world (dead bodies everywhere).\nIn terms of lackluster/ Cons:\n\nMultiplayer can be frustrating as the connection can be subpar & some games are laggy.\nGraphic performance is underwhelming in some areas of the game. (i.e. Plains of Strife, where I get ca. 30 fps on a 980ti)\nMelee characters have a harder time, compared to magic / ranged based characters.\nCan get boring running through the same levels with different characters as there are no Pre-Generated levels/dungeons and depending on the player, the end game can be lacking.\nNo “secret passage” like in TQ IT ;)\nThis was a secret area in TQ: IT, where the bosses were named after the developers.  I am also aware of Dalia's SUPER SECRET QUEST, but for me it is not the same\nConclusion\nGrim dawn is the spiritual successor to Titan Quest. They took the best of the core elements from TQ and improved upon them while adding new features (i.e. Devotions).\n\nIn the end it is a worthy buy and I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a great ARPG set in a dark atmosphere.\n\n**********************\nSIDE NOTE: Another aspect, which I find interesting is that the developers have already stated that they are working on a survival mode and there is already an expansion planned for the future. This level of support for the customer is really nice to see and they are continuing with small updated to the game (i.e. patch 1.03 - Devotion changes)","April 30","true","806.9"," 56 of 59 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","56","59","0","2"

They were good games and I enjoyed most of them that I played, (except Torchlight, wasn't a fan for some reason) but they still left me wanting.\nIf you can relate, Grim Dawn is what you've been looking for, its cherrypicked the best systems and ideas of all the recent well-done ARPGS, and basically jammed them back into a reimagining of Diablo 2 with great results\n\nIts the most worthy among a slew of competitors for the true successor to Diablo 2 (including PoE, D3, Titan Quest:IT, Torchlight 1 & 2)\nIf you feel like this genre had gotten stagnant, like I did, this game will renew your hope.\n\n+1-4 player, instanced loot, trade loot, enemy difficulty/loot scaling by player\n+Atmosphere and feel of Diablo 2, but with guns\n+Class/level system of Titan Quest\n+Tons of components, crafting, and enhancements that significantly alter playstyle and can easily alter build path, like Path of Exile\n+Fantastic character build options\n+Shoulder slot\n+Totally needless amount of isntanced loot\n+good loot variety\n+good enemy variety\n+huge enemy groups, frequent enemy heros\n+fun, satisfying combat\n+Main quest is decently long, high replayability\n+reasonably priced\n\n=some pretty blatant recreations of Diablo 2 encounters (definitely more of an homage than a copy)\n=Class-granted skills are varied, but uninspired.

The hanging exorcises the aetheric infestation (4th dimentional being has no desire to die stuck in your body). Your rope gets shot down and the game starts with you enhanced body being asked if you're willing to redeam yourself and help save a small parcel of humanity. No spoilers there folks, watch the trailer (nicely done).\n\nThe setting is as if someone took magical Renaissance era Europe added a touch of the old West, a dash of Tesla, and iced it all with some Soloman Kane.\n\nGraphically\nYou've got the 3 person top down angle camera view.\nAnd well folks... while the detail level isn't bad. This game is dark, grubby, and crumbling in looks. A while one occationally gets to walk through areas like this\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=652567803\nmore often you'll get dungeons like this and darker\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=652567901\n\nI turned up my brightness. Cause everytime I was in a dark area at night. Even with light enhancing items, it was bloody hard to see. Which is realistic (and can be nice in a horror game) but I personally don't find it fun in a dungeon crawler.\n\nAudio\n30% of NPCs have voice acting. The rest speak only in text format. The hacks, shots, grunts, ect are worthy; but nothing special. The background music is your typical ignoreable mood enhancer stuff.\n\nGameplay\nNow here's where it gets enjoyable. It's your standard mouse point directional walk, left click attack, right click ect.. with the customizeable 2 layered slots for potions, spells, special attacks, and the permanent spot for your personal rift portal (that your lovely modifed humanity grants you). A great class system and you'll get to choose 2 of them eventually. Then you get you devotional choices once you restore your first shrine (on a nice astrological skill map). Your inventory will expand with some quests. You have a storage chest and the ability to send items to your other characters. You get enhancement bits to add to your items. Once you help the blacksmith, the ability to craft.\n\nAnd if all that seams familar to you (to any core rpg player it should) there's the truth of this game. The developers have taken nearly every well working gameplay aspect from all the games before and used them.This isn't a bad thing even if it's not truly inovative. It's nostalgic without being hokey.\n\nThere's also multiplayer available.........\n\nOverall\nI really think if you ever enjoyed a 3 person view RPG you should buy this. It's a premium experiance and a excellent dungeon grinder.","March 25","true","42.4"," 60 of 66 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","60","66","0","0"

As time passed, what began as sort of a hobby turned into a real undertaking. And then a work of passion. Now, 6 years later, we are looking at the end result of that work, all new paint, polished up and ready to drive.\n\nSo was the wait worth it? Hell yes it was. This game is a masterpiece.

This game has TONS of loot, many different class combos, exciting combat and a decent story to hold it all together. I picked this up when it was 50% off, but I would have still been happy having paid full price of $25 as there is a LOT of content here.\n\nThis game is still in Early Access (full game due around Q1 '16) but you wouldn't know it while playing. The dev's have focused on releasing one act at a time, and releasing quality content instead of a full game of bugs and glitches. I've played now for about 40 hours and haven't encountered a single bug, which is quite impressive. The only negative I could think of is the frame rate gets a little choppy at times, but I'm guessing this is just an optimisation thing, which will no doubt happen before launch.\n\nIn short: Great game and really good value considering the content within and the asking price. I totally recommend this to all ARPG fans or just RPG fans in general.","October 28, 2015","true","45.7"," 50 of 52 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","50","52","0","1"

I saw it and thought "Re-skin of Titan Quest." I am happy to see the spirit of TQ perserved while establishing itself as it's own Intellectual Property and its take on Action Role Playing Games.\n\nI was let down by the charactor creation (I spend a lot of time on charactor creation in games like Saints Row 3, 4 and Skyrim etc) and thusly wasn't able to creat a persona that felt like mine. However I've come to expect this from ARPGs so I wasn't to let down.\n\nAfter playing Diablo 3 from launch and being terribly dissapointed by it's lacklustre story I was impressed by how fast I took to the setting and story being told here. In a nutshell you are a "Taken" and about to be hung. Once the game began I noticed zombies assaulting the town and was actually excited to get into the swing of things. 5 hours later, my wife is giving me the stare and the fog clears. This is the first ARPG to legit suck me into the zone. Story wise there are genuine choices to be had and content "can be skipped" (Zones have a minimum monster level however).\n\nGameplay wise I've only played as a Demolistionist/Occultist but the skills are rewarding and the weapons have an oomph. One gripe i have is being unable to undo mastery points (Something I learned a little late) full on respecs should be a thing.\n\nGraphically the game looks well, the setting and the monsters fit in and match the games tone.\n\nI highly suggest this game to any ARPG lover.","February 25, 2015","true","60.0"," 64 of 74 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","64","74","4","5"

TBH, this game is the whole reason I initially downloaded Steam. For awhile, I wasn't a big fan of the whole Steam idea. Now it's a part of life. Strange how things work out. Anyway, deciding I should actually start supporting these talented small teams early instead of just crossing my fingers like I did with GGG, I backed Crate pretty heavily on Kickstarter (for me at least) and had to install Steam to test their Alpha releases.\n\nMy opinion has, of course, wavered throughout the last few years. At the finish line, I can assure you that this is a top-notch aRPG that belongs in ANYONE's arsenal who claims to be a fan of the genre.\n\nMy pet-peave at the moment is that with it's stellar reviews on big-name sites such as ign and such it is of course getting the indoctrinal "which is better" treatment.\n\nGrim Dawn is it's own beast.\n\nPath of Exile is my social aRPG. I play it for teamwork. I play it for that economical atmostphere. Sure, it still has a great single player feel. It's just a little more casual in that regard. And hey, if you're not a PoE fan, I can totally appreciate that. It's not for everyone. I just mention it here because the comparison between the two seems constant lately, and I happen to very much like the title and respect both GGG and Crate highly for their work ethic regardless(note to readers, I play PoE almost exclusively OFF steam, so my time logged is not correct, because I did not have steam yet when I started the game).\n\nGrim dawn is a more serious single player aRPG. I play it for those serious solo-theorycrafting craves I get sometimes. Sure, it has multiplayer, and it's great with friends. It's just more casual in that regard and wasn't really designed around it. It also will have amazing modding capabilities that PoE will never have (see below).\n\nComparing the two games is really an easy thing to do since they're in the same genre, so I understand why all the youtubers do it, but it's actually unfair, get it? In reality, both games are not at odds for our attention at all, but actually are different enough to work in concert together. Basically what I'm saying is, I'm a fan of both. if you're a fan of one, it shouldn't mean you shouldn't be a fan of the other. Especially in what I'm convinced is the Golden Age of Action RPG's where a game like Grim DAwn can offer so much depth/complexity for half the price of what I paid for that disappointing night out with my GF to see Nolan's "Interstellar."\n\n***********************************************\nIf you are wondering why I left out Diablo 3: Reaper of $ouls,\n\nit's because I'm only considering Professional Titles, not amateur ones.\n***********************************************\n\n-WHY 50% OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT "HACKING PROBLEMS" ARE WRITTEN BY IDIOTS-\n\nIt's important to understand that there is no  Online Warden in this game like in Diablo 3 or Path of Exile and that seems to be upsetting a lot of people. It is the reason for 50% of the "Negative Reviews" you see above. Those people are ignorant, and let me explain why:\n\nCrate never wanted the game to be server-side. See, when they made TQ clientside last decade, they discovered something HUGE... that we as a community... are fricking amazing at supporting games we love.\n\n\nWe took TQ and we\n1. Patched it\n2. Fixed it even more\n3. Improved it\n4. Added voice overs\n5. Translated it into foreign languages like... I dunno Samarian & Klingon probably [chk source]\n6. New Mechanics\n7. More DLCs\n8. Even more DLCs\n9. User Tools for more fun\n10. ENTIRELY NEW SEQUELS\n11. "HOLY F***, GUYS, SOMEONE JUST RECREATED DIABLO 2: LOD ON OUR GAME ENGINE!!! WE ARE NEVER EVER EVER MAKING A GAME SERVER-SIDE AGAIN. IN FACT, THAT GAME WE'RE WORKING ON NOW? GRIM DAWN IS IT? LET'S JUST RELEASE THE GAME WITH ALL THE TOOLS WE USED TO CREATE THE DARN THING TOO TO THEM. OUR FANS ARE AWESOME!!!"\n\n--This is the reason for 50% of the negative reviews. Because Clientside unfortunately means that, if you WANT TO, it's also really easy to cheat and have any item. Other great aRPGs use clientside too. Torchlight 2 does as well.\n\nThe point is, who cares? Don't not buy an amazing aRPG in the Golden Era of Action RPGs simply because your friend MIGHT not have actually found his "Sword of a Thousand Truths." Get a new friend, I dunno.  You're getting an amazing game for $25.\n\nAnd if history with TQ taught us anything. In the next couple years. Us fans are gonna give you a few more amazing games for free with this engine too. FREE... provided you have purchased the GD engine, of course ;-)\n\n\nLostman-","April 10","true","730.3"," 58 of 65 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","58","65","5","3"

With 201 Games on Steam, it is my most-played and easily my favorite. Oh, you want a review? OK then...\n\nGrim Dawn presents a nitty-gritty world ravaged both my man's mistakes as much as otherworldly invasion. The feel of this world is perpetuated in every facet of the design of the game. Skills and attacks - player and enemy alike - are brutal and satisfying. The UI is precisely what it needs to be to get the points of its contents across to the player; it is no fancier than that. The quests have a purpose to them - 'We feel threatened by X, fix that for us by slaying him/her/it' - but they do not go out of their way in their descriptions to make their completion any easier than a rough idea of where to go. This game is designed to be played solely by you, your inclinations, and you intuition, not to help you play it with omniscient developer input and assistance. But you get what you give, and then a little more. You'll hunt across beautiful hand-crafted landscapes for terrifyingly monstrous entities, read immersive and haunting texts scattered throughout the world, and develop a character of your own design, one of your own play-style and skill choices.\n\nOK, so that's all the RPG stuff out of the way. So how does Grim Dawn put the Action in Action-RPG? At the beginning of the game, it does not do so wildly. Nor should it; if you started a god then any godly things you did throughout the game would feel all the same. But eventually the combat of Grim Dawn becomes fast paced and as brutal as the world around you. Every enemy in Grim Dawn is designed to kill you with merciless potency, and you'll have in your arsenal an array of spells, skills, and items to decimate you foes with terrific effect. Rarely will you ever feel truly immortal; the world of Grim Dawn has foes tough enough to go toe-to-toe with the most dedicated players.\n\nGrim Dawn is a hack-and-slash ARPG that does everything it needs to and so much more. I've spent around $150 on the game between gifts and pre-purchasing for myself, and I've gotten more than five hours of enjoyment for every dollar spent. If you've read this far, do yourself the favor and pick it up for $25.","November 9, 2015","true","921.1"," 117 of 156 people (75%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","75","117","156","72","0"

But as I played through it, several positives that other similar ARGP's don't have become clear:\n\nPositives:\n+ Grim Dawn has six well-rounded premade 'classes' you can invest in.\nIn Grim Dawn, you start out with all options open and you can choose from a big variation of offensive and defensive skills.\n+ Grim Dawn allows for Dual Class mixing.\nAfter reaching level 10, you can start investing points in another 'class' skill tree, allowing you to mix with even more offensive/defensive skills from that other class.\n+ Grim Dawn has an item for most skill builds.\nThe items in Grim Dawn are unique, but also generic in a good sense. Flat bonuses to whatever type of damage your character deals are widely available.\n+ Grim Dawn has a massive variety of item-enhancers (called Materials).\nYou find these in the world and can attach them to items to make them more powerful in a certain way, or use them in the extensive crafting system. They can be somewhat compared to 'socketable gems or runes' in Diablo 2, but every item has a 'socket'.\n+ Grim Dawn has a very extensive 'talent' system (called Devotion).\nIn the world you find shrines that once defeated/something sacrificed to award a talent point. This can be invested in a very broad talent system. This has a slight downside for those who do NOT enjoy theorycrafting; it can be a bit overwhelming.\n+ Grim Dawn plays fluently.\nNow this may seem irrelevant, but for those who played Path of Exile and were thrown off by the 'clunky' gameplay (I know I was) will have a much cleaner feel of gameplay flow in Grim dawn that is almost similar to Diablo 3. You character feels very responsive to your actions and he goes where you want him to go.\n+ Grim Dawn has a good mix between realistic and clear art style.\nTo make a game both pretty in a realistic way AND still be able to see what happens where is NOT easy, and Grim Dawn does a good job at it. The minimap, map and color scheme are all clear enough to see (I am r-g colorblind).\n+ Grim Dawn is fun to play with friends.\nOnce set up, GD is a very enjoyable multiplayer experience. You can easily build characters that complement each other, or slaughter each other in a duel.\n+ Grim Dawn items can (usually) be traded/given to friends.\nYeah, this is good. Not like Diablo 3 where every-****ing-thing is soulbound. Some items in Grim Dawn are also soulbound, but with reason.\n+ Grim Dawn ultimate difficulty is unforgiving.\nIt may remind some people of Diablo 3 Inferno mode, which is not for the casual player. I put this as a negative and positive on purpose, as this is a matter of taste.\n\nNegatives:\n- Grim Dawn has a seemingly pointless mechanic of stat points.\nYou are allowed to invest in Physique, Cunning or Spirit. Physique gives hp and other health bonuses, Cunning gives crit and hit bonuses and Spirit gives more energy to spam your skills. It SEEMS like a choice at first, but because items REQUIRE flat amounts of these stats (715 Spirit for that great caster item, 715 Physique for that awesome armor) this choice is an illusion. In fact, this can be very frustrating for a first playthrough; you might not be able to wear something awesome you find. Diablo 3 doesn't have this problem (but many others).\n- Grim Dawn tends to stutter a bit with large amounts of monsters and particles on screen.\nPlayed on a high-end PC (2016 built), with 3 Wind Devils, 3 Storm Totems, 1 Wendigo Totem and 4 packs of monsters can give lag, even on the best of machines. This is not any worse than on similar games like D3 or PoE.\n- Grim Dawn leveling can become tedious.\nAfter level 50, the experience needed to advance increases rapidly per level. Reaching max level on a character is an every-day, 2 week investment at least.\n- Grim Dawn needs portforwarding for most people to do multiplayer.\nRight now, hosting a game in GD requires you to manually open port 27016 (UDP/TCP). Although this is easy for me, it may not be for those less technically inclined.\n- Grim Dawn ultimate difficulty is unforgiving.\nIt may remind some people of Diablo 3 Inferno mode, which is not for the casual player. I put this as a negative and positive on purpose, as this is a matter of taste.\n\nI hope you found this summary review helpful!

The Devs have so far avoided micromanaging the number of viable builds down to one per class like other ARPGS (looking at you D3). There's no always-online nonsense to deal with so you can actually play the single-player mode of the game you spent legal tender on without connecting to some corporations' server bank. There is no trade restrictions barring certain augments, which can be stripped beforehand to allow that item to be traded again.\n\nCombat isn't too flashy, which is good because the screen isn't filled with so much ♥♥♥♥ you can't see what the enemy is doing so you can avoid it. Skills can still be visually impressive but without the Michael Bay special effects barrage so common to latter-day ARPGs. It fits the artistic and narrative theme of the game while still letting your skills feel impactful but not so overwhelmingly powerful that you can't imagine why anyone would have died to the enemy in the first place. It just FEELS right.\n\nFurthermore, the story presented in Grim Dawn is actually quite compelling especially if you take the time to read through the dialogue and pick up all the scraps of paper left behind out in the world. There is genuine tension in the story as you piece together what happened to Cairn, and how you can help save it. Speaking of which, the world here feels connected and alive, without immersion-breaking nonsense like the copy/paste hero squads with yellow auras just in case you were too stupid to notice them or randomly-generated terrain that looks like someone emptied a jigsaw puzzle onto the table and scrambled the pieces up.\n\nThere is even a legit lore reason why you are the only person who can control the teleporters too.\n\n\n\nAll in all if you like ARPGs this game is worth every single cent of the asking price.","January 28","true","671.9"," 46 of 49 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","46","49","0","1"

So rather than dance around it, I'll just do it: Grim Dawn is better than most. I'll compare it to games you might have already played.\n\n* It's harder than Diablo III, and has more punishing monster abilities that require more attention.\n* It's less punishing tha Path of Exile, with more focus on attack skills that make the game fun (rather than defensive skills that make you run around).\n* Similar to Titan Quest, you pick two paths and combine them into a unique gameplay style. And, similar to Titan Quest, you can seriously gimp yourself by picking two fundamentally incompatible paths.\n* The world is static, with loads of side quests if you want to do them, like Sacred 2. Unlike Sacred 2, the world remains interesting and isn't as generically massive. Fewer enemies have cheap tricks to one-shot you.\n\nI don't have much to say that hasn't already been said... this is an excellent game.

He kept going on about a Mr. Grim. Said "I might throw his keyster in the jug, but I'd get mine when Mr. Grim came knockin' around." Well I gave him a good bit a chin music for throwin' around empty threats, and he clammed right up.\n\nBut something wasn't right, sure some snowed-out dopester's usually on about some crazy malarky any time I pick 'em up. This felt different, and it was making me sweat, so I decide to make a trip back over to the joint, see what he's on about. Just as I drain my glass and flick my butt in the ash tray, this leggy dame walks through the door like she's giving somebody a tour of the place. I ask her if she'd heard a knockin' but she puts out her hand and introduces herself, in that self-assured way of a girlie who comes from money. She says her name is Dawn, and she has a case for me.\n\nI say I ain't taking cases right now, my library's full-up and until I shut some of them up, I ain't handling any more. She ignores me again and starts chinning about this supposed case she's got.  I'm annoyed but I figure I'll tip another one down, so I pour myself another whiskey. I ain't much hearing her as it's the usual talking about her husband. I assume the cat's cheatin' on the broad or playing the Bruno with her, knocking her around, and she won't have it anymore. That's nine out of ten women who walk through my door anyhow. But it's the opposite. She's complainin' about she loves him so much and he just won't let her go. So I interrupt, saying "Doll, I don't hear a problem here, you're acting like pulling the Dutch act, why? 'Cause you love a 'fella too much?"\n\nBut she says she don't wanna love him so much, there ain't else she can think about and everyone who meets him is the same way. She wants me to pop him. I shake my head at her going all goofy on me. Just when you think you met the craziest broad in town, some nut goes and ups her.\n\nI'm about to go tell her to climb up her thumb when she slips in the cat's name, "Mr. Grim." I nearly flop off my wheels. "How's that," I reply. And she says it again, "Mr. Grim, surely you've heard of him, he's running the new game in town." Well, I tell her spit it out about the bird and she does. Telling me when you meet him you start out weak, but he builds you up in whatever way you want. You wanna learn to build things? He's got that. You wanna learn to shoot? Fight? Even give someone the old Harlem Sunset,  he'll show you that too. But you have to work for it, you've gotta complete jobs for him, but it's worth the reward, and when you wanna stop, he'll let you, but only because he knows you'll be back for more. He's running all the people in this town, and apparently I'm next.\n\nWell, that convinced me. I gotta find this trouble boy before he finds me. I nod to the broad, grab my coat and my heater and take it on the heel and toe. I knew this one would be different. This Grim Dawn case was going to consume me for god knows how long.\n\n11/10 Would hard-boil again.\n\nIf you liked this review, please check out my other steam reviews","March 6","true","25.7"," 110 of 153 people (72%) found this review helpful 71 people found this review funny","72","110","153","71","9"

With his little buddy Raven flying behind him, shooting electricity out of his eye balls, my Wicthblade is demolishing every foe he encounters, waves at a time. And just when I think this may be too easy, I hit a boss level monster that makes me start quaffing the few potions I have. I finally crush the boss monster's head like a grape with my two-handed "mace" and get the loot. All is right with the world.\n\nI have a few Early Access titles in my game list, but Grim Dawn is by far the most polished one I have played. Heck, I've played big production titles that don't work this well (I'm looking at you, "Rise of the Argonauts").\n\nAdd this to the fact that I played Diablo and liked it. Played D2 and liked it. Played Titan Quest and loved it, and add that I tend to enjoy apocalyptic game settings and that makes Grim Dawn something that will not be uninstalled for a very long time.\n\nFor an ARPG, the writting is superb. The letters and dialoge are on par with what you would expect from a classic western RPG.\n\nI cannot reccomend this title enough, and although I am nowhere near being done playing this game I have to wonder with a benchmark being set this high: what will Crate do next?\n\nI am excited for the future.","February 28, 2015","true","18.5"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","45","51","4","0"

Arguably one of the greatest ARPG's ever. The graphics were super cool, the story was interesting and at times intense, the action itself was seamless, the upgrade system was super deep and yet accessible. You could play this game countless different ways and have a great time. I put right around 40 hours into the campaign playing solo before finishing it, and after I was done, there was still another area at the top of the map to unlock, and probably 3 or 4 that I missed besides that. There is also an area called The steps of Torment which will challenge any hardened players, and that area features roguelike qualities. This game carries a lot of obvious influences as well, from Diablo 2 to Torchlight to even Dark Souls, and wears them well, while still managing to create it's own distinct personality.\n\nI'm thinking that I can still easily put in another 15 or so hours solo before I'm just grinding loot or decide to change difficulties. The game also leaves definite room for a sequel and/or expansion, and really, this is a game world that could persist for a long time. There were things said via notes in the game that absolutely open up other potential story arcs. The Aetherial Betrayer, Ulgrim, and quite a few others.\n\nSo, some cool features of the game: you can dual class, and it changes your actual class if you do so. For example, I played an Occultist/Arcanist, which made me a Warlock. The upgrade system for the actual classes is broad enough to give you a lot of variety, but condensed enough that you wont feel overwhelmed. However, there is a second upgrade system that you get points for simply by cleansing shrines, and that my friends is as expansive an upgrade system as I have seen in a game. You could spend a while reading through all of them, and then you still have to decide what will best suit your play style. They are set up as constellations, and there are a lot of them! It can seem daunting, but actually, I dont think there are really any wrong choices, although some will obviously suit your preferred playstyle better than others, and a lot of them only unlock after unlocking constellations closer to the center, where you basically choose your upgrade arc. That was quite impressive and again, lends itself to a lot of experimentation. There is a respec NPC in the game, but I never actually made use of it, so I cant say how that works.\n\nAlso, some merchants will only sell you stuff after you have gotten your town or faction disposition maxed out, and they of course have the best items, lol. You can sell to them, but I personally didnt max out any factions yet, so I havent been able to purchase those super cool items. You can also craft items via another type of NPC, and that system is also pretty deep. You can craft all the basic stuff, but you have to find blueprints to craft anything truly spectacular. Items also have one slot for gem/material upgrades, and the gems/materials can be made stronger by fusing as many as 4 of the same type together. This will often unlock a special ability like casting fireballs or gaining Aetherial defense, slams, and so on.\n\nThere is actually a ton more to this game, but I think I will leave off for now and maybe revise this once I finish the map, play through higher difficulties, and/or play through this in co-op mode.\n\nI cant really find much in the way of flaws in this game, so I'm maxing out this skill tree with a 10 out of 10.\n","March 5","true","45.7"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","43","48","0","0"

This review is based on a playthrough of one character to level 25ish, partly played alone and partly played with a friend.\n\nThings to Expect:    Action Role-Playing Games tend to lack role-play options that actually relate to game-play. Such situations do occur in this game, and can decidedly change your experience or even what equipment you can gain.\nProgression trees that do not exactly guide you in their use, but most of the level up choices you make can be undone to repair mistakes or to optimize.\nCrafters are decidedly useful, as they will always create at-level gear you can use for the same amount of materials (so far.)\nGritty world, gritty characters, and a dark atmosphere. It is not exactly bland, but it's not exactly pretty.\nYou can only duel-wield pistols if equipped with a specifc item.\nDamage can be sudden and it is hard to determine where it comes from or what causes it due to all the graphics and effects.\nOpinions:Kill, loot, rinse, repeat. You're a dude or lady that was nearly hung for being possessed, but was spared because of context. And now a gathering of NPCs look at you with hope/despair in wondering if you can save them from the end of the world. Which already happened, but they hope you won't make it worse. Given I've not personally completed the story, I cannot give a nay or yay regarding it.\n\nI can state that it does set the post-apocolypse in semi-fantasy land well. Everyone looks unclean and filthy, and your equipment is no exception. None of your equipment shines or glows, or looks elegant. It is rough or practical looking, and portays the scavenger look as you are picking up fantasy pieces in fantasy land. Most of the land is in ruins, garbage strewn about is a constant land image.\n\nThe music is there, and serves its purpose but is lost under combat noise. I've not heard a track I would listen to outside of the game, but I've not had a reason to turn the music off.\n\nPlaying as the Soldier class, 1 of 5 classes available currently (six planned), I have not felt the need to dual class. Though I played on Veteran difficulty, and was underleveled for the first boss, I managed to defeat them by myself with the skills I invested in and resources I earned/purchased. Healing potions did not ensure my victory, and I definately needed them. From my perspective, devoting time to gaining levels to match the boss or finding more appropriate equipment to defend myself would have made the battle easier. But ultimately, like all ARPGs of this sort, it comes down to loot/equipment.\n\nLoot in the game is not generous, but it is not lack luster. While my luck may just be poor, and I keep finding high qualities items that would better suit other classes, the pieces that I do find I have yet to replace. Add onto the componant items that can be collected and combined to impart even greater bonuses, which can be placed onto equipment to ensure their longevity, means there are always options to improve gear.\n\nIn multiplayer, loot can be set to personal or shared. With personal loot, all loot seen by you is yours.\n\nThere are tools within the game to help you determine what gear you need, though I personally find it hard to track incoming damage. It is hard to determine what enemies will attack what sort of defence immediately, and for me it was always trial by fire. And gear is not immediately available to immediately counter enemy attacks, it all has to be earned with time.\n\nBut that's the point of these kinds of games: repeatedly charge into dungeons to find better and better gear, for multiple situtaions. And, to the games great credit, their NPC crafters are not simple gamble-based machines. Despite the random statisics on the items, they will always make gear that is at least at your character's level.\n\nOne major complaint I have to make is the text box for NPC interaction is small, and that makes reading hard to do.\n\nConclusion:\nI have not seen all of the game yet, but what I've played I have enjoyed. It is a game that asks the player to micromanage their gear to fit their needs, but allows them headstrong acts of determination to push through challenges at the cost of resources. Character customization benefits from augment gear, to dual classing for combining skill sets, to a mostly passive bonus system gained from exploring and slaying monsters.\n\nThe game's look works. It does not strain the eyes, and sets the mood it intended to set. While more color would be appreciated, what I have seen I've not been distracted (beyond all the literal garbage. Loads of trash in places! Fantasy kingdom lacks littering laws.)\n\nThe story is there, and while not bad it can be overlooked. This may be a dangerous thing, however, as a choice made in the first portion of the game drastically changes the loot available to you. And the game does not give you the luxury of making that choice's importance to you apparant. Squint your eyes to read that text, because it may make your adventure all the easier.\n\nThis is a solid enty into the ARPG library. Not too easy, not unforgiving, but demands you pay attention.","December 3, 2015","true","22.8"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","39","43","0","0"

The game provides fast and smooth gameplay with intriguing lore to uncover. The game looks dark and grim which I found very appealing compared to the cartoony look other games may have. There’s enough diversity in the different area’s to explore. Some areas are looking absolutely gorgeous. Most of the game is hand-crafted  with some randomization. There a plenty of different enemies to fight against providing enough verity and challenge. Sometimes you have to prioritize to kill a certain enemy otherwise things may get really tough. What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG), which means that an enemy could have an epic weapon or armor equipped that you can see him wearing. So kill him and he will drop that item, however if he might be tougher to fight against as the item can grant them more power than usual.\nYou can play this game single-player or multi-player with a party up to a max of 4 people.\n\nThere are currently 6 classes which are called masteries in the game. They each have their own unique skills. When you reach level 2 you can choose a mastery to start with and at level 10 you can choose a 2nd mastery if you want. This way it provides enough build diversity for your taste. Melee or ranged and a mix of both it’s all up to you to choose. You can use 1 handed weapons and shields, 2 handed weapons, dual wield, pistols, scepters, focus and pets (summons). So you are not bound to a few skills you can choose from. Items like armor, components , relics, etcetera could also grant extra skills to use. And let’s not forget about Devotion, thought out the game you can find Devotion Shrines to restore, which grants you loot and a Devotion point on which you can invest in the Devotion Window providing more stats and skills to customize your build. You can use any item you want just as long as you meet the required stats for it. You can reassign skill- and devotion points but not mastery- and attribute points.\n\nThere’s plenty of loot in this game which can be obtained from enemies, chest, bought at a vendor or you can craft items. Blueprints can be found to craft different items at the blacksmith.\n\nI like the faction system on where you have hostile factions with increased negative reputation against them, brings increased enemy spawn additional monster spawns, increased Hero spawns and, upon reaching Nemesis status, Nemesis spawns. With friendly factions, increased reputation unlocks access to the bounty table. There you can do small quest for a gaining faster reputation with that faction and that unlocks more items at the faction vendor.\n\nI love it  that certain quest can change the appearance a little bit of a refugee area. Bringing more survivors there and a cosmetic change. There are also quests that brings choice and consequence to your decisions. So the outcome for that quest could influence a small area.\n\nThe lore is great for those who are interested in that like me. You can find notes in the game that provide more information about certain events. But also by talking to npc’s and reading the description in the devotion windows.\n\nThere’s no magic arrow that points you into the right direction for a quest, only when your nearby you will see a star on the mini map that your close. Personally i think this is a big plus, i love to explore and find the area myself it’s way more immersive.\n\nThere are enough options in the game to change the camera angle zoom in and out. You can set the loot filter to only show magic items, so that your screen isn’t cluttered with loot.\n\nSecret areas who doesn’t like them, i always have the urge to explore everything. Some secret areas are small others are larger. You can find them by breaking a wall or perhaps a hidden path to reach it. Explore and you shall be rewarded because there are plenty of secret areas to uncover.\n\nSmall things that matter like kicking in doors or at barrels, destructible objects like furniture walls that collapse. Weather changing effect that make the area darker with a bit or rain or just a sunny day. Enemies of different factions fighting each other.\n\nChallenge dungeons  that provide a real challenge, where if you die you have to restart the game to start a new session. That means you have to redo the dungeon to get to the end. I play softcore so i won’t lose my character but still have the excitement of trying to survive and not to get killed.\n\n\nModding tools are released, so expect the community to create their own content, items, classes and even entire worlds.\n\nThe developers are very passionate about the making the game, since the Kickstarter the game has grown bigger and better with more features than they originally planned. There is even a free content update coming out soon!\n\nSome very useful links besides YouTube and Twitch:\n\nTo find out more about the game i highly suggest to the a look at the official game guide at: http://www.grimdawn.com/game.php\nWant to take a look at the masteries and the skills and plan your build than take a look here: http://grimcalc.com/.\nWant to know more about the items than you certainly want to take a look here: http://gracefuldusk.appspot.com/","May 5","true","740.7"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","35","37","0","3"

I played it only about 40 hours in EA because I don´t wanted to spoiler myself.\nAfter release I will change my home to a vault with plenty food and I will play this game til the Dawn of the Apes.\n\nShort: Best H&S game\n\nPros\nHuge world to explore\nGreat Soundtrack\nDual Class System\nItemization\nQuests with choices and little consequenes like Dragon Age\nNice challenges like roquelike dungeon\n\nCons\nMultiplayer still needs some polish.\n\nI am a guy who loves hack&slay games. I played nearly every H&S Game the last decade and my biggest disappointment was Diablo 3. It is not a bad game but it was not the sequel I was hopping for. The biggest issue D3 has is its degree of difficulty. D3 is less about skills. It´s about the equipment you carry. Then there is the repetition of all the dialoges in the game which makes me feel like I am in a limbo. Last but not least: D3 is not very complex. You walk a straight path-there is nothing to explore, you have some skills you are using depending on your equipment and thats it!\nYes I know. Many H&S games are like that but I wanted more.\n\nLets talk about Grim Dawn.\nIt´s somekind of a sequel of Titan Quest (TQ). Back in the days TQ was having the best combat feeling beside Diablo 2. You were able to play a multiclass character which made the game very interesting for people who loves customization.\n\nGrim Dawn took all the good stuff from Titan Quest and enhanced it to a new level.\nGD is one of the few gems who deserve the titel ARPG.\nYou have a huge world to explore. There are secret passages, hidden chests with epic items, pathes you have to unlock, breakable walls, shrines which gives you permanent buffs..\nThere are quests where you have to take a choice. Later in the game you will see the consequences of your choice.\nThere are many factions you can join. Its like in World of Warcraft. Each faction give you different benefits and quests.\n\nThe combat is really awesome. It´s not as fast like Torchlight 2 but at least its nearly as good as Diablo 3.\nThere are some interesting skills for multiplayer and because of the multiclass system there are a lot of skillsets you can try out. In one point GD surpasses the other games: You really have to use the environment to survive. You can take cover behind walls against enemy archers or you can use narrow ways to avoid to get flanked or surrounded by enemies. Some enemies are shooting in an arc or from the sky so you should take cover under a fabric.\n\nLets talk about the music. It is one of the best fantasy soundtracks I have ever listened beside Age of Conan.\nIt fits perfect to the game world, never gets disturbing and feels really unique.\nI would buy the soundtrack.\n\nPlease guys, buy this game if you love hack&slay. I followed this game since it was announced. The Devs are really great guys. They are really active in the forums and they put so much content in this game. I can´t believe that a small dev team could create such a good game. They didn´t have a million budget like blizzard but they delivered something awesome.\nThis game is like Diablo 3 should have been. It´s like Dave vs Goliath.\n\nBUY THIS GAME AND SUPPORT IT!","February 24","true","65.2"," 46 of 55 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","46","55","3","0"

I feel like I own it to Crate to write one, so here it goes. I'll cover 5 topics: World, Story, Gameplay, Graphics and Sound.\n\nWorld: I thank Crate for not making world randomized. The map is hand drawn, same every time, but the boulders and obstacles block certain paths, so you'll never go the same way twice. The pros of that approach tie with the story.\n\nStory: The story itself is okay, much better than other ARPGs though (looking at you, Torchlight 2 :D). The best part about it is the lore behind the world. Random notes make world alive and some of it are really beautifly written, like mini novels all around you.\n\nGameplay: The skills feel responsive and overall, combat is very satisfying. The punches are hard and spell effects make combat seem very fast paced. There are occasional glitches and fps drops, but this is an indie studio and an early access game, so I believe it will be resolved (I'm playing on a 8 year old toaster by the way, and i get 25+ on low/med settings, which is awesome). Skilltrees and devotion system make each individual character different. Components and relics are an awesome way for customizing your character further.\n\nGraphics: Crate didn't go for beautiful graphics and eye candy. Instead, what you get, is dark and grim world. The look of the game is awesome, Areas are distinct and every single one feels like it's the part of the world, not some random desert here and lush green woods 10 minutes further. Graphics are here for the atmosphere, not the beauty.\n\nSound: Abilities sound great, even though the autoattacks could use some love. The soundtrack is awesome though, resembeling the Diablo one (overly reverbed instruments).\n\nOverall: This game is awesome. Buy it now. Support the developers and the game, you won't regret it. This is by far the best ARPG I've ever played.\n\n","February 16","true","655.9"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","35","38","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dnm81/recommended/219990/","dnm81","dnm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dnm81/","98 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nStay awhile and listenAfter the Grim Dawn, the world is in turmoil and everyone is trying to get by with what they can. There are death and despair everywhere. The world is big, based on a single map, and the game is semi linear. That make up for a great game experience! For the naysayers, I only have this to say to you[www.instagram.com]. ;)\n\n\nSpeaking for the game\nGraphics and design:\nGrimy, grim and rough. When it comes to graphics Grim dawn is spot on. The game is dark, and include the same type of gore and feel of doom that was present in Diablo 1. You can toggle the view of your camera, the game is in full 3D and plays smooth (not laggy/jerkily as it seems to be in the promotion video clip).\n\nThe game stays simple yet effectful regarding to spells, skills and weaponry. There are colours, but not overdone and the gear are “simple” in design fitting within the context of the world. Even though the skills gets more expressive and effectful the more you level, it will never, as far as I know, become like the Diablo 3 roaming discotheques of coloured lightshows and smoke grenades I am used to. And I am greatly thankful for that.\n\nDuring Chistmas I only had my laptop to play on, and even though my laptop has a really poor graphic card the game runs smooth (but can barely handle Diablo 3 and absolutely not games like Cities Skylines). It feels great to play a new and good looking game that is not forcing you to buy a new computer.\n\nSound effects and music:\nThe sound effects are really neat. My first character was a Pyromancer focusing around a gun build, and the swooping falcons have a nices punch to them, likewise the sound of the gun when firing. It is almost like you “feel it”.\n\nThe music enhances the graphic expression of the death and misery that surrounds everything.\n\nAttributes, skills and leveling:\nThe leveling of the character is in all ARPG:s, but apart from for example Diablo 3, Grim Dawn allows you to put out points after each level in core attributes like “Physique”, “Cunning” and “Spirit” affecting everything from health and energy to damages output and chances to hit and get hit.\n\nEach level you are awarded skill points to build your character in your chosen mastery/masteries. There are six masteries and if dual classing there are additional 15 different classes, each with a number of great synergy builds to create.\n\nI think the leveling experience is good. As used to Diablo 3's minor variations, I think the different build possibilities are enormous, which do greatly enhancing the leveling experience.\n\nMechanics:\nAs fare as mechanics goes, it seems to be totally transparent. I do not have that much to say on this matter. Yet again referring to Diablo 3, I think this fact is a nice change of pace.\n\nInventory/backpack and stash/bank:\nThe system for inventory and stash are as such: Inventory on the character are bigger then Diablo 3 and do I even need to mention Path of Exiles totally lack of inventory space? The inventory is expandable through quest rewards. As far as I have progressed, you have one personal tab in the stash/bank and four shared with your other characters. But as in all of these type of games inventory and stash space, even a great amount of space, is not enough. ;)\n\nBugs:\nI have not noticed any major bugs.\n\nMiscellaneous:\nExploration: As I let on in the beginning, Grim Dawn are composed of one whole “overworld”, a continuous map that, for the most parts, are open and not depending on the game progression (there is no fixed acts like in Diablo 3 or Path of Exile, where A leads to B and B to C). This makes exploration one extra dimension of the game and the environments are nice; varies a lot with high level of detail. There are randomly spawn dungeons that does not show on the map, as far as it seems. This makes it harder to find them, but you do not need to enter them to progress through the game. It just gives a nice flair to the game. There are also lots of hidden areas that will not show on neither the mini map nor the big map. The dungeons has that great feel of dungeon crawl around, with some of them in a roguelike-ish style. In some extent it feels like Diablo 1 but with much better graphics.\n\nQuesting: As for questing, there is no holding hand style of gameplay. So do not expect a World of Warcraft path finding system for quest completion. This is more old school. You have to rely on your reading skills. Thus far I have never experienced any problem with completing any quests, and I find it nice for a change that the game is not playing for me. The “hardest” get around finding are the faction bounties. Even though I have taken to account the increasingly laziness of players, I do not think those are demanding in neither reading nor thinking skills.\n\nFactions: The game as a faction system that reminds of the systems in MMO:s. There are different steps rewarding you with discounts at vendors and access to quartermasters. You gain negative reputation with your enemies resulting in increasing monster spawn, hero spawn and spawn of nemesis at the most negative stance.\n\nCrafting: The game has a meaningful intriguing crafting system. During the game you can buy and find blueprints to learn new craftable items. At your Blacksmith you will be able to craft weapons, accessories, armor, components (things you can use in further crafting or to “enchant" gear you have), consumables and relics.\n\nStory: The game has a nice story and as you progress you can make choices through dialogue with NPC:s that affects the game in different ways. I have made some good ones, and some bad ones. One learn as long as one live.\n\nDifficulties: There are three difficulties: Normal, Elite and Ultimate. The first unlocks the second after play through. For experience players I would recommend to play normal mode with “veteran” checked. Normal (veteran mode) will provide a greater challenge; stronger and tougher monsters in increased number of spawns.\n\nSpeaking against the game     No random generated maps, as far as I know. With that said I want to point out that so far it has not been something I thought about. If we are to be fair, the random generated maps in Diablo 3 and Path of Exile “are not much to hang on the Christmas tree” (Swedish idiom for “that's not much to boast about”). However I would like the game to have random generated elements in endgame, maybe in player open “rifts” or something like that (maybe it already exists… I have not made it to endgame yet).\n\nNo voice acting when giving a storyline, quest or lore. This I think is really negative. There are so much lore that it would be great listening to it instead of reading. I hope the rumor is true, that they are planning to voice the lore, but I do not know if that is the case.\n\nEven though I like the storyline and lore of the game, it can be corny to some small parts. As I do not want to spoil the story for someone I will not go into it.\n\nIt is not a major problem, but worth mentioning: sometime the pathfinding could be better. I think it would do well from some polish, but otherwise I have no complaint regarding that.\n\nI have played around 10 hours in multiplayer mode. The experience has been really good, but a couple of times we have gotten off sync for some minutes. I do not think this is a big problem, but when it happens it is a source of great irritation.\n\nConclusion I give Grim Dawn a clear thumb up. The game is an impressive achievement, and has huge potential for further expansion. When I look at the map, it seems like that game developers has prepared for an almost doubles sized map. I hope that is the case! :)","January 10","true","210.3"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","38","43","3","4"

The music and ambient sounds are very good in the game.\n+So far the areas seem very nicely made.

I am playing veteran and it really feels like veteran difficulty.\n+loot system is what it is supposed to be.The harder the difficulty the more loot, simple. So far I've been getting very good items which help me against harder enemies.\n+voice actors. I think this is personal taste, but in my opinion the voices fit for the NPCs.\n+crafting system. So far I've haven't tried it that much, but in higher levels my guess you will need it more.\n+You can remove one point from skill tree for a price which is good. You can try out other builds without starting new character.\n\nSo far no cons come in my mind, but I am going to definitely recommend this game for all ARPG lovers.

I am happy to say that - after being patient - this game is to me everything Early Access was called into life for.\n\nIf you are an avid ARPG fan like myself, I find it hard to make a case against buying Grim Dawn, even though it is technically unfinished. The content available presently is quite fleshed out, considering how much more there is to come. I find myself collecting an insurmountable amount of items, just so I can prepare for the next character build I have in mind.  That is not to say the game makes you play alts in order to get the most out of it, rather it is a testament to how the build diversity makes you want to experiment and gets you excited to try other things. You are free to make a 'pure' build, using ony one class, or supplement it with one or more skills/passives of another class. Alter your skills' damage type to make it mesh better with your ideal build, or change the way it works entirely, making your big AoE skill a continuous basic attack. The Grim Dawn world is your oyster.\n\nWhile Grim Dawn has its flaws, like any other ARPG, it absolutely nails that which it strives to be. It's grim, very much so. Many of the choices you get to make during quests have a sense of moral ambiguity. Some more or less than others, but a refreshing breeze in the genre, which often relies on simple "Kill X mob or boss" quests as you trot down the storyline. Not in Grim Dawn. Well, at least not in its entirety. Many of these quests certainy fall into the well-known standard we all experienced. Others have you decide on lives and allow you to shape the game to an extent. You can end up with more or less people in the game as you decide on whether or not to save them. You may or may not get access to a certain item if you decide to choose a particular path. It certainly allows for you to experience a slightly altered world next time around, adding to the replayability.\n\nBut what does all of this mean in the larger scope? We all look towards ARPG's for the same thing, I would think. Killing stuff, lots of it, in order to get stuff to kill more stuff faster and/or more efficiently. Grim Dawn certainly provides plenty of both. There are lots of armor sets to collect, some of which allow you to completely change your playstyle, sometimes in a way that seems counter-intuitive at first. It's in these details that the game shows its true self. The small mechanics that could change the way you think about some of the skills in the game, which you will likely only discover a good while into the game. Are you not concerned with these mechanics? That's ok, the game lends itself perfectly to those who simply want to barge through the game wreaking havoc. It's all up to you.\n\nFor those of you who are on the fence about the game, in regards to its similarities with Titan Quest, I can only say this: Grim Dawn is no less than a worthy spiritual successor to Titan Quest. It adds plenty, from a new narrative, new classes and areas, to new mechanics and playstyles. All in keeping with its roots, and building on that solid foundation that many of us look back on so fondly. This is not the same game, but it 'was' built with the same eye for detail and the same type of devotion to the genre we know from Titan Quest. It was made by people who love the game, for people who love the game. If you ask me, that's how you get a good game. Which leads to my verdict as the game stands at the time of writing this review:\n\nA solid 8.5/10 Highly recommended for fans, certainly worthwhile still for those with a passing interest.\n\nIf they keep up the hard work, and after implementing the announced features and planned content, I might bump it up to a solid 9/10.\n\n\n\n\nBUILD 28 UPDATE\n\nWe are now a good chunk further in development since my initial review. I let the game 'ripen' a bit and have not played much since build 24, giving me a wealth of new content to play around with.\n\nI have to say, I was not prepared for what I'd find. Including the Factions (with the Bounty and Nemesis systems), Devotion System and new class on top of the remainder of Act 3 and first part of Act 4 and the additional 20 levels there is so much to do. The ability to diversify to this extent will make this game last as long as you want it to.\nThe prospect of almost unlimited replayability is exactly what I had hoped when I put down my money for an Early Access game.\n\nWith Build 28 also came a much needed boost in performance, and some polish in the graphics department, giving me a buttery smooth 60 FPS across the board.\n\nHaving seen this game grow from its infancy, where Act I was the entire game, to what it is now has been an experience that has made me truly appreciate the developers. I thank you, and all the other people who supported this game. Early Access is always a leap of faith on behalf of the consumer, with a trackrecord that is not without its blemishes. For a developer to follow through on their promises to this extent has been a breath of fresh air and spark of hope that this business model can produce wonderful products.\n\nI was reserving judgment for my initial review score, as the game had so much to grow yet. We are nearing the full release at this point, and I have only become more hopeful for the end product, as it truly feels like a full game already.\n\nIt's easily a 9/10 for me at this point and a huge recommendation for anyone who wants to enjoy a new ARPG.\n\nThere is no better time to show your support for a developer who has earned my complete trust and support. I highly doubt you'd regret it.","March 27, 2015","true","330.7"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","36","41","0","0"

Enough to where I can start to form an opinion on it. First off, let me precede this with a disclaimer. The game is currently in Early Access so parts may change once it hits the final build.\n\nThis game does have a dark atmosphere similar to Diablo series of old. I've played around with several different builds to date and they all offer something different. However, the true magic happens once you can combine 2 professions to make your own hybrid class(think Titan Quest and you'll completely understand what I'm talking about). If you enjoy that idea and don't mind some occasional weirdness occuring during gameplay, then this game belongs in your library.\n\nHere is where I explain the weirdness I spoke of earlier. Controls can be a little wonky(there have been times that I've selected the enemy that I wanted to attack and my character simply ran over to stand next to them). You will occasionally come across an area that you should be able to reach but an invisible wall will prevent you(to date, I have only seen this a small handful of times and is nothing too major). Also, there is some popup issues where I had to be actively running to have an object appear in front of me.\n\nIf the Early Access thing worries you, then I would state that they appear to give regular updates on the game. I'm unsure if they are planning a final pass once they finish the primary development of the title but since they are apparently trying to create themselves and have shown an openess to the community, I cannot see that they will leave issues remaining in the game.\n\nI currently cannot comment on the co-op as I have not yet experienced it other than saying that the game does offer LAN and Online modes.\n\nIf you enjoy ARPG's of old and want to experience something both new and old at the same time, I would recommend this. If you are looking for a graphical masterpiece, then hold off. For myself, I fully intend on grabbing a few copies for friends once it is finished so we can all have a grand old time loot grinding.","December 31, 2014","true","44.4"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","37","43","0","1"

That mean they know what they do, they are one of best team ever to create this kind of game.\n\n\nThis is addictive hack'n'slash with RPG based on 6 classes, full of skills in use in dual-class system like TQIT was.\n\n- Dual class system ; choose your gameplay style melee, ranged/magic/summoner based on 6 classes with tons of skills to unlock. You must balance your character between overpowering & protections. Classes are more experienced than TQIT\n\n- Generous loot system better than mostly others game on same kind. Rare/epic/legendary items, based on classes, with   20,000+ possible magical affix combinations and over 200 rare affixes.\n\n- Innovative quest system : you can choose your destiny which affect world. Choose which factions to help and those to fight. Make peace, make hell or stay neutral : but face consequences of your acts. Your goal is to rebuild world from human extention\n\n- Factions system : help factions what you want and be awarded with discount from merchants, exclusive items to unlock. When you help a faction, you automatically fight against others which are ennemy. Entire world is based on factions, except beasts. If you fight too much against a faction, this faction will give you more challenge in fight in future, sending to you better mobs & bosses to kill you.\n\n- Multiplayer : 4 players can coop or pvp.\n\n- 4 difficulties mode : normal, veteran, elite and ultimate, can be conbinated to hardcore game.\n\n- Great gameplay : fast-paced combat with many visual effects, freeze/stun/knockdown, furnitures to demolish\n\n- optional rotatable camera : always fight from the most optimal angle\n\n- Intelligent mix between open-ended world and corridor, with outside & underground maps, 20+ secrets passages, exclusive quest map (depending on your choices based on quests)\n\n- Bestiary : 200+ enemy heroes and bosses, hand-configured with their own unique arrays of deadly skills.\n\n- Additional rogue-like dungeons :  special challenge dungeons (require rare crafted key) where enemy levels increase as you progress and player can't teleport. Win or die.\n\n- Dynamic weather : - The world is brought to life with region-specific climates and a variety of weather effects. A sunny day can cloud over with mild rain showers that builds into a booming thunderstorm. Variable wind gusts blow grass and affect objects like windmills.\n\n- Crafting system  : with 250 recipes to learn (weapons/armors/jewels/potions), combining/salvaging components, augments\n\n- Respec system : cancel your skills allocation points to create new build based on same mastery.\n\n\nThis is one best game ever. You can buy it, closed eyes, even in beta or at full price. You'll don't regret it.","October 15, 2015","true","342.9"," 43 of 53 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","43","53","5","0"

On first playthrough, there are scenarios that are placed that will try to deceive you and force you to use your better judgement. Using your judgement incorrectly can force you to kill otherwise 'mostly' innocent NPCs (Julius & Helen in Arkovia for example). Things are not always what they seem with the setups.\n\nThe class system is brilliant for an ARPG, two characters playing the same class-combo can end up entirely different depending on playstyle. It's a fairly new take on things that ARPGs have been building on for decades now; For example, two Blademasters (Soldier+Nightblade) can end up with one being a two-handed using tanky warrior type, while the other ends up more like a dual-wielding assassin with an arsenal of area effect abilities at their hand. All the skills are fairly decent and there isn't a wrong way to build your class --and if you feel you have built it 'wrong', you get a second chance with skill resets whenever you want.\n\nThe game is also very fluid. Other than the given glitches that will most likely be fixed in full release, I have no complaints about this game.","June 18, 2015","true","25.5"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","35","41","2","0"

Look up Monster Infrequent (MI) for more info.\nExtensive crafting and personal economy that can be traded with friends or the community.\nLots of storage space but you will need it when collecting your components and crafting with them + storing your great finds.\nYou will be challenged as much as you want wile farming with a modest level scaling feature.\nThe first 2.5 acts are out. 3 acts are confirmed there have been rumors of a small 4th act.\n\nYou can level to 40* with its 116** skill points available to spend once you figure out your build idea get ready for some choices as your allocating 3 skill points a level you can respec your skills but not your mastery level so choose wisely between stat and mastery rushing or leveling your primary attack skill, aoe skill, defenses, auras, debuffs, cc and more. I would recommend with your 116 skill points aim for having at least 1/2 of them in your mastery and you will want to focus mastery > skill ups to a degree for the first 15~ levels. Ideally you will want to have a good lead in your mastery level, it should be 10+ points past your current level and you should feel safe and have the stats you need to scale your damage and HP.\n\n* 40 is the current level cap, I have no official news on the final number but they say it should be close to 50 - 75 at last estimate but I assume closer to the 75 side.\n** 116 skill points is 3 a level (for now I could see it drop to less at closer to the 70+ mark. 1 bonus skill point for the current game we may get more skill points before we progress to the second difficulty.

You don't own a computer.\n\n2.  You don't like ARPG's.\n\nThat's about it.  Everything about the game is solidly well done.  The skill trees feel like fun, meaningful upgrades.  The combat animations are rewarding, and I mean that turning something was once a large fanged monster into a pink mist with your big hammer feels like you'd want it to.  It's well polished.  Abilities do what they say they'll do.  Bugs probably exist, but I haven't experienced them.\n\nI played it for about 40 hours so months ago and felt like I got my money's worth, got bored and put it down.  What made me start playing it again?  Well, I re-installed Diablo 3 the other day, and it made me miss Grim Dawn.  Diablo 3 feels like a Zynga game compared to this.\n\nI suppose the question you're really asking is "But how does it stack up against Path of Exile?"  And that's a reasonable question.  In terms of quality, I don't see where one is better than the other.  The meaningful difference is simply that while Path of Exile aims for a sandbox-y feeling emphasizing customization by randomizing absolutely everything, Grim Dawn takes a much more traditional, structured, approach.  I couldn't really say one is better, but I prefer Grim Dawn.\n\nProbably the only criticism I have the game doesn't really innovate at all.  You've a few classes with skill trees, you can dual class and use 2 skill trees, and there are shrines you can find that give you points to put in a secondary skill tree system.  There's loot with stats.  Better stats let you hit things harder and kill tougher things to get better loot to kill tougher things.  It's arguable how much that matters.  I want something more innovative, but I recognize that most attempts to re-invent the wheel end up wrecking it, so I can't really blame developers for just creating a really good standard wheel.\n\nSo, the bottom line is:  I bought it, played it, and enjoyed it.  If you like ARPG's, you'll get your money's worth out of it.","February 26","true","48.0"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","28","30","9","0"

It starts off by just throwing you in blind and doesn't tell you much other than you were possessed, but as you explore the world you find journal entries that give you insight into what happened.\n\nMuch like Diablo 2, Grim Dawn has a dark world where horrible things have happened. You awake in the apocalypse, the world is ending and only a tiny sliver of humanity remains to fight back. The world is filled with gruesome tales and your decisions(that's right, you actually get to make quite a few as you progress) can frequently have nasty unintended consequences.\n\nIn other words, the setting is wonderful.\n\nThe second thing this game does right is have a good skill system with satisfying special abilities. Too many Diablo clones fail because their progression system just feels dull, here you are always eager to level up because it gives you new or more deadly abilities.\n\nThe combat has a lot of weight to it, and when you smash an enemy with a crit or a special attack it feels super satisfying as their corpse flies away from you with an explosive thwack!\n\nLength: no idea, not even done on my first play through, wayyy over 30 hours worth of content though. At 25 bucks this is a steal.\n\nLoot system is basically Diablo 2's, maybe not quite as good as D2's but that may be the nostalgia talking. There is a ton of loot to find, and it encourages you to try other classes and builds as you find epic loot for those classes.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic game. And if you've been waiting years for something to scratch that Diablo 2 itch like I have, then this is definitely a game you need to try.","March 16","true","29.5"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","31","35","3","0"

However, within the engine they have managed to change the game enough to make it distinct from a Titans Quest mod. Think similarly to Unreal Engine. It may not be as flexible, but god damn if Crate can't bend it anyway.\n\nThe game heavily favors exploration, with secret quests, bosses and chests hidden around the world. Its fun to find new stuff, and even more entertaining to blow a friends mind by showing them where a level 30 boss is in a level 18 zone. Yes, he will destroy you if you aren't very prepared.\n\nThere is very little hand holding inherant in the game, however the community more than makes up for it. Due to a previously successful kickstarter, there is a large community who have been helping guide newbies, and also to just have fun together. I would highly recommend joining the forums, and atleast reading the developer journals 'Grim Misadventures' as they provide sneak peaks at upcoming content.\n\nYes, this game is incomplete currently, however, what they have released so far is well worth the price in my opinion. Torchlight 2 was a similar price, and may currently have Grim Dawn on play length (I think it would actually be close however) but only up to Act 3 Chapter 1 is currently playable.\n\nThe build system will be similar to anyone who knows something about Titans Quest, with the combination of two different skill trees, i.e. Demolitionist+Nightblade=Saboteur.\n\nSimply put, if you enjoyed older ARPG's, filled with secrets and crazy builds, then you will most likely enjoy this.

It's obvious to see how the developers are in this to make a great game they're proud to put their name on, and they rightfully have a lot of loyal fans who have been with them since the Alpha or some point in the Beta. I started playing in late Alpha, and the game was rather good even in that early state and they only continue to vastly improve it. It's really great to see developers not try to get away with the minimum amount to make X sales but pay great attention to detail and continue to go above and beyond of what would be an 'acceptable release'. I can't wait until this game is finished, if you enjoy ARPGs at all this is a MUST buy.\n\nYou pick a class at level 1, and once you reach level 10 you have the option to pick a second class, although you can do it at any level after 10 as well if you're not sure what to pick. This allows you to have some really great hybrid builds with huge replayability potential. There are currently 5 classes, so the combinations you can make are quite large, and they plan to add at least 1 more class in every expansion.\n\nGrim Dawn has a great mix of C'thonian elements, undead and other demensional demonic enemies. The environment is beautifully crafted and the plot/quests are well thought out, the additional info diaries you can find are fun to collect and read, although not a nonsense mundane task like some games make finding such things to be.\n\nGrim Dawn has a good difficulty level and can further be increased by choosing a Veteran mode, and later when the game is released more difficulties will be released.\n\n10/10","November 29, 2014","true","80.5"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","32","37","0","0"

While your character gets better when you level up and spend points on your stats and skills, you can be godlike when you have godlike gear.\n\nThe game has 6 "pure" classes with its own skill tree. You can dual-class which gives a total of 21 possible classes (15 dual classes and 6 pure classes). The skill system is very in-depth but still easy to understand and the possibilities of different builds are very enormous. The max level is 85, after finishing the game at normal difficulty you will be around level 50 and there are two more difficulties.\n\nThere is also a Hardcore mode, multiplayer, an extensive crafting system and an achievements system.\n\nOverall a very good game, I would recommend it!

Yes.\n\nWhy? Well, first of all, it's further along than most early access games. I've already put over 40 hours into the game and still haven't seen most of chapter 2. The amount of content is huge.\n\nBut while content is king, gameplay is God for most. The easiest way to describe the game is to compare it to Titan's Quest, but improved. It makes sense since Crate Entertainment is made up of some of the same people who worked on Titan's Quest. It's also built on the same engine, though that's been improved too. The art style is more how I wanted Diablo 3 to look, and I absolutely love it.\n\nUnlike Diablo 3, in Grim Dawn you can have two skillsets or you can just stick with one, but each level only gives you three points to spread over the skillsets, so you have to choose. You also are able to choose your attribute points, though there are only three choices. It's simplified, but not to the point of Diablo 3.\n\nThe game has a faction system that looks like it could be promising later on, but at the moment it's simple and mostly meaningless. You gain fame and reputation through killing big bosses and monsters which can open up other side quests, but you'll usually open these up just from playing normally and not paying attention to your fame stats.\n\nI dropped $58 on this game during its kickstarter, it was money I had saved for Diablo 3. I don't regret a penny, and after picking up Diablo 3 on sale, I think I made the right choice.\n\nBut, it is in early access so there are chances for bugs. I haven't ran into any since they've released  Act 2, but keep in mind it's still a work in progress, but even then it's better in my opinion than some full release games.\n\nIf you love ARPGs then you owe it to yourself to pick up this game, especially when it's only $25.","March 8, 2015","true","50.8"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","1"

Grim Dawn has since been added to the collection and thus far I have absolutely no regrets.\n\nThe game provides appropriately 'grim' visuals, complemented by a very catchy and memorable soundtrack, all of which makes your impending murderous killing spree (in the name of questing and loot) all the more enjoyable. Having said that, Grim Dawn does a few things differently compared to the above commonly referenced titles. The lack of handholding is welcomed, as are the various but noticeable quality of life improvements that are easily underappreciated. In addition, gone are the procedurally generated maps, opting instead for a lovingly crafted world that throws in randomly spawned locales and dungeon entrances, alongside numerous quests with different outcomes and consequences, as well as picking a side between warring factions -- all of which ensures that despite the more 'static' settings, you still have uncertainty spliced with a bit of randomness and replay value - enforced through multiple difficulty settings of gameplay.\n\nClass/character building is a decent mix between repairable/configurable stats/abilities, and permanent decisions. It is also pleasant how you can essentially mix together two classes to form your own hybrids, rather than pick X and be stuck with it, adding onto the replay value thanks to all manner of class potential and experimentation in your mission to explore and survive in the absolute highest difficulty.\n\nIn short, Grim Dawn is as familiar as it is unique - a 'must try' for fans of the genre looking for a nice mixture of all that is currently on offer today, with its own twists and turns.\n\nThere are negatives, sure - but they are drowning in a pool of competant and well handled positivies.","February 23","true","51.7"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","0"

I got hooked on this game hard. The graphics, sound, abilities, combat, inventory management all fantastic. The upgrade system for enhancing your gear allows for a lot of variety. I explored every inch of every map, hacking away at the endless relentless hordes of evil that plague the beautiful and varied landscapes. You start in zombie infested swamplands. Then you unlock the other side of town and it's like something out of the wild west. There is strong variety in enemy design.\n\nThe ability to open rifts (teleports) anywhere in the game is a dream come true for inventory management. You don't have to make tough decisions about what to carry. Just teleport back to town, sell stuff, and return to where you were. Monsters don't respawn from teleporting. This also makes tough boss battles easier. Sometimes I would die repeatedly to a boss, but a rift in that room let me return back to it quickly. Another great feature is that enemies don't regenerate health, so you can eventually whittle down even the toughest challenges.\n\nA few downsides are that the grind can get tiresome due to the extreme amount of enemies standing in your way. They don't respawn  unless you exit the game, however, which is nice for keeping track of where you've been as the maps are enormous.\n\nYou can't save the game, which makes it hard to play shorter sessions. If you start exploring a map, you're in for the long haul until you either clear the entire area or find a new rift. Otherwise, the next time you log in you start at the city and all the monsters you cleared on a map have respawned. Exiting the game removes any existing personal rift you left behind also, so no quick teleporting to where you left off on a map. This was the most frustrating feature for me, because I can't always play for hours at a time and would have to play something else when my play time was shorter.\n\nSale prices of items to shops is really low. Buy prices are really high. It needs better balance. It's not that huge of a deal, since the best items keep flowing from combat loot and treasure chests.\n\nI also felt we don't get enough points to boost our skills each level. The game boasts combining two classes but it takes around 40 skill points just to cap out tier 1 abilities in one class. You only get 3 points per level. So you have to sacrifice boosting your main class just to scratch the surface of the second class.\n\nI pointed out a handful of downsides, but it is early access. It's in incredible shape for an EA title, most of which we all know aren't that well off. I highly recommend supporting the game. I played 42 hours before I ran of content as of May 4. New content is coming soon according to the developer notes. In the meanwhile I started  playing Titan Quest, an older game from the same creator. I just can't get enough!","May 6, 2015","true","82.1"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","24","25","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mantisofparadise/recommended/219990/","mantisofparadise","ParadiseMantis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mantisofparadise/","281 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDiablo 3 is too simplified and baby-tier.\nPath of Exile requires six spreadsheets and a bible to pray with.\nTitan Quest has a weird Greek theme to it and needs mods to run as intended.\n\nSo why not play Grim Dawn? For starters its offline so you're not waiting on anyone else's servers or connections (unless you want to play multiplayer) and while it isn't free like PoE its much cheaper than D3 and you don't have to run it through a redundant client. Everything you need to play Grim Dawn gets downloaded through Steam which shouldn't be a selling point but in today's time not coming saddled with DRM or always-online requirements is quite the bow on the box.\n\nAs for the game itself its typical ARPG fair. Find monsters, bludgeon them until they die, pick up loot, rinse and repeat. Grim Dawn manages to make that pretty satisfying though, on par with D3 actually (although the gritty aesthetic does appeal more to me than D3s aesthetic) and much more so than PoE where a lot of attacks seem to not even connect. It uses a tri-stat system and is very similar to a finished, polished, and reskinned Titan Quest with more stuff in it. Making a return is the two-class system which is pretty good fun and encourages lots of replay to see what each combination feels like in play (even if you can see, on paper, how they appear if you go looking.)\n\nThe mechanics encourage a wider variety of things than D3s 'Add more to your primary stat' equipment. A lot of the time you have to think about things and make sure that the extra +5% Physical damage bonus is worth the loss of 3% of your armor value and all of your Cold resistance because you don't know the next time some random frost-covered skeletor is going to show up and hand you your ♥♥♥ on a plate. There are hardly ever any 'pure upgrades' if you keep upgrading your equipment consistently and the crafting system helps this out a lot.\n\nThe real shocker is that making equipment is actually worth your time instead of the usual 'I can just pick it up off the ground, why bother?' mentality that plagues most ARP games. A lot of the time you can make better items than what you find so you're going to be almost always short on supplies and currencies which is really pretty unique considering the mountain of gold I'm sitting on in D3 and the bank stashes full of PoE currency items. There just seems to be a lot of attention to detail to make the game better than its competition.\n\nI can't make a sales pitch to people who don't know the genre, you're going to just look deep inside yourself and find out how much grind and loot hunting you're ready to commit to, but for everyone else? You're looking for the buzzwords of 'Its better than Diablo 2' but I'm not here to give you that judgement - I'm here to tell you that its better than everything else in the modern market.\n\nIf you want to know if it beats out the classic D2? Try it out.","October 1, 2015","true","121.2"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","26","29","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/harku123/recommended/219990/","harku123","Dad.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/harku123/","88 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHighly recommended game for fans of any Diablo game, Path of Exile, Titan Quest, Torchlight, Fate etc.\n\nThe things that drew me to this game was two things:\n\n1) It has single player (offline with no latency or disconnect issues)\n2) Dark atmosphere\n\nOther things that are awesome about this game:\n\n-Grim Dawn developers have paid high attention to details, both visually and also dialogue. Graphics are very nice (although needs optimizing, but that always happens just before actual game release) and dialogue is quite good and sometimes funny as well (serious funny, not childish funny (not that there's anything wrong with that)) and there are no inconsistencies as far as I have noticed such as how Leah in Diablo 3 is powerful enough to open a gate, but the main hero is not, yet can defeat Diablo etc.\n\n-The game is friendly to people with certain disabilities such as sufferers of motion sickness (option to turn off camera shaking) and people with colour blindness (several clolour blindness options to suit the type of colour blindness you have). I cannot tell you how well these options work as I do not actually suffer from these disabilities, but I really like that the developers pay attention to this.\n\n-So the fact that the environments are not randomly generated like other ARPGs worried me a little but they are a large part of what keeps a game interesting for me, but I can assure anyone that the environments do indeed stay fresh because of a number or reasons. There are all kinds of debris that can block your path in one game session, then in a different game session it'll be elsewhere (they vary per game session) meaning you still have to explore the map a little further. There are also many caves/dungeons that are optional but there are many and exploring them does reward you nicely, adding high satisfaction to the gameplay.\n\n-Again, the darker atmosphere of this game is not necessarily scary, but it is indeed gloomy and people who enjoy Diablo will particularly enjoy the atmosphere of Grim Dawn.\n\n-I have not looked too much into the lore, but what I have heard and read about does make me want to look into it further. The idea of the game taking place after a recent kind of apocalypse is always cool and it does make you think of Fallout 3 in that sense. You meet characters in the game who are struggling to survive in the post apocalyptic environment with dangerous monsters (and people) roaming the wilds that were once safe in the past.\n\n-Like a lot of people say, the game is built on the exact same engine that the game Titan Quest (awesome ARPG from 2006 and STILL very good and quite up to date with newer games in every aspect, including graphics). You can easily tell as most of the UI also looks very similar in both structure and art style as Titan Quest. Not only that though, the physics feel exactly like in Titan Quest and the character animation has the same kind of heavy feel to them as well.\n\n-Items. Similar affix system as you get in most ARPGs. Random stats will be applied to each item that you pick up. It's nothing revolutionary, but it's a system that is used in many games because it works and actually manages to keep the game fresh for a while. There are magic items, epic items, legendary items, all that kind of stuff. It's all good though!\n\n-The game has factions similar to ones you see in World of Warcraft. You complete quests for a certain group of people and you increase your reputation with them, making them respect you more and there is a meter in the character menu so you can keep track of it. It's exciting to see what more the developers will do with this as there are a lot of possibilities they could play around with in such a feature.\n\n-Levelling, stats and abilities. Most abilities are cool, but I have not explored it much because I have only played 1 character for about 19 hours as of this review and another small character for less than 1 hour. I can say though that you always anticipate the next level you reach in the game as you get to apply point into stats and also abilities and you do actually feel that your character grows every level. As of this review, the level cap is only 40 which will increase as more of act 3 gets accessible (I think act 3 is the final act..?) but I don't think anybody knows what the max level will be yet but it seems to me that the developers want the game to remain fun and add endgame. They have mentioned on their website that after release they are planning on implementing a game mode where you defeat endless waves of monsters and then you can test how far you get etc, although not much detail has been provided yet.\n\n-Another thing I would like to mention is that the developers do not believe in pay-to-win or small useless DLC updates. However, they do want to create expansions to the game after release (paid expansions such as Lord of Destruction, Immortal Throne, Reaper of Souls etc.) which is awesome really.\n\n-Music is very good.\n\nThe developers are very active and update the playable game regularly. Check out their website http://www.grimdawn.com/ for information on the content and features of the game on the Game Guide menu.\n\nVery good game. Happy I contributed to supporting the developers.\n\n9.5/10\n\nEDIT: I would like to add some cons about the game as to not be too biased towards the game.\n\n-So obviously the game needs work on the optimization but that always happens near the end of development.\n\n-Combat COULD improve in a way but is not a large problem. I feel (as a melee character) that not much strategy is involved. My class does not really use energy (mana) and I have never ever run out of it before. A lot of monsters' movement speed is faster than you so you cannot avoid their attacks and it ends up with you using potions. The frequency of using potions is similar to that of Diablo 2, give or take, depending on how much healing your class is capable of. I am okay with this, but I do enjoy the way that in Diablo 3 it is balanced in a different way where potions are an emergency heal with a long cooldown, rather than your main source of healing. Basically the combat could do with slightly more strategy as the only strategy I do is to run away from mobs real quick, heal, then go back but it is far from ruining it. It is a smaller problem than I may be making it out to be. Also it is in beta stage.\n\n-User Interface is not that smooth, but it was not in Titan Quest either but easily forgivable as it is not a huge issue or anything. It isn't unresponsive or anything, just not smooth in anyway, although the placement of the UI during combat or any activity is good and does not get in the way.\n\nMight update this review as time goes on, if I remember ;)","December 29, 2014","true","59.8"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","0"

Using the Titan Quest engine provided that essential first step to greatness, and it helped create awesome locations populated with diverse monsters. The levels are huge and joined together in a cohesive manner. The inclusion of faction alliances, and numerous written logs, helps strengthen the role-playing aspects. Character customization, class combinations, equipment upgrades and Devotion skills allow for a titanic range of viable builds. Once you finish the game, additional time can be spent with bounties, faction quest, and exploration of obscure areas. If multiplayer was more polished, there would be nothing holding it back from being strongly recommended.

Before now, when playing the typical ARPG like Diablo or Torchlight, I'm so used to just clicking through text because none of it really matters, it all would lead to the same thing, so imagine my surprise when I was doing just that and found out I managed to annihilate an entire settlement, who were just trying to stay alive best they could, but my sloppiness ensured their destruction, of course I got another quest out of it that I wouldn't have received otherwise but still, I know for a fact I have never felt so guilty before EVER when playing an ARPG in the past so now I'm more careful when I read through text because it doesn't matter if you quit the game and come back to farm loots, that poor rickety shambles of a village will still be just as dead as it was when I destroyed it so carelessly the first time.  That is simply AWESOME!!!\n\nAnd on top of that,  there is faction gameplay as well so you can align yourself with certain powers that be which will give availability to cool gear and items you wouldn't get otherwise but also increases the replayability as well, over and above what the class/masteries provide alone.\n\nAs of right now, it's not possible to choose factions that could possibly royally screw over the first settlement where your character starts and is accepted into for story reasons. Even so, with the factions mechanic they already have in place, I wouldn't be at all surprised if a future expansion or dlc will make such a thing very possible because your starting area is coveted by many, so this faction gameplay they've added to Grim Dawn makes the future possibilities of the game's potential really exciting!\n\nI just can't recommend this game more highly!!","September 1, 2015","true","261.5"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"

Don't lose hope, you WILL love again, and your love may blossom as soon as THIS VERY MOMENT.  After all, the night is always darkest before the dawn, and Grim Dawn will make you praise the sun once more!\n\nWhat's good about Grim Dawn?  I'll try to avoid direct comparisons to other games in the genre, but here are some of Grim Dawn's highlights:\n\n+the game feels impactful.  Every strike against an enemy is accompanied by a satisfying thud, and ragdoll animations send enemies flying all over the screen in tiny bits\n\n+there is near infinite levels of customization.  The game awards you plenty of skill points, but not enough to to able to invest in a wide variety of skills.  You'll have to plan carefully and pick your favorites, which increases replayability.\n\n+There is a hardcore option.\n\n+There is multiplayer\n\n+There is a huge variety of loot.\n\n+Making a functional build requires thought.\n\n+crafting exists.  If you're having trouble finding the item you need, you can either craft one using a blueprint (which you can loot randomly), or by having the blacksmith craft a random piece of gear.\n\n+There are plenty of side areas to explore.  Exploring is almost always worth the time, since you may find unique bosses or Devotion Shrines which grant you points to use in your devotion skill tree.\n\n+multiple difficulties are available to the player.  Every character you make progresses through normal, elite, and ultimate difficulty.  Once you beat the game on normal difficulty, you can play Elite difficulty with that character, and once you beat Elite, you can play Ultimate with that character.\n\n+The world changes in meaningful ways as you play.  Your choices in sidequests have a lasting impact on your game, and aiding the npcs in town may cause them to treat you differently.\n+Factions exist in the game.  For example, the first settlement, "Devil's Crossing", will only tolerate your existence at first.  As you prove yourself to the settlers, you will gain access to new quests and new equipment sold only at that settlement.  By contrast, enemies also have factions.  The more that a specific enemy faction grows to loathe you, they'll throw tougher monsters at you.\n\n+the game is moddable\n\n+The plot is extremely good for a game of this genre.\n\n+Last, the developers of Grim Dawn are extremely receptive and transparent.\n\nSo what are some of Grim Dawn's flaws?\n\n-drop rates for rarer items are low.  I personally like the droprate though.\n\n-Even on pc's with good specs, some people have framerate issues with lots of enemies.   Some users do not experience this issue.\n\n-stash space is limited.  If you are willing to mod, this is a non-issue.\n\n-it takes FOREVER to reach "nemesis" status with enemy factions (this is the highest status possible).\n\nOverall, the game is a solid 9/10.  If the developers can manage to further optimize the game and improve framerate, I would give it a solid 10/10","January 14","true","632.3"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","24","26","2","0"

If so, this game should be at the top of your list.  When I first read a Grim Dawn article from RockPaperShotgun.com a long while back, I was left with hope for an ARPG that would deliver a gaming experience akin to mashing up several characteristic of some of my favorite games:\n\nDiablo/Diablo 2 - Loot Variety / Quality, Rune/Rune word system, and the dark, mature, and savage atmosphere\nTitan Quest:IT - Graphics, Class system, Essence system, Relic system and Loot Variety/Qualities\nGames of the late 90s era - Innovation and challenge at the risk of appealing to a niche / mature audience\nPath of Exile - Deep passive skill tree offering immense amounts of customization and replayability\nThus far the game is delivering a very enjoyable gaming experience.  Below i've touched on the aspects of the game I've enjoyed most.  However, recently Crate overhauled their website and added a Game Guide [www.grimdawn.com].  This guide provides considerably more depth into the masteries and systems which build the foundation of this game.  If you're on the fence about the game poke through the guide to get an in depth view of what the game has to offer, read on to get a flavor of what my experience has been, or read both, but don't waste too much time; the game is begging to be played.\n\nThe current 5 mastery choices are bound to provide an option to suit almost anyones play style and to top it all off Grim Dawn uses a dual mastery system that provides excellent character building depth and game replayability.\n\nThe Component System is Grim Dawn's version of the Titan Quest Essence system or Diablo's gem, jewel, rune system, which offers the ability for players to collect components dropped by enemies which can then be combined to create components with greater stats and sometimes active skills when socketed to armor, weapons, or accessories.\n\nThe Forge system is an enhanced version of Titan Quest's Enchant system, which now allows players to craft relics, gear, and accessories from completed components, scraps, and iron bits. Relics which require formulas are Grim Dawn's answer to Diablo 2's Runeword system.  The forge is a much more engading/indepth version of Diablo's Gambling system and Diablo 2's Horadric cube crafting system.\n\nThe Devotion system is Crate's version of Path of Exiles' passive tree.  Notable difference that I find more enjoyable is the means by which one obtains devotion points (passive tree points).  Instead of being given the passive point on each level; the player must first find the devotion shrine and either restore it with the requested materials or kill whatever has been locked within it.  This system provides the player with even more reason to explore this atmospheric world and additional challenges to "fix" the shrine thereby adding more depth to the enchancing your character instead of just purely leveling.\n\nThe loot system is addicating and gratifying. Loot erupts from slain enemies and chests and glistens on the ground begging to be picked up.  The qualities range from ( Unique Item sets, Purple - Legendary, Blue - Epic, Orange - Components, Green - rare, Yellow - magical, White - common, Grey - broken).\n\nThe post apocolyptic dark and gritty fantasy victorian environment is splendid!  I really enjoy all the detail of the graphical assets for this game so far; they are varied and really don't feel over used. The lighting and shadow system is done in a way that makes the environment come to life and feel real.  The weather/atmosphere system is very appealing and includes aspects such as day/night cycle, fog, lightning, rain, etc. and the ability to mix it up to varying degrees to create climates/weather patterns for different regions within the game.  I also appreciate the graphics tuning options that allow me to crank up the visual details for my desktop rig, and allow me to scale it all down for my outdated laptop.\n\nThe ambient soundstage and sound effects is probably one of my favorite aspects of this game. Between this and the grahic asset detail the immersion is top notch.  Here are some examples:\n\nTicking of an old grandfather clock\nPopping and creeking of old wooden floors\nCrackling of a roaring fire incinerating coffins and the dead\nThe buzzing of flies over a rotting corpse\nHissing wind and the babbling creeks\nCrows squawking and monsters growning\nMetallic reverberating undertones (sounds a little like deep church bells in the distance with overtones of ringing metal being pounded on by a blacksmith.)\nThe combat sound effects are extremely satisfying! The character actions/skills seem to integrate flawlessly with the sound effect in a way that just seems to "fit/resonate".  For example flaming musket shots crack as they leave the muzzle of the weapon and sizzle/ignite as they penetrate the target's flesh. A landed melee attack has a solid satisfying thud the seems as if it were capable of shattering bones.\n\nIn previous builds of the game I found the soundtrack left a lot to be desired.  It was distracting and felt repeative and grating.  I'm happy to say the soundtrack is changing in a very positive way, now blending and interweaving into the ambient effects of the game.  It's really starting to fit the atmosphere and rhythem of the game in my opinion.\n\nOverall, I'm happy to say I have zero reget being an initial founder for this game. I'm also glad I cancelled my Diablo 3 per-orders and upped my support for this small indi developer when it became a Kickstarter project.  I have full confidence Crate will deliver a highly polished finished product boasting an amazing challenging, replayable, and indepth ARPG experience that other games of this genre will be judged on. It's definitely worth the asking price of $25 as it stands, and I expect it will become an even greater value as more content is added, adjusted, and balanced.\n\nMany thanks to Arthur Bruno and his Crate Entertainment team for continuing to deliver on his original vision dating back to 2010.","October 25, 2014","true","220.7"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","0"

It has come a long way, trekked through many zombie infested bugs. It has true potential to be a successor to the Titan Quest series. The Dev's are friendly and listen to most of the community and the community has been mostly awesome back. Dev's take bug reporting seriously and will remedy a BIG patch with each build update, unless there is a serious bug that breaks gameplay they will push one out fast asap. The game just keeps getting better and better as time goes. I dont play it all the time, i do go on a week like binge and take a break here and there.\n\nYes everyone knows its a Diablo esque hack & slash loot game. I see no problem in that. Just lots of SHINIES! :D\n\nGameplay - Its improved and fantastic!\nStory - Is very interesting (probably matter of opinion because some spots can seem bland) with a good amount of lore in between.\nSoundtrack - its perfect, goes with the atmosphere of the game.\nLoot - is ever improving and some amazing stuff drops yet the loot table is not even 10% available at the current build!\nClasses - Whether main specing or dual specing its impressive to see what kinds of character builds we can come up with and what skill combos we can do to make our characters pretty unique.\nMultiplayer - OMG we have multiplayer! Its a little buggy at times but we have multiplayer! And its fun!\n\nP.S.

Many loots... I have found white, yellow, green and blue loots, so many that I got confused. I know that if blue and yellow loots fall in love they will make green loots, but what about the white ones? Are they just really old?\n\nAlso, the game is very violent. I took a stroll just outside of Devils Crossing and a giant insect/bug came out of nowhere and threw up bile and acid in my face. At first I thought it was an accident, but whwn I moved to the side it turned and did it again... The only way to make him stop was to kill him. I'm a pacifist, and I just wanted to give the poor thing some pepto-bismol and get on with my questing. For some reason everyone in this game is very angry and just want to pick fights with you. You will also meet people that come out of the ground. I guess they are dead and has risen, but it's not very realistic... I have seen pictures of Jesus when he was resurrected, and he looks all handsome with wavy hair and a well kept beard - these guys looks like they fall off the ugly-tree and hit every branch on the way down.\n\nI have searched everywhere the game lets me so far, and I have yet to come across a unicorn. All games should have atleast one unicorn!! If you don't know, unicorns are awesome, they look just like horses - only they have a big shiny carrot on their forehead. Unicorns comes in all colors, and I would really like to find a pink one because pink is my most favorite color in the whole world. I guess unicorns will be coming in the last part of act three.\n\nThere is also a lack of romance in this game. I play video games to escape reality, and in real life I'm not very good with the opposite(or the same) gender. Therefor I was disappointed when I couldn't find a special someone to share my nights with. This is also something I guess the devs will make available later.\n\nThe game has some good things going for it though. Water for instance. If you squint really hard and look at water on your screen from about an inch away it looks almost wet. I also like the sound of rings falling from mobs as it reminds me of my cooking timer. I like food. This is good.\n\nLast, but not least - I would like to say that the game would benefit from some more customization. I would like my Demolishionist to sport a nice Lacrosse turtle-neck, slim fit jeans and perhaps some RayBans. None of these options are available. I found some helmet-thingy with sunglasses attached to it, but they looked more like protection a welder would use, nothing Prada about them.\n\nTLDR; Awesome game, just buy it and never look back!\n\nThis is what Diablo III tried to be, and more!\n\nIt's still in early access, there is no end-game, and yet it's the most fun I've had i years. I love this game.\nCan't wait to see it progress and mature.

Good graphics. I have my graphics maxed and the game looks amazing, the best graphics I have seen on an arpg yet.\n\n3. Enviroments. Each act has a different look and I like that. Past arpgs usually look similar in most places but in grim dawn you have a good veriety to keep it interesting.\n\n4. Loot. I love the loot in grim dawn. It dosn't take years to farm for end game items like some other games yet you don't get it right away. I have a few near maxed chars 700 hours in but there is some items I have never seen so it keeps me playing and enjoying it too.\n\n5. And lots of other things like the ui, the option to hide loot you don't want, the crafting system, boss fights, the secret areas and much more.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The stash is too small. You get 1 stash tab for each char and a shared stash that has 4 tabs plus 5 small inventory bags for each char as you level but it's not enough and once you start getting a lot of good items like epic and legendary then you will need to make multiple characters to carry your gear or destroy/sell lots of items. I have to switch between about 7 chars when trying to find gear and it's annoying.\n\n2. End game is decent, there is 2 rogue like dungeons and you can farm nemesis bosses, plus on the ultimate setting all areas scale to your level but it's still not enough for me, I would prefer something like a map system or something.\n\n\n\nOverall I would rate the game about 9.5/10.

The gothic setting, with a pinch of Wild West and post-apocalyptic atmosphere, appeals to my tastes much more than the mythologies presented in Titan Quest. It is still a bit rough around the edges (for example, the intro and ending cinematics are missing, the NPC's are not voiced, some bugs remain to be squashed and the overall balance of the game is not finite yet), but that won't stop this gem from reaching its full potential once the game exits EA in February next year.\n\nIf you are a true fan of hack 'n slash approach to the ARPG genre, with a couple of innovations to freshen it up and a nicely crafted world to explore, and if you're aching for some loot hunting, then this is the game for you.

It offers the very best of the genre, providing fantastic build diversity and character development depth whilst also offering a satisfying set of mechanics and great combat - something that you must, up until this point, have chosen either one or the other in this genre.\n\nPlot is decent, if somewhat lacking in focus and general flow but it is better than most ARPGs. Writing however is great and the game really shines in the smaller stories it tells, which add in building this fantastic world.\n\nThe biggest plus for me is the fact that you can play this game offline! No more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers killing off your HC characters and no more desync ruining your experience. I'm not the person who has played games like PoE or D3 competitively so the lack of a competitive scene does not effect me in any way so this is a BIG positive for me.\n\nMy one criticism is that many skills are very similar to each other in playstyle (at least in the early game), and many skills just augment the basic attack which, to me personally, is very boring. However, the Devotion system does add a new dynamic to these skills and it does emphasise the minor differences between skills, so this criticism may be unjust.\n\nAlso, modding tools are to be released so time will tell if a modding scene will exist but if it does, then any question of longevity will be eliminated.","March 19","true","60.4"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","0"

The general feeling was it was in most people's top 3, especially as everyone dislikes Diablo 3, which I actually enjoyed as a single player experience.\n\nYou get more character customisation here than Diablo 3 but not the amount of Path of Exile. You pick one class and then later on pick another to make a hybrid. A simple but effective concept for making the character you choose.

People are comparing it to Diablo 3, but this game doesn't take a page out of Blizzard's World of Warcraft artstyle that looks like it came straight out of a Disney cartoon. Instead it tries to show you a bleak world where there is little hope of a better tomorrow.\n\nThe story isn't spoon-fed on a silver platter, but instead small notes you read along the way really set the tone of the game. SLIGHT SPOILER: It starts with a sense of mistery. You WANT to know what happened to fallen kingdoms, forgotten cities, destroyed families. The notes you read at the start only give you clues to the events that befell the world around you. It really grabs you and immerses you into the world (if you actually try rather than just mindlessly killing things).\n\nThis isn't an "MMO" like Path of Exiles or Diablo 3 claim to be. Instead this is more of a single-player game WITH multiplayer elements (CO-OP). Even in its early state this game is worth the money since it already has a large amount of playable content that will keep you entertained.\n\nThe gear is great, the abilities are fun, and combat is good. I did experience some crashing when playing in CO-OP though.

I was introduced to it in the days of Diablo, yes the original, and have beeen addicted ever since.\n\nI've played a good number of them, only a select few have grabbed me the way Diablo did. My top three of all time are Titan Quest, Diablo 2 and Sacred- in no particular order, I love them all for different reasons.\n\nWhile only in Alpha, Grim Dawn may find itself with a rare honor. Being named my favorite ARPG ever. I don't name something my 'favorite' lightly, because my mood may change, or there may be something this other one did better so I like it better for that. Grim Dawn is no exception, but the parts I do like are vast and done super well.\n\nGrim Dawn plays like Titan Quest, no surprise same people and same core engine. It's fast paced and chaotic, bodies fly everywhere. Unlike Titan Quest, it actually likes to challenge you, you run in to bosses that actually slow you down and make you rethink the "run in and hit it until it dies" strategy.\n\nThe class system is definitely a throwback to Titan Quest, only improved. You select your first class when you ding 2, and at 10 you can select a second class. On launch there will be at least 5 masteries, which translates to 15 potential character options, and each one of those has several build options.\nUnlike Titan Quest though, in Grim Dawn your masteries are all complete classes and you do not NEED to take another to actually be able to play the game. It is balanced such that any combination is a viable build, and even most build options within each combination are viable.\n\nLoot, they've done away with the crappy 'broken' items, limiting it to only 'non magic' and better, which come in 5 flavors. Magic, Rare, Unique, Set, Legendary. Magic items have 1 or 2 enchantments on them, but can have really good enchantments, Rares have multiple enchantments but don't have the same maximum power as magic, sets and uniques are self explanatory to anyone who has played an ARPG, Legendary are basically uniques on crack.\n\nThe world is one of my favorite parts of Grim Dawn. Victorian Post Apocalypse with an occasional light steampunk aesthetic. It's gritty, it's dirty, you feel like it's really a world that's been attacked and nearly destroyed. The dead are piled like they've been given up on, bodies are burned to prevent them from coming back, buildings are half destroyed. Survivors are taking refuge in a prison, because it's one of the most secure places left.\n\nThe economy feels apocalyptic too, even basic items are expensive, and the currency is no longer gold, it's iron. A staple resource needed for many things. While the game has iron coins, I like to think of it as scrounging scrap bits of iron from those you defeat and trading that, coins are simply used because "Iron junk" is kinda an odd currency.\n\nThere's a few minor issues with the game, but I'll wait to reserve judgement on the negatives until after the final game launches. In the mean time, I consider even the alpha alone to be well worth the $30 it costs. I backed it on Kickstarter for $85 and consider myself to have already gotten more than my money's worth out of it.","November 25, 2013","true","149.6"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","12"

Your character got posessed by Aetherials but, as the peoples of Devil's Crossing were about to hang you, the Aetherials left you alone, for some reason. So here you are, with mad powers and ♥♥♥♥♥, to save the day!\n\nYou can level up your character in two different classes and each class have enough skill so you won't be able to get them all. This allow for a great customization of your character along with with the items that can help you improve your build even more.\n\nAnd one of the best thing in my opinion is that the stats system is not totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Your stats climb linearly with levels. The three main attribute are Physique for health, Cunning for physical damage and hit chances ( both yours and your ennemie's ) and Spirit for magic damage and energy. You'll probably end up maxing one or two but you'll have to find something in your build to make up for your lack of health, hit chances or energy.\n\nHero Monsters are also something I thinks is very fun. They are like small bosses with unique name and design and most of them actually feel like they have an unique twist.\n\nOn top of this, Grim Dawn is set up in a dark world with well done characters, complex backstory and factions, amazing areas to explore and secrets to discover.

The game is like an onion with more and more features unlocked as you play. Before you know it, you have a very deep, engaging ARPG on your hands. The character progression rivals Path of Exile's and is better in some aspects. The builds are almost endless in scope so you won't see as much cookie cutter (though cookie cutter isn't necessarily a bad thing as long as there are other optitons - and, boy, are there options). The maps are huge and varied with as much to explore under ground as there is on the ground. The story is solid with actual choices that affect a lot of gameplay. There are even factions to grind rep with that give you access to gear and other helpful items. Have I mentioned the bounty board that each faction owns? Bounty boards give you access to more difficult quests without a lot of help from quest text that offer more xp and rewards. Think "daily quests" mixed in with the monster hunting from FF12. The best part? Crate is giving access to their builder which will allow player's to make their own enemies, maps, stories, items, dungeons, etc, basically increasing the lifespan and depth of an already endlessly deep experience.\n\nI cannot reccomend this game enough if you are a true APRG, dungeon diving","January 12","true","77.9"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Three friends and I bought the early access and are having a great time running around, getting very interesting/exciting gear, and smashing enemies.

Like that "I-connect-my-fist-with-that-monsters-face-violence" heavy.\n\n2.1) CHARACTER-CREATION IN MAIN-MENU:\nThere is not a lot of selection going on when you first start the game up to create your character. Which isn't bad in my book. I'm not playing Skyrim here. Dis an ARPG yo!\nYou can enter a name for your character, you can choose between male and female and if you want to go hardcore.\nIf you go hardcore and get your character killed, you will be notified that "You are dead" and you will respond via button with "Okay". After that your character remains as a ghost on your character-list (not able to be played any further).\n\n2.2) CHARACTER-CREATION IN-GAME:\nThere might not be a lot of selection during the character-creation.\nBut...\n...damn.\nWhen it comes to choices how to develop your character? These developers hit the nail on the head!\nYou have the freedom to choose between six classes/masteries:\nSoldier, Demolitionist, Occultist, Nightblade, Arcanist and Shaman.\nYou need to put skillpoints into a mastery first, before you can access its skills. For every point put into a mastery, you get buffs for attributes, health and energy (da new/old-mana thing). You best look here for more in-depth information:\nhttp://grimcalc.com/\nExactly at level 10 you can choose a second class to complement your first choice. But that is optional and completely up to you! There are enough skills in just one class which want to be maxed out to cause devastation.\nYou get 3 skillpoints for each level (just 2 at level 50 and on). Maxlevel currently is 85. But from what I understand (and I don't understand much - haven't enjoyed a lot of education) the developers want to create an expansion. So maxlevel might get a raise there.\nYou get 1 Attribute Point for each level. Attributes are: Physique, Cunning and Spirit.\nThe Items. DA ITEMS! They range from (in that order and in increasing rareness (that a word?)): White, yellow [magic], green [rare], blue [epic] and violet [legendary]. You can equip items in the following slots: Helmets, chest-armor, leg-armor, boots, bracers, shoulder-armor, belt, 2 rings, necklace, relics and ribbons. They can give you access to unique skills and you can add to them...\nComponents. There are so much of them. It's like sand on a beach only with diamonds instead of sand. Every component is unique and again, they can give your character access to unique skills with which you can bust these monsters nuts in.\nFor more depth about this topic best look here:\nhttps://gracefuldusk.appspot.com/items\nDevotion: As if picking two classes from six available ones were not enough, you can devote your character to certain paths. You can gain so called "Devotion-Points" by cleaning shrines. Once cleansed, you gain a point.\nI should note that you can set skill-/devotionpoints back for a price (Iron - the ingame currency) at a vendor. I found a lot of iron so I assume that's no issue. Only problem is, that you can't redistribute attribute points and no masteries/classes that you have already invested points in, since you can't respec the points put into a mastery.\n\n2.3) CHARACTER-INFO IN-GAME & DIFFICULTY:\nThe developers included a lot of information about your character that you can check upon at any time through your inventory/character-window. You will find it necessary. Especially when you hit the next difficult modes after "normal": Elite and Ultimate. With each rank of difficulty your character suffers from a 25% penalty to some resistances (resistances are: Fire, Cold, Lightning, Poison & Acid and Piercing, Bleeding, Vitality, Aether, Stun and Chaos).\nIf you're playing on normal and find it to easy for your likings, because you're to pro for that ♥♥♥♥, you can switch to veteran mode. Harder enemies, more heroes, more loot!\nVereran mode is not available on Elite- and Ultimate-Difficulty anymore however. It's veteran enough there, you power-hungry being.\n\n3) FACTIONS:\nYou can side with factions! There are eleven in total:\n- Aetherials [hostile by default]\n- Chthonians [hostile by default]\n- Conley's Gang [hostile by default]\n- Devil's Crossing [friendly by default]\n- Homestead [friendly by default]\n- Kymon's Chosen [hostile or friendly; depends on a choice in the game]\n- Order of Death's Vigil [hostile or friendly; depends on a choice in the game]\n- Rovers [friendly by default]\n- The Black Legion [friendly by default]\n- The Outcast [hostile or friendly; depends on a choice in the game]\n- Undead [hostile by default]\n\nIf you're an enemy to a faction and gained enough hate (through killing members of that faction or fulfilling quests with factions hostile to them) a nemesis will spawn. These beings will blow your character away like a firecracker if you are not prepared. Now I might not have enjoyed a lot of education, but I have never met an enemy that powerful yet rewarding like a nemesis in a game!\n\nIf you have gained enough trust with a faction, you can waddle-daddle to a "faction-vendor". He, she (or it) will sell items unique to them. Like...\n\n4) RECIPES (also: CRAFTING):\nYUS!\nThere are recipes in game. You played Titan Quest? You know what I mean!\nIf not, let me explain:\nYou find a recipe through farming (busting monsterheads in over and over) or through methods mentioned before.\nYou read it and then its knowledge is saved forever. You can access it as often as you want. No real need to find it a second time.\nIf you have the right ingredients (that you have to farm and gather first as well), you can craft whatever that nice and beautiful looking recipe promises you.\nAt a smithy. Now theses NPC's have special bonuses unique to them. So wherever you craft your thing via recipe, these bonuses will be applied.\n\n5) STORY AND VOICE-ACTING:\nThe story is nice, I guess. The game is set in Victorian-times (for my defense > no education). I don't want to tell much (if you are even interested in the story at all) but you start as a "Taken". One being which's body has been invaded by a powerful spirit called an Aetherian. The ones who ruled the earth before they have been banished by the gods of the humans.\nAnd now...\n...NAOW they want IT BACK!\nAnd it is up to YOU to stop them!\nBut overall I have to say I enjoy the little notes you can find here and there. They add alot to the atmosphere and tell you how it came down to this apocalypse.\n\nThe Voice-acting is nice. Main characters will speak their lines. Though most of them seem a little to silent for me. Might be just a problem on my end. So that's no minus there.\n\nBit of a problem can be, that, if you are playing multiplayer, only one of you can talk to a character at one given time. So if one accepts a quest, it is not readable for you anymore.\n\n6) CONCLUSION:\nOverall, I have to say my thanks to the developers here.\nObviously my paid 24,99€ are not enough to compensate for the fun you have given me, so I wrote this review to tell people about what great of a gem you created with your dedicated work.\n\nSeriously, every punch I do ingame is like a massage for my soul. Whenever I had a stressful day, I just gonna play.\nGrim Dawn.","March 2","true","294.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

It's currently in early access, but there's a lot to do in game, as they just released the first part of Act 3, and multiplayer was added a few patches ago. The first thing you will notice is how fun combat can be. A common issue in ARPGs is boring combat. As fun as Diablo 2 and PoE are, the combat can feel very boring. In Grim Dawn when you attack stuff you see the enemy corpse really take damage, you see the gore and the corpse fly off depending on what you hit them with. The sounds are also good quality which helps make each hit you do feel powerful and rewarding. With good combat, the return of Titan Quests unique skill system, and a dark world to explore, the game is very much worth buying even in early access. The devs are good about responding on the steam forums and their own, so you can easily follow the development as this goes towards release.","December 22, 2014","true","13.2"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryche/recommended/219990/","ryche","Ryche","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryche/","2 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI waited until I had over 300 hours in the Early Access version of the game so I could give it a fair opinion. The game is excellent. Especially if you like ARPG's such as the Diablo series, Path of Exile, Titan Quest, Nox, etc. Fans of hack and slash RPG's will be more than satisfied with the purchase. There are now all 6 classes in the game as of Build 27 and each one has a distinct style of gameplay. I chose the Soldier for that old school sword and board melee feel and I couldn't be more than happy with my first character.\n\nFirst, the obvious comparisons to the other giants in the genre. The game feels a lot like Diablo 2 with the Diablo 3 improvements such as blacksmithing, heroes, nemesis mobs, etc. Whereas D3 was more of a go-faster, kill as fast as you can while hoping you have the resistances to avoid this chain of boss mobs and Path of Exile leans more toward competitive gameplay, Grim Dawn has that explore, kill, dirnk a  potion and continue feel of Diablo and D2. It also has larger acts and a loot system that rewards you often (and just enough) to help you build a character you are happy with much more quickly. There are also is a deep modification system that allows you to make your gear fit your gameplay style. I never felt like I would never get the gear to make a certain build and I did not have to follow a certain build to be able to finish certain content.\n\nCurrently in Early Access the game is worth the purchase price. It is complete through ACT III and I experienced no crashes and no bugs that killed my immersion or frustrated my gameplay. The graphics are excellent for an ARPG with enviromental damage, destructive enviroments and spell effects. Plus the devlopers have promised more polish. While on the subject of the developer I would like to add that they have continously fulfilled their promises throughout development. Crate is a very small developer at this point and have been extemely transparent and communicative about the game. It is not a game you fear won't reach full release or continue to be supported with additional content.\n\nOne thing I wanted to address in previous reviews I have read stated that there was no voice acting in the game. There is. While the quest and lore content is not voice acted you will hear the familiar, "That skill is not ready." and various shouts and chants from the enemies such as "Kill the non-believer!" throughout the game that make it feel fully complete. There are not hours and hours of lore and quest text so do not be daunted thinking you will spend more time reading than playing. It is a true hack and slash with multiple systems to modify gameplay that gamers have come to expect.\n\nAs you can tell from the review I have been very happy with my purchase and if you can pick it up on sale it is even more worthy of a buy. Hidden areas, large game map, crafting, faction and reputation rewards (including quests), excellent loot and an interesting setting with highly varied mobs all combine to make it a worthy competitor to the other, more well-known ARPG's on the market right now.","August 23, 2015","true","319.0"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/recommended/219990/","feuerzeuge","fleur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/","211 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA great Diablo-like, in the vein of Titan Quest. It follows genre conventions pretty closely despite all the prior talk of the open world and faction system - it is separated into discrete, linear acts much like D2, and the factions are so far more of an afterthought than a central game mechanic. Despite that, it's a lot of fun to play if you're into the genre - combat feels good, and the staggering amount of options you're given for how to build your character give it a lot replay value.\n\nLike in D2, some items offer you unique abilities that you can base entire builds around, and loot in general plays a big part in hinting at spurring new playthroughs. If you're like me, it's not rare to find a rare item and have your mind immediately start to consider how its unique bonuses could be ridiculously abused with the proper build.\n\nI'd highly recommend it if you like the feeling of your character getting stronger, the feeling of finding sweet loot and the feeling of taking out huge crowds of angry monsters in ever more efficient and spectacular ways. It's a bit easy to begin with, but that at least offers you freedom to experiment - and the game is fully moddable, to boot. I'd heartily recommend this.","July 28, 2015","true","202.7"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","3"

So after four hours or so in to the game, I looked up Crate Entertainment, the guys and gals behind Grim Dawn. Turns out that they're made up of a lot of the people behind Iron Lore, the company who did Titan Quest and Dawn of War: Soulstorm.\n\nWhy is this relevant (besides me being happy that this gives me everything I love about Titan Quest)? Because with Grim Dawn it shows that these guys have done this before, and done it well with Titan Quest. Dawn of War shows that they are familiar with the Games Workshop IP. And this all ties in to the big statement as to why I love Grim Dawn:\n\nIt's like Titan Quest and Warhammer Fantasy decided to mate to breed the perfect child.\n\nIs Grim Dawn perfect? No. Is it almost perfect as far as ARPG's go? Yes. I would even say that it is the better of them. It is much better than the Diablo games (I love those too, so this isn't bias), it is better than Titan Quest (the world feels more vibrant and steeped in history than even the historical-fantasy setting of it's predecesor) and it sure as hell beats out all of the other Diablo Clones I have placed since Diablo 1 came out.\n\nIt follows the same formula, but I feel like it is better balanced, with a better setting, a cooler plotline, and much better skill/stat progression. And do also like how every stat is useful to every class. And thus far I like every skill I have unlocked.\n\nTR;DR: Buy this game. It blows Diablo 2 and 3 away, and is also better than it's "predecessor", Titan Quest.\n\n9/10, which is SOLID for an early access game.

It is a worthy successor of Titan Quest and a game that, despite using tried-and-tested methods, will scratch the itch of those who cried in disappointment when Diablo 3 came out and not only them. It is capable of appealing to any ARPG fan, because there are plenty of items and sets to discover, there are enough classes to find one suiting your playstyle as there is a world plunged into chaos and darkness that needs saving. For a price of 25 euros, you’ll get an ARPG in the old-school sense of the word that has the potential to keep you clicking for at least 40 to 50 hours and you can definitely do much worse than that.

I played it for a few hours, but didn't give it enough time to realize the beauty hidden underneath the upgraded Titanquest game engine.\n\nBecause, up to this point, Path of Exile has been my absolute favorite ARPG, I follow ZiggyD on YouTube. He posted a video about how the game was just about to be fully released in a couple days, and recommended the game for people who like PoE and ARPGs in general, so, remembering that I had the game in my library, I figured I would actually give it a real shot this time.\n\nA few hours in, and I realized this game had a lot of potential. About 43 hours later, I'm now realizing this game is incredible.\n\nOne of the things that bugged me about the game initially was how my character movement sort of felt like I was gliding over the ground, instead of actually being affected by gravity like someone in real life. It's the same phenomenon you can experience in Bethesda games like Fallout 3 and Skyrim, if you zoom out to third person (haven't played F4 so I don't know whether this has changed).\n\nHowever, this is a very minor misgiving that I quickly got over. I soon realized that the game has a lot of other really, really good things to enjoy about it, and truth be told, the engine ain't all that bad. In fact, I think they did a great job on the lighting and some of the particle effects in the game, especially the blood, vitality, and chaos effects.\n\nEnough graphics talk, though!\n\nThe action does feel very good, and it doesn't take long for your character to start feeling powerful. I feel like Path of Exile struggles with this. While maybe not as pronounced as Diablo 3, Grim Dawn does have ragdoll physics and great sound effects to make combat very enjoyable. There are also nice additions like combat numbers that aren't in PoE.\n\nThe class system is fantastic - you'll be able to choose a primary class at level 2, and then at level 10 you'll choose your secondary class. You get to combine two of the six classes in the game. Initially, this doesn't sound groundbreaking, but the skill trees for each class have so many different options that it opens up an incredible amount of builds that are possible! I've only made 2 characters so far (one of which was my first one, a year ago), only one of which I really count, so I can't wait to try out some amazing builds!\n\nI have only completed normal difficulty so far, but one thing I love about this game is how I have been able to experiment liberally with my build, without being severely punished for doing so. I feel like Diablo 3 makes builds completely trivial, while on the other hand Path of Exile has a ton of amazing build options, but is harshly unforgiving if you make a mistake with your build.\n\nGrim Dawn (again, so far - because I haven't played the second two difficulties) strikes the perfect balance between the these two extremes by adding a small cost to each point you refund in your skill tree. This gives you the ability to experiment, but doesn't trivialize character builds by just letting you swap them out whenever you want.\n\nAnother thing the game has going for it is the exploration. Normally with ARPGs, I reach the endgame quite quickly and start the usual grind. It's to be expected that you'll be grinding for gear in this genre. However, I feel like I get burned out leveling new characters quickly these days in ARPGs. Maybe this is my own fault, but a lot of times there just isn't much reason to explore, so it becomes a race to endgame.\n\nIn Grim Dawn, the game gives you great reason to explore every nook and cranny, because there are actually secret areas that spawn randomly. These areas may even contain questgivers and new hero monsters to fight, and they must be found by searching around the map for hidden walls and other places that are not indicated by the map. This really makes the leveling process enjoyable, and it gives you a reason to explore the game!\n\nThe loot is also great. I feel like they found the right balance between frequency and rarity. Fun loot drops all the time, but not so much that it isn't exciting anymore.\n\nSummary:\n\nVisuals: 8/10\nSound: 8/10\nVisceral-ness of combat/Character combat feel: 9/10\nLore: 8/10\nClass system: 9/10\nLoot system: 9/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall value/bang for your buck: Off the charts!\n\nIf you like action RPGs, stop thinking and go buy it!","February 28","true","78.7"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

It follows the formula in a fairly straightforward manner, but it's impeccably refined – one of the best-in-genre, in my opinion.\n\nMy bullsh*t:\n\nI'd had my eye on this game for a couple of years, frankly, but the thought of playing an ARPG in delayed, unpolished segments seemed miserable. After reading that the game was 'content complete' with the release of Act 4, I decided to finally dive in (it was also on sale, which was sweet).\n\nTo be clear, I love this genre. Diablo, Titan Quest, Torchlight. Loved 'em all. Hell, I even like Diablo 3 (because I think its streamlined nature makes it an amazing local co-op console port, but I suppose that's besides the point). All of this taken into consideration, Grim Dawn, as an all-round experience, is better than some of the most prolific titles of the genre.\n\nTo start, it offers a wonderfully refined balance between the min-maxing ARGPs of old and the mash-to-win fair of today: the gameplay is modern(ish), character-building is back-to-formula without being too overbearing (respecs are cheap, and the dual-class system, in addition to being damned fun, provides a lot of versatility), and the questing is considerably deep for the genre (a blend of story missions, side quests, and bounties – there's always something to do). The game also adds Factions, which adds another layer of complexity – and a good amount of gear, at that.\n\nTo the benefit of its well-crafted content, level progression is such that you never find yourself grinding, and gear progression is perfectly consistent, even at later levels.  As a result, the game plays fluidly, offering us junkies a true-to-form “Wiki-this” experience whilst maintaining an almost action-adventure pace. This is in part due to the impressive amount of content, which keeps the game from ever feeling wanting for ideas / challenges. Like all ARPGs, the progression is certainly linear, but this game does a better job than most at making its limitations unnoticeable.\n\nMoving on to the artsy side of things, Grim Dawn looks pretty great. Others have likened the tone and art direction to Diablo (going to far as to label is a “true successor” to the series), but I think it's really carved a style of its own. Unlike other games, Grim Dawn never seems overtly “fantastic” - even as you're having your knee caps mauled by an outer-dimensional being (borrowed straight from the pages of Lovecraft, mind you). As a result, the early, critter-laden environments contrast brilliantly with some of the wierder sh*t down the line. This grounded atmosphere that allows the escalating doom-and-gloom to feel genuinely threatening, which is something I haven't felt since my first encounter with D2; however, unlike the Diablo series, I can't say the game ever felt “scary,” at any point. Dark, for sure, but never scary.\n\nAdding to the game's unique atmosphere, there is a clear effort invested in the environments (evidenced by the player's ability to rotate the camera 360 degrees – a rarely utilized but none the less cool and welcome feature). As a result, the environments never feel paint-by-numbers or overtly themed (looking at you, Torchlight 2). The only thing that I'm not terribly impressed with are the characters, themselves. Player models, as well as most other NPC humans in the game, just don't look that great. Passable, but not great. What's more, the gear, perhaps in keeping with the game's relatively down-to-earth aesthetic, just never pops or impresses the way it does in similar titles, and because of the necessary mish-mashing brought on by the dual-class system, there's never much visual differentiation between classes.\n\nI know that nobody really reads this crap beyond the “buy it” part, so I'll go ahead and close this off with the usual: 11/10, would die in aetherial fire again. But seriously, if you're a fan of the genre, this is worth a look, especially when it's on sale. It's business as usual, no doubt, but it does everything just a little bit better.\n\nStray observations:\n\nOther downsides? Maybe crafting. Crafting is always either a miserable grind (every title but Diablo 3) or an oft-disappointing time-sink (Diablo 3), but this game manages to make it altogether irrelevant, minus a few relics. Keep in mind, it isn't necessarily 'bad,' but it's the one thing that feels sort of phoned in.","January 14","true","113.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Allow me to give a brief history of the development team, which is comprised of seven developers and some of those developers are former Titan Quest employees.  Since we are on the subject of Titan Quest, please keep in mind that because you may have not liked Titan Quest, that does not mean that you will not like Grim Dawn.  Grim Dawn is not Titan Quest reskinned.  Repeat:  Grim Dawn is NOT Titan Quest reskinned.  It is a completely different action-RPG unlike Titan Quest.  The only similarity that they share is the fact that Grim Dawn runs on a heavily modified version of the Titan Quest engine.\n\nGrim Dawn captures the spirit of the setting with excellent mood, tone, and atmosphere. From the lush marshlands overcome by the walking dead, to the dark, damp caves of the lowering isle, accompanied by the tactful display of gore among the hollowing darkness, Grim dawn sets the mood and tone as you traverse through the hauntingly well-designed maps.\n\nThe themes of Grim Dawn consist of medieval and steam punk inspirations that lends to the game's attitude and style.  Whether you're a fan of Torchlight 2, or the fantasy-like Diablo series, you'll find a nice blend of attractive themes that cater to the action-RPG genre crowd.  Weapons and artilery like muskets to shields are within these premises and stick well to the underlying themes.\n\nGiven the chance, the player can dual wield a shield with a musket and cause mayhem while taking a physical beating by a horde of monsters using your shield.  The combat sticks to the same ARPG formula that we have grown to appreciate and love from the genre.  Why ruin an established formula that works?  Grim Dawn is just that.  It is not attempting to claim new innovations and ideas.  At its core, it sticks purely to the ARPG formula.  The player can invest points into attributes and skills as they rank up.  The skills is represented in a horizontal matrix intead of the typical "tree" design.  This allows you to really customize your character the way you want without making faltering mistakes, yet it allows you to adjust accordingly to your playstyle.  Didn't like the "firestrike" ability?  Invest horizontally in another branch of skills and don't waste any more of your points.  When you use an attribute or skill point, you have a chance to "undo points" before you finalize it.\n\nThe musical score in Grim Dawn is rhythmic and it underscores the layered aspects of the game in spectacular fashion.  Any composer and or musical artist that can utilize an electric guitar to capture the sense of dread on a soundtrack and quickly lift you up by giving the player hope in a frenzy of battles has my vote and wallet.  The soundtrack is beautiful and unlike anything I have heard of before in a video game.  Instead, it uses a nice blend of many instruments over the overly used "epic score" or immediate type of music that typically tries to replicate an adrenaline-like feeling.  The soundtrack is excellent.\n\nThe screenshots and video gameplay that have been released for Grim Dawn does not do it any justice.  The graphics and visuals are great.  With all of the video options turned up, you're getting a crisp-looking game with a rich amount of detail.  The video options consists of several high and very high settings (on maximum settings).  Based on this, you know that the developers are pushing the graphics as far as they could on this specific engine.  You won't be disappointed with the aesthethics, considering it was one of the aspects that I was little concerned about, although not the most important.  You can breathe easier knowing that the game looks really great on max settings.  There is are no concerns in this department.\n\nDespite being in Early Access, Grim Dawn has a ton of potential to become one of the best ARPGs around.  You can really tell that a lot of work, heart, and passion went into this game's development.  It truly shows in a product that is not even finished yet.  Imagine when it is complete.  I have played Diablo 3, Path of Exile, Torchlight 2 (which I think is the best ARPG to date as a finished product), and other action-RPG, dungeon crawlers and I honestly believe that Grim Dawn has the potential to best these video games in the genre.","June 29, 2014","true","14.2"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","3"

This game is a third person aerial view action game where the object is to save the town/world from a menacing invasion or two.\n\nLike mostly all games of this style, there are four flavours of bad guys; your peons, which are there to die in droves, your lieutenants which soak up some damage, but are otherwise disposable, heroes which usually soak a lot of damage and dish more out but not extremely so, and bosses which both deal out and take a tremendous beating.\n\nWhen you level, besides the attributes you can increase Mastery level or skills. You have a limited amount of points (255); you might hear people whine that “I need more points for this build”. Ignore them; just realize that there is a budget in this game for your points, and that you can’t always get what you want. But if you try sometime, you just might find you get what you need.\n\nOne thing I would like to point out if someone is interested in this game; there is no ‘right’ build nor is there a great need to find one. Certain skills are meant to work together with good synergy and you can choose a less-optimal skill selection, but if you want to play a certain style you can. For example, a ranged character is just as viable a character as a melee character. A ‘tank’ can play just as well as a ‘DPS’, if a bit slower at times (I’m assuming that you if know what a ‘tank’ is, you know this already).\n\nThere are also many builds out there, “perfect” builds where “this build absolutely needs these 7 purple items of lvl 75 to work”; ignore these people. If a build requires Nemesis to work, it’s not a build. What I would recommend is have an idea of what you’re looking for in a game (do you want ranged or melee? High armour or high deflection/maneuverability? Slime and snails or puppy dogs’ tails? Thunder or lightning?) Most classes can do most things well enough that in Normal/Veteran you won’t be that put off. By the time you hit Elite, either you know what works, you can find out what does, or you make a new char and try that; it’s all good.\n\nI have played multi-player with friends and I find that quite fun and highly recommend it if possible.\n\nPro’s:\n•	The ability to play how you want (within reason)\n•	Fast paced\n•	Lots of different bad-guy selection/abilities\n\nCon’s:\n•	In Elite/Ultimate, gear dependency increases and efficiency becomes more important\n•	Some skills are pointless (or ‘not as efficient’) to increase above one point\n•	Much higher requirements to get heavy armour than to get ‘magic’-type rings or amulets\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. It’s not perfect, and there are things that could be done better, but it’s a fun game to play and I enjoy my time playing it. The first act is very good for easing someone into the game. The classes are all quite different and all provide something fun and exciting to try.","May 9","true","305.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","0"

Just note that I play both games exclusively on hardcore.\n\nDiablo 3's fun is in the crazy power fantasy of sets and legendary powers. All of your time is spent at level cap maxing out gear and attempting that next Greater Rift. Unfortunately if you want to stay competitive you'll probably have to take a build from the internet.\n\nGrim Dawn's fun is all about figuring out a new build with each new character. I never felt the need to find a build online because the game isn't about pushing leaderboards. I feel that the game really rewards people who like to min/max but don't want to get all their builds from the internet.\n\nGrim Dawn really is a very different game from D3, but I enjoy both. Do you play a little D3 each season and get bored two weeks in? Afterward return to Grim Dawn for more build experiments and tinkering.

They didn't rush the development and didn't produce a turd (*cough* Unity and Arkahm Knight *cough*)  The class system is a ton of fun to just tinker with and, as many others have already said, doesn't leave you feeling crippled for choices you make.  Loot drops are satisfying on a whole, gear sets are out there to grind for, bosses to beat repeatedly, and new random "elites" pop up more and more in the regular world as you progress and "earn" faction hate from undead and others.

Yes. Yes it was. I thoroughly enjoyed my 80hrs romp through the grim gritty post apocalyptic hell that was Grim Dawn :D This was pretty much everything I ever wanted from an aRPG .. Loot. Loot. More Loot. Made by some of the same developers of the legendary Titan Quest, it's not hard to understand why they managed to get the formula down so well, making the experience a true joy to play through and not just an arduous, dull, slog. The visuals were nice, not exactly CryEngine levels of pretty but the art design and overall atmosphere was delicious, and the audio was really good too - though the VA was a bit hit and miss at times. Tons of quests, near infinite replayability due to the Bounty system, and with six classes that can be multiclasses to create more combinations, there's always something to play for. Everything that made Titan Quest great has been improved, in my opinion, most especially the overall feel and weight of combat.\n\nMy only serious laments would be the frankly appalling performance mid/late game, sadly caused by the aeons old engine being hamstrung with its legendarily bad multicore performance (100% on core0, 0-15% on cores 1-3) and a small dev team without the ability or resources to really pump into optimisation. My system is no slouch, being a 4Ghz i5 2500k and a GTX780, but the framerate dropped down to mid 20s during heavy combat and that is simply unacceptable. Sadly the Steam build also plays host to some nasty anti-piracy "triggers" that the devs put in, despite the fact that they're also releasing DRM-free builds on competing services.\n\nLastly, the ending, or lackthere of, as once you beat the final boss.. that's it. Nothing. You barely even get a single paragraph from a quest giver and... that's it. Such a huge letdown after an otherwise fantastic experience. It feels like the entirety of Act 4 was just slapped together too quickly, and finished even quicker.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who loves loot-focused aRPGs, such as Diablo, Torchlight or the predecessor; Titan Quest. Just don't go in expecting a world-class story or any real "ending", the obvious goal is the character building.","March 6","true","89.7"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","2"

These folks were part of the Titan Quest team, and I have to say this game eclipses that one. Titan Quest has a great setting, but even if you are a fan of classical Greece this game is better in every other way!\n\nEvery gripe I've had with almost every ARPG since Diablo 2 has been addressed, along with lots of wonderful and original innovations.\n\nIt still feels and plays just like most other ARPGs - you choose a class (or two), level up, loot, hack'n'slash (or cast) your way through several acts... yes, it all feels familiar, but in a pleasant way! Even the music is heavily reminiscent of the classic Diablo 2 score, which is some of my favourite game music of all time, but with its own weird west flavour. The world and its lore is lovingly crafted, with some wonderful twists on typical conventions. I'm having a real blast with my main character so far; she is basically a post apocalyptic sheriff with a brace of six shooters dealing out fiery death and lobbing canister bombs at the bad guys!\n\nConsidering this game is still technically early access (though content complete at time of review), I'd say it already hands down beats Diablo 3, Path Of Exile and every other ARPG I've tried in the past decade or two. Every time there's been an update, things just get better and better.\n\nIf you're a fan of the genre, this is truly a must-own!","January 11","true","74.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

Fighting mobs of leveled enemies along the way. And although this seems challenging. There are small areas of loot that you can uncover for a chance at decent equipment or weapons.  That I used to give to someone special.\nThe map is quite large, offering the player opportunity to explore an extremely dark and detailed world that I am positive the developers have put a great deal of effort in.\n\nThis game is challenging. To play it alone means dying a lot. It is still in development. So I don't even think the game has a system for calculating the number of players in each instance. It just places every enemy that the script has originally and expects you to slay them all, no questions asked. This can be very stressfull especially with boss battles. In my experience. Area of effect spells,  And someone playing the game more often than you really allows you to sweep up rooms or areas filled with mobs of enemies.\n\nI am really enjoying the soundtrack, class system, leveling system and skill system of this game.\n\nHowever This game is still in early access and has been for a year now. There are multiple glitches. Including new equipment not showing up on other players screens, as well as a somewhat broken rift travel system I didn't die as often.  and multiple CTD reports that I and other players I know have experienced.\n\nYet It still has a lot of potential\nPick it up when it's on sale.

Usually I play them for a few hours then get bored however I've played Grim Dawn for 44 hours and have owned it for about a week.\nIt has good graphics with a grim art-style with most dungeons being really dark.\nThe controls are good with bindable keys. You can also change your skills on the hotbar (mouse, 1 to 8 and then 9 & 0).\nThe character progression in the game in terms of points is skill points (your points for active skills or passives for your class (also this game lets you choose 2 classes for 1 character) and you gain 3 of these points every time you level up.\nThere are attribute points that you get from leveling up and you get 1 per time to go into either of the 3 primary stats; Physique, cunning or spirit.\nThe last is devotion points which you get from finding shrines in the world. To get the point you either need a certain item, activate it's trap (basically kill a few enemies and maybe a hero) or just get it anyway. These points go into the devotion tab that grants mostly small passives with some bigger ones and active skills.\nIn the world you find rift-gates which allow you to teleport there at any time, which are usually found in / near the cities or in some dungeons.\nYou've got the loot system that has an armour stat, and with how ocmmon they are (common, magic, legendary, epic, ect) which give extra and greater stats.\nThe game allows you to do the quests in basically any order you want and you're not required to do them at all, you could just find loot and kill things if you wanted to.\nThis game features multiplayer too. It's mostly a single player game but the multiplayer works really well and I play online most of the time I'm on.\nOverall I rate Grim Dawn 9/10.\nThere is also mod support coming out soon and there is at least 1 DLC expansion promised to be added.","April 18","true","49.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","2"

Don’t get me wrong I’m a huge fan of PoE and D3 but I feel GD has managed to plonk itself nicely in the middle.\n\nIt does still need quite a bit of work though, comparing a beta to two games released for several years is really unfair... so.. stick it on your wish list for now ;)\n\nfurther..\n\nThere are far more damage types and intricate bonuses than D3, which makes the itemisation really interesting, unlike d3 which is flat and over simplified. But its not over the top complex like PoE.. which after a while just becomes a real ball ache.\n\nThis translates into an overall more enjoyable experience for me, I really REALLY like the new introduction of more 'stats tabs' revealing more in-depth information, this allows a great overview of what exactly is going on with my build, offering the opportunity to have a good chew at the stats when I want to theory craft or min max, but is simple enough that I don’t have to think too hard about it when I just want to have fun.\n\nThe ability to modify EVERY ITEM with a whole range of things really is a breath of fresh air compared to D3's socketing system. The 'gems' in GrimDawn's case offer far more variance and innovation resulting in your character feeling like your own build and your own character and not just a copy/pasta of kripps currently build.\n\nUnlike gems in D3, the 'gem' can roll a wide range of random stats, meaning you still want to pick them up and collect them for future builds and they are also used as materials in crafting. In GD they aren’t really gems, they are more like bits and pieces of materials you find reflecting well the gritty 'salvaging' wasteland kind of feeling the game gives. Gems to me belong in a puzzle game not an aRPG.\n\nThe crafting is more complex than d3, but in an 'easier' way than poe, for lack of a better way of putting it. You don’t feel as if its absolutely necessary in order to enjoy the game but there is enough meat n two veg to satisfy anyone who needs breadth as well as depth.\n\nGraphically, I LOVE d3, while I do like a gritty envoiroment PoE was just.. I cant put my finger on it, but I really didn not enjoy its style it was trying to hard to be d2. I know PoE players will hate me for saying it, but I really didnt like it! sorry. GD is even more gritty but curiously more appealing to me. The envoirment is highly detailed compensating for the not so detailed player character models. which is fine considering the vast array of gear available. It doesnt have 'random' maps like d3 or poe, but I feel that it is better in the end, since random maps in d3 and poe.. well, they dont seem 'THAT' random and making them random is at the expense of an intricate, detailed envoiroment that a mapped out envoiroment can provide.\n\nit IS of course still beta so there are quite a few issues with polish, for me personally the graphics engine needs a lot of work in the optimisation department, which I'm sure will come. If I were to guess I'd say the game is about 60% done. It needs at least two more acts, another 30 or so levels, multi player functionality and.. I PREY it will have some on-line functionality. Titan Quest, which the game is based from, was easy to mod, hack n crack and couldn’t be used for ladders, race's or leagues.\n\nI suspect ladders and the like will never be seen in GD, which has its up sides and down sides I suppose. I would dearly love that feature, but in the absence of that second on my wish list would be an in-game version of the TQCollector mod. The amount of items in TQ was Vaaasstt! and I loved doing the collector thing. Much like I love collecting achievements (hint hint)\n\nHope this isn’t too long, I’ve been quite negative about GD in the past and I'm genuinely impressed with the progress so far.\n\nDefiantly one to keep your eye on!","June 12, 2014","true","231.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","1"

One of the best singleplayer experiences in a long time.\nI have hundreds of hours playing Diablo 2 and 3. And thousands of hours playing Path of Exile.\n\nGrim Dawn is so much better than Diablo 3 in every aspect. It looks awsome. The worldmap is huge and is so detailed and just looks hand-painted and very beautiful. I love the music. It has day and night cycles and a wheather-system. Effects are very beautiful and the artwork is dark and dirty and colors are so atmospheric. Grim Dawn lets Diablo 3 look like a game for 6years old.\n\nIt has a rotatable camera, thats not just a gimmick but really enhances combat and the quest for hidden boxes and stuff. The skill system is pretty deep. Not nearly as complex as in Path of Exile of course, but still quite versatile. Combat mechanics are very complex too, so is crafting. It has a fractions-system, lots of game-changing decisions to make, very high replay-value.\n\nI play it on hardcore-mode with perma-death and item-loss and its just as intense as in Path of Exile. As far as multiplayer is concerned, Grim Dawn doesnt have such a brilliant and outstanding ingame-economy like Path of Exile. But as a single-player experience its really hard to top.\n\nThis game is still in early access but runs really neat.

This is just as good as Titan Quest and possibly, Diablo II. If you like a true spiritual successor to the genre, this game is for you.\n\nPros:\n- Classic ARPG style; Choose a build you wanted to play and farm epic loot\n- Character progression freedom. You take control on how you want to build your character from attributes to skills\n- Wide variety of itemization keeps you hunting for more gear\n- Unique faction system offering rewards and access to faction-based gear depending on who you side on\n- Unique devotion system (skills/passives unlocked via constellations) adds flavor to existing builds\n- Smooth combat\n- Good graphics, dark and has real world-like art style\n- Great soundtrack matching each and every location's mood\n- Awesome story. the idea that you are not the sole savior of the world is refreshing\n- DRM free!!!\n\nCons:\n- Lack of skill animations due to outdated game engine (no jumping, no spinning, etc..)\n- Crafting system can be improved\n- Vendors seldom sell good items and often costs too much\n- No vanity/item enhancement system currently in place (transmog/enchantment)","December 14, 2015","true","447.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The spiritual successor to Titan Quest and what the Diablo series were modeled after, this game delivers.\n\nWith 6 classes to choose from and then the ability to dual class after hitting the 10th level, the options seem limitless.  The skills themselves with each class are well thought out and it hardly seems that one is better than the other.  At this point I don't think there is any 1 direction you "need" to spec yourself out because every skill seems equally viable.  Heck I found myself holding skill points because I simply did not know which way to go and ended up leveling 5 times before spending any!\n\nThe mood and atmosphere settings for each locations are wonderfully detailed.   The one complaint I may have is that in some areas it can become extremely dark even with lit torches around.\n\nThere are things that happen within the game that will make a profound impact to your game.  Rescuing a survivor from the area he may be at may not be the best idea...\n\nAlthough the main world you will be exploring are all pre-rendered maps, there are extra dungeons in which are special challenges that are all very much roguelike and different that require a special key to enter.  Trying to find these places are what makes the game that much  more fun to explore and check every nook and cranny for something cool.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find sooo much meat on this game to indulge myself with and even after several playthroughs with different combinations of classes, I still found myself having loads of fun.  This game is a must have!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/VenscQmUBVo","January 14","true","27.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

All the possible combinations of skills and gear make this a highly replayable action RPG even with its linear storyline. The way the monster levels are handled you can easily go back to previously visited areas to level up your character (I hesitate to use "grind" as it doesn't feel like that) without getting bored  because you're too overpowered, and they have thrown in a few optional elite areas which you can visit to really test your mettle (and build).\n\nFeedback from fans and players has resulted in tweaks here and there, especially when it comes to balancing the skills. There is some work needed in that department still, but nothing game-breaking, especially not if you're a pretty average ARPG player like me.\n\nThe classes are interesting and have varied skill sets. You can combine two or stay true to one for as long as you like. Thanks to the stash system you can easily transfer gear from one character to another, and you can augment your equipment so you have more control over how they function. Players of Titan Quest will of course be familiar with this (improved) system.\n\nYou will get more than expected for the Early Access price (and with 50% off it's a steal) and they are constantly improving and adding more content. An experienced development team I was more than happy to support on Kickstarter; a gamble which paid off in abundance and the game's not even released yet.","March 9, 2015","true","89.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

I will talk more of MODS later.\n\nThe game has one of the most immersive world creations in my humble opinion. The world you play in can more or less be compared to one of my other fav games "Borderlands 2". When you start out as a scrub of level 1 you can NOT choose any class. As soon as you level up (rather fast all things concidered) you may choose a class to play as.\nClasses included are Soldier / Demolist / Occulist / Shaman and so on.\nWhen you reach level 10 you can choose a second class and this is what makes the building so much fun. Each class has a masteriebar (up to level 50 per class) and a skill bar. If you put points into masteries you can unlock the end skill for each class.\n\nEnough of that technical babble (I will put links below so you can better understand what I am so badly explaining)\n\nWhen you first start a hero you will ALWAYS begin at normal difficulty or normal / veteran difficulty. The latter one gives more mobs and more XP and loot. I recommend using Normal / Veteran,\nWhen you finish the game on Normal you can unlock the Elite dificulty (for DD players, this is the Insane dificulty). When you finish Elite you will unlock Ultimate dificulty, this is the hardest dificulty the game has to offer (for DD players, this is NM Difficulty)\nThe higher the dificulty the more important the resistances will become (I wish you could put screenshots here). There are several that are incorperated here (Fire/Ice/Freeze/Slow/Poison/Aether/Chaos) and so on and on. you should strife for a resists of around 80 percent or above (if you can) for the most important ones.\n\nThis game is all about loot, there is a lot of loot, annoyingly so it seems when you first start the game. What is important to know is that in normal/veteran, the pieces you find, aren't that good. The good pieces start to drop around level 50 when you will also get your first legendary loot when you finish the game.\n\nYou can also craft materials to suplemnt your build, some may give you extra damage, or more resists or even extra skills that you put on your skillbar. This is an important part of your build. This game isn't easy for a scrub like me, my first hero that I created (demolist/shaman) has more than 300 deaths to his sorry ♥♥♥ name. I blame him and not me :)\n\nHere are some video's explaining the basics:\nBuilding a characterhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW-2NSK6q7s\n\nFlat damage and percent damagehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqQN-tgeCWk&list=PLZgbv9keJuEcOJTp6vrrgOJaWDUSwLeRV\n\nAttributes and Other Statshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JOIXNZSzcw&index=2&list=PLZgbv9keJuEcOJTp6vrrgOJaWDUSwLeRV\n\nReputation and Factionshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PowRmpOjHgo&index=3&list=PLZgbv9keJuEcOJTp6vrrgOJaWDUSwLeRV\n\nThere are more video's of this amazing you tuber, you can find them in his play list.\nDisclaimer → I am NOT the person talking in the video's because I suck :)\n\nMODS\nWith the latest update they introduced the ability to create mods, the workshop is NOT available, you must create a folder in the games directory (main) named "MODS" duh and put the mods in this directory. I will put a link to the website of crate below.\n\nAs of now the mods are pouring out and are very nice, I HIGHLY recommend Davoods DAIL mod because he incorperates all the best mods available (endless waves like in Diablo 3, new classes, higher masteriesbar up to level 100, and so on and on and on.\n\nWebsite of the cool guys of Crate.\n\nhttp://www.grimdawn.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=35\nThis is the link where you can download the mods, plain and simple.\n\nTo end the crappy wall of text I wish to thank the guys of Crate for creating this amazing game.","May 29","true","923.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

I can safely say this is what Diablo 3 should have been. The grim, hopeless atmosphere is back, the ugly aesthetically displeasing monsters are back, the loot that feels meaningful from level 1 to max level is back, and the absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing awesome music is back somehow.\n\nProbably my favorite thing Grim Dawn expanded upon from Diablo 2 is the classes. Each of the 5 (Soon to be 6 upon the full release) classes have clear cut specialties, but the big twist here is that you can combine two of any class together to help shape a specific type of build you have in mind. While you may feel encouraged to play a hybrid double-class character, it's entirely viable and possible to play a pure single class character. It's just really ♥♥♥♥ing great.\n\nIt's crazy, because the game isn't even finished at this point, and already it feels like it's had more thought and care put into it than the entirety of Diablo 3.","July 18, 2015","true","77.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

It was extremely good and there are so many different types of builds to choose from and it's fantastic!  There's a total of four ACT's to play through, 25 different builds to choose from and 4 different difficulty settings.  The first is Normal.  Then Normal Veteran.  Normal Veteran is Normal, but more monsters per group and more champion monsters show up too.  GREAT for getting those green and blue drops!  After beating the game on Normal, Elite opens up and upon beating Elite, Ultimate difficulty is available.\n\nIt took me 30ish hours to beat the game (all quests) on Veteran with a Conjurer pet build.  The current build for this game at the time of this writing is 29 and with this build the game is now content complete!  Build 30 is supposed to be the official release and will have achievements enabled along with bug fixes, balancing tweaks and Mod support!\n\nThe game has a lot of loot for all possible specs ranging from guns, melee, spells and pets.  After you log out of the game and then log back in all monsters, including bosses, respawn.  You can do boss and elite monsters runs all night long to farm specific gear of your choice.  Speaking of loot, while you're out and about killing monster after monster your bags are gonna get quite full.  You do have your own personal portal to fast travel back to town and sell off or store the gear you don't need.\n\nThere's also a lot of quests to do too!  Some quests allow you to gain stranded people out in the world to come back to the starter town and build it up with blacksmiths and more quests.  Blacksmiths can make you new gear for Iron (in game currency) and mats.  Mats (materials) are found from killing monsters and drop quite frequently.  Iron and mats can also be used to respec your character, but beware, respec is limited to skill & devotion points only and the price of Iron goes up with each respec.  You can not respec your mastery points (mastery is your class IE: soldier) or attribute points once distributed.\n\nEvery level you gain 3 points to put wherever you like until level 50 and after 50 you only gain 2 points.  With these points you can upgrade your class or start picking skills and/or upgrade them.  Once you put points into your Mastery you can not undo those, but if you pick skills for your mastery and decide later you would like to try different skills you can do so.  You also gain attribute points every level too.  These points are seperate from the 3 points you gain for your mastery or skills.  Attribute points are side points you can place onto your character in your character stats.  Once distributed you can not undo these.\n\nThere are tons of builds online to help you plan a build ahead of time so if you do mess up a build you won't have to start over.  The below link can help you plan out a class build:\n\nhttp://grimcalc.com/\n\nFinally, there are devotion points.  Devotion is fairly new and are bonus stats you can place on your character.  These stats include more damage done, resisting a certain damage type like poison and even new skills!  Devotion points are found throughout the world from shrines.  These shrines can be activated from mats or from fighting montsters.  Once Devotion points are placed you can respec them, but with cost of Iron and mats.\n\nThere are factions in the game too.  Factions will provide you with very good gear to choose from, but you'll need reputation from them for them to grant you said gear.  Rep can be farmed from killing monsters or doing bounties (quests) for them.  This gear is quite expensive and you will have to grind for Iron and rep for quite a while.  Factions also provide scrolls for the blacksmith too so he can learn more types of gear to make you.\n\nIf you're looking for an ARPG similar to Diable 2, Path of Exile or Torchlight this is the game for you.  There is a story and it's all in text format with no voice acting, but it's something.   Despite the minor flaws this game has it still runs very good and has plenty of hours of enjoyment.  Especially just playing around with all the different builds.  Recommended!","January 10","true","110.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","5"

And by this I mean the very specific isometric camera, third person, loot grind heaven that is my holy grail of games.  As it is right now, Grim Dawn is very high up on the list of my favorites of the genre.\n\nFighting feels wonderful, tactile and with the "oomph" you look for in a game like this.  It is also quick and fluid, unlike Path of Exiles (which was really my biggest gripe about that game).  The skills are all fun, and the leveling system and how you pick your skills is a great nod to customization, replayability and feeling like you have control over who your character is and how they play.\n\nI don't play these games for story and couldn't tell you much about this one, other than the atmosphere is dark and, well, grim.  There's a prison, and a warden (a staple of these games now?), and a bunch of dudes that want you to go kill things.\n\nCrafting is actually interesting, a sort of extra bonus to the loot dropping and helping you build your character with the bonuses and strengths (even some skills) you'd like.\n\nWish there was more to it, can't wait for updates.","November 2, 2014","true","13.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

It's still new, and not finished yet, there seems to still be a need for a little bit of balancing, but I still highly recommend this to everyone.\n\nWhat makes this game unique in my opinion is the Skill tree (or whatever you wanna call it) for example, my first character was a Shaman/Occult summoner.  He summons monsters to fight.  His talent trees support minions. Pretty simple.\n\nMy next few characters died, and finally I decided to play Standard instead of Hardcore difficulty, because I die alot.  My newest and favorite character so far is a Pyro/Arcanist.  At level 38, so far I only have Arcanist to support my massive mana needs.  He's basically a sniper, who wields fire magic as passive along with his sniping/blowing everything up ability.  For the skill tree, I made it so he generates whirlpools of death (25-30%) chance to proc just by attacking things.  Check that with the abovementioned blowing everything up ability, it's pretty damn fun.\n\nHe still dies sometimes.  I wouldn't suggest anyone to play hardcore difficulty at this time unless you have an extraordinary amount of patience, far more than me to occasionally charge in and die.  Cause you die really easy sometimes.  And sometimes there's no escape from a losing fight.\n\nDiablo II I loved it, but it's dated.  Right.  Diablo III I loved it too, but it was pretty simple and basic.  Path of Exile just kindof infuriates me, because it's not really a hard game, so I play hardcore difficulty on it, its fairly easy, until some random obsurdly hard creature kills you out of nowhere.  So I just can't get myself to play that anymore, the randomness is horrible.\n\nI have not yet played multiplayer on this game, but I want to.  The few times I've tried to with my hardcore characters I couldn't find any games.  Maybe standard difficulty will find some.\n\nSome of the things I said may seem like downers, but don't get me wrong:  I love this game.  I've only been playing it for a few weeks now and there's been big updates since I started, so they're coming in regularly and that's great.  There's voice acting for a lot of it now, even a cinematic sequence when you start the game.\n\nIt's worth the full $25.

For me, that makes it the best. The world, the monsters (fodder, elites, and bosses), and all the loot are made by a person. Sure there are some random elements, but nothing makes an ARPG more enjoyable than this hand-crafted feeling. Other games (read PoE, d3) are just painful by comparison cause you are trying to compare 2 items that have a bunch of random stats thrown together. You are just running maps looking for exits, killing elites without any care for what they are. In Grim Dawn, you get a much better feeling of progression and accomplishment.","September 7, 2014","true","744.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

The way the game has you roll your character is uniqe in the way that you don't choose your class when you make your character. Once you reach level 1, you are asked to choose one of five different classes to play, but thats not all. Upon hitting level 10 you are prompted yet again to pick a second class the merge with, but you do not have to pick this time if you dont want to. This leaves the game with 15 possible ways to play.\n\nThe current level cap on a character is 50 but that will most likely take you more than one sit down of the game to level. There is a slight lack of end game content however, at the moment there are only 2 end game dungeons which are quite dificult but can get somewhat repetative. these two dungeons are rouge-like however, which adds an aspect of caution as there isn't a real disadvantage to dying yet. (Rouge-like meaning once you die you have to start at the beginning)\n\nOver all, I recommend checking this game out and playing with friends always enhance your experiance. There is easily 100+ hours here for you, if you are in to these kinds of games.","August 21, 2015","true","138.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

Then you buy it, and then look at the clock and you just spent the last 14 hour straight playing? This is one of those games. That should sell you enough without even reading on.\n\nSo heres the obligatory pros and cons list\n\nPros:\n\n1. Graphics are very nice and detailed. Much detail went into a lot of the textures, and environmental effects to enhance the feeling of the zone you are in. Also the granularity and amount of settings to tweek would make any enthusiast gamer smile.\n2. Skills are almost ripped right out of titan quest. Mix and match up to two different skill trees to form your own classes!\n3. The current story is rather intriguing, and for a game genre not typically inundated with dialogue, it offers nice story depth, and "bioware-esque" branching diologue.\n4. The sounds and music are very well created to the atmospheres you travel around to.\n5. Closest thing I've ever come across to an open world ARPG. It gives a general direction to head in, and several winding paths and side dungeons to explore, making the map feel massive in scale.\n6. Fledgling ( Currently ) crafting system which uses upgrades as a currency for crafting multitudes of items. Very exciting to see where they take it from here.\n7. Offline and Online multiplayer, currently up to 4 players.\n8. Heres a unique one, The game doesnt treat you like a child, and hold your hand. It gives you the option for pop up tutorials if thats your thing, but after that, it doesnt spoonfeed you easy enemies and a straight path. It tends to let you wander and choose many different ways to get to your goal. Some more painful than others.\n9. The combat feels punchy and rewarding if you can get the hang of how the A.I. functions and your mastery of the controls.\n10. THE ABILITY TO MOVE YOUR CAMERA, and to zoom out. These simple buttons make all the world personally. You can view everything in any angle you choose!\n\nCons:\n1. The graphics / engine. The game is, albeit, an alpha, however it suffers from extreme frame dips, chops, stutters, and minor freezes. It is generally playable, yet sometimes it randomly dips to near unplayable frame rates for no apparent reason, causing many a player to drop their settings.\n2. The current amount of skill trees feel rather limited to the basics, and it feels rather cramped in comparison to Titan Quest.\n3. The multiplayer is glitchy, and crahses for reasons unknown more often then appreciated.\n4. Information on some quests and most items and crafting is very scarce due to the new-ness of the game, which sometimes causes confusion.\n5. No voice overs on the main bulk of dialogue causes a small feeling of disconnect from the story.\n\nIn summary, the game will steal many an hour from your spare time if you let it, and they are very well deserved and spent hours, based on the amount of money they are currently asking. The game is in no way finished yet, and there are extremely exciting features coming soon, such as Factions, and hopefully more crafting.","January 2, 2015","true","63.6"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

Now clocking 23.4 hours and counting!\n\nMy history with aRPG's are mostly on Diablo series. Starting from first. I loved Diablo3. Fast paced action with lots of balls in it, even though they made game more "dumb". Now Diablo 3 is pretty much dead, been craving for a good aRPG. Path of Exile for some reason doesn't fit my gameslist. Maybe cause it feels so slow and balless? Yes yes I know you can make many fancy builds etc etc.\n\nAnyway, I really recommend Grim Dawn to any aRPG fans around here. It's fast paced, it has very good leveling and even better gear system.

If killing hordes of monsters is a stress releaver for you, look no further. Grim Dawn has a dark story and rich lore, but lets be honest, you love loot. You will grind away (albeit a fun grind) and get all kinds of loot. The game has several classes that allow you create an aray of characters. I currently have a pure Nightblade, a pure Soldier and a Clint Eastwood type Gunslinger. They all feel different and they all kick butt. The game feels very polished for an early access game and the developers are good at keeping us updated. The skill tree is not overly complicated like (POE) and you can go to YouTube and follow guides if you can't decide. I highly recommend Grim Dawn to anyone that likes this genre.","June 6, 2015","true","952.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Now where the game unfortunately lacks is in combat, some skills being nothing more than basic attack modifiers some are still really really great feeling and there will be something to fit every playstyle. It also makes up for that with the best imo quest lines and stories coupled with glorious exploration which is what makes this game really really shine. i got 1k+ hours in d3, 5k+ in total on poe and i want grim dawn to be up there with d3 and poe in play hours cause it truly deserves it.

It uses a revamped version of the engine, the same dual class system and talent trees, and there is a lot of randomly generated loot for you to pry out of the cold dead hands of the (un)dead. The zombie apocalypse has broken out, and for some mysterious reason you did not turn into a zombie when you were supposed to. That makes you special, and thus the hero of the story :-)\n\nThe world is pretty grim, with a bit of a Victorian / Western feel to it. There's magic, there are guns, there's guys with hats, there are zombies, there are goblin-like monsters and lots of angry mutated wildlife. And then there is this cult of Ch'Thon mucking things up. Killing monsters feels satifying, and with a lot of different skills to choose from, you have plenty of viable character builds to try out. With the addition of the Devotion system in beta 29, you have even more options to customize your character as you progress through the game.\n\nThe faction system starts to develop once you have finished the first major story arc, and it is nice. Each character and monster in the game belongs to a faction. Factions have relationships with each other. If you kill enough Aetherials, they are going to dislike you more and more, to the point where they might start setting up ambushes and sending champion monsters after you. The reverse also works: if you manage to get a good reputation with a faction, you get access to more special items from their vendors, as well as a Bounty Quest table.\n\nAnother addition to the game over Titan Quest is crafting. You can create magical items appropriate for your level, as well as build some pretty cool Epic items, if you find the plans and obtain the neccessary crafting materials.\n\nI started playing in Beta 27, which added the Shaman class. It combines very nicely with the Occultist, because they both offer summonable pets. In previous betas I have tried other class combinations, which had a completely different playstyle. All of them were a lot of fun.\n\nBeta 28 and 29 added Act 4 to the game, so the storyline is now complete. Judging on my progress so far, the storyline is going to take about 30 hours to complete on a first playthrough.\n\nIf you want to see some gameplay, I have a let's play series going with my Conjurer (Shaman/Occultist) that started in beta 27, and played all through beta 28 and 29:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE3-ipIYpZY","November 9, 2015","true","120.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Crate Ent. is the newest TQ company that has old members of TQ company)\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nThis ARPG has a nice atmosphere, in the begining you are at a dark world but in Act 2 you are at a semi-bright world, I honestly think this game will be the most popular ARPG,why? beacuse its gonna have mod support,it(might) wont have problems in the launch.The game itself has a really wierd story and its grindy but for those who like grinding games they wont get bored easily.The Lengedary loot as i read is gonna be 1 per character but it might change beacuse the game is designed for level 200 so it might have like a low or medium chance to get lengedaries in level 60,75(Release level).This game features a dungeon where(im pretty sure) you wont get bored,that dungeon is challanging and has a good loot and as you go to many floors it gets harder, if you die you have to go to those floors all over again.\nThe game has even a hardcore mode if you really wanna loose all your stuff you can do that,I havent gone into hardcore mode but im 100% sure it wont give you any bonuses it will be just a challange.\n\nWhat I forgot to say is,the game is based on a apocalyptic dark world where there is only some surviours but some are enemies,and you can do some side quests with the enemies side also the max level for now is 35.","November 16, 2014","true","81.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

At the same time the game doesn't restrict you from changing your current build. For example, 8 hours in I respecced from building around two active abilities and fire and burn damage damage into two different active abilities and cold and lighting damage. I was having some trouble with certain situations and was finding my damage output lacking against bosses so I looked at what gear I had and what I could change around with my skill points and after a few iterations came with a mostly different build which performed better. The change felt organic. The game strikes a very good balance between giving players the freedom to change their current build and making them feel like the choices they made are meaningful.\n\nEverything about the game feels like it takes the better elements from its predecessors and organically combines them into something that has its own identity. The atmopsphere is gritty and dark like the Diablo series but with a futuristic twist as early forms of firearms and explosives are available. The dual mastery system from Titan Quest is back but the skill trees have more synergy within themselves and each other as the damage and damage bonuses in most abilities are split between two different types. But more importantly the game isn't afraid to add something new. The crafting system and the faction system along with quests that offer some meaningful choices are the big things that come to mind at this stage.\n\nThe game world feels much more alive and interesting than most other games. The dialogue is organic and appropriate to the situations. For example, at one point you may encounter a pair trying to scam some money off you and you can decide whether to respond with violence or allow them to join the community you're building up. If you choose the latter and talk to them later on they will express their gratitude for not killing them and how they probably had no chance in combat against you. They also share how they struggled to survive prior to the current encounter. Encounters like these make the player feel invested in the gameworld and builds up the atmosphere, soemthing a lot of modern games fail to do and instead rely on a few cinematics and a diary entry around every corner. While this game has the diary entries, they are well spaced out and actually anwser some of the burning questions the player might have about the gameworld so unlike many other games, I actually read most of them.\n\nAnother thing that adds to the atmosphere and to the experience as a whole is the dynamic weather system. It also acts as an important offset to the lack of randomly generated levels. I have no complaints about the level design itself but running through the same exact level tends to get old after a while and the dynamic weather spices things up a bit.\n\nAll in all this game is shaping up to be one of the best ARPG out there and thats bound to improve as development progresses.","November 1, 2014","true","208.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The gameplay is quick, fun and entertaining. The controls are quite responsive. The graphics are very decent. The music is fitting. The art style is nice and the game is up it's own butt with atmosphere. It's been a long time I had a game like Diablo or Dungeon Siege to keep me occupied, and now it's here.\n\nThe UI and the way the game is presented could be improved, however. Often times it seems the screen is cluttered with text, or my HUD is getting in the way. Other than that, this game is a real gem. Truly underrated as far as it being Early Access.\n\nI haven't tried the Multiplayer feature yet, so I won't say anything in that regard.\n\nThis is one of those games I wish more people would get involved in. I recommend it to all you dungeon crawler-loving gamers. Be prepared for fast-paced action and hordes of zombies, demons, beasts and bugs.

I've only encountered a couple bugs. Gameplay wise I find it just as fun - if not more-so - than Path of Exile (PoE). Both Grim Dawn and PoE borrow heavily from other games in terms of character progression. Grim Dawn from Titan Quest, and PoE from Final Fantasy 7 and 10.\n\nGrim Dawn isn't an always-online game like PoE however can be played multi-player online or locally. It also allows you to circle the camera around to get a full look at the environment, which Path doesn't. My main gripes with this game is its continued use of Diablo-style isometric gameplay (instead of straight 3D 3rd person action RPG), lack of multi-character control and unoriginality in terms of character progression.\n\nThat said isometric "Diablo-style" Action RPGs are still one of my favorite genres and it's way worth the buy, even in beta.","January 7, 2015","true","82.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Im blown away. Iv been looking for a new Diablo/Sacred/Titan Quest style game and this is it. Im shocked at how great this game is. This game has my vote.\n\nAmazing graphics\nAmazing classes and skills(has a great skill tree) as well as weapons and armor/items\nAmazing animations\nDark atmosphere\nLove the looting and leveling up\nAmazingly fun game play\nGreat music\nIt even has guns! And if you dont like using guns, then grab a sword, crossbow, shield, or whenever you like. It has it all !!!\n\nLove the classes and skills. I find all the skills for each class awesome. You know in like diablo 3 where most of the skills are lame and look lame with lame animations? Not this game. The classes are awesome with all good skill trees. Makes me wanna make every character. And if thats not enough then not only can you pick a class, you can choose 2 classes and be a hybrid(hybrid is optional). Ever seen a crazy armored demolisionist throwing bombs will shooting up everything around him + tanking all enemies? Its awesome. Again, you can choose to be hybrid or just stay one class, choice is up to you. And if you go one class and then later decide you want to be hybrid you can at anytime.\n\nThis game adds so much more to hack and slash style games. This game sets a record in my book. And just to think that the game is still in development makes it even better. This game accomplished what the others could not and it isnt even finished yet. Cant wait to see more content/updates.\n\nTheres ONLY ONE thing that I found to been an issue and thats optimization. The game runs a bit choppy. Running max setting at 60fps+ but its still choppin and skippin somtimes at 60fps. Its not that bad tho. I cant wait to see whats in the future. This game is worth every penny.\n\nGrim dawn is way better then Diablo 3. I loved Diablo 1, 2, and 3 as well as Titan Quest and Sacred Series. Heck I was still playing Diablo 2 with mods till I bought this. But Grim Dawn takes it to a whole new level. It takes all my favorite hack and slash Diablo/Sacred/Titan Quest style games and throws them into one creating the best H&S RPG I have ever played. You can't go wrong with Grim Dawn.

It blends the best parts of Diablo and Titan Quest and exceeds both of them, without doing anything amazing of its own right. It just delivers a fun experience and gives you an insight into what Diablo III could have been had it been done right (let’s not even talk about the DII Auction House at launch…).\n\nThis game has been a long time in the making and it shows. The worlds are large and open and yet you never feel lost. There is a ton of content to get through and yet you never feel forced to do it. Nice touches like the bounty system to increase faction rep and the portal system enhance and ease gameplay.\n\nThe character development is interesting, with the ability to dual class from level 10 (if you so desire) and choose a variety of options from each class. Along with a devotion system, which further opens up interesting class choices – this game just does it right.\n\nThrow in a very reasonable price tag and you should add this game to your collection today.\n\nThe Good:\nCharacter development\nHuge amount of content\nValue for money\n\nThe Bad:\nUI interface could look a little nicer\nAs with all ARPGs can feel like more of the same after a while\n\nThe Ugly:\nN/A\n\nOverall Score:\n8/10","January 4","true","91.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Skip to the end if you dont want.. information?\n\nGameplay 8/10 Existing out of:\n\nCombat 3/3\nTop-view action rpg. The combat reminds me most of Diablo 2.\nSimple mouse directed movement with really smoothely animated auto attacks and skill uses. The enemies arent usually AS big as the Diablo hordes, however certainly not as meager as the small groups of Torchlight either.\nMost enemies do have their own way of attacking and alot of them have skills of their own they will use meaning you will see a good amount of differentiation between even the same enemies when they have different skills/passives. Overall combat is done very well and a good amount of things feel like they do the punch they should (or shouldnt .. a 1handed gun for example feels like it might have hit or it might not have while raining down meteors certainly make the enemies turn to flying units :P)\n\nSetting 2/3\nComparing it to the other game that comes in mind ..Titan Quest (which was made in the same engine (ofcourse it has now been upgraded a good bit) and certain developers that worked on Titan Quest did work on this game) this is quite the difference.\nFrom Greek gods to a lovecraftian renaissance post-apocalyptic world of undead and monsters. Still i must say... it does fit. I do now and then get slightly tired when seeing another deserted wasteland of ♥♥♥♥ed over buildings and rocks, but it cant deny it does look nice nor can i deny that it is exactly how a world ravaged by monsters would look. Overall.. it does look nice, it fits the game like a glove.. and yeah. Interesting change :P\n\nSide Quests 1/2\nStoryline quests will be discussed soon but for now.. Side Quests. I always love doing every single quets in an entire game, but i will try to stay objective.. they couldnt have been more sidequesty. Some of them are actually interesting quests with a good amount of lore behind them, others are simply... find my dead wife and done.\n\nDifficulty 2/2\nTip 1: NEVER start any action-rpg on normal difficulty. You either start Grim Dawn on Veteran or you go away now :D\nSo yeah... sure, there probably are some lame boring tank paladin builds that breeze through Veteran without dying once and even with the squishiest class that would still be possible, but that depends more on the player than anything else.\nIf you make a mistake at the wrong moment, you are garanteed dead. You walk into a hallway without way out while an elite is chasing you... well. gj... you can retrieve the lost exp later :P Dont forget healing pots either because forgetting those can cause the same effect to happen.\nHowever you can always get into hardcore mode if you feel lik you prefer to have permadeath and loss of all items on death.\nOr delve into one of the harder difficulties once you finished the game on veteran difficulty.\n\n\nStory 7.5/10 I gave the story a 7.5 not because of the main storyline, but more due to the lore and stories you find yourself on the side or during sidequests. Main storyline is simplistic end-of-the-world monster take-over... its the fine details, side-stories and lore you find out during the questing that makes it interesting though.\nAlso, you get exp for using lorepages... isnt that a good way to get people to at least take a look for a second :D\nNot going to really spoil much in case ive missed some information myself or will have to end up changing the review because of false information due to me not having fully finished the game yet and thus might be wrong concerning certain storyaspects :D\n\n\nCharacter Customisation 9/10 Existing out of:\n\nSkill customisation 5/5\nThey used the same system as in Titan Quest and i still love it. It comes down to having to pick your first talenttree/class at the start and at level 10 you get to pick a second talenttree/class (any can be mixed with any) which leads to very interesting combinations of skills and passives. You could combine 2 pet-based classes, but why would that be fun? Why not have part of you summon pets and the other one USE A MASSIVE FLAMETROWER OF DEATH...\nAnd yeah, there are some really nice-looking skills and im quite sure there is a class they will like for anyone out there.\nOfcourse i must mention that they will eventually release expansions which will most likely include more classes to pick from.. or who knows.. maybe like Titan Quest eventually allow you to combine 3 classes :O\n\nAside from that there is the devotion system. Its a a simple system that allows you to get points for certain challenges and spend those in a starchart of heavenly signs to unlock alot of passives/buffs or even a few more skills to use.\n\nGear customisation 4/5\nYou have gear, you have alot of gear. You have normal gear, cool-looking gear, gear with really good passives on them and even gear that unlocks certain skills (feet that allow you to do a magical stomp) or passives (chest that allows for dualwielding of guns).\nI must say that at the start all gear looks a bit generic but ive heard at the end i all fits together way better. So yeah... just a really good amount of gear that does and feels alot different. Did i already tell you, you can upgrade it using gemstones that gives it even more passives but also can add skills given by that gemstone to be unlocked when placed on a gearpiece? Well.. now you know..\n\n\n+0.5 extra points for moddability of the game\nGeneral outcome of my review: Would recommend 8.5/10. Any action-rpg fan should try this as it is to solid to not be worth it\nCannot wait to fully complete the story, delve into some gearing and after that try every single other class myself :D And hopefully the next DLC might be out before i get done with that so that might even be more amazing ;D","February 26","true","235.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Grim dawn has stopped me from searching. I have had this game since very early access as the theme of the game caught my attention. I've gotten about 5 friends to purchase this game and multiplayer is very fun ( although a little buggy at times still much fun ). The developers usually keep you updated every couple of weeks so you know that more content will be coming as it goes and they have been very on the ball with this.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes it feels very fluid based on the class you create. Spells and abilities are well tuned and all work well together ( I mean if you multiclass you feel you can mix and match yourself well ).\n\nThey introduced a faction system which means you can be liked and hated by NPC parties in the game which can cause boss enemies to spawn or harder monsters. On the good side it allows you to purchase nice items from NPC vendors in towns based on the faction.\n\nThe story is also very well done and ive heard mixed reviews on the fact no NPC reads their text to you - but personally I kind of like that. As you play through youll find notes and scripts about the lore of the game which I also like it is almost like you add a journal of story as you play the game which in itself is a reward.\n\nAll in all I highly recommend grim dawn - theres at least 20 hours of gameplay and with all the muilticlassing you can do theres plenty more. Hidden areas and bosses are also out there.. happy hunting.\n\n","October 3, 2015","true","318.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Some or all of these things may bother you, I know that not all of them bother me.\n\nThe map is 95% the same every single game. The overall structure is exactly the same but they will put obstructions on random sections of path so that you can't always run the exact same path every single game. Along with this, I'm *pretty* certain that monster spawns are the same every game, with maybe hero/champion/unique spawns occurring in a semi-random fashion.\n\nMonster spawns are sometimes triggered by your walking over a, well, trigger point. These are usually only configured assuming you are coming from one direction. This means rather than spawning when you get close to a point, monsters will frequently end up spawning behind you if you like to explore 100% of a region. This feels really sloppy and gets tedious as it forces you to double back if you want to kill everything.\n\nMonsters scale to your level (with certain seeming minimum and maximum levels) and monsters that spawn as a result of certain actions (either map triggers or summons by other monsters) will spawn at different levels than the already present monsters. This can result in a monster multiple levels higher than you (I've seen ones up to ~10 levels higher than me) spawning things your level, or things way lower level than you (up to ~20 levels lower) spawning things at your level.\n\nWhile most of the skill points you spend can be unspent for an extremely reasonable amount, there are a relatively large number that can't be retrieved. You can get ~120 skill points currently, of which you may end up sinking 50-75 into places that you can't get them back from. When the level cap increases, I expect this to become less of an issue but currently it can lead to lots of regret.\n\nAt each level up you obtain 1 "stat point" to be spent on one of three stats. This might lead you (me) into believing this game was set up like Dungeon Siege to a certain point with full armor sets based on one or two of these stats. This would be a lie. Almost all armor ends up requiring a certain amount of physique (read: strength) and no other stats. Almost all rings/amulets end up needing a certain amount of spirit (read: int/wis) and I've never seen one rely on anything else. Some weapons require cunning (read: dex) or spirit, but most rely on physique. These stat points cannot be reallocated. Sadface.\n\nThis game is kind of oldschool in that the concept of utility skills/powers does not really exist. If you need healing, you will be expected to rely mainly on potions or out of combat things. If you want to move faster or drain health, that will mostly be due to your gear. From my observation, only the two melee trees (soldier/nightblade aka fighter/rogue) have things like this. As a result, almost all of the builds I see on here use one or both of these trees or try to avoid any situation in which they would take damage.\n\nI haven't tried it but don't feel like there is currently a viable "pet" class. The Occultist tree gives 2 pets, but you can only summon 1 copy of each (from what I've seen) which is pretty thin for a pet class.\n\nI think I've complained a lot and you're probably wondering why I've still given a positive review (if you're still reading). That would mostly be due to the potential for future development. Most/all of the things I've mentioned could be fixed with post-release player created workshop mods or by the dev team in a future Build.\n\nAs it stands, I believe the EA game is worth $10-15 to me, and that's what I paid at some point this was on sale. If you're hard up for a new Torchlight/Diablo/TQ/etc fix, this might be worth more to you. Asked right now, I don't think I'd pay $25.\n\nIf I really needed a fix though, I'd probably pay the $25.","April 29, 2015","true","222.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

No stat is a "dud" stat all have their advantages.\n\n- Extreme Build Diversity, 5 classes, each with 20 skills, 15 class combinations and hundreds of passives through the devotion tree. There are literally 100's of viable builds.\n\n- Fast Paced fun combat. I've been killing zombies for over 70 hours now and still enjoying every second!\n\n- Great Developer Team. Remember how blizzard would only update their game every 6 monhs? Crate's already about to release it's next major update after less than a month. Many free content patches expected in the future - and still waiting for survival mode.\n\n- Modding Tools. The community is going to create so many amazing mods that are truly going to push the limits of this game. Some people are still playing after 700 hours.\n\nCons:\n\n- Multiplayer needs work. At its current state Grim Dawn is a single player game. This game is very easy to hack which means things like trading / random queues are just not a good idea. No economy is kind of a good thing though, you have to find your own gear.\n\n- Lack of End Game content. Don't get me wrong, I've played 70 hours and I'm not even close to end game yet, my highest level is 58 (of 85). However I will reach the end game eventually and there are only basically 2 static dungeons to run (however 3 new ones are coming next update).\n\n- No Random Dungeons. Due to the engine there are no random dungeons in this game which means there will never be things like rifts (diablo 3) or maps (PoE) which means we totally rely on the community and developer for new dungeons - can't just generate them!\n\nThe Developers have laid down an excellent foundation, easily the best RPG system of any of the ARPG's out there. If they keep supporting the game with expansions, and supporting community creations, there is no reason this game will not surpass Diablo 3 and PoE as king of the Hack and Slash.","April 23","true","88.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Fitting that I've been playing this game lately.  I feel like I have my own grim dawn looming, as much as my character runs around killing a ridiculous amount of monsters attempting to fend off the Impending Apocalypse, or Certain Doom, or whatever the goal is here.  I'm not really sure.  Something bad is happening, and I've got to stop it.\n\nThe last time I was in the hospital they told me how fortunate it was for me that the cath team was already in the lab for someone else and I could get right in.  I saw them wheel that person out with a sheet over them, even though they tried to pull my gurney back so that I wouldn't.  Ah, stories to tell.\n\nThe story is always secondary though, and what really matters is progress.  Get better gear, learn new skills, get stronger, kill more monsters.  Which brings me to the only thing I do not like about Grim Dawn.  The monsters scale, so that even as I level up, so do they, which I feel loses a lot of the feeling of progress.  As I'm never shy to point out, I'm older than video games, and have always enjoyed the feeling of going back to an early area in a game just to get the satisfaction of seeing how much stronger I am than the enemies that I once struggled against.\n\nThat's just my opinion on scaling though, and there are certainly reasons for doing it, despite my feelings.  I guess enemy scaling is just like life though.  I'm going back to the hospital tomorrow, and just like Grim Dawn, I always get the feeling that no matter how much I think I've progressed, my disease has kept pace, and levelled up with me.\n\nThere are obviously way more things I like about this game though, as I am playing it, so let's look at those!  You've got a skill tree where you can multi-class that feels kind of like Rift, another constellation based set of skills that kind of feels like Path of Exile, though no one has such a huge tree as PoE, crafting that makes you hoard piles of strangely named objects, just in case you find you need them one day for a Thing You Want, enhancements for your gear that add new skills, whew, there is some depth to creating your character is what I'm saying.\n\nI guess if I had to sum it up in one word, I'd say Grim Dawn is a mix between Diablo (the good one), Path of Exile, and a pirated version of Photoshop that is somehow missing most of the color palette.  It's a great game to play while drinking gin, in order to avoid wondering just when you will get your well deserved Darwinian death.\n\nI know this is probably my worst review ever, but if you have managed to read this far I would like to say one thing.  Steam censoring would render it completely unreadable though, so I will say this instead.\n\nIf you smoke, you are stupid.  Very stupid.  I'm not putting you down, I have been that stupid for thirty five years.  I just hope you can understand that you are paying big companies to kill you.  If you could even feel how scary this is, and know that you did it to yourself, well, maybe you could keep playing cool games like Grim Dawn for a very long time.","March 31","true","167.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","2"

It has all the things that make a great hack and slash, and all of them done well.   The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is compelling.

Although only two acts are completed, I've created dozens of various characters trying to get a feel for where to spend my time (LOL - Thats already done !)  A fine game at $60.00 a steal and so worthwhile at anything less.  Please give this game a chance - if you like the genre then you will love this game and be supportorting an up and coming powerhouse of a game company.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteblade999/recommended/219990/","Whiteblade999","Amn Nom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteblade999/","322 products in account","I initially went into Grim Dawn with low expectations. Maybe it would be a dark fantasy Titan Quest at best. To say Grim Dawn surpassed my expectations would be selling the game short.\n\nCore gameplay is standard genre fare; grind enemies into a fine paste and collect items off of their dead bodies. The combat itself has a nice weight to it, my Blademaster felt like a whirlwind tearing through groups.\n\nProgression uses the dual skill tree system from Titan Quest. A first tree is picked at level 1, and then the second is picked at level 10. There is no restrictions on mixing trees, so a variety of different builds are available.\n\nSkills in the tree aren’t just selected, a player is given three points on level ups to use.  A player can either choose to level up masteries, which has skills at 5 point intervals, or one of the aforementioned skills. This system forces a player to choose between immediate returns of available skills or investing in mastery points to unlock stronger skills.\n\nIn practice the system mostly works, but can cause some pacing issues towards the end of a skill tree. Around Act 3 there was a huge difficulty jump, and the skill to finish my build felt like it required too much investment in masteries to unlock.\n\nItemization is average for this type of game. Most of the items are just straight stat boosts, but the character is given plenty of choices for damage. There are ten resistances available to the player and enemy. All of the resistances see use without one over shining the rest.\n\nIt is important to note that Legendaries are treated as end game build defining items. They start dropping at level 50, or around the end of the first difficulty.\n\nWhere Grim Dawn really sets itself apart from the genre is the story and atmosphere. The game starts out with a cutscene to give some exposition about aetherials invading the world. Then the player is dropped into a post-apocalyptic world.\n\nFrom here the player isn’t given much in the way of outright story. Instead hints are dropped about how exactly civilization collapsed, the history of the world, humanities place in the three way war that is being waged, and much more. The main plot is more or less the player trying to survive, eventually becoming a ‘hero’ because frankly the developers need a reason to explain why my Blademaster has killed 24,500 enemies.\n\nThe atmosphere is what brings everything together. From the get-go it is established that this is a terrible world. Other games have tried the dark fantasy thing, but often feel sterile despite there being blood and corpses everywhere.\n\nA set of notes that drop in an area tell a story. A family of four is fleeing the aetherial invasion and food is scarce, but there are rumors that the cultists who have risen up to fight the aetherial invasion will provide shelter to anyone willing to join. The family is forced to join the cult. In time the mother starts to buy into the ideology while the father just grits his teeth to make sure the children have food. The story ends with the women realizing that the family she joined the cult to protect would be safer as sacrifices to the blood god.\n\nAs mentioned before, the cult has risen up to fight the aetherials. Make no mistake, these cultists are no friends of anyone sane. The aetherials sole goal is to claim the world for themselves, enslaving humanity in the process. The remnants of an empire are caught in the middle trying to fend off both sides while reclaiming civilization.\n\nThis three-way war is illustrated in gameplay through encountering cultists and aetherials fighting each other. When the player engages one side, they will keep on fighting. At times they will side with each other to fight the player, but there has been times where they simply ignore the player and continue their assault, as if accepting the help.\n\nThe game is loaded with small scenarios that provide opportunities for choice and consequence. There was a man lying in the road bleeding out, and according to this man was betrayed by his partner. Either way he was dead and there was nothing I could do to help him. Except to honor his last request to track down his killer.\n\nI do so and the person begs me to let them explain what happened. He explains that the man lying in the road was indeed his partner, but he acted in self-defense to stop the ex-partner from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ his daughter. There is no other NPC in sight. What do I do? Is the daughter hiding or am I be being played a fool?\n\nThe attention to detail in all of these things give the world an authenticity that the genre hasn’t had in a long time. Since Diablo 2 in fact. Yes, it’s that good.\n\nThis isn’t the game for someone wanting a fun 1,000 hour min/max item grind; that is Diablo 3. This isn’t the game for someone wanting to replay the game 50 times trying out off the wall builds; that is Path of Exile. This is the game for someone who wants the fun gameplay of the genre with a well realized dark fantasy world.\n\nCrate Entertainment is a studio to watch. I know that I’ll be watching for the first Grim Dawn expansion.","March 18","true","32.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","1"

Plenty of good loot to sift through, but only a few epic drops so far, so it seems pretty balanced on that front. Can't wait to keep playing as they continue developing the game.

I personally like to rotate the camera and zoom in and out at certain points, you can do all this with your middle mouse button! The immersion you get from the world in which you are playing is brilliant and every detail has been added to really please the player. Even the World map is brilliantly detailed. This is more of a counter review against another i read with regards to the immersion and graphics. Sorry but NO. The immersion is awesome and the graphics are fine (i5 4690k, gtx 770 4gb) this game delivers in almost every aspect IMO.

I am not as much of a big fan of ARPG as before because I don't have much time in my hand as I used to, but this game already took from me more than 100 hours. It's not plenty, but it's enough for me to fall in love with this game, considering the fact that I played Titanquest for years.\n\nThe core of TQ remained, and got polished to a better level.

You will spend hours after hours slaying monster, getting loot, and min maxing with your gears to get a superman out of it, except there's no superman until much later. If Diablo focuses much on End-game, this game is all about progression. Every point of skill should be spent carefully, every point of attribute should be used wisely to make your character better. And your gear. There are some other features that are worth-mentioning such as: Reputation for factions (also this is very tendious, as in Wow, in a smaller scale), veteran for those who feel Normal is too easy and the upper difficulty is too hard, (kind of) intersting side areas and side quests. etc. The graphic is ok-ish, not too fancy but enough to keep you entertained for quite a long time, though the color tone seems a bit off (it's called Grim Dawn for a reason). In short, buy this, this is one of the most rewarding early-access I've ever purchased.\n\nPros:\n- Loot\n- Dual class\n- Character customization\n- Crafting system\n- Classic!\n\nCons:\n- Crafting system somtimes feels too confusing\n- Grind, grind, grind\n- Not up-to-date graphics\n- Multiplayer is still as bad as TQ","January 6","true","213.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Enjoy the world, the challenge, the story and all the other stuff. This game, even in its early access form, gives me exactly what  I want. The world seems interesting, the item embuing thing seems fun and the 2-way character build is something new. It is a bit of a Diablo, but in a good way. What I especially love is the difficulty level of battles already from the beginning. Unlike in many other games where you can simply run into any foe and click your way through, especially early game, Grim Dawn gives just enough for you to think when to rush in and when to actually kite around for a while. The game is by no means hard, but the difficulty level is just enough for me to feel engaged in battles. Especially against enemy heroes. This means I can actualyl enjoy the game casually all the way from the beginning - I don't have to rush and push my way through to end-game to have all the fun. I can have casual fun when getting to the end-game.\n\nOf course the game is not perfect. It is sometimes hard to target in battles due to environment and sometimes your surroundings might block your ranged attacks even when you don't see an obstacle between you and your target.

There honestly aren't that many bad reviews, which should be a good sign in the first place, but I will save you some time by summarizing what I found out looking through bad reviews, and debunking them, leaving you with no reason NOT to buy this game.\n\nFirst, people complain it's buggy or crashing -- Keep in mind It's early access.  That being said, it's the most stable early access game I've ever played.  I'd have to guess that the people complaining about crashes don't understand early access, or maybe played much earlier on.  I have had 1 or 2 issues in my 25 hours of playtime.\n\nSecond, people complain it's  not as good as Titan Quest, the story isn't up to snuff, etc... -- This isn't in -any- way a sequel or expansion to Titan Quest. Don't expect it to be something it isn't. Yes it has some of the same staff members who worked on Titan Quest working on this game, but that knowledge is used to understand that they know what they're doing with this type of game.  And if you read the news and updates, you'll see they're always expanding their team, getting veteran game designers/developers/artists to help with the lore, story, and artwork.  Again, it's still early access, and they're working on it.\n\nThird, people say "[insert dungeon crawling ARPG here] is better -- Bah, Fan boys!  I love this style of game, and played Diablo 2 so much my middle school AND high school grades suffered.  Diablo, Titan Quest, Torchlight, Path of Exile, the van helsing games... I've played them all and couldn't tell you why anyone would say any of them are better than this game (D2 excluded, cause, ya know... you can't beat that...).  And yes I've played D3 since it came out, since the expansion, and through seasons 1 and 3.  This game is more Diablo than Diablo 3.\n\nI'll admit, I bought it half off during the summer sale, but I loved it so much I bought a 2nd copy for a friend and he can't put it down either.  If I have any qualms about this game it's that it's only 4 player max, and the character customization (not to be confused with Class customization) is lacking. And by lacking, I mean non-existent beyond Male or Female.  But that's all bells and whistles, and it's not what makes this type of game fun.  Where the game earns respect is in the innovation and unique ideas they have come up with that make the game fun and interesting, while not impacting the traditional principles that make this type of game addicting and enjoyable.\n\nTL;DR\nHaters gonna hate.  This game's fun as hell!","June 29, 2015","true","81.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

So if you like Titan quest or even hack and slash game you will love this game. after 200+hr spent on the game i still see new stuff and love the game :D Crate Entertainment are doing a great job on the game with every patch they throw out. The patch come from 500mb to 1gb and there is alot of extra stuff to do with them. level cap atm is 50\n\nBut ofc with every good game there is a downside. The optimization on the game is bad, and you will prob get some frame drop in combat. but it's Early access game and Create will fix the optimization on release so dw to much about it :)\n\nPros and cons\nPros\n- Gameplay is allot like Titan quest, Same talent tree system with dual class\n- So much loot you will click your finger off looting it all\n- the game is long. 15-20hrs from start to finish\n- You can rotate camera "first arp i know of where you can do this"\n- Every zone feel like they belong there\n- Dual wield 1hand pistols :D\n\nCons\n- Early access can give some bugs ofc.

I am not as much of a big fan of ARPG as before because I don't have much time in my hand as I used to, but this game already took from me more than 100 hours. It's not plenty, but it's enough for me to fall in love with this game, considering the fact that I played Titanquest for years.\n\nThe core of TQ remained, and got polished to a better level. Dual-class, ridiculous physic (well, looking at those monsters flying always brings me joy), detailed, sophisticated, also confusing crafting system. You will spend hours after hours slaying monster, getting loot, and min maxing with your gears to get a superman out of it, except there's no superman until much later. If Diablo focuses much on End-game, this game is all about progression. Every point of skill should be spent carefully, every point of attribute should be used wisely to make your character better. And your gear. There are some other features that are worth-mentioning such as: Reputation for factions (also this is very tendious, as in Wow, in a smaller scale), veteran for those who feel Normal is too easy and the upper difficulty is too hard, (kind of) intersting side areas and side quests. etc. The graphic is ok-ish, not too fancy but enough to keep you entertained for quite a long time, though the color tone seems a bit off (it's called Grim Dawn for a reason). In short, buy this, this is one of the most rewarding early-access I've ever purchased.\n\nPros:\n- Loot\n- Dual class\n- Character customization\n- Crafting system\n- Classic!\n\nCons:\n- Crafting system somtimes feels too confusing\n- Grind, grind, grind\n- Not up-to-date graphics\n- Multiplayer is still as bad as TQ","January 6","true","213.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The new additions rewarding as well, well-tested, and rich. Every patch and update makes this game even more enjoyable, and that's a really rare thing nowadays.

Loving the Hardcore mode :)\n\nThis game is great, hands down. It works in the 'Diablo style' without feeling like a clone or a knock off. Let's face it, there are really two names right now when it comes to the Diablo-esque ARPGs - Path of Exile and Diablo 3 (all right, so Diablo 2 is still going, I know, but we're talking modern). I like this one because it manages to not feel like either of those titles.\n\n-The pacing is decent - I keep moving forward and it never really feels like I'm slowing down.\n\n-The loot system feels tight, I get upgrades at a fairly regular pace but you never seem to know when that awesome piece will be around the corner. The item upgrades that you find are also interesting and useful right off the bat. I never feel like I should hoard them because I'm always finding something new. I'm sure down the road there will be big bad endgame style pieces but for now it's managing to stay fun.\n\n-The class system. That's where this game really shines. I've been making new characters and playing them to level ten to experiment with the mix-n-match the game provides and so far it's been a positive experience. Things I wouldn't mind seeing in the future - a little more information regarding how certain classes synergize with eachother, what skills play well with others, etc. It's early on right now so I'm not as worried about it (and let's face it, theorycrafting is half the reason fansites exist) and I'm having fun with the experimentation.\n\n-No persistent online connection. I cannot stress how awesome this is. Will it lead to some cheating? Probably. Do I care about that when I just want to play by myself or with a few buddies? Not in the slightest. Considering that the place I live has terrible internet having a proper Single Player Mode is absolutely crucial, my ping time can get over 1000ms and I don't need to explain how quickly that will get you killed in D3 or PoE. With this game I don't have to worry about it, just fire it up and away I go.\n\nSo far so good guys. It's amazing to see what's been done (especially considering the age of the engine running underneath the hood) so far and I'm really looking forward to what the future holds.

It is first and foremost a single player game that happens to have multiplayer bolted-on! For those who say it runs poorly, perhaps your hardware isn't up to the task? There have been some issues (after all the game is in early access) but for me personally the game runs well. Worst of all are those who whine that the dev's 'nerfed my favourite skill and now I can't play the game anymore because it's not fun' or words to that effect. There's no pleasing some people! I have got over 380 hours in game and I am still having fun. I've played multiple builds using multiple different skills and long let this continue!\n\nI would certainly recommend this game.","February 6","true","475.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I have to say that Grim Dawn is the best ARPG I have played since that old classic Titan Quest Immortal Throne. It takes on the two class system that TQ had plus it adds another way to spec out your character with a Star Constellation map and as you find desecrated shrines and restore them you gain points you can use to fill out the various constellation adding further character customization.\n\nGrim Dawn to me is the ultimate single player ARPG that also has multiplayer co-op and PvP built in, in fact it reminds me of the good old days of that classic Diablo 2 which I had a TON of fun playing multiplayer back in the day. The developer has been very active in the Steam Forum for their game during Early Access and they have delivered 100% in all promises made to the contributors in the Kickstarter that began this project and through out Early Access. I consider Crate Entertainment to be one of my favorite developers in the game development business and I can't wait to see where Grim Dawn goes when they release the toolset so the modding community can begin to take this game in very interesting directions in the future.","February 25","true","160.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

Damn fun.\n\nThe main issue with Grim Dawn is that there are a lot of skills, and even more items. Which is both brilliant and horrible. It's brilliant when you can find the skill and item interaction that allows you to achieve that crazy combo, and the depth that this game has is astounding, but that's where things get difficult.\n\nUnless you've been playing traditional ARPG's since they came out, or can do complicated mathematics on the fly, there is an overload of information finding these combinations may take a while. Grim Dawn partially addresses this with separated character sheets and detailed information, while summarising it for newer players but with so many interactions it can be difficult for new players to understand what is useful and what is not.\n\nI always feel the need to plan out the character with a skill calculator, trying to figure out the optimal way to get the most damage out of it.

Everything you loved about Titan Quest Immortal Throne and more.  The TQ engine has been upgraded with some new tricks, and the new environments and maps are a delightful treat. The best part is the Steps of Torment dungeon which has you crafting a key to open a dungeon that has no access to portaling out, and the key is destroyed upon entry. If you die you have to start over after crafting the key. It adds dynamic challenges to the game. The is an early access game you can trust.

I'm not a big ARPG fan but I still manage to find this game really enjoyable. The game runs smooth and looks amazing on GTX 960.  The character customization allows you to create a build the best suits your playing style.  The only problem I've got  with Grim Dawn, is that it is a loot game. There is tons of loot to collect  and save for other characters but your limited on the storage space.

Created by some of the team that brought you the timeless classic Titan Quest, strap up and delve into Cairn - a world in a 'victorian-esque' era that is experiencing the eradication of the human race.\n\nAt this time, this game is still a work in progress but it shows a ton of promise. Grim Dawn lives up to its name and paints a canvas of a harsh world where good help is hard to find, suvival isn't always guarenteed and death lurks around every corner. Accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, I found this game sucked me into its world and I sunk tons of hours hacking and slashing my way to the finish of the current beta (Build 24).\n\nIf I had to compare it to other games of the genre, I'd say it has the grit and gore of Diablo 2/Path of Exile, mixed with the leveling system of Titan Quest and the fast combat of Torchlight 2. Grim Dawn introduces a variety of its own elements, such as the 'Constitution' health regeneration system, designed to reduce the number of trips to town and potions used so you spend more time in combat. The game also features a choice/consequence system where saving 'character A' means the death of 'character B' and a loss of trust from the faction character B is associated with. There is a ton of loot to reward you for your victories and a variety of options for crafting so customization is certainly an option for your gear.\n\nOutside of expected and respected bug fixes, I would like to see: more voice acting for NPCs, more animations for skills and enemies, and hopefully another class (currently there are 5).\n\nI highly recommend this game and I look forward to the completed product.

I'll be playing this for years. Most addictive stuff ever! No it doesn't have the nice animations and polish of Diablo 3, but every other system in the game is better than Diablo 3. And trust me, after 500 hours of Diablo 3, i know. I see some negative reviews expecting a Diablo 3 clone, please people, watch some playthroughs or reviews on youtube. This is more like an oldschool Arpg, Which doesn't mean it feels dated in any way.

I have a few complaints, but none substantial enough for me to even think about turning away from the game.

Created by some of the team that brought you the timeless classic Titan Quest, strap up and delve into Cairn - a world in a 'victorian-esque' era that is experiencing the eradication of the human race.\n\nAt this time, this game is still a work in progress but it shows a ton of promise. Grim Dawn lives up to its name and paints a canvas of a harsh world where good help is hard to find, suvival isn't always guarenteed and death lurks around every corner. Accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, I found this game sucked me into its world and I sunk tons of hours hacking and slashing my way to the finish of the current beta (Build 24).\n\nIf I had to compare it to other games of the genre, I'd say it has the grit and gore of Diablo 2/Path of Exile, mixed with the leveling system of Titan Quest and the fast combat of Torchlight 2. Grim Dawn introduces a variety of its own elements, such as the 'Constitution' health regeneration system, designed to reduce the number of trips to town and potions used so you spend more time in combat. The game also features a choice/consequence system where saving 'character A' means the death of 'character B' and a loss of trust from the faction character B is associated with. There is a ton of loot to reward you for your victories and a variety of options for crafting so customization is certainly an option for your gear.\n\nOutside of expected and respected bug fixes, I would like to see: more voice acting for NPCs, more animations for skills and enemies, and hopefully another class (currently there are 5).\n\nI highly recommend this game and I look forward to the completed product.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrytigerp/recommended/219990/","angrytigerp","Angrytiger [USN IRL]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrytigerp/","738 products in account","Titan Quest 2: Steampunk edition. No, this isn't a criticism, I loved TQ, and Grim Dawn lovingly thieves TQ's corpse of a lot of key gameplay elements (no surprise, as most of Crate Entertainment is made up of TQ's devs, if memory serves correctly)\n\nEquipment: Grim Dawn's gear consists of a typical loot-fests' prefixed and affixed "Ascended Warrior's [item] of Everlasting Pain and Death of the Fox"-type loot generation, with a fair smattering of weapon archetypes to choose from at the moment (swords, daggers, two-handers, rifles, pistols, crossbows, etc.) You can buy these super-overpriced from friendly merchants in town, or just kill special bosses or minibosses and get drops from them. Armor is spread about, consisting of a familiar spread -- helmet, torso, legs, feet, shoulders, gloves, and then slots for amulets, two rings, medals (like, military rewards, yeah), and relics. These last few are more specialized and, like most other H&Ss, are usually more utilitarian, offering not specific DPS or defense boosts, but general stat buffs.\n\nUpgrades: Gear can be 'gemmed' (Diablo 2 callback) in a sense. As you kill enemies, you'll collect fragments of upgrade items. Combine them (just smash them together in-inventory, no need for special NPCs or items) and you get the "completed" item. You can upgrade gear with this stuff at any point, complete or not, with completion usually maxing out the stat/effect bonus the item uses, in addition to adding an additional ability. Certain things will only fit into certain gear (upgrades increasing weapon damage can only fit into, well, weapons). And no, there's no slot-tracking to keep in mind, for better or for worse -- a completed upgrade piece is a big investment into a piece of gear you know you'll keep for a while (or maybe it's just an upgrade that you don't even really like).\n\nCrafting: This'll feel quite familiar to Diablo 3 players. You get a Blacksmith NPC after some time out in the field who will craft stuff for you. This can be randomly-rolled items, or it can be super-upgrades, combining several of the previously-mentioned upgrades into a single, more powerful item with different effects altogether. Most crafting costs one or several of a few unique crafting-only materials you find afield (Scrap, Aether Crystals, and Tainted Brain Matter, to name a few gooey examples). Crafting is also the only way to make Relics, which is an item for one of your fairly-numerous inventory slots.\n\nSkilltrees/Masteries: This is what I am very grateful that the TQ devs put into Grim Dawn. What set TQ, and by inheritance, Grim Dawn, apart was the way it handled skills. See, you don't say "I'm a Wizard!" when you start the game, and only ever learn magic spells. What happens is, the first time you level up, you choose your skilltree. Right now, there's:\n-- Soldiers (lots of general self-buffs and damaging abilities, not flashy but strong)\n-- Occultists (Summoner-type character, can have a variety of pets or a single strong one, depending how you build it, and with debuffs to cast on enemies and a handful of offensive spells)\n-- Demolitionists (the ranged class, intended to use guns as there's skills that specifically focus on their use. Has a bunch of 'gadgets' that can supplement DPS, like grenades, traps, etc.)\n-- Nightblade (the rogue class, lots of movement/positioning skills, with focus on critical hits and powerful damage buffs)\n-- Arcanist (the caster, has a range of offensive and defensive spells from single-target to AoEs).\n-- Shaman (sort of like a spellsword, if that spellsword used a two-handed weapon. Skills are much along the path of the Diablo 2 Necromancer's totems.)\n\nThe coolest part is that, at level 10, you choose a SECOND Mastery, if you so choose. Or, you can refrain from doing so, and simply keep pouring points into your first Mastery. This is a good idea sometimes, as GD also has a very strong focus on synergizing skills -- rather than just give you a billion abilities, you only get a handful per Mastery. But as you level up the Mastery, you unlock new skills that branch off of each ability's "tree", adding additional effects. You can pour points into this new effect for better stats on that effect... OR you can put points into the initial skill.\n\nSay you have a magic missile ability, for example. You put a single point into it to unlock it. If you put more points into it, it increases damage of type A. But, if you put points into a skill down the tree, you might unlock an explosion effect that deals damage over time of type B! So you could feasibly just unlock a skill for use, then never touch the initial skill again, if later branches in the tree have effects you prefer.\n\nInstant warp-to-town: Hardly bears mentioning, as it is more or less standard for H&Ss nowadays, but yeah. Free travel back to town at any time without needing to carry around town portal scrolls.\n\nNOT from TQ, but instead new to GD: you can unlock new areas by collecting enough Scrap (one of those crafting mats, you may recall) and iron bits (the "gold" of this world) and building a bridge. In some cases, this can speed up forward progression... or you can go in a completely different direction from where the game seems to be railroading you. A very nifty way to make you feel a bit less like you're just moving in a straight line through the game.\nOne thing I do find kind of lackluster is building your character outside of skill choices. Character stat-building is more or less dependent on Mastery Selection, as points into the Mastery (which counts as a skill point use, so keep track) will not only unlock new skills, but give you general stat increases relevant to the Mastery (big "Physique" stat increase for Soldier, "Cunning" for Demolitionist, "Spirit" for Arcanist, etc., and a smaller amount of a mixture of the other stats). These are the three stats you can really directly affect, actually. Each is a catch-all for a variety of engine numbers (Physique is Health, Defense value, etc.; Cunning affects chance-to-hit and chance-to-be-hit; Spirit affects your Mana/Energy, damage of spells, etc.) Beyond Mastery skill points, you get precisely ONE (1) choice of stat to increase, from those three, per level. It's a moderate increase, to be sure (like 5 or 6 points), and yes, it's meant to supplement the Mastery's auto-assignment (which is 9 times out of 10 an accurate representation of the stats you usually need for that Mastery to shine), but for some it might feel like it's railroading players a bit too strongly.\n\nIf you liked TQ, this game is a no-brainer -- It's TQ2, or might as well be. If you're a general H&S RPG fan (liked Torchlight 1 and/or 2, Diablo 1, 2, or 3, Path of Exile, Dungeon Siege 1 or 2, Sacred 1 or 2, etc. etc.), you might want to look through the gameplay videos and see if you might be interested. Otherwise... well, you kind of HAVE to be used to the genre to really 'get' the appeal of this game. If clicking on loot pinatas until they die and mashing Alt to see what they dropped isn't appealing to you, you're probably better off skipping over this one.","March 10, 2015","true","25.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

In other words they lack servers that diablo 2 had in order to host events like ladders etc... A great thing I loved about arpgs was collecting rare loot and trading it for other currency (for instance runes diablo etc.) (path of exile orbs)  or other gear during competitive ladders. I think at one point they discussed the potenial to have their own servers but the cost would be too high as of now. They would need to see how well the game goes over when it's actually released before they can jump the gun on that. Basically finding rare loot isn't as rewarding since people can alter their save files and get whatever gear they desire. If you don't care about online that's great or closed servers that's also fine.\n\nI really enjoyed most of the classes but occultist was extremely bland for me. This game has good things about it and bad things. The bad consists of horrible particles, animations and spell effects for abilities. You don't feel powerful with some of the abilities just due to how it looks visually. Some of the builds disappoint me there isn't much of a variety and some skills feel out of place. I was also full of extreme sads when I learned there was no dedicated healer with utility like in Titan quest. I expect the game to get better with time especially when it's released and when expansions come around.

If you said yes buy this immediately. I have 60 hours in as of this review and that is having only made a single character. I took my first character to the current level cap of 40 and am currently at act 3 chapter 1 the end of the content so far. I have already gotten my moneys worth at this point as far as I am concerned. I can hardly imagine what the entire game will be like let alone any future dlc or sequels. By the time I finish my first charcter to the end of the full content I will have no less than 80 to 100 hours I bet.

I was, and remain, a huge fan of Titan Quest - but this is the first time I've resonated and connected so strongly with an ARPG since Diablo II. It's an immediate love connection, and when I'm not playing it I can't stop thinking about it. The story and world feel rich and interesting, and I actually find myself listening to and reading the quest and lore texts (an unusual feat for an ARPG, and something I felt was lacking in TQ). The gameplay is fast, addictive, intense, and deeply rewarding. The power curve is fast and satisfying. The classes are diverse and exciting, and so far I haven't invested in a skill that felt disappointing or boring.\n\nThis game is obviously crafted with love and skill, and if you (like me) wondered what could have been if the team behind Titan Quest had gotten another shot to build on what they had learned and created before, this game will be a very fulfilling and nostalgic and wonderful experience, and well worth the modest asking price.\n\nNote for veterans of the genre: the default difficulty option is a bit on the easy side, but turning it up to "veteran" offers a good challenge, and the screen being constantly filled with enemies and explosions and sparks and blood and loot will do plenty to scratch the itch you've been feeling since you finally ran out of loot to grind in Diablo II.\n\n","February 27","true","40.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Just like PoE, this game makes Diablo III look like a game made for simple-minded children. This game has everything Diablo III lacked: Better story,  with a grim setting and atmosphere  that successfully convey a sense of danger and despair. Unchained character development with many options for how to develop your character. Nuance in NPC interactions where making the wrong decision can result in you killing someone who you could have saved.\n\nAs this game nears completion, I consider it a perfect arpg with no real flaws. Every aspect of the game is well-developed and it is truly fun to play. The depth of character development is impressive, as you can improve your character's stats, pick two classes to specialize in, enhance your abilities by restoring corrupted shrines and investing devotion points in a Constellation system, craft/find a wide array of weapon enhancements and even find relics that give you special abilities like dual-wielding ranged weapons. If you like arpgs with dark stories that don't treat you like an imbecile, this is as good as it gets.","February 8","true","447.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I grew up playing PS2 hack and slash game's like Champion's of norath, when I saw the screen shots for this game I just knew I would love it. What I didn't know was that I would play this game as much as I have. I play by myself, however there is a healthy online community of players who always have servers up for you to join.\n\nThe gear in this game is creative and beautiful. There are many item set's that link together and give you additional stats or ability's. Most bosses have healthy drop rates. (This was a problem I ran into with titan quest)\n\nWhen you play on harder difficulty's the game drops gear more frequently, When you get to higher levels like 50+ the game will start dropping legendary gear & Empowered lower level gear to match your current level. Empowered gear is gear you get at say level 15 or 30, with triple its original stats so you can use it at level 58 or 65.\n\nThe game also features a meal system that gives you a translucent health bar that refill's your current health bar when combat end's its very useful and is a nice feature on the harder difficulties.\n\nAs far as the class system goes its just like titans quest, you choose the Soldier tree and say the Nightblade tree and your class becomes a Blademaster. You can mix all the classes like this and make many different characters.\n\nThere is so much more to talk about, I would recommend this game to any Action RPG gamer.\n\nThank you crate for this amazing game, whenever I felt like something needed to be changed or added into the game it's like you read my mind and changed or added that feature. Crate you have made a masterpiece with this game and I cannot wait to see what y'all do next.","February 27","true","718.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

It runs more than adequately.  It runs almost as well as Titan Quest, so far.  Like Titan Quest it slows a tad when you near flames and a little bit more when you view through multiple levels of transparencies (such as looking thru tree limbs, walls, and other objects to see behind them), that's about it.\n\nThe atmosphere is great, sort of a mix of Diablo 1 and 2 meets Path of Exile.  All of the great features of the Titan Quest Series' features are there, such as innumerable stats so you always know what is going on under the hood, to good art direction, and the ability to choose 2 classes if you want a hybrid character.\n\nAll I can tell you is that if it runs on my rig, chances are it will run on your rig, laptop or not, provided you choose the right options.  The main purpose for this review is to get out the word that it does run ok on such a set-up.\n\nIf you enjoyed Titan Quest and Immortal Throne, or you really long for a quality, good looking update to Diablo 1 and 2, with new lore to explore, but that same feeling of slightly claustrophobic dread, this looks like a winner.  So far, I enjoy the beginning more than Titan Quest/Immortal Throne.  The way the factions and various magic systems are divided, also seems to allow for better balancing while meshing perfectly with the new lore of this game, which is new to my experience.  It makes it enjoyable to explore and simply to experience the game.   There are numerous new features beyond TQ/IT as well.\n\nI'll play more to see if I run into any issues.  I turned the shadows off mainly to avoid slight polygon effects showing up under shadow calculation (after a while some shadows looked like flashing black triangles), and to pick up a couple frames a second.  Turning off post processing didn't hurt the look at all, but picked up a several frames a second also.    At the settings I described above, with Details at Medium, and the rest not just mentioned at low, it looks just like the quality of Titan Quest at high.\n\nThat's a good sign.  It is 1-16-2016.  I got the game on sale for about $15.  This is SO FAR exactly what I wanted.  I'll update the review when I have put a good 40 + hours in.\n\nEDIT IN DETAILING BEST GRAPHIC OPTIONS:\n\nFor playing Grim Dawn on the Intel HD 2500 I also recommend keeping:\n-- Anti-Aliasing Off (not needed at these resolutions and can slow fps down),\n-- Anisotropic Filtering Off (tends to cause slight lag at least on Titan Quest/Immortal Throne in certain situations, and on isometric games tends to just increase the detail clarity of textures very near to you unless you put it very high, and tends to act on lighting and shadows causing more lag, but try AF at 2x or 4x and see if it is ok for you).\n-- I'll try 1360x768, and some other resolutions next, but the reason I used 1024x768 is because I knew from previous experience that this gave the best responsiveness on TQ/IT with some good lighting and mild shadows, rest on high).  You may be able to do about as well at 1280x720 or 1360x768, worth trying.  For me my custom colors and set-up work only at 1024x768 and 1360x768, so those are the key options I try first, works on most games for Intel HD 2500 GPU (with very rare exceptions).\n-- Although Triple Buffering did smooth out the movement a touch entering in and out of transparencies, movement of the character became a bit unwieldy with lots of enemies and transparency effects while in buildings so ... my guess is that it overwhelmed the GPU at that point past the ability to smooth, as it tried to keep up with the 3 frames ahead stored in the buffer.  It never helped much with a slow GPU in TQ/IT either.  If you have a fast GPU, that may be another story.)\n\nEDIT IN #2 :\n\n-- I tried a bit 1360x786.  As with Titan Quest, it can be done, but it is a bit laggy on the Intel HD 2500, so for me it is not quite worth it.  The 1280x resolutions usually will run a bit bigger, but on my system they will not be full screen within a window, that is with black bars, which I prefer for a higher concentration of pixels per inch at a resolution.  Also my colors don't look as good as the custom settings don't really stick to it.  They are worth a try if you like and use often those resolutions.  On many games 1280x720 will run about the same as 1024x768, it might be close also in this game, but no guarantees.\n\nI continue to enjoy the game immensely for its atmosphere.\n\nOne thing some of you may find interesting -- at the moment there are some furniture which do not highlight and are destructible.  Occasionally these are shelves or slightly different looking cabinets.  Although they do not highlight under the mouse cursor, on rare occasions they can provide look and rarely some very good loot.  It is not a bad idea to try destroying any furniture around you.  It will all refresh anyway on the next restart of the game, as the map seems to reset in that way, along with the usual restock of enemies when you restart/reload a game from the main menu.","January 16","true","30.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

There are so many things that I can say about this game.\n\n1. Devotion points are just great. - Adding points give you celestial powers which can even make your build more effective and powerful the way you want it to be. Devotion skill tree is huge and has a variety of stats you can add for your character.\n\n2. The components are just similar to how Titan Quest was. - This game is just like Titan Quest but very unique and awesome. You just can't imagine the similarities between Grim Dawn and Titan Quest on how the components were in that game.\n\n3. Relics remind me of Titan Quest. - Do you remember the day when you were playing Titan Quest and saw how runes gave off skills and stats well now that Grim Dawn has that content to this game it is so fun.\n\n4. Out of all, Grim Dawn is still a pre-released game that will be released in February but when it get released, I just can't wait for it to be released since the game is content complete but the game might still add more content and you may never know there might be exciting stuff in the game that might surprise you.\n\nWell good luck to you people who are new to this game and haven't played ARPG games like Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, Diablo III before and I really recommend this game since it's so fun and yet so exciting and interesting in some way. :)\n\nContinuing on with the good things I'd said about this game, I'd love to tell you about the Arcanist, Demolitionist, and Nightblade.\n\n1. Arcanist - This class uses PURE Spirit for stats. Uses one - handed weapons such as wands, swords, daggers, or maces. Known as the "manifestation of magic." Uses Elemental Damage. Ues Fire, Physical, Cold, and Lightning Damage. Has an advantage of long - range attacks. Uses long range skills such as "Fanetti's Replicating Missile, "Trozan's Sky Shard", "Albrecht's Aether Ray", and "Devastation. The "Fanetti's Replicating Missile" is basically the default skill for the Arcanist that can split into fragments which will eventually increase as you level it up. Also it comes with modifiers that will enhance this skill. The "Trozan's Sky Shard" is basically a large meteorite that can kill groups of enemies. I would really recommend using this skill too since it has a modifier that can Freeze Targets and enable you to have the advantage of killing enemies long range. I'd also say this would work with bosses too but not all of them. The "Albrecht's Aether Ray" is basically an aether laser or beam that you can contiually hold to instantly kill enemies over time. The only thing the Arcanist would suffer from is the Energy per Second that this skill uses. So I'd recommend using an component called Ectoplasm which gives you more Energy, and Energy per Second that will reduce the amount of Energy you use for your skills. Lastly, the "Devastation" is one of the ultimate skills of the Arcanist that will cost a tremendous amount of Energy to use. So use it wisely. This skill is basically raining embers of "raw pure energy" that will rain down on multiple enemies making them take Aether Damage. I'd really recommend going for Aether Damage, Elemental Damage, and Elemental Resistance for this class since this class is really focused on all the elements. The only thing that the Arcanist suffers from is HP. So I'd also recommend picking another class to get the passives and auras from to support the Arcanist and make your life so much easier when it comes to HP and losing HP causing the Arcanist to die so quickly. So far this is what I know about Arcanist and what it uses for advantage, and the types of skills it uses.\n\n2. Demolitionist - Hell yeah, this class is my favorite. This class uses Physique and Cunning. There are items and runes that has a passive that grants the ability to duel wield one - handed guns at the same time. Now, this is what I call a freaking Gunslinger. Phew, phew, phew! Lul. The default skill of this class is the Fire Strike and it does Fire Damage, and Burn Damage Over Time to a single enemy. The awesome thing about this skill is that it has 4 modifiers. 4 Freaking Modifers! Yeah, thats right. Well as you can see the 4 modifers are "Explosive Strike", "Searing Strike", "Static Strike", and "Brimstone." I know the first three sound all similar but they pretty much fairly give different bonuses. The first modifer "Explosive Strike" gives bonuses to Fire Damage, a Meter Radius so it can damage multiple enemies, and especially more Burn Damage over Time. So pretty much Hellfire on all the enemies that are suffering and your like "Burn baby burn, yeah yeah yeah!" Well yeah, once I see multiple enemies getting burned that's what it reminds of. Lol. Alright the second modifier "Searing Strike" only works on a melee or two - handed ranged weapon. This modifier grants tremendous bonus to Total Damage, Crit Damage, and Skill Cost. At level 1, "Searing Strike" grants +15% Total Damage, +25% Crit Damage, and -33% Skill Cost. I just find this so overpowered that you can literally level up this modifier even more to see the true power of it. Good luck to people who use two - handed ranged weapons or melee weapons who are looking forward to using this modifier. The third modifier "Static Strike" says it all. This modifier has a Chance of Knockdown Target, Additional Lightning Damage, and Chance of Dealing Lightning Damage. This is pretty much pyrotechnic. You see what I did there huh. Wink, wink. Alright, the fourth most overpowered modifier of Fire Strike is Brimstone. This is pretty much an occult power. Man, Demolitionist you didn't have to steal the occult's power didn't you? This modifier grants Fire Strike the ability to split into 3 Fragments, Additional Fire Damage, and also Chaos Damage. Wow, look at all those bonuses you can receive if you literally add these modifiers to Fire Strike. This is why I use Fire Strike and this is why I'm in love with Demolitionist. So far this is what I pretty much know about Demolitinist and I just wish there would be more skills to be added for this class so people can eventually create unique builds that will inspire them and show how enjoyable this game can be.\n\n3. Nightblade - The freaking assassin. This class has a skill called Dual Blades that grants you the ability to dual wield one - handed melee weapons at the same time. The awesome thing about this skill is that it has 5 modifiers. Wow, 5 modifiers! I didn't really expect that much! So these 5 modifiers are called "Belgothian's Shears", "Nidalla's Hidden Hand", "Amarasta's Quick Cut", "Whirling Death", and "Execution. The first modifier "Belgothian's Shears basically has a chance to be activated while using your default weapon attack. Just remember to use the default weapon attack with the one that has the sword to see this in action. This skill basically does a 165 Degree Arc which basically spins, Hits Up to 3 Targets, Additionial Pierce Damage, Stun a Target, Additional Poison Damage, and Weapon Damage. It's so much bonuses that I find it so overpowered for a default attack to activate this while killing enemies. The second modifier "Nidalla's Hidden Hand" is very different to the first modifier. It basically doesn't proc or have a chance to be activated but it modifies these three modifiers "Belgothian's Shears", "Amarasta's Quick Cut", and "Whirling Death." What the heck? A modifier within a modifier? Where did that come from. Well as you can see this is what the modifier does. Sooo, well that's my point. So this modifier grants Acid Damage, Poison Damage over time, and a chance of Slowing Target. Wow, how Deadly can this be. I guess that was very punny of me to say deadly when it relates to toxic, poison, or any deadly green substance.\n\nWell now that I've reached the writing limit, this is what I love and know about the game Grim Dawn so far. Awesome job on the game though and keep up the great work! :}","December 31, 2015","true","142.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The fact the devs were fearless and allow the player to create totally unworkable, useless builds provides half the joy of learning and discovery. It's very possible your first couple of chars will be completely underpowered, so you go back and make use of the generous re-spec options to shuffle some skill points around and try again. By the time you've gotten a couple chars under your belt you'll begin to learn what works, what synergizes where, and you're off to the races.\n\nThe mobs are mostly typical hack and slash fare, nicely animated, and the loot drops in massive piles like it should. Which brings me to the only minor complaint I'd level right now. NEED MOAR STORAGE! You can eventually buy what looks like four large bank tabs shareable among your various chars, but there are SO MANY crafting materials and tempting drops that they fill up very rapidly\n\nOverall, great game, more than worth full price.

But that's the beauty of Grim Dawn - it's just a Diablo 2 clone. It's easy to pick up and play for a bit.\n\nThere's nothing more to say. NOTHING. It's got some neat customization stuff - you like, build your own class? It's weird. But very very awesome. Similar to PoE, but not even close to the same thing. It's great.\n\nThe music is fantastic for those who are fans of Diablo 1 and 2's moody, grim soundtracks. No other hack-n-slash has ever come close to that. So this is just fantastic. In general, enemy design seems much closer to Diablo, also. Zombies, weird leaping critters, slithering serpent dudes - they all fit in. Character design, I don't know. Not perfect, but good enough. But unlike the Torchlight series, design isn't all over the place. It's not a very cartoony looking game. And this is a big plus in my opinion.\n\nGame's about $5 over what I'd pay for this, if I'm honest. The game feels really quite polished, which is surprising for 2016, sadly. I don't really think the screenshots do the game many favours. In general, I like the graphics (blood textures need some work). If things are low-poly, they're doing a good job of disguising this with relatively high quality textures across the board. This is a game that was made for PC, and feels like it.\n\nGame's worth a buy, if you're looking for yet another hack-n-slash. This one does it well, which is surprising considering how many I've turned down. Loki, Torchlight, Diablo III I've still played for a whole bunch of hours, got several heroes geared, and most max level, and I am still not really sure if it was really all that good...\n\nGrim dawn feels good. It's fun to kill stuff. Good, crunchy sound effects make beating enemies to a pulp extremely satisfying. Which is fantastic.\n\nI don't really know how to end this review, but basically, game's great.

There are so many things that I can say about this game.\n\n1. Devotion points are just great. - Adding points give you celestial powers which can even make your build more effective and powerful the way you want it to be. Devotion skill tree is huge and has a variety of stats you can add for your character.\n\n2. The components are just similar to how Titan Quest was. - This game is just like Titan Quest but very unique and awesome. You just can't imagine the similarities between Grim Dawn and Titan Quest on how the components were in that game.\n\n3. Relics remind me of Titan Quest. - Do you remember the day when you were playing Titan Quest and saw how runes gave off skills and stats well now that Grim Dawn has that content to this game it is so fun.\n\n4. Out of all, Grim Dawn is still a pre-released game that will be released in February but when it get released, I just can't wait for it to be released since the game is content complete but the game might still add more content and you may never know there might be exciting stuff in the game that might surprise you.\n\nWell good luck to you people who are new to this game and haven't played ARPG games like Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, Diablo III before and I really recommend this game since it's so fun and yet so exciting and interesting in some way. :)\n\nContinuing on with the good things I'd said about this game, I'd love to tell you about the Arcanist, Demolitionist, and Nightblade.\n\n1. Arcanist - This class uses PURE Spirit for stats. Uses one - handed weapons such as wands, swords, daggers, or maces. Known as the "manifestation of magic." Uses Elemental Damage. Ues Fire, Physical, Cold, and Lightning Damage. Has an advantage of long - range attacks. Uses long range skills such as "Fanetti's Replicating Missile, "Trozan's Sky Shard", "Albrecht's Aether Ray", and "Devastation. The "Fanetti's Replicating Missile" is basically the default skill for the Arcanist that can split into fragments which will eventually increase as you level it up. Also it comes with modifiers that will enhance this skill. The "Trozan's Sky Shard" is basically a large meteorite that can kill groups of enemies. I would really recommend using this skill too since it has a modifier that can Freeze Targets and enable you to have the advantage of killing enemies long range. I'd also say this would work with bosses too but not all of them. The "Albrecht's Aether Ray" is basically an aether laser or beam that you can contiually hold to instantly kill enemies over time. The only thing the Arcanist would suffer from is the Energy per Second that this skill uses. So I'd recommend using an component called Ectoplasm which gives you more Energy, and Energy per Second that will reduce the amount of Energy you use for your skills. Lastly, the "Devastation" is one of the ultimate skills of the Arcanist that will cost a tremendous amount of Energy to use. So use it wisely. This skill is basically raining embers of "raw pure energy" that will rain down on multiple enemies making them take Aether Damage. I'd really recommend going for Aether Damage, Elemental Damage, and Elemental Resistance for this class since this class is really focused on all the elements. The only thing that the Arcanist suffers from is HP. So I'd also recommend picking another class to get the passives and auras from to support the Arcanist and make your life so much easier when it comes to HP and losing HP causing the Arcanist to die so quickly. So far this is what I know about Arcanist and what it uses for advantage, and the types of skills it uses.\n\n2. Demolitionist - Hell yeah, this class is my favorite. This class uses Physique and Cunning. There are items and runes that has a passive that grants the ability to duel wield one - handed guns at the same time. Now, this is what I call a freaking Gunslinger. Phew, phew, phew! Lul. The default skill of this class is the Fire Strike and it does Fire Damage, and Burn Damage Over Time to a single enemy. The awesome thing about this skill is that it has 4 modifiers. 4 Freaking Modifers! Yeah, thats right. Well as you can see the 4 modifers are "Explosive Strike", "Searing Strike", "Static Strike", and "Brimstone." I know the first three sound all similar but they pretty much fairly give different bonuses. The first modifer "Explosive Strike" gives bonuses to Fire Damage, a Meter Radius so it can damage multiple enemies, and especially more Burn Damage over Time. So pretty much Hellfire on all the enemies that are suffering and your like "Burn baby burn, yeah yeah yeah!" Well yeah, once I see multiple enemies getting burned that's what it reminds of. Lol. Alright the second modifier "Searing Strike" only works on a melee or two - handed ranged weapon. This modifier grants tremendous bonus to Total Damage, Crit Damage, and Skill Cost. At level 1, "Searing Strike" grants +15% Total Damage, +25% Crit Damage, and -33% Skill Cost. I just find this so overpowered that you can literally level up this modifier even more to see the true power of it. Good luck to people who use two - handed ranged weapons or melee weapons who are looking forward to using this modifier. The third modifier "Static Strike" says it all. This modifier has a Chance of Knockdown Target, Additional Lightning Damage, and Chance of Dealing Lightning Damage. This is pretty much pyrotechnic. You see what I did there huh. Wink, wink. Alright, the fourth most overpowered modifier of Fire Strike is Brimstone. This is pretty much an occult power. Man, Demolitionist you didn't have to steal the occult's power didn't you? This modifier grants Fire Strike the ability to split into 3 Fragments, Additional Fire Damage, and also Chaos Damage. Wow, look at all those bonuses you can receive if you literally add these modifiers to Fire Strike. This is why I use Fire Strike and this is why I'm in love with Demolitionist. So far this is what I pretty much know about Demolitinist and I just wish there would be more skills to be added for this class so people can eventually create unique builds that will inspire them and show how enjoyable this game can be.\n\n3. Nightblade - The freaking assassin. This class has a skill called Dual Blades that grants you the ability to dual wield one - handed melee weapons at the same time. The awesome thing about this skill is that it has 5 modifiers. Wow, 5 modifiers! I didn't really expect that much! So these 5 modifiers are called "Belgothian's Shears", "Nidalla's Hidden Hand", "Amarasta's Quick Cut", "Whirling Death", and "Execution. The first modifier "Belgothian's Shears basically has a chance to be activated while using your default weapon attack. Just remember to use the default weapon attack with the one that has the sword to see this in action. This skill basically does a 165 Degree Arc which basically spins, Hits Up to 3 Targets, Additionial Pierce Damage, Stun a Target, Additional Poison Damage, and Weapon Damage. It's so much bonuses that I find it so overpowered for a default attack to activate this while killing enemies. The second modifier "Nidalla's Hidden Hand" is very different to the first modifier. It basically doesn't proc or have a chance to be activated but it modifies these three modifiers "Belgothian's Shears", "Amarasta's Quick Cut", and "Whirling Death." What the heck? A modifier within a modifier? Where did that come from. Well as you can see this is what the modifier does. Sooo, well that's my point. So this modifier grants Acid Damage, Poison Damage over time, and a chance of Slowing Target. Wow, how Deadly can this be. I guess that was very punny of me to say deadly when it relates to toxic, poison, or any deadly green substance.\n\nWell now that I've reached the writing limit, this is what I love and know about the game Grim Dawn so far. Awesome job on the game though and keep up the great work! :}","December 31, 2015","true","142.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/219990/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","Grim Dawn has plenty of content for those that decide to stick with it all the way through and decide to go even further with additional difficulties or try other classes and class combinations. One thorough playthrough on Veteran (Enhanced Normal) took me around 39 hours with a mix of single player and co-op. The hours per dollars spent ratio is fairly high; however, the experience isn’t problem free. The game performs well on everything maxed and only dropped frames when too many effects were going off. So turn down some of those settings if you’re using a weaker rig and planning to have some co-op fun.\n\nStory/Atmosphere\nUnsurprisingly, the world in Grim Dawn is grim. Humanity is struggling to survive amidst the warring factions all vying for control of the world. The quests aren’t revolutionary, but what kept me interested was the world building aspect. Journal entries waiting to be discovered are scattered all across the land. Some of them are very well written and have tones that range from sad to gross to horrifying. Other entries will give you some history or act as a bit of flavor. The game uses darker shades of color and litters the world with rotting dead bodies, ancient dungeons, mines, and many enemies to slaughter. The game is separated into four acts that all have a distinct visual style and map layouts. Some layouts were better than others and didn’t make you walk around too many blocked paths. I felt much more invested in the world than Diablo 3’s (I disliked most of D3’s story) and grew to dislike one of the factions in GD because of how gross they were with human lives. Let’s not forget that this game is an ARPG and the story isn’t the main focus. So let’s move on to the gameplay.\n\nGameplay\nThis game has a slow beginning pace in regard to acquiring skills. This pacing can become even slower if you decide to take on two classes because for the first 50 levels, you’ll be making hard decisions on what skills you want to give your 3 skill points. You can stick to one class and be a purist which lets you specialize and access the later skills much faster, but I prefer mixing things up. To access later skills you have to put points into a mastery bar to unlock them. This means dual classing can put you at a disadvantage if you don’t have a good plan in mind because specializing with your damage abilities far outweighs having a bunch of weak ones. Many abilities can have passives that enhance it even more, which makes specializing very potent. To err with skill point allocation is human, but the game is very forgiving with skill point refunds except for masteries. It starts out fairly cheap and slowly increases in price the more you use it, but I’ve used it for over 120+ skill points without destroying my wallet.\n\nGrim Dawn also has a Devotion system which reminds me of Path of Exile’s giant passive tree, but smaller. The Devotion system is made of many constellations which mostly provide passive bonuses and some on-chance abilities which can result in meteor showers, whirlpools, a shield, and more. You must find and cleanse shrines out in the world to earn Devotion points and most of them are out of the way or hidden. Every completed constellation provides affinity for unlocking more powerful constellations which makes things complicated. Planning will be required here since refunding skill points is more difficult. You’ll need Aether Crystals (a material) and iron bits (the currency) for each point.\n\nFor my main character, I went with a Druid (Shaman + Arcanist) that heavily used the refund system to create a fun character that could handle the challenges of the game set to Veteran. My character underwent some drastic changes as she went from a melee focused lightning Shaman with a pet and some Arcanist abilities to a cold/lightning Arcanist that later added two aether/fire skills found deep within the tree. I mainly used Olexra’s Flash Freeze, a damaging AoE freeze attack; a Lightning Nova from an Amber gem; and Trozan’s Sky Shard, basically 3 ice meteors. I greatly enjoyed freezing all the enemies on the screen and then following up with the other two spells. Eventually, I picked up Aether Ray for that single target beam of death feeling and Devastation to complete my AoE build. The spells and skills are satisfying and impactful once you have your arsenal together. Some of them send the enemies flying. You should definitely use the refund system to maximize your character’s potential.\n\nThe game has crafting and it’s the kind of crafting where you make one item that’s then needed for another, more powerful item. Example, 3-4 pieces make 1 complete ingredient. Item A, B, and C each require four different complete ingredients. Item Q requires A, B, and C. This kind of progression is tied to crafting materials and Relics. It also lets you try and roll rare gear if you have the Scrap, but I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re trying to replace very low level gear. You can farm materials off of specific monsters, including bosses. To repopulate a world, you’ll need to exit to the main menu and then start the game again which goes by quickly for my system, but still isn’t fun to do. The crafting system requires enough farming to the point of multiple restarts or playthroughs in order to make the more interesting items. In my case, I couldn’t make a Relic I strongly desired because I didn’t find the right blueprint drop for one of the ingredients over my 70+ hours on that single character which made me sigh repeatedly. Still does. I had all the other pieces that went through the process.\n\nFinally, there’s a reputation system in play. Enemy factions will grow stronger as you kill more of them which results in better drops. Allied factions will offer more items from their faction merchants. They carry good equipment and make sure you stay appropriately geared if the drops were not in your favor. You can do bounties for a faction to increase your reputation with them, complete relevant quest, or kill the monster types they dislike. Bounties are vaguely described kill quests and not very interesting.\n\nCoop Experience\nGrim Dawn has functional p2p online co-op which works out pretty well for the most part. You’ll never have to worry about servers shutting down or server maintenance, but at the same time, you better make sure all players involved have some decent connections since one of you will be the host. The only disruptive things I’ve noticed were some rare desync issues where you can lose track of the other player’s true position (summons will follow the real deal) and some dead monsters/enemies that stayed behind in odd positions, their bodies normally decay to nothingness. Some player abilities will synergize well together. In my case, I used my max level Olexra’s Flash Freeze to reduce the enemies’ fire resistance by 106% which greatly benefited my co-op partner who dealt 80-90% fire damage.\n-\nGrim Dawn is a fairly good ARPG that should keep you entertained for many hours. For me, it has a low replay value. It’s a game that I might check on every now and then. I do have an interest in seeing what future mods might be able to accomplish once the tools are ready since the other ARPGs I play are online only. You can also use a trainer with GD with no issues online or offline. Should you decide to give this game a chance, I’ll point out two useful resources for beginning players: http://www.grimdawn.com/game.php which is a game guide and http://grimcalc.com/ for skill tree planning.","April 1","true","76.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Gasping, the resident\nleader-of-the-resistance shoots the rope twice and\nfrees you. The newly-updated intro cutscene shifts\naway to the main game, and the familiar, isometric\n2D camera welcomes you into the hellish world of\nCairn, where Fallout meets a frontiersman-like\nChristian dark age.\n\nGRIM DAWN.\n\n"What's going on now, Starboy?" Summer-Rain asks,\nunsure of the foreboding atmosphere of overturned,\nburning carts, ruined towns and mutilated corpses\nand livestock. The living dead stalk the streets and\ncountryside, and strange, otherworldly crystals have\nsprouted along the landscape, corrupting everything.\n\n"I have to make my way to Homestead, help the folk\nholed up in prison with resupplying their food source."\nSummer-Rain smiles, before asking if Achilles can help\nyou with your quest at the Homestead.\n\n"Ha-ha, Summer, very funny...!" You manage a wry\nsmile, before you cross a Reanimator's path, a giant,\nhulking undead monstrosity with aetherium crystals\nsprouting from its back, summoning lesser undead to\nfight you. "What's the story behind those crystals?"\nSummer-Rain asks, putting a tub of vanilla ice cream\nin between her crossed legs as she watches you fight\nthe reanimator. Clicking furiously in this Diablo-like\ngame that makes Diablo III look apalling, you wonder\nhow a team of less than ten people did so well a job\ncompared to a game where dozens of people worked\non and took years to complete in the case of Diablo.\n\n\nYou glance at her before doing a double-take, with\nSummer-Rain oblivious to the suggestive pose she is\nin, with vanilla ice cream, no less. You explain while\nfighting throughout the countryside that the green\ncrystals; Aetherium, were artificially made and is the\nreason why the Grim Dawn event happened.\n\nBefore the world of Cairn changed, it was similar to\nbeing a mix of the American Colonies and\nsemi-industrial England. But after the Grim Dawn,\nwith magic commonplace, two otherworldly powers\ncame and fought among themselves over the world-\nthe Aetherials, who possessed physical vessels and\nsaw Humans as both fuel and food, and the\nChthonians, enemies of the Aetherials who required\npain and blood sacrifices to bind themselves to\nmortals to grant them aid or power.\n\nSummer-Rain tilts her head with the spoon in her\nmouth, a weird look on her face before she removes\nthe spoon for another scoop of vanilla. "Doesn't\nseem like a good deal for any of us humans. The\nAetherials wanna eat us and the Chthonians want to\nuse us, even though they hate the Aetherials." By\nthis time, you have fought your way to Homestead\nand helped their Quartermaster with an insect\ninfestation, and now the human remnants of an\nEmpire want to enlist an external faction to combat\nthe otherworldly menace.\n\nYou walk towards the Homestead's central area amid\nBlack Legion guards, garrisoned in Homestead for\nprotection of both the farmers and for the Legion's\nown, the last bastion of sanity in a world gone mad,\nmiles from the Prison-Fortress you called your new\nhome since beginning the game.\n\n"Who are these two?!" Summer-Rain exclaims, two\ncharacters now flanking you, one in dark robes and\ncloth mask, arcane runes upon his garb, while the\nother is clothed in white with gold armor, orange\nand red accents decorating his patterns of fire and\nthe sun. "I have to choose now, the faction which\nwill assist me in my quest to free Cairn from these\nmonsters."\n\nSummer-Rain is excited now. "Burn them! Burn the\nundead influence from Cairn!" She yells, but you\nalready wanted to play with the Order of Death's\nVigil, the necromancers who have a noble outlook\non undeath, but are reviled by the rival faction\nKymon's Chosen, a group dedicated to a Sun God\nwhom the Necromancers view as a false messiah.\n\n"HOW COULD YOU?!?!" Summer-Rain exclaims,\nincredulous after picking your faction to progress\nthe story. "They're religious fanatics, Summer!"\nYou try to argue your case, but Summer-Rain is\nnot hearing any of it. "You're using necromancy!\nThe very powers you're trying to destroy! You're\na hypocrite, Starboy Coldheart!" She sticks her\ntongue out at you while moving towards the door.\n\n"Where are you going?!" You ask, not knowing\nwhat to do now, what with receiving orders to\ngo to the super-secret hideout of the Order of\nDeath's Vigil and Summer-Rain about to walk out\nof your room. She looks down at you in a strange,\nhalf-pout.\n\n"I'm going to get my laptop and play Grim Dawn\non my own. I'm going to join Kymon's Chosen and\nburn the corruption of the undead, the Aetherials,\nthe Chthonians- and you- from Cairn." Your jaw\ndrops as Summer-Rain opens your door and\nflashes you her signature smile.\n\n"I Love you... Starboy Coldheart!"\n\nA week later, the warrior priestess of Kymon's\nChosen, Summer-Rain; faces off against an\noccultist of the Order of Death's Vigil in the most\nstrangely unbalanced multiplayer host game in\nan isometric ARPG.\n\nAll because she wanted to burn undead for the\nglory of a false Sun God rather than use them to\ncombat other undead alongside her boyfriend.\n\nGRIM DAWN.\n\n","April 3","true","42.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","11","16","3","1"

I bet you do now! :)\n\nThis is a fantastic Diablo-style action-rpg by some of the same people who made Titan Quest. The game is a LOT like Titan Quest and that is a good thing since TQ was awesome. I think this game is probably better then TQ, as well as more recent games like Torchlight II and Van Helsing.\n\nWhat do I like about the game? Well, the game is neither too generous or too stingy with it's loot. The skill system nicely mixes active skills, with various passive skills that modify how they work. The game isn't too generous with skill points, and you'll always feel keen for that next level up. The game rewards you for exploring and you'll find hidden quests, random encounters, loot chests and boss fights. The action finds a perfect mix between fast paced and not being so fast that you have no time to strategize. Combat requires you to be aware of how you position yourself and keep an eye on what is going on. They seem to have found the right balances to make the game fun across the board.\n\nAlso don't be too scared by the Early Access label. The game is stable, mostly bug-free and feels "complete" with no noticable missing features except that it cuts short where the last act will eventually start. (One bug I did notice is that when I changed the resolution, mouse clicks on the ui don't always detect the right places until you restart the game.) Even with the game truncated, you'll still get quite a few hours of gameplay. After reaching the end, I immediately started a new character. There is also a "Veteran" option.\n\nHighly recommended!","September 18, 2014","true","139.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I think I'm just a sucker for combination classes, having the ability to select 2 classes of your liking gives you that extra freedom in making awesome builds.\n\nI would have more hours in it, but since it's Early Access, I'm not trying to put too much time into it until the full release.

Now after a while I am picking it back up again. And man let me tell you am I SATISFIED with the chagnes they made. Once bit thing was how the hitting mechanic works.

Plus, the classes are all pretty unique and a good combination of passive and active skills. Not to mention, once you hit level 10 you can choose to spec into another character class, resulting in some hilarious mixes of power.

Even though this is an early access review, I can say this game already has it together.It has an amazing skill tree/multiclass system that I absolutely adore! It's "Hardcore" enough as to not put off those kinds of players (i.e min/maxers,etc.) but it can also be played quite casually. If you have played other dungeon crawlers/hack and slash rpgs you will feel right at home here. While the game is terrific, it's not without it's short comings, such as sometimes your fps will drop, I have had a couple crashes (literally only 2), pushing your skill buttons on the keyboard can sometimes feel a tad unresponsive, just minor polish and optimization stuff. Overall the game is quite nice and with the recent addition of multiplayer the game just got that much better. This is definitely one to keep your eye on!\nAlso, be sure to check out swhipgaming.blogspot.com for more game rundowns!","January 15, 2015","true","70.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's the best ARPG since Diablo 2, hands down. I finished Act 1 in Early Access and it was so good that I had to promise myself I'd wait until the full release to play any more. Otherwise I would've played through the Early Access areas so often I'd become entirely burnt out on them before the game actually came out.\n\nThis game is what Diablo 3 SHOULD have been.","January 17, 2015","true","156.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

As someone who has thousands of hours under my belt playing ARPGs going all the way back to the original Diablo, I feel like this game strikes a nice balance in terms of complexity between Diablo 3 (modest) and Path of Exile (very high).  Between the 6 classes, the possibility to Dual Class, unique gear, and Devotion system there is a lot of depth and build diversity here to keep you busy for 100+ hours.  If there are any useless skills in this game, I haven't found them yet.  Everything is viable.

The devevlopers of the game made Titan quest which was a masterpiece ( didnt play it yeah shame on me :)  ) starting from team of 2 people and eventually grew to team of 10 people and managed to create this GEM.\nSince the ARPG market isnt that big we have 2 games that are currently the best on ARPG genre which are Diablo 3 ( ugghh) and its Free version which is Path of Exile.On the other hand none of those games reached the pinnacle of gameplay which diablo 2 had. DIablo 3 is just overpriced MMO these days and Path of Exile is a big market for trading gems-skills to make a cookie-cutter builds.\nNow lets see what exactly makes Grim Dawn a great game and why you should invest your time into it:\n\nDual class system: you get a choice out of 6 classes( masteries) as you start on level 2 and another choice of class at level 10. Although its not forced and you can play 1 class just as any ARPG.\nGear gives skills: there are lots of gear and components which can give you different skills as well be it passive or active.\nDevotion System: There are shrines located in the world of cairn as you adventure , some of them require  to be fixed(different componets required)  or kill a wave of monsters.After you restore a shrine you get devotion point which can be spent according to your like.Total of 50 shrines can be obtainable.\nFactions: you kill monsters for a faction to get respected with them which unlocks gear and augments to boost your character even further.\nI  can go on and on about game features but the game is awesome and worth every penny you give for it.\n3 Difficulties; Normal, Elite, Ultimate. 4 Huge acts to complete. 2 roguelike dungeons for more challenge. The game is content complete and fully playable which awaits some polishing and launch at February. Lets congratulate the developers on making such a badass game with little budget.

Bought D3 when it came out, huge disapppointment with the skill system and it was boring and bright, unlike D2 which was darker. Grim Dawn reminded me of D2, and brought with it the wonder of the dual class system to me (I never tried Titan Quest, somehow it slipped off my game radar)\n\nGD seems to be what I expect from a modern ARPG, it is moderately hard if your build is incorrect, and you can respec your characters' skill points to see if u can improve on your build.

Not only is the combat system great, the story is immersive, and the game has a lot of side features, such as factions. Grinding is actually fun and something I can actually do for once. In other ARPG's after a couple re-runs of areas to grind, it started becoming a chore rather than an enjoying game. Another feature that really got to me was the impact of quests, and the choices you made. For example, if you kill a certain person, later on other people might come after you for vengeance. Vice versa, if you save a certain person, they might later come back and offer their aid/services. Grim Dawn does what all ARPG's does well, but at the moment I find nothing really unique about it that stands out. Riftportals are similar to PoE's portals. Code base is pretty much the same as TQ. But despite having no real unique feature, all of it's basic essentials are done amazingly well, leaving for a addictive game.

Titan Quest. These two games are very similar however Grim Dawn has taken what was a great concept in Titan Quest and made it even better. There are 6 Classes to play now. All can be combined with each other to give you a unique playing experience that fits your profile. Would it be nice if there were a few more masteries? Sure. But right now the game in my eyes is perfect.\n\nGrim Dawn has a great story so I wont include any spoilers. One of the few games that I really enjoy playing that gives you the ability to make decisions on who to save, or who to kill. These decisions can either help you if you help them or it can hurt you.\n\nFactions. Just like in many RPG games there are factions. Good ones, and bad ones. In Grim Dawn Reputation Factions are of major importance as they provide you with decent high level gear, and Augments that can enchant your gear with various additional damage types or resistances.\n\nAct Three was recently released a few months back and I have to say just like Act 1 and Act 2. Act 3 is really good, and it keeps me on the edge of my seat waiting for them to release Act 4 and hopefully the rest of the game.\n\nIve owned Grim Dawn for a little over a year now and I have to tell you, Everyday I have played this game I get addicted more and more.\n\nDo I recommend this game? You bet your ♥♥♥ I do. If you want a damn good game where you can get lost for hours and even more with friends. Buy it. What are you waiting for Cupcake, hit that buy button and enjoy the epic experience that is Grim Dawn.","January 9, 2015","true","179.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

For anyone that played the Titan's Quest series, you will see some similarities in the combat and general flow of the game.  They did a great job of making an interesting crafting system as well as items that can be attached to gear, unlocking abilities and adding attributes.  I will definitely find myself tinkering around with a lot as the content continues to be released.  The boss fights were challenging but I was also ahead by about 2 or 3 levels at most points in the game so that was a factor.  I would recommend this to anyone that was a fan of the teams original games as well as anyone looking for something like Diablo but with a deeper story line as well as more side content.","January 11, 2015","true","12.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Even though this is an early access review, I can say this game already has it together.It has an amazing skill tree/multiclass system that I absolutely adore! It's "Hardcore" enough as to not put off those kinds of players (i.e min/maxers,etc.) but it can also be played quite casually. If you have played other dungeon crawlers/hack and slash rpgs you will feel right at home here. While the game is terrific, it's not without it's short comings, such as sometimes your fps will drop, I have had a couple crashes (literally only 2), pushing your skill buttons on the keyboard can sometimes feel a tad unresponsive, just minor polish and optimization stuff. Overall the game is quite nice and with the recent addition of multiplayer the game just got that much better.

It's the best ARPG since Diablo 2, hands down. I finished Act 1 in Early Access and it was so good that I had to promise myself I'd wait until the full release to play any more.

Никакие Диабло, Торчлайты и ВанХельсинги рядом не стоят. Сделано в традициях Titan Quest, так что многое узнаваемо по части интерфейса и прокачки, но сильно отличается от оригинала по концепции, атмосфере и контенту.\n\nХоть игра и находится в раннем достуе на момент написания отзыва (завершен только 3 акт), уже есть чем заняться при достижении максимального уровня — охотой на монстров и заработком репутации. Отзывчивые разработчики, большое разнообразие предметов, навыков и всяих реликвий, много лора для изучения сюжета и мира... Это просто идеальная игра. Вот только бегать с кем-то в кооперативе оказалось менее весело, чем в одиночку, но я не уверен, что это минус.\n\nМожно играть без подключения к долбаному интернету, что сильно мешает в случае с Диабло 3.\n\n...\n\nОбновлено. Теперь вышла релизная версия и контента стало в разы больше. Да, это несомненно великолепный продукт с кучей возможностей, с огромной реиграбельностью и превосходным будущим. Каждый аспект Grim Dawn на голову превосходит подобные в других играх, в ней собрано всё самое лучшее. Теперь нужно приложить просто титанические усилия, чтобы найти хоть какие-то недостатки. Наверное, это лучшее вложение средств в ранний доступ, которое я когда-либо делал.","June 25, 2015","true","234.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

As someone who has thousands of hours under my belt playing ARPGs going all the way back to the original Diablo, I feel like this game strikes a nice balance in terms of complexity between Diablo 3 (modest) and Path of Exile (very high).  Between the 6 classes, the possibility to Dual Class, unique gear, and Devotion system there is a lot of depth and build diversity here to keep you busy for 100+ hours.  If there are any useless skills in this game, I haven't found them yet.  Everything is viable.

A good old-fashioned hack-n-slash/shoot-n-loot.\n\nA realm of chaotic energy forced its way into the material world and did an apocalypse, and a hell-cult took advantage of the mayhem to gain a ton of power for itself and is now summoning demons to harvest more blood to summon more demons. Fun times for a recently-possessed rando like yourself to find themselves in, 'specially with a noose around their neck.\n\nEarly Access, yes, but it's actually almost feature-complete. Not that you can tell, until you see an out-of-place NPC telling you you've hit the end of the developed game.\n\nIf you have an extra $25 to spend and have a fondness for isometric ♥♥♥♥-wrecking, jump on it.

Никакие Диабло, Торчлайты и ВанХельсинги рядом не стоят. Сделано в традициях Titan Quest, так что многое узнаваемо по части интерфейса и прокачки, но сильно отличается от оригинала по концепции, атмосфере и контенту.\n\nХоть игра и находится в раннем достуе на момент написания отзыва (завершен только 3 акт), уже есть чем заняться при достижении максимального уровня — охотой на монстров и заработком репутации. Отзывчивые разработчики, большое разнообразие предметов, навыков и всяих реликвий, много лора для изучения сюжета и мира... Это просто идеальная игра. Вот только бегать с кем-то в кооперативе оказалось менее весело, чем в одиночку, но я не уверен, что это минус.\n\nМожно играть без подключения к долбаному интернету, что сильно мешает в случае с Диабло 3.\n\n...\n\nОбновлено. Теперь вышла релизная версия и контента стало в разы больше. Да, это несомненно великолепный продукт с кучей возможностей, с огромной реиграбельностью и превосходным будущим. Каждый аспект Grim Dawn на голову превосходит подобные в других играх, в ней собрано всё самое лучшее. Теперь нужно приложить просто титанические усилия, чтобы найти хоть какие-то недостатки.

I am a huge fan of the isometric dungeon crawler genre, but I know it is not everyone's cup of tea. Also this is my first review ever.\n\nWith that being said this game in my opinion is hands down the best ARPG released since D2 LOD. If you are a fan of titan quest you will feel at home with how the core game feels as the same engine is used. The story is dark and gritty with an alternate world that has recently expierenced an apocalpyse of sorts. Needless to say there are plently of monsters that need slaying.\n\nPros:\n+Excelent skill trees with meaningful passives. ( I miss passives that actually change your build, and I am happy to see the return to form, very similar to D2)\n\n+Items are meaningful, uniques and legendaries feel just that unique and legendary. This is one of the most important factors in the genre, and I feel comfortable in saying this game has the best item attributes around.The items in the game can dramatically change your build. Like D2 One of the great features of this is granted skills from items (another feature missing in many of todays arpgs)\n\n+Plenty to do after and during the story. While many arpgs simply have you killing monsters in the hopes of getting loot, this game adds a couple of new layers to the loot grind. The first is a reputation system, that allows you to buy specialty items and recipees. Which brings up another neat feature which is crafting. Crafting in this game is actually very useful and can help create unique builds, especially through relics (items that you can equip in a relic slot granting specific bonuses and a new skill). There is also a roguelike dungeon in the game that if beaten grants a reward of treasure chests galore. There is plenty more I have not mentioned like the Nemisis system, and devotion shrines.\n\n+Both offline and online\n\nCons:\n-Graphically speaking it does not push the boundaries, but that is to be expected in the genre.\n\n-Combat while not bad, is typical of arpg's. Nothing boundary pushing here. Basically the combat is near identical to titan quest which is no surprise. Still the combat is on par with any other arpg out, and the build possiblites pretty much gurantee a style for you. I only put this in the cons because some people may not be a fan of the basic combat style of arpgs.\n\n-Some people may be turned off by the large number of passives in the skill trees (I myself love passives)\n\n- There is no serverside online. Meaning the characters are saved to your computer allowing others online to modify/cheat their character. (This can be mitigated by playing with friends, but it would be nice to have anti cheating measures)\n\nOverall:\nThis game is a must for arpg fans especially those that enjoyed titan quest and d2 lod. While the combat may not be as smooth as d3 or the trade community as active as PoE, I beleive that it more than makes up for it in the sheer number of awesome items (once again one of the most important parts of an arpg) and the many builds you can make. With devotion shrines to be found or reputation to be gained, there is plenty to do, and you will not have to worry about only grinding the same area over and over. If you are a fan of the genre this game is for you, if not then you will most likely not enjoy the game. This is a game that caters very much to people like me, that is to say the developers bring back the feel from the late 90's early 2000's that I loved so much.\n","January 4","true","91.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The fundamentals work well, and every couple of years a new title will come out and improve the concept a little. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing and The Bard's Tale added some character or a new atmosphere, FATE and Torchlight added in little new mechanics that bring more depth to the world, Path of Exile titles like DeathSpank and Borderlands thrived on ARPG elements, but kept their own style too. Then along comes Grim Dawn, which stays true to the holy mechanics of dungeon crawling; randomly generated loot, tons of enemies and enemy types, and a dark downbeat atmosphere, but adds enough to change the tried-and-tested ARPG elements and bolster them to a new level.\n\nHighlights\nWhile doing those things well would have been enough, Grim Dawn has added to the fundamentals with a grim brooding atmosphere and overlying story where the last humans are trying to survive in a punishing and dying world, and it made me feel as though I, as a common nobody dragged to the hallows to die then set loose to make my way, was really having an impact on the environment and the people around me as I gathered resources and helped establish footholds and improve things for the better for myself and those around me. It's packed with tons of intrigue, lore, story and personality and they make the overall game as exciting and interesting as the gameplay itself.\n\n* Play time and content is huge. It's pretty difficult to run out of things to complete, and difficulty scales\n\nMistakes\n* I've noticed input lag on a number of occasions, and there are plenty of reports of small performance issues\n* The graphics engine uses the same components as Titans Quest, which many people simply didn't like then and will not like now. It works well with the dark and desperate feel of the game, but for many this will be a sticking point\n\nRecommendations\nCurrently available for £18.99/22.99€/$24.99, Grim Dawn is fairly priced, especially considering its closest competitor, Diablo 3, weighs in at $39.99 and another $39.99 for the expansion.

The fundamentals work well, and every couple of years a new title will come out and improve the concept a little. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing and The Bard's Tale added some character or a new atmosphere, FATE and Torchlight added in little new mechanics that bring more depth to the world, Path of Exile titles like DeathSpank and Borderlands thrived on ARPG elements, but kept their own style too. Then along comes Grim Dawn, which stays true to the holy mechanics of dungeon crawling; randomly generated loot, tons of enemies and enemy types, and a dark downbeat atmosphere, but adds enough to change the tried-and-tested ARPG elements and bolster them to a new level.\n\nHighlights\nWhile doing those things well would have been enough, Grim Dawn has added to the fundamentals with a grim brooding atmosphere and overlying story where the last humans are trying to survive in a punishing and dying world, and it made me feel as though I, as a common nobody dragged to the hallows to die then set loose to make my way, was really having an impact on the environment and the people around me as I gathered resources and helped establish footholds and improve things for the better for myself and those around me. It's packed with tons of intrigue, lore, story and personality and they make the overall game as exciting and interesting as the gameplay itself.\n\n* Play time and content is huge. It's pretty difficult to run out of things to complete, and difficulty scales\n\nMistakes\n* I've noticed input lag on a number of occasions, and there are plenty of reports of small performance issues\n* The graphics engine uses the same components as Titans Quest, which many people simply didn't like then and will not like now. It works well with the dark and desperate feel of the game, but for many this will be a sticking point\n\nRecommendations\nCurrently available for £18.99/22.99€/$24.99, Grim Dawn is fairly priced, especially considering its closest competitor, Diablo 3, weighs in at $39.99 and another $39.99 for the expansion. At the time of review, it's already been discounted to -50% a few times, which is plain and simple great value for money. Game time clocks in at around 40 hours+, with a ton of replay value, and being in Early Access, there's a planned Third Act releasing some time within a year which will add plenty more content.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/219990/","August 23, 2015","true","14.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I am a huge fan of the isometric dungeon crawler genre, but I know it is not everyone's cup of tea. Also this is my first review ever.\n\nWith that being said this game in my opinion is hands down the best ARPG released since D2 LOD. If you are a fan of titan quest you will feel at home with how the core game feels as the same engine is used. The story is dark and gritty with an alternate world that has recently expierenced an apocalpyse of sorts. Needless to say there are plently of monsters that need slaying.\n\nPros:\n+Excelent skill trees with meaningful passives. ( I miss passives that actually change your build, and I am happy to see the return to form, very similar to D2)\n\n+Items are meaningful, uniques and legendaries feel just that unique and legendary. This is one of the most important factors in the genre, and I feel comfortable in saying this game has the best item attributes around.The items in the game can dramatically change your build. Like D2 One of the great features of this is granted skills from items (another feature missing in many of todays arpgs)\n\n+Plenty to do after and during the story. While many arpgs simply have you killing monsters in the hopes of getting loot, this game adds a couple of new layers to the loot grind. The first is a reputation system, that allows you to buy specialty items and recipees. Which brings up another neat feature which is crafting. Crafting in this game is actually very useful and can help create unique builds, especially through relics (items that you can equip in a relic slot granting specific bonuses and a new skill). There is also a roguelike dungeon in the game that if beaten grants a reward of treasure chests galore. There is plenty more I have not mentioned like the Nemisis system, and devotion shrines.\n\n+Both offline and online\n\nCons:\n-Graphically speaking it does not push the boundaries, but that is to be expected in the genre.\n\n-Combat while not bad, is typical of arpg's. Nothing boundary pushing here. Basically the combat is near identical to titan quest which is no surprise. Still the combat is on par with any other arpg out, and the build possiblites pretty much gurantee a style for you. I only put this in the cons because some people may not be a fan of the basic combat style of arpgs.\n\n-Some people may be turned off by the large number of passives in the skill trees (I myself love passives)\n\n- There is no serverside online. Meaning the characters are saved to your computer allowing others online to modify/cheat their character. (This can be mitigated by playing with friends, but it would be nice to have anti cheating measures)\n\nOverall:\nThis game is a must for arpg fans especially those that enjoyed titan quest and d2 lod. While the combat may not be as smooth as d3 or the trade community as active as PoE, I beleive that it more than makes up for it in the sheer number of awesome items (once again one of the most important parts of an arpg) and the many builds you can make. With devotion shrines to be found or reputation to be gained, there is plenty to do, and you will not have to worry about only grinding the same area over and over. If you are a fan of the genre this game is for you, if not then you will most likely not enjoy the game. This is a game that caters very much to people like me, that is to say the developers bring back the feel from the late 90's early 2000's that I loved so much.\n","January 4","true","91.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

If you were about D2s immersion and overall atmosphere you do yourself a huge diservice by not paying 20 bucks for this masterpiece. Right now it is 16 bucks buy this help these guys out I promise you. This game is not even complete you would never know it. Huge world intersting characters.\nI have around 20 years exp with this genre and I'm a huge CRATE fan.\nI love Diablo 3 but its all about show and cookie cutter lots of multiplayer love. It has vastly improved 10 fold...But this feels more like the spiritual child of D2. It is a whole lot like TQ as well. Man o man if i didnt get one thing for Xmas but this id walk away very happy.\nJust some detailed info I had to dig around for....character models look nice not quite as good as D3 but you're armor changes appearance you can be a male or female. UI is very nice and minimalist. Act 3 is getting close to completion.\nYou can check GDs web site they have 3 packages for purchase. 20 bucks gets you a hell of alot. Im excited for the future and potential this game has give it a shot you wont regret it. Yes its far better then PoE sorry guys. It just flows better looks better skill tree isnt this over inflated wheel of hp and mp increases (lol). BEST feature yet...IT works offline....OMGodders!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nGraphics 9\nSound     10\nloot         9\nskills        8\nquests     9\naddiction level 10\nOverall quality  10 (game is not even finished)\nGreat job guys keep up the hard work !!!!!\nUPDATED REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UPDATED REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nOver a year later Grim Dawn is content complete. I will say once again If you want the best ARPG ever made purchase Grim Dawn .\nBetter than Diablo 3 Yes it is. Keep in mind it is a bit different than Diablo 3. Better than Path of exile\n!00 times better....I don't even know why POE is considered 2nd best its not even close to Grim Dawn. POE is generic plain and simple and it is a typical F2p game but I won't taint this awesome game with talks of junk. You will probally be pressed to find enough time to give this Gem its due.\nThe world is meticulously crafted everything placed has a reason...There are intersting quest there are factions for rewards and in depth crafting system a huge seamless map. The loot is awesome and the new cap is lvl 85. Theres also Devotion system and a whole lot of ways to customize your class. Graphically the game is gorgeous there is a huge amount of polish already and even though GD is content complete they still have a build 30 coming to add more balance and fix bugs which in the 70 hours ive never seen. So final release of game drops in February. THE game is on sale for 15 bucks...is it worth it LOL. Its worth full price and then some I would of payed 100 bucks for it if thats what they asked...It is that good and CRATE entertainment is purely awesome.\nCombat is Visceral and every hit is spot on. Where Diablo 3 is very good with combat Grim Dawn is not as flashy with skills but make no mistake the combat and effect suit this game style perfectly.\nIts kind of nice seeing your enemies rather then them being lost in a hail of multishot and meteors HAHAHA.

Then I found Grim Dawn on here and it seems like a great mix of Diablo 2, Diablo 3, Path of Exile and the old-ish Titan Quest. While the game is in early access, it proves to be a competent ARPG so far.

Nevertheless, the game is in a perfectly playable state and is very fun too.\n\nGrim Dawn is an unusual spiritual successor to Titan Quest, to whom a few of the people working on it had a hand in making. Stylistically, the games are quite different- between the vibrant fantasy Greece of TQ and GD's own grim take on Victorian fashions and weaponry. Mechanically though, it's the perfect successor to TQ, taking the good aspects of TQ's 2-mastery system and deepening it with a greater variety of skills available per mastery. Item drops are far improved over where TQ was, with a far better rate of blue items\n\nThe amount of actual content the game has to offer can't rival that of many other ARPG's, past or present, but Grim Dawn's lengthy amount of time spent refining what is there isn't an accident- it's a lean game with a focus on replayability through quality and a small amount of variation in your journey through some minor randomization. It's a small thing, but entrances to underground areas changing to be located somewhere else drastically changes the pace of going through zones you already accomplished with another character before.\n\nAnd, as a final selling point for Grim Dawn, as with other popular ARPG's these days, support for the game won't end upon final release. It's a bit far from now, but future expansion including new areas and masteries, just as meticulously crafted as those in the original, are something to look forward to- and with GD's current record, unlikely to suddenly go awol as the developer decides to work on other projects.","November 2, 2014","true","239.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Smaller in scope, but nevertheless a worthy addition to any ARPG fan's library. It's not very pretty; if you're a graphics fanboy, there's a lot to nitpick about the scenery. A love of dark atmosphere is a must, as 90% of Dawn's look is centered around an amalgamation of Dark Ages/Post Apocalyptic themes. No sunshine or secret rainbow levels here!\n\nAlso, what's not to love about taking a shotgun to a zombie's face in the middle of a rainstorm, and then tossing a molotov into a group of walkers immediately after?  You level at a reasonable pace, as well. Aye, it's a "one more level and then I'll get off!" sort of game.\n\nAlso of note: no quest guidelines or help. When you're given a quest (find my necklace!) you have to actually READ the quest info and pick out clues as to where it might be (which are almost always obvious anyway..."Oh! She said in the second paragraph she left it in her house in TOWN so it must be there, right...? Only, which house is hers? Guess I gotta check them all!") Nothing brain-boggling, but it's nice that it pays to READ stuff rather than look at your map to find a highlighted location (as in most games). Might be a turn off for the impatient, though. Still, there are always plenty of monsters to shoot/stab/immolate/bash.\n\nAnd for under $20, this game is a no brainer. Will definitely suck at a few hours out of your life.","June 22, 2014","true","8.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","1"

This is one of those games that keeps getting care until it is actually a finished product unlike most games these days.\n\nThis is also one of the very few games that have great atmospheric music. You don't always even realize it's there and it never manages to annoy you. And when you actually happen to pay attention to it you find it obvious that the music is an integral part of the atmosphere.\n\nThe game has some Diablo 2 feel to it but at least for me it does not invoke quite the same kind of gaming madness as Diablo 2 did all those years ago. But then again I may have changed a bit myself over time too. Upgrading items is too loyal Titan Quest for my liking. It's not a bad system but IMO it does not compete well with D2 gems and runes. And for me every game in this genre competes with Diablo 2 with Lord of Destruction expansion installed. Also so far I haven't noticed that interesting itemization in Grim Dawn but IMO the items are more interesting than in Diablo 3 for example. Then again most more interesting items in D2 came to play at a reasonably high level.","January 25","true","37.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I wish there was a transparent overlay map.\n\nNeutral:\n- Class system is designed in such a way that is meant to combine two classes, giving you more varied skills. If you go just one class, then you will have more powerful skills, but not a lot of variety. (Not necessarily bad)\n- There are a lot of passive skills.

However, it is weak where D3 is strong: game responsiveness.

Grim Dawn has the substance and strategy of Titan Quest, yet in its current state it lacks the quality and polish that made Titan Quest so immersive and falls flat ONLY because Grim Dawn is still layering the foundation of its identity and therefore it's face isn't fully developed and able to be properly percieved.

Having not heard of this game before I spent some time researching as I have been burned by early access games before. After reading and watching and rinsing and repeating I finally broke down and bought Grim Dawn. I have not been disappointed so far. The game is visually stunning and controls very well. It does not hold your hand and requires exploration and actual reading of the quests. The world is also an open one with load screens only when entering caves or dungeons. Transportation is alieviated by a nice portal system though, which makes getting around to those areas already discovered a breeze. The skill system seems very robust allowing for a mashup of two specs (unlocked at level 10) and making or breaking your build interesting and rewarding. It seems like the developers are quite active in rolling out updates. Like any early access game though, I am sure there are problems which I havn't encountered or noticed yet. So as I do recommend this game, remember do your own homework.

Plenty of stuff to do, enemies to kill, loot to hoard.\n\nThe dual-class system allows for an amazing amount of customization. There are 5 classes to choose from (Soldier, Demolitionist, Occultist, Nightblade, and Arcanist). Once you reach level 10 you can choose a second class to compliment your first, or just stick with one. Each class' skill tree has enough abilities that you can't even come close to maxing out everything. Your choice of skills actually matters and will affect how you play.\n\nEven just with the same two-class combination ( I have 3 different soldier + occultist = witchblade) there is quite a variety as to how one can choose to play: ranged w/ guns, ranged w/ 2-hand melee weapon (Really? Yep.), dual-wield melee, 1-hand and shield, 2-hand melee.\n\nThe game can be non-linear - if you want, you can skip most of act 1 and go to act 2 earlier for a challenge. There are lots of hidden areas to find, some with challenging enemies, others with chests containing guaranteed epic loot.\n\nAll this and more from an Early Access title. One of the best Early Access experiences I've had with any Steam game and it gets better with each new patch.\n\nAbsolutely worth full price, $25 is half the cost of a certain other 'AAA' ARPG that didnt come close to what fans were hoping for (and it's a steal at the current 50% off sale price!!).

The music in some parts reminds me of how Final Fantasy VII's music helped set the mood. The combat is pretty enjoyable, I'm liking the skill system and the story is pretty cool so far. I'm not really far into the main story, if there really is one, but the side quests and people you speak with give it a pretty neato atmosphere.\n\nIf you have money to burn and wanted something a little more streamlined than Inquisitor or Two Worlds, keeping the good parts of each but cutting out the crappy graphics and long reading of the former and the garbage everything except mediocre graphics from the second, kept the same inventory system from each, and gameplay wise shares a fair bit with Path of Exile, then pick it up full price. I think it should be 20 at most but it is Early Access so more will be added in the future.\n\nI should also note that it does not play like an Early Access title. As in, it isn't crappy. A very large chunk of Early Access titles are in alpha and even upon full release (if they ever make it that far, few seem to) many of them do not play near as fluid as this game does. This game plays smooth as frig. You really can't tell it's Early Access.\n\nIf it ever goes down to 5-7 bucks, pick it up immediately. If it goes down to 14 or so, give it great consideration.

Sometimes its the small things when playing with friends that make coop games a dream to play, things like updating everyones quests or collecting a quest and everyone gets are small but really increase the ease of playing.\n\nI highly reccomend this game but I must say I really wish something could be done with the LAN issues as I do not think there is any for sure solution to it, sometimes you all connect with no problems and other times only two people can connect, you change a few settings then you have three connected, then it breaks again.

Building your character is fun, as far as level 26 I was able to use most abilities for my dual class and did not see any of them being useless or over-powered(this will change at end game I imagine -but hope not) RNG is against me ofc. I found several decentlty rolled/interesting in utility items which are not really usable by any of my classes T_T\nThe game already has alot to do in it and I can't really find any bugs yet( and the game is still being updated!)\n\nWhile movement is a tiny bit "clunky" (maybe just for me?) it does help in position your character well for the situation. So I guess that's another pro for the game, some strategy is required during tougher fights, not to mention bosses, just the "hero" type enemies are hard enough to get you started on thinking how to "abuse the environment".\n\nBTW I killed a guy who murdered another guy, later it turned out the first guy murdered the 2nd guy because he ♥♥♥♥♥/tried to ♥♥♥♥ his daughter.

I'm not a Diablo fan; too twitchy and too repetitive, with what seemed like a very clear One Good Build per class. Not my thing.\n\nHowever, I love this game! Do yourself a favor and start on Veteran, not Normal. It can be twitchy, depending on how you build your character. I'm about to do Elite, and I just finished the story, so at least this far I haven't been bothered by repetition; I understand there is some, but nothing like "ok just repeat the whole game again forever liTERALLY FOREVER." But I'm really SUPER pleased with the class system. A general familiarity with RPGs enabled me to pick a path through the multitude of skills and options without referencing the internet, and extreme flexibility with the points has enabled me to tune that nicely as the content got harder. I love that I haven't needed to bind a million abilities, and have had the opportunity to make lots of interesting, difficult decisions. y'all this game is good, it's so good that I went past ignoring the steampunk-western-Lovecraft-zombies setting and I actually LIKE it now.

Sometimes its the small things when playing with friends that make coop games a dream to play, things like updating everyones quests or collecting a quest and everyone gets are small but really increase the ease of playing.\n\nI highly reccomend this game but I must say I really wish something could be done with the LAN issues as I do not think there is any for sure solution to it, sometimes you all connect with no problems and other times only two people can connect, you change a few settings then you have three connected, then it breaks again. From what we worked out it literaly comes down to just trying to connect over and over. Who knows maybe this will be fixed in B31 which has just come out?\n\nAnyways still a great game and I am currently in Elite mode which I hope there will be more purple drops. I was lucky enough to get a purple chest just a few hours before completing Vetern Normal mode which I think is super rare.\n\nA part from the LAN issues this is a great purchase and is different enough that POE for me to be hooked (I hate leagues and limited events -POE), love exploring and grinding with mates.","February 23","true","81.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Building your character is fun, as far as level 26 I was able to use most abilities for my dual class and did not see any of them being useless or over-powered(this will change at end game I imagine -but hope not) RNG is against me ofc. I found several decentlty rolled/interesting in utility items which are not really usable by any of my classes T_T\nThe game already has alot to do in it and I can't really find any bugs yet( and the game is still being updated!)\n\nWhile movement is a tiny bit "clunky" (maybe just for me?) it does help in position your character well for the situation. So I guess that's another pro for the game, some strategy is required during tougher fights, not to mention bosses, just the "hero" type enemies are hard enough to get you started on thinking how to "abuse the environment".\n\nBTW I killed a guy who murdered another guy, later it turned out the first guy murdered the 2nd guy because he ♥♥♥♥♥/tried to ♥♥♥♥ his daughter.

The long and short of this is, it is exactly what you've already been reading, a very well-crafted and enjoyable game.\n\nGrim Dawn's Class systems provide the kind of depth and diversity required to dispel the anti-choice deception which plague the majority of RPGs available to us. The option to engage in multi-classing between the 6 available classes adds a secondary dimension, while a devotion system on top of that adds yet a third layer to core possibilities and endgame outcomes.\n\nWhile you will still end up seeing "optimal build" templates offered up down the road, rest assured that these will only be pathways for the unimaginative or lazy. Grim Dawn truly frees us from the bonds and anxiety that sometimes cause us to have to choose between what we want, and what we feel we have to do in order to create viable end-game builds.\n\nBut what is an ARPG without loot? This is truly the crack from which ARPG fans smoke. Grim Dawn has this covered and you'll find it ultimately as fulfilling as you would expect. We are presented with stockpiles of standard ARPG loot fare ("common", "magic", "legendary", "epic", etc.).\n\nWhile not unique, we can further customize this gear with augmentations along the way. Loot is truly the fourth dimension upon which our characters are built and, in compliment to the class and devotions systems, provide us with now exponential possibilities to reach our own personal end-game. Unlike games like Diablo 3, loot truly becomes the icing on the cake, and not the whole cake itself.\n\nLastly, I read somewhere that what Crate did with combat was to simply "make it satisfying". While I can't quite put my finger on exactly how they do this, I can tell you that it's exactly that. The combat is not a burden and does not detract from the overall experience. It's extremely fluid and, given the number of ways in which you will dispatch hordes of foes, you'll start to question your own true control over bloodlust.\n\nAt the end of the day, Grim Dawn is that once-a-year gem that leaves you asking why the hell you didn't hear the hype train rumbling down the tracks before this. Especially given the value price attached, Grim Dawn is refreshingly awesome. It's an experience you shouldn't deny yourself.","February 29","true","33.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is everything that Diablo 3 wasn't and more, and it's made by the same people who made Titan Quest. It's in alpha and it already has loads of content and devs who are constantly updating the game, fixing bugs, and adding more content weekly. I just got done playing for several hours with 3 other friends in a party and it ran smoothly and we all had a blast. It brought back memories of staying up all night in high school with my friends lan'ing Diablo 2 and Titan Quest. This game is definitely going to be the new titan quest and more. You can play two different classes which leads to a lot of different combinations and playstyles, and the devs are adding in new classes off and on as well which is really nice. I'm currently playing a warder which is a shaman and a soldier/warrior. It's a blast; this game is a work of art and definitely deserves to be given a chance. There are a few minor bugs i've noticed but they are visual and aren't pertinent to gameplay and progression. If you're thinking about trying out Grim Dawn because you're trying to fill that empty hole that Diablo 3 left you with, do it. I doubt you'll be dissapointed.","December 13, 2015","true","247.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Then it was in the wintersale, bought it.. no regrets. Gameplay is awesome, questing actually is very different then other games, not too obvious (not the standard follow marker, kill 10 boars, talk to this person, done). You complete quests while exploring, wich is something i really had to get used to, but really enjoy. The build diversity is insane. at lvl 10 you get to pick a second class and the devotion system allows you to alter your skills and build even further. This game really is ''play how you want''. Lookig forward to trying out many more classes. Best ARPG i have played in years. I'm lvl 33 now and just cleared act 1, Barely done anything in act 2.\n\nBottom line, if you like hack and slash, experimenting with an insane amount of skills and about 30 class combos, this game is the game for you.","December 26, 2015","true","180.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs of this review, I have put 22 hours into the game.\n\nI am not going to make a hardcore review detailing the nuances of every build, rather I am going to explain what the game excells over other ARPGs and what are its blemishes.\n\nWhat Comes Across the Horizon\nGrim Dawn shows its inspiration for Diablo 2 with a similar dismal art-style to suit the darker tones of its story. However, unlike Diablo 2, the game isn't afraid to give the scenary and the world color too.\n\nBut GD isn't living in the glory of D2. You won't be fighting demons and angels; you'll be fighting eldritch beings from another realm, occutists, and all manner of creations from the great beyond and from our own hands.\n\nThe weaponry and specializations (classes) in this game are also changed to a late Medieval time-period where explosives and guns were first in use. Weapons are also not limited to whatever specialization you have, yet they can be benefited by certain classes.\n\nWhile the story is nothing original, the execution is told with smart subtle writing. By giving only enough context in notes or from NPCs and by exploring the environments throughly, you'll find answers to your questions while always being left with more horrifying questions unanswered.\n\nIt's a story that is more intriguing to unravel for yourself. You start by waking up shortly after a gallowsman cuts your noose once you've regained consciousness from being possessed.\n\nTo say anything more will spoil the mystery, but if you're a fan of H.P Lovecraft, then I think you'll enjoy where this game is going.\n\nBut let's focus on what GD does best of all: Experimentation.\n\nForget About the Classes, Enjoy the Experiment\nThe best aspect of GD is the variety of builds you can make. It's all based on what skills and/or weaponry you prefer, and the only limitation is what kind of final class you are looking for.\n\nAt the start, you have no skills. Once you level up, you have the option of six class choices. And at level ten, you have the option of a secondary class from the remaining five--or you can stick with one if you really want--which is almost mandatory for more casual ARPG players.\n\nThere is no specific class for one playstyle like with other ARPGs. No class is only a warrior, a mage, a ranger, etc. Instead, each class works as if it were split in two, and the halves were combined with other split-classes.\n\nIf that is too confusing, here's a simple breakdown of them all:\n\nSoldier: Sword & Shield (also two-handed abilities) and general tankish perks.\nDemolitionist: Projeticle equipment expert (grenades, stun-jacks, mortar) and fire-magic.\nOccultist: Posion/hex spells and small creatures to summon.\nArcanist: Ice and general-type magic spells.\nNightblade: Dual-wielding expert, crit-based attacks and illusion magic.\nShaman: Two-handed expert, lighting focus and a large creature to conjure.\n\nSome of these classes can be entirely played alone. However, some classes, like the Arcanist and Demolionist, will feel barren of abilities if you don't add another class.\n\nThe result is a system where you can make some unique builds with your friends, even if you all start from the same class.\n\nFor example, do you want to play a Van Helsing build (original)? Combine the Nightblade with the Demolitionist (two-wielding swords, get a cross bow, and combine it with Demo gadgets).\n\nDo you want to play as a two-handed Battlemage from TES? Combine the Shaman with the Arcanist.\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nAlthough some classes are obviously designed for a weapon-type, there is nothing in the game to stop you from using whatever you want with the classes. Most skills do not require a certain weapon.\n\nArmor is not restricted by your classes either. It's all based on what attributes you select (physique, cunning and spirit), which can be modified further with the Devotions perks, and those too have special skills of their own.\n\nThe best way to find what works for you is to start six characters to level 10. It will take you 15 mins to 20 mins each if you go the Slith island. For the first three, upgrade your Mastery alone.  From 4 -10, get your Mastery to rank 10 and try out the skills.\n\nIf you're not satisfied, you can try another build. Once you have tried two or three out, you'll probably get an idea what you want. By the sixth run, you'll know what to choose for your final character.\n\nIt sounds tedious, but it's really engaging to see what works and what doesn't. And because it takes so little time you won't get tired either.\n\nThe reward for experimenting, while not being restricted to create whatever type of character you wan,  is the best thing to be found in GD.\n\nNot All Sunshine\nYou're going to grow weary by reused enemies. Thankfully, enemies will only respawn after you leave the game. My strategy is to always reach the next portal to start my next game. Even if you take breaks, some levels are littered with enemies, especially in Act 2.\n\nBosses don't fare much better. Something I can't overlook after playing Van Helsing with unique boss-fights. The Warden had some tactics, but Cronley was a sponge with nonstop mobs.\n\nThe areas offer a lot of exploration. Possibly too much. Later, you can unlock more areas to old places for a classic RPG feel.\n\nYou are not forced to go through the story in order--you can bypass Act 1 if you want. But the enemies will be tougher if you choose to do it. (To the game's credit, you can fight enemies 10 levels higher than you.)\n\nThese issues are minor, but the more you play the more the game can wane on you with its initial appeal. You should play with friends to mitigate the absurd enemy hordes you'll have to fight, but not impossible for solo players.\n\nRating of Completion/Competence\nHere is a detailed list of my scale:\n\n1 : A bug-filled mess with zero content or missing many features. Far too early to get into the games. Also, games that get updates infrequently.\n\n2: A game with the beginnings of ideas, yet too soon to invest any time. Check back for updates to see if things improve. (Also, games that play well but do not have all the basic features, such as promised multiplayer modes.)\n\n3: A game that is in a playable state, yet may not have all its technical issues sorted out. Features are all available--all game modes--while they may not be finalized. Games in this section are cautious recommendations to buy, so you should check the updates.\n\n4: A game that is in a playable state, technically competent, and has enough content to be worthy of purchasing right now. Features are all accounted for and the updates for the game are frequent enough to not discourage cautious buyers. Of course, the timing of these updates should be with respect to the size of the development team.\n\n5: A game that could be considered finished. It is in the final stages of development with balancing and other last minute changes to be resolved to be fit for release.\n\nSimple Rating: 5/5, which coincides with the developer's statement that 99.9% of the game is complete.\nI'm willing to give this game a full raiting because the developers have earned my admiration for why EA can be a great idea if done by the right people.\n\nDetailed Rating: 19/20 or 95%\nContent: 5/5\n\nThe only things left for the game are some polish that will make a full-release build within the first week of Feb.\n\nQuality: 5/5\n\nIt's a finished product\n\nOptimization: 5/5\n\nBesides my PC being too weak to run at the max settings, I have had zero problems.\n\nProductivity: 4/5\n\nDespite the limited development team of ten and of over two years working to make Grim Dawn a great game, Crate Entertainment has been able to add meaningful content or add useful monthly updates to make the wait acceptable.\n\nThey are the best example of EA I have been a part of.","December 3, 2015","true","52.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

THAT MEANS IT AIN'T DONE YET! So just bear that in mind. Now, that being said, this game actually has a bit of a pedigree behind it. This game is a dungeon-crawling, action based rpg much in the vein of Diablo, Path of Exile, etc. Now if you've seen any game footage of Grim Dawn already, you may be thinking "Hmm, this gameplay and talent interface sure seems familiar". Well there is in fact a reason for that. A few years back, there was an action rpg based very much in ancient mythology called "Titan Quest". Several of the original developers from TQ are now working on this game. Much like Titan Quest, this game has what I would describe as a "Hybrid" class system. Meaning your character starts as a blank slate, then after your first few levels you get to choose your class specialization. A few more levels down the line, however, you get to pick ANOTHER talent specialization, merging the two into a hybrid class (ex: If you start as an Occultist, and then merge it with Demolitionist, you will become a Pyromancer).\n\nThe game also has a unique blend of dark age/black powder technology with a sort of Grim, Victorian aesthetic, which I personally really dig. Although the game still isn't technichally finished, I feel I can safely recommend it seeing as the developers behind it have some credible history in the genre, and the game still feels functional in its current state.","November 15, 2014","true","13.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

If I had never played Titan Quest and this was my first foray into it, I would love this game on it's own merit.  The setting is compeletly different and MUCH darker then TQ even was.  The combat is fun and loot progression so far has been great. I have played ACT 1 and ACT 2.  I can't wait for more, it was worth getting in early and for me it is more than worth the price.  I hope this game gets  more publicity as I think it could be a sleeper hit in the ARPG genre as DIvinity Original Sin has become in the CRPG one (I like both types) Looking forward to a full release and continued content.\n\nI do want to say that the community on the Grim Dawn website and the DEVS themselves are great.

However, it's 100x easier in multiplayer to cover all of the ground that needs to be covered. I mean, even diablo's maps bottle-necked after an area. But I do find myself getting frequently exhausted between opening the map and going back to areas I missed. The mini-map doesn't exactly let you know if you've been there or not.\n\nOther than that, this game is actually fantastic. The whole concept is thrilling. It's as if Titan Quest and Diablo II had a cute little post zombie apocalypse baby. There are a few things that bug me, but they're seriously miniscule and don't even matter.\n\n1. The map doesn't bottle-neck ( I know I already covered that. This is for the lists sake)\n2. Not a whole lot of variety in color. I realize that "Post-Apocalypse" ultimately makes you think of brown and grey. But not EVERYTHING has to be one of those two colors, you know? It makes every area look some-what the same. Dull and un-vibrant.\n3. None of the characters have voices, which is a shame because they would be fantastic with voices. A voice is what makes a character truly memorable. When I say "Decard Cain" you know exactly who I'm talking about. He probably has one of the most memorable voices in gaming. Other than perhaps Sheogorath from Oblivion.\n\nAnyway, think about getting some voice actors, and turn up the contrast on the new areas! Those are my two tips :3\n\nIf you read this all the way down to the bottom. I love you.","September 13, 2014","true","6.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Great combat system with a skill system very much like Titan Quest. Beautiful gore blood sprays and splats, wood splinters and cracks all drawing you into a dark and dangerous world. Arpg's are all about the loot and this game already has loot galore. Only the first two acts are in the game at this time and they can easily keep you hooked for a few hundred hours collecting loot and trying the different classes mixed together. That’s right you can mix match any of the classes together for some crazy combo's Titan Quest players will feel right at home with this. This game is already very well done and its still in development if you love argp's do yourself and the developer a favor and buy this game you will not regret it. They listen to their player base and you can tell by their updates that tend to hit on what the players want. They have polls on their site so you can vote on things going into the game. The charm and fun you get from this game is a true pleasure that every gamer should be part of. This is easily one of the best early access games out there and gives you a solid game to play from the time you install it.","November 2, 2014","true","3.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

THAT MEANS IT AIN'T DONE YET! So just bear that in mind. Now, that being said, this game actually has a bit of a pedigree behind it. This game is a dungeon-crawling, action based rpg much in the vein of Diablo, Path of Exile, etc. Now if you've seen any game footage of Grim Dawn already, you may be thinking "Hmm, this gameplay and talent interface sure seems familiar". Well there is in fact a reason for that. A few years back, there was an action rpg based very much in ancient mythology called "Titan Quest". Several of the original developers from TQ are now working on this game. Much like Titan Quest, this game has what I would describe as a "Hybrid" class system. Meaning your character starts as a blank slate, then after your first few levels you get to choose your class specialization. A few more levels down the line, however, you get to pick ANOTHER talent specialization, merging the two into a hybrid class (ex: If you start as an Occultist, and then merge it with Demolitionist, you will become a Pyromancer).\n\nThe game also has a unique blend of dark age/black powder technology with a sort of Grim, Victorian aesthetic, which I personally really dig. Although the game still isn't technichally finished, I feel I can safely recommend it seeing as the developers behind it have some credible history in the genre, and the game still feels functional in its current state.","November 15, 2014","true","13.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

D3 was visually great but the grind to level cap was quick, and getting the best gear for that level was tedious and boring. Torchlight II had some potential but with only 4 classes, and essentially the same quests every playthrough burned out its playability fast. If you've had similar frustrations, Grim Dawn is a great replacement to the prior two titles I mentioned. I'm writing this July 19th, and they've yet to release multiplayer in 'late July', but with just the single player its great so far.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n3/30/15\nThere's 3 acts now that can take a day or two to complete once you get some experience with the game, but first playthroughs will be satisfyingly long. I'm not sure how long they plan on making it, but there's definitely an act 4 in the works.\n\nThey also finished the 5th class, which makes for 10 possible combinations of 2, plus just going pure one class builds makes for 15 setups for a charcter. With near endless skill combinations, you won't often see similar builds to your own.\n\nCombat is actually punishing on Veteran difficulty. Unlike D3 where an elite's random mix of skills can devistate you but the game is otherwise a breeze, GD's mobs have some base skills that can overwhelm you with immobilizations, debuffs, and various protections that make them durable.\n\nMultiplayer is great, I had some hold ups getting LAN to work, but seems they fixed in during the recent 5 month break I took from the game.","July 19, 2014","true","618.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

THe game is still very far into its infancy but what s already in the game so far is amazing to see and experience. The skill tree system and dual classing adds some variety to building your character and personalizing it as you see fit. Components are another way to further personalize your gear for your needs which can add various stats to weapons armors and accessories. Currently the story is incomplete but give it a few more months and the rest of the main story should be complete. Legendary items also are not in the game yet but once the level caps are raised and these are introduced even more personalization will be available. Each class has its place and any combination of the classes is viable. You could even choose to fully spec into a single character rather than invest into 2 classes.  Another cool feature is hidden areas that do not show up on the map. It is always nice to find one of these especially if its one no one else has found yet. Steps of Torment is currently the hardest content in the game and is quite a challenge. It took me nearly 200 hrs to be able to complete it. As such as more content is added, level caps are raised, and harder difficulty modes are added there will be plenty of replayability in the game to last you quite a long time. As such this is a great game to invest your money in if you love aRPG's and want to get the most out of your money. It may not be a complete game but when it is complete you will not regret spending a single cent on this game.\n\n8/10","February 12, 2015","true","197.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The folks behind Grim Dawn also produced Titan Quest almost a decade ago- anybody who plays both of them will see obvious parallels, right down to individual powers and skills- and know exactly what they want to offer. This is a straightforward hack'n'slash: you see something moving that isn't you, you click on it and hit hotkeys (and occasionally run away until you can drink another health potion) until the critter dies in a spray of bloody gibs, then you rinse and repeat. The formula's as old as the original Diablo, but Grim Dawn provides enough character-building options that it feels fresh. Monsters are fairly straightforward- you've got slow melee, fast melee, shooters, shooters with some area effect, some immobilization, boss versions of each type, etc. They're mixed together enough to provide some interesting tactical challenges.\n\nWhat else? As mentioned above, the setting employs copious amounts of Grimdark(TM): 19th Century weaponry made out of junkyard materials, armour alternatively borrowed from The Road Warrior and a Victorian costume shop, abandoned and burnt-out buildings, spiky axes made for a steampunk serial killer, you get the idea. Goes well with the gameplay.

Disappointed by sequels and clones that followed? Do yourself a long waited favour and buy Grim Dawn, it deserves every cent and second of your money and time you'll spend on it.\n\nFirst review on steam for me, I just felt compelled to do it this time, because the devs deserve all the praise they can get.\nGreat support and interaction with the community through 6 long years of development have brought fort an amazing arpg that makes you wonder which is the AAA title and which the indie when compared to other °more well known° rivals.\n\nIt's been in an extremely polished and enjoyable state since the very beginning of its early access, and you could see the ambition to make it the best game it could be when more and more people were added to the development team, along with more features, more content and more polish to both new and old areas as they released them.\n\nThis game has all you could have ever wanted from a true sequel of diablo 2 and more.\n\n- Huge, I mean huge, and beautiful hand made world, where every single little thing has been maniacally placed to make it feel as real and atmosphearic as it can be. You will feel overwhelmed by the complexity of some passages, the different possible routes, the many secrets and facultative content to be found. And good luck finding some of them, because they are well hidden.\nAll of that without completely giving up on randomization, taking advantage of a system that changes which routes are blocked and which are not with every playthrough, keeping the game fresh, letting you enjoy even more the level design, something I feel that can make or destroy a game, and in most other games nowadays, is extremely linear.\n\n- No more shallow items that give a couple flat bonuses only. The game is full of items that grant the user interesting abilities that you can even build your character around some, but the good news is that you start finding those way earlier than other games that make you wait for the °end game°. In grim dawn it feels like °end game° all the time.\nThere's also a nice crafting system, allowing you to collect recipes for items, consumables, and augments for existing items (those can also grant skills!)\n\n- Extremely interesting character system that allows for a lot of customization between dual classing, stats, class skills, devotion system (think of it as an additional tier of talents with prerequisites that force you to plan ahead on how to unlock them, and the amazing thing is: you get the devotion points by cleansing shrines, and sometimes you can find those shrines in secret ares, which further encourage exploration and attention to details) and much more.\n\n- The quests and faction system is a nice change of pace from being forced to do things the same way all the time. Now you can make your choices in some of those, and experience the difference yourself (for istance, having or not a new vendor in town if you saved/spared him). Obviously don't expect to find hundreds of those, it's still an arpg/dungeon crawler, not a pure rpg.\n\n- The combat is fun and visceral. The impact of the skills and the controls are just right, and all of the things I listed above, including the complexity of the levels and characters gives it a very nice feel and pace. This is not a RACE to destroy everything in the shortest amount of time like Diablo 3. You can try, but you will never feel the NEED for it in order to progress, and it overall juist feel better.\nAlong with the classic three difficulty level, there is also a °veteran° option to start the game a bit harder and unforgiving than the traditional normal.\nAlso during the game you can find some Roguelike dungeons that can definitely put to the test your character and your abilities.\n\nThe devs are committed to give it a long support, with a survival mode and expansion pack already announced, as well as being very fast at fixing bugs and applying balance passes.\n\nThe only thing you might not like are some animations of the character, which look a little stiff, but seriously, it's a great huge game made by a team of about ten people, most of whom joined only when the project was already half done.\n\nThis is a game that can give you hundreds and hundreds of hours of great fun, for the price of less than half of many AAA titles that sometimes offer about 10 hours of shallow gameplay.\n\nStill reading this? Just buy it already, you can always thank me later.","February 26","true","155.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There have been many imitators but few have risen to the top. If you are looking for that original Diablo 2 feel, then look no further. The graphics are gorgeous, even at medium settings. If your system can max it out then you will be in for a real treat! GD has been in early access for quite a while, but that has resulted in a high amount of depth and polish. In addition to the standard features of the genre, you also get factions, crafting and a recently implemented devotion system. If you liked Titan Quest or its expansion Immortal Throne, then you will immediately be at home with GD. As mentioned above, if you crave that old school Diablo experience but in a modern package, then I recommend you buy this game.","October 21, 2015","true","242.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Path of Exile came close to striking the right notes, but high end hardcore play was impossible for those without stellar internet connections due to constant desync issues that would lead to you being killed by invisible monsters. For the asking price PoE was a great game, but Grim Dawn feels like a title that will go a long way toward scratching that ARPG itch better than any ARPG did for me in recent memory.\n\nThe game, at this point (early July 2014) only has two of its three chapters implemented and lacks multiplayer functionality at the moment. Multiplayer should be coming soon, and not long after the final chapter of an entertaining story will unfold. If you're a big fan of ARPGs but lately products like Torchlight 2 have lacked j'en sais quoi, Grim Dawn may be just what you're after.\n\nAlso, you get to shoot monsters in the face with muskets, and who doesn't love that?","July 2, 2014","true","367.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Most will say the graphics are good or bad according to their rigs, some will mention the music, some the ambience, some others will even mention the dialogues, and most will talk about the loot.\n\nI will say the whole experience feels organic; it is perhaps more dark than Path of Exile, but it doesn't feel with a weird pace. It is as smooth as Torchlight II, but far from the cartoonish feeling. It does not feel as large as Titan Quest, and yet I have not able to advance very deep into it. If you had a chance to play the undisputed best of this genre, Diablo II, and crave for a close experience, this is as close you can get, so far.

Disappointed by sequels and clones that followed? Do yourself a long waited favour and buy Grim Dawn, it deserves every cent and second of your money and time you'll spend on it.\n\nFirst review on steam for me, I just felt compelled to do it this time, because the devs deserve all the praise they can get.\nGreat support and interaction with the community through 6 long years of development have brought fort an amazing arpg that makes you wonder which is the AAA title and which the indie when compared to other °more well known° rivals.\n\nIt's been in an extremely polished and enjoyable state since the very beginning of its early access, and you could see the ambition to make it the best game it could be when more and more people were added to the development team, along with more features, more content and more polish to both new and old areas as they released them.\n\nThis game has all you could have ever wanted from a true sequel of diablo 2 and more.\n\n- Huge, I mean huge, and beautiful hand made world, where every single little thing has been maniacally placed to make it feel as real and atmosphearic as it can be. You will feel overwhelmed by the complexity of some passages, the different possible routes, the many secrets and facultative content to be found. And good luck finding some of them, because they are well hidden.\nAll of that without completely giving up on randomization, taking advantage of a system that changes which routes are blocked and which are not with every playthrough, keeping the game fresh, letting you enjoy even more the level design, something I feel that can make or destroy a game, and in most other games nowadays, is extremely linear.\n\n- No more shallow items that give a couple flat bonuses only. The game is full of items that grant the user interesting abilities that you can even build your character around some, but the good news is that you start finding those way earlier than other games that make you wait for the °end game°. In grim dawn it feels like °end game° all the time.\nThere's also a nice crafting system, allowing you to collect recipes for items, consumables, and augments for existing items (those can also grant skills!)\n\n- Extremely interesting character system that allows for a lot of customization between dual classing, stats, class skills, devotion system (think of it as an additional tier of talents with prerequisites that force you to plan ahead on how to unlock them, and the amazing thing is: you get the devotion points by cleansing shrines, and sometimes you can find those shrines in secret ares, which further encourage exploration and attention to details) and much more.\n\n- The quests and faction system is a nice change of pace from being forced to do things the same way all the time. Now you can make your choices in some of those, and experience the difference yourself (for istance, having or not a new vendor in town if you saved/spared him). Obviously don't expect to find hundreds of those, it's still an arpg/dungeon crawler, not a pure rpg.\n\n- The combat is fun and visceral. The impact of the skills and the controls are just right, and all of the things I listed above, including the complexity of the levels and characters gives it a very nice feel and pace. This is not a RACE to destroy everything in the shortest amount of time like Diablo 3. You can try, but you will never feel the NEED for it in order to progress, and it overall juist feel better.\nAlong with the classic three difficulty level, there is also a °veteran° option to start the game a bit harder and unforgiving than the traditional normal.\nAlso during the game you can find some Roguelike dungeons that can definitely put to the test your character and your abilities.\n\nThe devs are committed to give it a long support, with a survival mode and expansion pack already announced, as well as being very fast at fixing bugs and applying balance passes.\n\nThe only thing you might not like are some animations of the character, which look a little stiff, but seriously, it's a great huge game made by a team of about ten people, most of whom joined only when the project was already half done.\n\nThis is a game that can give you hundreds and hundreds of hours of great fun, for the price of less than half of many AAA titles that sometimes offer about 10 hours of shallow gameplay.\n\nStill reading this? Just buy it already, you can always thank me later.","February 26","true","155.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

If you are like me don't bother reading any further and go buy this game right away I guarantee you will play it to death.\n\nFor people who don't have much experience with ARPGs, I reckon this game could be tricky to get in, the classes, skill trees, stats, devotion points are rather complicated concepts for a first-timer, but you can always find yourself a good beginner guide nowadays (I suggest that you visit Grim Dawn forums, there are really helpful people/threads there to get you started). Put some hours in and once you get a grasp of the game you will have fun with your own builds/chars because Grim Dawn has awesome replayability, one lucky item drop could change your playstyle completely, and you also can respec any unwanted skillpoints, adjust build to your personal preference.\n\nGraphically Grim Dawn doesn’t look as polished as Diablo 3, action seems a bit slower, but for some reason I felt right at home from the very beginning, maybe courtesy to apocalyptic world (loved the setting), or similar to D2/TQ gameplay. I was surprised that some quests had different outcomes, and great deal of secret/hidden locations compensate for lack of randomized maps (which I personally don’t like as much), I also totally loved the notes scattered around the world, it certainly adds up to the gruesome setting of Grim Dawn.\n\nMy verdict: Grim Dawn is a must-have ARPG for anyone who wants to experience true Diablo 2 successor, plus - taking in consideration the current price you get the most value for your grinding needs :)","April 10","true","75.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Crate was able to gain rights to the Titan Quest engine and began developing Grim Dawn which in my opinion is a worthy successor. While Grim Dawn does take inspiration from fan favorites such as the diablo series Torchlight series and Path of exile it introduces it's own unique ideas to these systems as well. Some of the things enjoy are.\n\nThe Dual Class System: Having been developed by some of the people that worked on Titan Quest one of the core features that i really enjoyed about Titan Quest makes a welcome return here in the dual class system. Upon entering the game you can create a Male or Female classless hero at level 2 you will have the ability to pick one of 6 class trees.\n\nSolder\nDemolitionist\nshaman\narchanist\nnightblade\noccultist\n\nyou can further flesh out your class at level 10 by combining a second of these trees. This combined with all the items that grant skills and augments to skills makes for some deep customization options which is one of the things i enjoy about rpgs in general.\n\nThe devotion system: while it is apparent that this system takes inspiration from Path of exile's massive skill tree the devotion system in Grim Dawn is quite unique in that you have to go exploring throughout the would to find shrines which need to be cleansed. once cleansed you will gain devotion points which can be spent in a constellation map to augment your skills.\n\nOpen world: Cairn  is a huge open world providing hours of fun content to delve into quests some with consequences /lore/Factions/Bounties/Dungeons there is allot to do in Grim Dawn and Crate have already confirmed they will be adding more content updates and full expansions\n\nComponent system: The component system works similar to the gem socket system present in other games in the genre. The difference here is that instead of having  gems and socketable items Grim Dawn has different components that can be added to any tier of item. Some of these components can really improve your build by having skills tied to them. For example I have a character that has a lodestone socketed into my offhand this item grants a lightning nova skill and to take that even further I have tied the lightning nova skill from the lodestone to the scorpion sting ability in the devotion system which adds an aoe poison to the lightning nova.There are tons of components for every gear type and you can combine these components to make more powerful ones. While I do enjoy this system it is not without it's flaws the biggest one being that if i want to modify or remove an item from a piece of gear I can do that  by way of the Inventor's apprentice however you can only keep one or the other the component item or the piece of gear. This can make the decision to salvage quite difficult if both items provide significant additions to a build.\n\nThe Loot: Loot in Grim Dawn like other titles comes in different tier types Common/Magic/Rare/Epic and Legendary. What makes the loot different from other arpgs is the fact that like the component system some items can augment existing skills even after you have maxed them out on the skill tree or like the lodestone mentioned in the component section some loot can have specific skills tied to the item. This really makes for a unique customization experience.\n\nThe Inventory system: While the inventory system is in many ways no different any other arpg out there there are a few things that are worth mentioning about the system in Grim Dawn such as quests that give bag upgrades for rewards a button that automatically combines components and my personal favorite and something that everyone has been asking for in several games of the genre. an AUTO SORT BUTTON!!! for those of us who hate playing inventory tetris. The stash system is also really well done as it has a character specific tab and an item transfer tab. The item transfer area can be upgraded to have more tabs within it as well so there really is no shortage of space.\n\nQuesting and Lore: Quests in Grim Dawn come in many forms. Some quests unlock vendors and crafting abilities some have choices and consequences. For example maybe there are 2 warring factions in the game if you choose to help one you will become enemies with the other. These kinds of choices make for a rich questing experience. while exploring the world you will find tons of pages and notes on the areas that you are exploring I have always been a fan of finding lore in these types of games and there is no shortage of that here.\n\nCrafting: Crafting in Grim Dawn borrows some of the ideas from Diablo 3's artisan system they have blueprints that you can find through out the world to increase the list of items available to craft. You can craft components and potions to give you extra damage or resistance fore specific monster type as well but the thing that stands out to me is the ability to craft relics these relics like other loot in the game can ultimately change your play style for example you might have a character such as the demolitionist that uses pistols but can't dual wield them no problem you can craft the gunslingers talisman equip it and you have your ability to dual wield pistols.\n\nFactions: While exploring the world of Cairn you will encounter different factions and settlements that will have their own set of bounties and quests for you to do. These factions have quartermasters which are merchants that sell items specific to that faction depending on how high your friendly reputation is with them. As stated before in the quest section some factions are at war with each other so helping one faction may and in come cases will in definitely either damage or completely ruin your reputation with certain factions. If your reputation gets significantly low with a faction they will spawn more elites and nemesis monsters to hunt you down. This in my opinion makes for a very engaging exploration experience.\n\nSingle/Multiplayer modes with server browser: Grim Dawn features the ability to play your characters in both single and multiplayer modes. the multi player is easy to use the host options are quite good due to the fact that you can host a game for up to 4 players and because the game features a server browser rather than an account based system the player hosting the game  can easily customize the number of players allowed in the server weather there is instanced loot and even put a password on servers so that only friends can join this is somthing i wish all games like this had.\n\nThe Cons: While I really Enjoy Grim Dawn I do have one minor complaint. I wold love for there to be more voice acting especially since there is literally tons of lore notes in the game and being a person that has some visual difficulties reading a whole bunch of text does tend to put allot of strain on my eyes so having audio to listen to is a big help but I also understand that they are an indie team and are only able to work with that they have and this grype aside they have made a fantastic rpg.\n\nFinal Verdict: If your looking for a new action rpg title to dig into Than Grim Dawn will not disappoint. It has something for new comers and old veterans of the genre alike. It is a great value and well worth the asking price and i highly recommend this so i am going to give Grim Dawn a 9 out of 10.","April 28","true","152.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I needed it, to the extent that I got a new video card and RAM for my old desktop just to run it. Ah, the 2000s were a fun time. I tried Diablo 2 and even 3 later on, but I had been spoiled. Creating a class instead of picking from a group, crafting items and Artifacts, Iron Lore has made a true RPG in a lovingly-crafted world. And finally, they got the chance to do it again.\n\nI had followed Grim Dawn before the Kickstarter, and I was very excited at what could be done. Admittedly, that anticipation can leave one disappointed, or blinded into mindlessly loving the product. I'm pleased with what Crate has done, evoking the spirit of Diablo while modernizing in the style of Titan Quest. Combat feels smooth and detailed, everything is already polished to big-budget quality. The visuals are inspiring, and the world feels believable in the characters and quest choices. The loot is varied with minimal junk. I need to get around and play it some more, but I figured the sale would be a good time to put up a review to help make a decision. I'd recommend the game if you are interested in a modern take on the genre that isn't focused on console support and failed auction houses.","June 23, 2014","true","7.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Which wasn't so successful.\nThey’re using the same engine as in Titan fall and the world is hand made. They add content every few months and add stuff like two hand weapons you missed for in Titan Quest.\n\nYou can choose between four classes. Later you can add a second class, resulting in a new class. You can make a cool mix of skills. But if you want to keep it classy, you also can combine a warrior with a rogue, resulting in a heavy battleship, raging through the lines.\nThe setting is really dark and doesn't change that much. It can be depressing over the time to run every time the same themed cave or village. The maps are big and not random generated. So you don't have different results in different runs.\nThe combat system is classic hack & slay. You beat monsters, use skills and drink some pots to heal you. The classes are good balanced in my opinion and the story is okay. The graphics are a little bit outdated but fit the dark theme of the game.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a classic hack & slay but get sick of Diablo 3, here you go.\n\n8/10","December 3, 2014","true","119.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Grim Dawn comes into an ARPG market dominated mainly by Diablo 3 and Path of Exile, but offers an experience notable different from its competitors.\n\nFor those that remember and love Titan Quest, the gameplay of Grim Dawn is both nostalgic and improved.  If you've never tried TQ (you should) GD offers a unique experience for an ARPG.  Character progression revolves around gear, which drops often, stats (simple but varied) and a set of talent trees based on classes.  You may choose two classes, and therefore gain access to two trees, each with varied but coherent abilities and passives to allow a diverse range of powerful characters.  If you enjoy trying out different builds just to see how they work, Grim Dawn can offer you a lot of replayability.\n\nGD has no private servers, and at this point doesn't even have multiplayer implemented.  The idea, though, is that Crate wants its players to mod the game as they please.  While this does allow for "cheating," in a game with no ladder boards, no action house and no intent for an economy, it feels perfect.  Grim Dawn isn't about grinding out the best loot, being the first to kill X boss, or the fastest, or whatever. Grim Dawn is about killing monsters, exploration, character building and just all around fun.\n\nIf that's what you're looking for, you should give Grim Dawn a try.","November 30, 2013","true","870.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

If you like games like Diablo, Torchlight, Path of Exiles, and so on you'll have no problems loving this game.\nI'm still playing my initial playthrough as a warrior type, and find the combat to be pretty sraight forward, the different mobs including unique named monsters and bosses, drop the varied color coded quality loot you find in all games of this type,  with some good itemization and stats overall, especially for set collections.  I can't wait to see the full game at release, because right now it's already a very nice and fun game.\n\nMarch 17th, 2014 Update\nSo, it's 1 year later and...\nThe game development is progressing very nicely I find, and the content keeps coming with more class options, quests, mobs, and loot that progresses the storylines along.  I'm still amazed at how well this small studio is able to put out a game that easily rivals bigger competitors in the same genre.  This holds up great to the games I mentioned earlier and is well worth getting just for the first 3 acts to date!  It's got loads of stuff to kill and loot already and could easily have been released as is.  Then bring out DLCs, season pass, and Grim Dawn II for the rest of the upcoming content.

If you enjoy other games from the genre, such as Diablo II, Torchlight (2) or Path of Exile, it is definitely worth checking out.\n\nUpdate: At the time of my first review, the game sometimes crashed when attempting to use portals to and from town, and failed to render the ground every now and then. These issues have been fixed! Although still "Early Access" the game is very polished feeling/looking, and the Devs listen to the players!\n\nMuch like Titan Quest, your character's class is not chosen at creation, but instead determined by picking one, or two, skill mastery trees (at level 2 and 10 respectively). This creates a large amount of diversity and customization when it comes to ability combinations and character buiding.

Slower paced than Torchlight II, but with more satisfying action. Class trees seem to be shaping up nicely, and you can choose from two of them to build your character from. Gear options are interesting so far; remains to be seen whether the higher difficulties will funnel everyone into specific builds/gear layouts.\n\nWorth full price considering Torchlight II is cheaper, Path of Exile is free, and you may or may not already own Diablo III? Maybe not if you're looking purely for value.

You've done it again!\n\nAfter Diablo 2, there wasn't anything to satiate the desire to click like a last minute bidder in hopes for a proc on an item or the great epic drops. Then came Titan Quest. My appetite disappeared as the mythology sucked me in with the awesome loot and amazing skill trees. Now the devs are back with Grim Dawn.\n\nFirst off, you collect iron. None of that lame gold that people are so used to snagging. Iron. It's in desperate need in this world of evil. Absolutely love that I'm in search of more iron bits to spend on recipes (which have a neat gamble aspect for the random stats portion) or to respec my skill trees.\n\nOh, skills trees. Like something shiny, I have to focus my attention on that. My friend is usually waiting for a good 5 minutes while I contemplate where I want to put my points. Do I put them in the mastery level so my base stats are better and I'm closer to that next awesome stat? Or do I max out the shock wave that I love so dearly on my Soldier? Decisions. Then, true to Titan Quest form, you get to spec down the tree of another class. From Soldier to Commando, my character began a journey of more awesome spells. Being able to add more depth to your character by snagging the key skills from another tree is a feature that every game needs to invest in. (Except the way PoE went...they took "tree" to mean the life tree that connects every human that ever existed or will exist.)\n\nThis game is a necessity. It is one of the stiches in that loom of dungeon crawlers. There are too few, but they manage to stretch during times when devs forget how easy it is to be lost in a difficult, non-repetitive and challenging game.","September 21, 2014","true","100.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Now for single player mode this isn't a big problem, but with the new multiplayer it can be a bit of a bother if three fellows are standing shoulder to shoulder and looking practically identical.\n\nAll in all it's got a lot of promise, if you enjoyed the Diablo series the mechanics will be familiar to you, one thing to remember, with firearms / ranged weapons, the shift key is your friend, you won't chase the baddies from here to hell's half-acre or start trying to squaredance with them.","September 4, 2014","true","110.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigpistol/recommended/219990/","bigpistol","Konrad Kaufmann","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigpistol/","187 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGreat hack and slash. Like Torchlight, the game plays like Diablo. However, unlike torchlight, the story is actually somewhat interesting and the western/Baroque setting is very unique and unlike any other canon I've seen. Another plus is the fact that even though this is technically an "Early Access" game like many others on steam, it has all the aspects of a full release. Especially now that multiplayer has been added, the game really only has to add the Arcanist class before its essencially all there. Mechanically, the game is well made. Not too HD but just enough clarity to help the game keep its gritty look. While it's technically designed and designated an Isometric, the camera can still be turned with "," and "." allowing for a much less restricted feel like many other over the head games. The class system is also very intuitive allowing for any of the 5 classes to be combined with another class, allowing for a variety of different combinations. The classes are also very accomadating to different desires and styles. The Soldier is essencially basic tank n' slash. The occultist is for people who like edge and magic, the demolitionist for gun people, the nightblade for burst/stealth people, and the arcanist for people who like not edgey magic. Overall, I believe this game is worth about $40, not $25.","September 5, 2014","true","20.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
