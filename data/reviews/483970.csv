Short but intense experience, can\'t really say much without spoiling it. Visually, the models and textures could use improvement; not sure if it\'s intentional, but a lot of visuals don\'t mesh well together and immersion suffers slightly as a result. Also, the book you start the experience with is just awful, literally MS Paint textures with 4th wall breaking...\n\nAside from these minor issues, the experience itself is great if your stomach can handle it.","May 31","true","0.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

This is terrible.  The 'horror' part is really just where they took all the 'Best VR Practices for not inducing nasua' and then did them all.\n\nThe entire experience is 6 minutes, total.  I know it's only a dollar, but honestly there's free games inifinitely better than this.  I'm surprised the author has the audacity to charge for what is essentially a very poor demo.","June 4","false","0.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Can't honestly say whether or not it's worth the buck, but I do love weird things. This fits the bill. And for less than the price of those beaks and feet that the fast food industry calls "chicken nuggets". So, take that as you will.\n\n7/10\n\nWould consider giving my soul to The Dark Lord again.","June 1","true","0.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","64","7","11","9","0"

However, it was quite a nice feeling. Genuine anxiety, with a payoff that's not really scary, but a feeling of relief more so. I think this would hinder a standard animation or game out-of-vr, but in this case it helped it. Plus there are some really nice visuals.\n\n","June 3","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But if you like paying developers for their time and creativity this is worth it. Some really enjoyable reality-bending scenes in here and I want to see more like this on the Vive. I hope that the developer allows for a "free-play" version to spend more time in specific scenes. It will be great to show off to friends who can handle the motion. Definitely the textures could use improvements but overall gets the point across.","June 2","true","0.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
