You may find it here: http://imgur.com/6qNRC8k\nAs I deleted it you will not be able to view it on steam.\n\nWhat can I say, Love in Space fixed a hearty majority of the issues with Liberation Day, Sunrider is once again one of my beloved franchises, and I am a (somewhat) pleased fan. while I cannot 100% say that v2.0 has rectified all the atrocities from it's v1.0 initial release, however this is a massive improvement from the last.\n\nBefore I continue I absolutely must address everyone at Love in Space for putting in the effort for this marvelous update. It really shows how much you care for your fans. v2.0 truly is appreciated and must be commended, that without a doubt deserves to be brought to light. You heard our cries and you responded, I personally thank all of you.\n\nWith the game as is right now it is certainly more satisfying. What was added made it much more enjoyable. Yes, there are things that cannot be fixed in terms with romance, choices and various other essential fundamentals for an eroge, this however this isn't the final chapter. I'm sure we can all expect nothing but greatness from from Love in Space. After all Diamonds are only made under high pressure.","March 10","true","22.2"," 73 of 85 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","73","85","5","8"

It's pretty comedic but trust me when I say this game can be dark.\nNow the game before this update wasn't really worth the update, same upgrade system and shop system besides seperate resources and in fact at the start it seemed like less content to the free game they released.\nNow I'm eager to get into [ RE ] turn, the newest update that adds in a whole new story and whole different type of game after you complete the normal game. It puts a twist on the ending and allows you to travel through time to change your fate. I know where all the choices went and they all went into this expansions, and it is beautiful. Tell Tale take notes, your choices actually matter and you could actually die and get everyone you know and love killed.\nMy favorite moment had to have been the dialogue where Shields said he didn't feel like he had a choice anymore and that it's like all his decisions vanished. He also complained about how he used to rip up rule books. God I think I'm in love with this series.\nMy hours were what 3-4 originally? Then I went through to check the map update for like 1-2. Now it's like over 12.\nAnyways the base game, it's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, no choices like MOA but this new expansion (I say expansion because it's new content and it's pretty god damn big for free big) is definently worth it. Also I get to decide my own fate now, no one tells me who to ♥♥♥♥.\nSeriously though that self reference to the base game is beautiful, I wish more games did that kind of thing I just hope it doesn't get over saturated if it does start happen because it's just so good right now.\nThe story is so good as well and the characters are magnifico, we get more background on the villians as well and on Shields' personality and the story is better than the base in my opinion.","May 24","true","15.9"," 49 of 49 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","49","49","5","0"

The only thing that improved in this game over the previous installement (Mask of Arcadius) were the visuals and voice actors. Everything else took a step back.\n\nThe higher production values, rather than enhancing the game, did nothing but limit it. Having played through the entirety, I can't help but feel that what the devs did was create a game based on how much voice acting and animation they could afford. The final product was made to fit the packaging, which is a terrible way to design a game.\n\nAs a result, we got something that was incredibly rushed and bland. There's been almost no improvement in gameplay. In fact, Liberation Day plays like a lightly modded version of the original. The mission count is low and unvaried. The original had a nicely fleshed out story that taught you a lot about the world and invested you in its characters. Liberation Day took all of that and turned it into a shiny, half-written screenplay with all your favorite characters shoehorned into whatever role the plot demanded. We learn absolutely nothing new about the world or its characters, who have become one dimensional tropes in service of a rushed game.\n\nMoA relied only on simple sprites and backgrounds and it really shined because of that. The devs created as much content as they felt would serve the gameplay experience and story and we got something that was not only special, but FREE. Liberation Day flipped that around and ironically, all the money that Patreon supporters and buyers of Sunrider Academy poured into the company has only ruined the next installment by making the studio believe it should try to crank out a AAA production level game.","March 6","false","7.1"," 99 of 127 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","99","127","3","0"

The story is too linear, to the point that your choices dont feel worthwhile, some choices dont even matter(*spoiler* if you dont spare cosette, she will appear in later dialogue, even though she is dead.)\n\nI was hoping for more out of this game, but it just fell short. So be warned potential buying that this may not be the space wiafu simulator you were looking for\n\nI would recommend not purchasing this, and just replay the original, you would have a better experiance if you did.","March 4","false","6.5"," 97 of 127 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","97","127","0","0"

Changing voice actors is going to be a bad idea most of the time especially for sequels (somewhat forgivable for remakes, persona 4 golden comes to mind) as it breaks the players’ emersion. To add to that, the Japanese voices are simply subpar, a lot of the voices are bad even by dlsite/dmm doujin game standards, whilst this might be subjective, I invite the readers to look for youtube videos of the Japanese voices and judge for themselves.\n\nLD offers a save import function from Mask of Arcadius, similar to the way that Mass Effect handles save transfers, this is a really great idea, that is if it actually works, the save importer is unfortunately really bugged and a lot of people are unable to make the save importer work. Thankfully LD also offers decision choices for MoA when starting a new game similar to how Dragon Age 2 handled it.\n\nThe UI within the VN portion of the game feels slick and modern, however, display bugs and slowdowns especially in the store page are pretty blatant, and this is again, clearly a product of using the Ren’Py engine.\n\n\nStory (Spoiler Free):\n\nWhilst people like to claim that stories could not be objectively bad, I have to disagree, without posting spoilers, I have to say that the single worst part about LD is the story despite the myriad of issues previously mentioned.\n\nLet’s get the elephant out of the room, LD contains an extremely linear storyline, there is a forced romance that feels extremely rushed and there are not choices at all, even the illusion of choice is lacking. To add on top of that, the storyline itself is objectively bad, I will explain below without spoilers. Whilst I do not feel like resorting to petty insults, I would like to respectfully remind the writers and developers that VNs are supposed to contain choices in them, otherwise, they are just dynamic novels, and those need actually really good writing, music, voice acting, and execution to pull off (planetarian comes to mind).\n\nIn LD, the protagonist is the standard dumb MC that doesn’t know anything and frequently breaks character, he is literally no better than the generic harem MC in LD. This is very disappointing given that this was not the case in the previous games.\n\nIn addition to the lackluster MC, the entire story makes the player feels like that they are just in for the ride, the MC does not have any impact on the storyline at all, it feels like the MC is just following everyone around, the player simply cannot make any meaningful choices and the MC himself did not make any meaningful choices, the MC just feels dead.\n\nThe forced romance is very problematic, it is clear that the developers are favouring a certain character with reckless abandon due to personal preference, whilst I agree that developers maintaining their personal touch on a game is very important, I think that even the way that they handled the forced romance is bad, the entire thing feels very rushed, the MC and the romance partner were acting blatantly out of character and the worst part is, the romance simply does not seem to any anything of significance to the storyline, at that point, I have to wonder why don’t they just make the romance optional if they wish to really focus on that character and not do other romanceable characters.\n\nThe basic concept of the entire storyline is quite intriguing, it shows a lot of potential, however, the execution done by LiS’s writers is unfortunately really bad, characters frequently act out of character, the plot turns into a jumbled mess towards the end starting from the middle of the story, and the writers wrote themselves into corners on several occasions only to perform arsepulls or deus ex machinas to get themselves out of the corner. There are more subjectively bad writing but that could not be discussed in depth without spoilers so I will refrain from doing that.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe unfortunate fact is, the awfully written (no other way to put it) storyline is the large, rusting, final nail on the coffin on top of the myriad of bugs, voice problems, engine problems for Liberation Day, as such, I simply cannot recommend Liberation Day to anyone for any price and the experience is genuinely not enjoyable and feels like a disservice to the franchise as a whole. I play the game and I see so much potential with the universe and the general plot themes, I want to like the game but I simply cannot.","April 16","false","6.2"," 61 of 77 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","61","77","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenmagician/recommended/358750/","goldenmagician","Waver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenmagician/","65 products in account","As a former patreon backer (paid $10 for beta access) and longtime fan of the series, I really cannot reccomend this game, at all.\n\nThe pretty production values and Japanese VA (what is wrong with English, I wonder? It's a beautiful language!) came at the expense of practically everything that made the previous Sunrider VNs (First Arrival and Mask of Arcadius) the gems they were.\n\nThe story is gutted, and railroad-linear whereas the previous VNs had multiple choices. People have mentioned the unsatisfying ending, but they've neglected to mention that it's unsatisfying not because of itself, but because of the atrocious pacing, forced romance, and hamfisted characterization that preceded it. For around $10 (price in my region, might be higher in yours!), you get around 3 hours total of storyline content (as in VN sections as opposed to fights). That's pretty much inexcusable.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it manages to be worse than previous iterations. QA apparently went out the window. Longtime fans know that the Ren'Py engine that Sunrider uses is pushed to its limits by the battle system, and so we can forgive the occasional slowdown. But Liberation Day was much worse than that in this department. Battles weren't just slow, they were basically slideshows. I have a 4th generation i5 on a kickass custom rig, by the way, so don't even start saying it could be my system. It isn't. These same molasses-slow battles were frequently interrupted by near-freezes and once even an outright crash. I cringed at that last bit, by the way, because it happened at the exact same spot (2nd or 3rd fight) it did for me in the beta version about a month ago.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nThis game isn't worth the money. It's inferior in every way but production values to the previous Sunrider novels, and those things are not worth the problems they brought. Also, I'll repeat myself: Japanese VA. WHY? Half the draw of this series for me is that it's an original English VN, written competently in English. What did you accomplish kicking the previous girls to the curb and replacing them with Japanese VAs? Was the weeaboo fantasy of a fully voiced JP game worth gutting the game over?\n\nI'm just really disappointed. I expect better for the next installment of the series, but I'm afraid that LiS may have shot themselves in the foot here and won't be able to recover without ending up with some serious egg on their faces.","March 5","false","11.7"," 69 of 92 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","69","92","3","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/358750/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","This review is based upon the 2.0 version of the game. I have not played the 1.0 version.\n\nSo we return to the surprisingly competent space drama with crazy anime girls. How is the third installment? (Sunrider the free game is actually two games, not one). Well, I got to import my save Mass Effect style, for one, and it seemed to have roughly the same impact as the ME import from ME1 to ME2 did (I never played ME3. ♥♥♥♥ EA). Namely that there are numerous mentions of your past actions and perhaps some influence on the events of the plot, but essentially the core of the story is the same. Arguably the most important imported choice comes in the form of what you decided in the big final decision of MoA, which determines one of your anime girls appearance for the entire game, and perhaps what sort of emotional baggage lies under the surface for that character.\n\nAnyway, Liberation Day (LD) is a noticeable step up from the previous games in terms of budget, with Japanese VA's, prettier art, and updates to the interface and combat system to make it look better. I did have 2 crashes, but that's probably just bugs that need fixing from a game that only recently came out. Good thing this game autosaves constantly.\n\nOk, enough dodging. Time to talk about the story that got this game so many negative reviews.\n\nAgain, i'll state I played 2.0, not 1.0. I don't know when the game originally ended, but considering the Japanese voices stop after a certain point, it is pretty easy for me to guess when. And yes, that is kind of a ♥♥♥♥ ending since so much is left unanswered in preparation for the sequel. The stuff that comes after that point does much to clear things up, as well as providing setup for what is to come next. So as for how it ended, i'd say the update which the devs speedily released as fast as they could once word of how mad people were about the 1.0 ending almost certainly helped.\n\nAs for the rest of the plot? A mix of predictable plot points that center heavily on jealousy and suspicion thanks to how the last game ended. There are still plenty of silly moments, but the plot is primarily serious and high-stakes as you prepare for, and then fight, the battle to liberate Cera. I'm not a fan of the forced romance with Chigara, especially since she isn't one of my favorites, but i'll forgive it (somewhat) thanks to LD's final act when everything gets turned upside down and predictability goes out the window. I was playing a silly anime girl game with some heavy plot elements when suddenly I found myself in something more like what GRRM would have done (though not as deep or well-written, obviously). Good thing i've gotten used to that sort of thing. XD\n\nStill not on board with Claude or where the plot takes her, though the scene with Ava going through the Medical Clinic later in the game was hilarious.\n\nSo, how is LD? It's alright. Is it overpriced for it's length? Yes. Did the devs perhaps spend too much time on boosting the budget with VA's and better art when they should have spent more time making game content? Probably. Is it a bad game? I don't think so. Most importantly, do I want to know what happens next in the Sunrider series? Yes. The preview for the next game (whenever that shows up) sounds like things are about to get even more insane as new players enter the fray that could change everything. Things to come certainly are looking interesting, :o\n\nUntil next time!\n\nEDIT: Just played the 3.0 Update that adds the [RE]turn storyline to the game. No battles to fight, but a good VN experience where the choices you make can lead to happiness... or dying horribly. Also it lets you follow story routes for most of the rest of the crew (Asaga, Ava, Sola, Icari, and a secret Claude ending). It's more good stuff. Best of all, it was a free DLC. It's addition not only lets you play a new story after you finish Liberation Day, but makes an already decent game even better. :D","March 13","true","19.6"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

I love the Sunrider series and it's great and it deserves more attention it should get.\nNow this....ugh...I waited for this for months, Am one of the few who pledged the full price before it was released. There was so much hype for this game and I guess I bought it into but I dont regret supporting the developers. Now lets get to the review\n\nI REALLY WANTED TO LOVE THIS GAME AND IT HAS IT MOMENTS BUT it broke my heart like my ex-fiance did to me. The game starts starts out great but get uninteresting and the plot becomes obivous and the ending is so horrible,so ♥♥♥♥ed up that you just be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for wasting the time. This game broke my heart. I'll make this simple\n\nPros\n-Better style(drawings of  certain characters\n-Theme song rocks!\n-Still funny as the First arrival and Mask of Arcadius\n-FAR BETTER ENDING THEN 1.0's ending\n\nCons\n\n-Plot\nThe plot of this one is to take back Cera, a planet which has been hyped but it dies in this one. The story did a decent enough job but when you get to the end, you just end up not caring when you get the real ending. The plot was also really obivous who was the villian and the villian was a mary sue and had a dull personality\n\n-Story is short, about 4-6 hours\n\n- Combat is the same with no real improvements!\n\n-LAG!!! How can you have lag in a ♥♥♥♥ing novel where most of your game is ♥♥♥♥ing texts with pictures and nothing else? This isnt a true game! the game is poorly optimized and with the game running at a solid 5-10FPS in most cases especially if your trying to speed through a mission. Thankfully it only lags during battles.\n\n-Forced romance whiether you want to or not!\n\n-When one of the main characters die after rallying anyone in the final battle and everyone cries when they die, afterwards no one is cares afterwards, no memorial, no funeral, they dont talk to themselves about them besides Ava.\n\n-All character development was wasted besides Icari and Kyska.\n\n-NO combat scenes anymore(WTF) Scnes dont count lol\n\n-NO ENGLISH! as someone who speakes english and is a american, its hard to watch or read something in a different language but here its dumb. The first two games had small dialog of English but they fit and they sounded real where now they been replaced with japanese voice actors and sound so generic. They did to make money but still...\n\n- All supporting characters,ships,mechs still look out of place or havnt been updated with new graphics.\n\n- I felt as none of my choices didnt matter in the end\n\nI could do this forever but the bottom line, play First Arrival, Mask of Arcadicus and if you like those, pirate this and if you like, then buy it and support the developers. This game is not worth 25$, more like 10$","March 4","false","24.7"," 54 of 76 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","54","76","3","2"

I had instantly become enamored when I first finished and was excited to see more as I became interested in all the characters. (Solamancer btw) After MoA and Academy I was excited for this game Liberation day, it had sent me into Mass Effect 3 frenzy all over again. I became a Patreon supporter so that I could get Beta access and have a copy of the game reserved at launch!\n\n\nGame Review: Ver1 was a bitter experience for myself. This mediocre version of the game had completely neglected the story and its paltry choices left me dumbfounded. While the gameplay by itself was well done and the Japanese voice acting was impressive, that too was hampered by slowdown from the new game engine. A final note is that I am one of those who run through on waifu mode because I'm more interested in the story aspects which Ver1 stumbled on at the end with a seemingly fatalistic ending and railroaded relationship with your science officer.\n\nVer2 largely retained the gameplay features with a few bug fixes but its main contribution was the addition of an epilogue to reintroduce choices into the game and to show that this was not your character's final act but simply a chapter closed and a new foe to face.\n\nThe DLC: I write this review after having played REborn and this was the best part of the game by far in terms of choices and story as it now allowed choices to create unique paths and reach new endings. The game would always encourage you to try again if you reached a bad ending or even aim higher if you reached the "normal/alt" endings. It was worth a bad ending or two to figure out the secret to getting the good endings. (Thanks Wanderer!}\n\nSola love!\n\nAll in all it was a pleasant experience in the end.

But bugs can be fixed.\n\nStory issues... that's another thing.\n\nIf I'm honest, the start and ending felt fine to me - the issue was that they were painfully linier. Even having the same ending with minor variations to it would have been better then stripping out practically all the choice and thematic RPG elements that made the first two Sunrider games so enjoayble. It feels like there is an entire chapter, or maybe even two, that is missing between the end of the prolouge levels and the start of the Cera invasion - like the first few episodes and last few episodes of a series were just stapled together. Add to that the linier romance choices in a game that practically objectified having multiple girls in it, and it feels like this game made a massive failling narratively.\n\nIt has better production values and full Japanese VO's, but in all honesty it's not worth the trade-off of axing the wonderful story that had been developing. The VO's are great and all, but feels painfully like the majority of the budget went there instead of developing the story, and it really wasn't worth it for something that, let's face it, is pretty much just a gimic - Sunrider Academy felt like it got more love story/writing-wise then Liberation Day did.\n\nTruthfully, it's not a 'Bad' game - but it is straightforward and certianly is dissipointing. If I were to put it in mecha-anime-fan terms, Liberation Day is to Sunrider what Gundam SEED Destiny is to Gundam SEED; it is a lackluster continuation when everything is said and done compared to what the prior had to offer, and I really do not think it's worth a 24.99 price tag (just 5$ shy of equaling Sunrider Academy's price) when it has barely a third of the story-content and an eighth of the actual choice oppertunities compared to Sunrider Academy.\n\nIt's not a horrid game, but I just cannot reccomend it - at least not at the current price. And for someone who's been a fan of the series since it was on Kickstarter, it really hurts me to say that.","March 5","false","21.9"," 53 of 75 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","53","75","0","1"

I feel like the writers are skilled enough to make them very important to the end.\nNow, I believe this is worth your time and money due to the skillful writing and story of the game. The universe and characters feel very fleshed out. The strategy of the gameplay is fun, and very difficult if you choose to make it so.","March 10","true","23.6"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","37","49","0","0"

I LIKED IT BEFORE BUT IT WAS A DIVISIVE PART OF THE GAME, EVEN I HAVE TO SAY IT'S A VAST IMPROVEMENT.\n\nOk, just to get it out there, I'm a big fan of the series and have played everything attributed to Love in Space so i'm going to be biased. That said, I was a little disappointed with some parts of this game though I still very much recommend it provided you've played it's predecessors. This review will probably be quite long, so bear with me, if you find this unhelpful please leave a comment to clarify your gripes and I can try to improve it. Otherwise i'll assume it's simple downvote spam because I liked the game lol\n\nNEGATIVES:\n\n- Short. Much shorter than the pricetag suggests at first but similar in length to the previous installments so that should really be no surprise to any buyers who have actually played the games. V2.0 adds some extra length to the end of the story, around 25-40 mins or so of dialogue which helps.\n\n- Linear. Choices and dialogue options are incredibly restricted in this game to the point where there are somewhere in the ballpark of ~5 decisions to make in conversations. I'll come back to this later.\nV2.0 adds more choices into the extra story at the end of the game, though they aren't particularly big choices it's nice to have them\n\n- Cliché. Personally I am fine with clichés as long as they're done well, and I think this game succeeds at this. Some people will turn their nose up at it though, so it has to be mentioned.\n\n- POTENTIAL SPOILER WITH NO SPECIFICS:  Weird forced romance despite previous decisions. Some of us are wholly not into the pairing that is embedded into the story, but it plays a role so i'm ok with it. Some people will be more irritated than me though.\n\n- Feels.... Easier than MoA? Maybe it's the new systems for upgrades and equipment or the combat tweaks, but it felt easier than the previous games up until very late in. This might disappoint some. Draw Fire is particularly overpowered right now, though that may be addressed at some point.\n\n- Spelling and grammatical errors. Eh who cares, it totals a massive 3-4 mistakes in my playthrough. Nothing particularly bad.\n\nOk enough of that depressing ♥♥♥♥ lets get to why I still love this game\n\nPOSITIVES:\n\n- Imports your save from the previous games. Helps you feel like it's a direct continuation of your game, though as i've only done a playthrough and a half I haven't seen all the differences previous choices can make, will probably update this in future when It's more clear how much it affects the game\n\n- Vast improvements to combat and combat animations. The jumps to closeups and clunky attack animation screens of the previous games are reduced or cut to make combat look and feel more fluid. Flak, shields and armour are much more visible than before making it easier to make decisions in battle\n\n- Visual upgrades. This game looks amazing, pretty much every character and scene is fantastic and the in-cockpit screens are beautiful. The one exception being the admiral as always. His face reminds me of raisins and haunts me.\n\n- Voice acting. Pretty much fully voiced, though only in japanese. This is FINE. People of course are complaining about it, and with V2.0 they added the ENG battle voices back into the game (same as the MoA voices) with an option to disable the Japanese story voiceover.\n\n- Shop/Upgrade system overhaul. Two resources, one for buying equipment and one for upgrading your ryders and the sunrider. You can undo your upgrades at any time and reallocate the intel to other areas if you're having trouble with a specific thing. ( PLEASE DO THIS TO MAKE IT EASIER GUYS ) Soo much better than before.\n\n- Free restoration patch to remove the censorship. It's pinned in the discussions by the dev, so be sure to get this straight away or you're not playing the "full" game.\n\n- GREAT story. Yes it's a little cliche, yes one or two of the twists are pretty obvious ( NOT THAT LAST ONE DON'T YOU DARE LIE ). It's pretty linear, but i've only done one playthrough with my main save so I haven't seen all the options yet (a lot of the bonus stuff is still locked so there is more) The ending was a point of contention in the community, but with V2.0 they've greatly expanded upon it and objectively it is a more fleshed out ending. It carries a little less impact than the original in my opinion, but it's still enough to keep you hyped for the next installment of the game.\n\nSo here you go, I recommend this game and it's franchise to anyone who likes turn based strategy games, Visual novels, space operas, mechs or sci-fi Anime/Manga\n\nV1.0 = 8 / 10\nV2.0 = 9 / 10\n\nMoA = 9 / 10\n\nWould definitely cover myself in butter and slide about in this game again.\nI'm commander shepard and Sunrider is my favorite franchise on the citadel.\n\n\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~ORIGINAL EARLY REVIEW~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIt's finally here, and even just a few minutes in you can tell it's well worth the wait.\n\n-IMPORTS YOUR SAVE FROM MoA!!!!! (Or tailor your own list of choices from the previous games)\n-Vast improvements to combat and combat animations (Soo smooth!)\n-Impressive visual upgrades including awesome in-cockpit screens\n-Tons of voice acted scenes so far (Seemingly only in Japanese with English subs)\n-Improved shop and upgrade system (we'll be seeing those a lot...)\n-FREE PATCH TO REMOVE THE CENSORSHIP (Pinned in the discussions)\n\nOh baby, I'm ready.

Love RPG-style visual novels in general? Well move along, because this game isn't what you're looking for.  There are only 2 or 3 choices throughout the game and, when you do make them, all your choices (from MoA, as well, which is a small plus) just provide flavor text without affecting anything in the story.  You don't even get a ship screen like you did in MoA.\n\nYou're forced into a romance with one of the more boring girls,  just so her betrayal (via Alice) and death affect the protag more, though most players probably would've felt the shock and horror regardless , while Claude, Krysta, and Icari (best waifu) are all pushed to the wayside, and all interactions with Asaga and Ava are only there to provide jealousy.   Did you end up capturing Cosette? Well you never get to talk to her or try to persuade her to join you (though she'd obviously stab you in the back), as both her and L7NN are forgotten about fairly quickly.   Oh, and remember how in MoA you say a bunch of nice things to Sola and she starts falling for you? Well forget about that, now she's an emotionless drone who does nothing but observe Asaga.\n\nAside from a few marked improvements in gameplay and art style which have been mentioned in other reviews, Sunrider: Liberation Day is just lazy and seems to only exist to put money into the pocket of the developer.  For the most part, it's a copy-paste of MoA with a few new units, and an altered (not upgraded) store/research system.  I honestly feel bad for those who supported this game on Patreon, because it feels like the developer just took all that Patreon money so he could take a trip to Japan and justify it with unneeded Japanese voice-acting.  I've seen a lot of backers leave since the release of this game, which I'm assuming are due to the fact that next to none of the expectations were met, so the next installment (oh yeah, it ends with a "to be continued") will probably be worse than Liberation Day if it even gets made.\n\nSo to take away from this and other reviews, unless the game is heavily discounted or you can burn money, just wait for someone to do a "Let's Play" of it, because it'll be pretty much the same experience.","March 5","false","12.0"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","31","41","2","0"

Developers learning from their mistakes, and community interaction. The game had so many issues at launch. Where were the choices? why didn't we have a star map anymore? why didn't we have a ship map anymore? What the heck was that ending supposed to be? Luckily, the Devs took note of these issues and the game's mixed reviews of about 50%. Now with the 2.0 patch, restoring missing content and fixing issues, the games has a positive score of about 70%. Amazing. but the game is nowhere near perfect, you can't simply patch out the main story, but Love in Space, unlike others, made an effort. So without further praise, it is my pleasure to announce my review of....\n\nSunrider: Liberation Day\nWhat kind of game is this? How do you play? What do you do?\nSunrider: LD is a tactical turn-based game set in space. It is a direct sequel to Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius, preciously released on steam for free. It is also a visual novel. The story is told in a VN style outside of battles. It has heavy focus on story telling with fire emblem style battles. Your goal is to avenge your home planet of Cera after the tragic events of the 1st game.\n\nControls\nThe game is controlled entirely with the mouse.  Unless you intend to do some tinkering in the game's console, cheater.  It controls just fine. 10/10\n\nSound\nThe game sounds great. Fantastic OST, with loads of voice acting. On top of that, the 2.0 patch brings back the old English voice actors from the 1st game. The theme song by Iced Blade is sold as DLC for a rather high price, but it retains the quality of everything listed. 10/10\n\nGraphics\nThe game looks great. There are no 3D models, but that doesn’t hold it back at all. All 2D sprites are well crafted and look fantastic in HD. The OP and Vanguard cut scenes are well animated, as well as the combat animations. However, there is a slight lack of said cut scenes. I understand the development cost, and the fact that this is a visual novel, but it felt a bit empty to me. A return of the old battle cut scenes would be nice as well, for those of us who had a PC that could run them. 8.5/10\n\nDifficulty\nThe game's difficulty is completely up to you. Want to die forever? set it to the hardest mode. Just want the story? Set it to waifu mode. It fits almost every player, no matter what skill level. I found myself playing through on normal, and I still had to retry a few times, and I’m okay with that. 10/10\n\nStory\nProbably where the game struggles most. You made your calls in the 1st game, and sure, it may alter the course of the game a little bit, but that’s the issue, a little bit. The biggest complaint about this game is the lack of choose-able routes for girls. No matter what you do, you will be forced into a route with 1 girl. The game has 8 female characters, but you have no call over who is your favorite. The 1.0 ending was confusing, but the 2.0 engine fixed it. Sadly, it could not fix other things that had already been done 5/10\n\nPerformance\nThis game is a visual novel. it should run on a potato, right? No, you’re going to need 3gigs of ram and in I3 according to the specs. Why? because they're getting a turn-based strategy to run on a visual novel engine. Is this impressive? Yes! Is this how it should be programed? Probably not. Forgive me if I have no idea what I’m saying, perhaps I don’t understand. But I feel like the specs are way too high for a game with no 3d models. 4/10\n\nOverallAs I said Sunrider LD is not a perfect game, but it is one that is worth the time the developers put into it. I can’t recommend you but it at is full price, as the story is too short, but it is a game that deserves to be played. If you haven’t already, I recommend you play the 1st Sunrider, and see what you think. I wish I could give this game a higher score, but it’s just not up to it. However, the story is not over, there will be a 4th installment to the series, and I expect nothing but greatness from the love in space development team\n\n7.5/10 - Recommended","March 15","true","10.1"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","24","29","2","0"

Unfortunately it was a very different experince but not all change is bad so let's discuss the improvments of Liberation Day:\n\n-The art is better\n-The UI is easier to read\n-The overlong combat animations are gone\n\nThose are the improvments. Now let's take a look at all the ways this game has changed for the worse compared to its predecessor.\nFirst and most suprisingly: this game runs like ♥♥♥♥. Strange for a visual novel with some strategy combat and less animations than the first game. Strange for this to be a problem on a PC that can run The Witcher 3 on rather high settings without problems. And it is strage that it is so bad that the stutering actually made me select the wrong options multiple times because the game couldn't keep up with my mouse. This is just unacceptable.\n\nSecondly the lenght. By all accounts this game is way shorter than Mask of Arcadius (which was free), there are plenty of games for half the price of this one that will give you many times the value.\n\nAnd finally my biggest problem: linearity. Mask of Arcadius had quite a few choices. Such as simple dialoge options, who to talk to between missions, what missions to take and even a few moral dilemmas that took quite some time for me to decide on. Nothing of the sort here. There are hardly any dialoge options, you do all missions in a set order and there is mabey one choice that affects the story.\n\nTo close this little review I wish to ask an open question for any passing Einstien to answer: Why in the name of all that is holy would you write a cast consisting almost exclusively of cute anime girls and then force the player to romance the most boring one? It boggles the mind!\n\nI have a lot of thinking to do. In short: unless you are a millionaire you probaly have better things to spend your money on.

This will be altered when 2.0 is released***\n\nNow don't get me wrong I adore this game series, it happens to be my favourite series of all time, and normally I wouldn't leave a review till I'd 100%'d the game or had a reasonable amount of hours but I think some feedback is needed here. I understand the problems with getting 'hyped' for a game and what it can do to your expectations so I did my very best to moderate my excitedness for this game ever since it was announced however that didn't seem to help.\n\nThis isn't a bad game for what it offers and there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been said by some of the other reviews but what I can say is that this game could have been so much more and  should  have been so much more. It lacks what I loved in Academy. The gameplay is solid, except for the fact it takes me 20 minutes to select a unit, and the story it offers is good as a continuation from Mask of Arcadius but, as said before, it could have been so much more. The game contains no romantic choice whatsoever which was probably what angered me the most (Yes I know it may not have made sense in the context of MoA's story). From memory there are about maybe 4 choices at the most in the game which begs the question of "Why not just make it linear?" consider there is really only one logical choice in them. The choice really feels forced.\n\nI never actually thought I'd leave a negative review for any game at all in this series consider how much I love it but I don't feel right just leaving this alone. I don't want a refund. I take a form of dumb pride having this in my library because I love these games so much so I'd never even consider something like that. I just feel the game underperforms for it's pricetag.\n\nApologies if this is poorly written. I decided not to spend 20 hours on the review itself which is coincidentally  much more time than I would have spent in game.","March 5","false","005.7"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","0"

Rarely have i seen so much investment in an indie visual novel franchise, which proves that we as the fanbase really care about Sunrider. This game isn't perfect, but does it really deserve such a backlash? The problem is that people compare it to MOA and yes, compared to it Liberation day does seem to lack in a few parts. But the game is still awesome for what it is. The combat, which was already great in MOA, has improved quite a lot. And i'm not only talking about the animations. It is much more balanced now, and Ryders that were frickin useless in MOA (I'm looking at you, Icari) now kick some serious ***. The Upgrade and Store mechanics have improved, the Visuals, bla bla bla. So, the major problem people have is the story. It's... fine. It continues the story of MOA in a logical sense with a few ( :P ) twists at the end.

Do you like having your decisions matter in a game? Do you like being able to choose the path the story takes?\n\nIf so, DO NOT buy this game, coming from a Sunrider Academy lover.\n\nHere are the pros and cons...though it possesses far more of the latter than the former. Slight spoilers, but nothing too specific said below just to put it all into context.\n\n\nPros:\n\n-Combat system is nice, and non-intrusive if you want to just deal with the storyline.\n\n-It has some great characters, such as Ava, Kryska, Icari, and Sola, but...\n\n\nCons:\n\n-None of these characters get enough focus, because the game is too short.\n\n-Plot is wholly predictable and every twist can be called from a mile away, which is why it is infuriating that you are unable to do anything about them at any given point. In fact, your player character, Kayto Shields, actively ARGUES with those who are like "hey, this is a bad idea" so that the plot can be railroaded in a certain direction.\n\n-In a game, a visual novel no less, with so many characters one would think they would get to choose who they romance...This is not so in Liberation. Instead, You are forced to romance quite possibly the least complex character, Chigara, who is the stereotypical nice girl who is shy...and that's it in terms of personality. No development. No real exploration. That's it. And your character becomes rapidly infatuated with her and they then become a couple.\n\n-Branching off of this, the game's twist at the end would be WHOLLY AVOIDABLE if the game gave you any agency of your character. Basically, as the game's pre-release material stated, there's a traitor on your crew...and instead of chucking her out into space at any given point despite people being suspicious (rightly or wrongly) in addition to all logic pointing to them, you instead have to deal with them the entire game and then they ruin your happiness at the end.\n\n-Despite barely giving us enough in this game itself, they put a "To Be Continued" at the end and a glimpse of what is to come...only, the thing is that I would like to resolve the things that the game itself forgets to before we move on to a whole new plot.\n\n-As previously mentioned, your choices do not matter. You like Ava and want to romance her and not Chigara? Too bad, even if you take EVERY anti-Chigara choice you still end up with her. You decide to trust a group or not trust them? Well the funny thing is that it never becomes relevent. None of your decisions seem to, which is a shame since their set up seems like it could have led to a great plot...the game's creators just didn't seem to care to grant the payoff.\n\n-Also as mentioned, the game is extremely short for its price. If you want a good Sunrider game or Visual Novel, play Sunrider Academy. THERE you get to actually make decisions that matter, and dear boring Chigara is optional.\n\n-They make a one dimensional character FINALLY likable by basically having them point out that none of the characters are happy with the forced romance either, save an ally at the same time, and reveal depth that we did not know existed...and then they die instantly thereafter. I know the battlefield isn't a place to give nice speeches, but to kill off a character who just finally got to shine for the first time in two entire games is just irritating.\n\n-This isn't a con for me personally, but I know some others will find it to be one: the game is "clean" for the most part, minus about 2 scenes. I don't care for hentai, but others do, so this is for them. Again, play Sunrider Academy if you want that.\n\n-They invested a great deal of time in certain subplots and relationships, only for the majority to not payoff at all. It's tragic too, because you can see that there was potential there, but for some reason they decided to not utilize their own narrative tools.\n\n-Also, the English voice cast was replaced entirely by the Japanese voice cast and they have not yet added the English voices back in. They could have made them an option at least, but I miss hearing Dragonball Z Abridged's Android 18 as Ava, among other fun voices. Instead I went from knowing all the voices in Mask of Arcadius to confused by those in this one, with some not even sounding too fitting for the characters while still being a good performance. Having grown attached to the voice actors through the first game, it's a shame that they got wholly shafted in this one.\n\n-Forced drama at the end. Yes, Kayto Shields, that person hurt someone you care about...but that person you care about just caused smallscale GENOCIDE, so yes, someone shot them. You should have done it yourself, but again, no choices. Just railroaded all the way through.\n\n-Claims to be a regular visual novel, but with how it all turns out it really is just a kinetic visual novel (one where you are just on the rails, watching it unfold like a movie). The combat interrupts this in a way, but seeing as how exploitable it is, even that becomes a chore at times since you know exactly how the battle will go the moment it begins.\n\nSo, all in all, please do not waste your time nor money on this game. I would not even recommend it on sale, even a 90% sale, and this is coming from someone who loved Sunrider Academy. I really wanted to love this game. I really wanted to enjoy it...but they gave me nothing to actually enjoy.\n\nI had come into it hoping that all the time and effort I put into making decisions previously would matter...that I could "win" or at least achieve some kind of goal by doing things a certain way...but the game said no, and forced me to go down the specific path I did not want us to go.\n\nIf you find enjoyment in it, I am happy for you, but as someone who enjoys stories and characters beyond all else in games, I cannot reccomend this to anyone.","March 10","false","5.1"," 39 of 64 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","39","64","0","0"

As a huge fan of both the original Sunrider and Sunrider academy, I was greatly dissapointed with the overall game. Nothing really added to the story and it seemed that the end was a rushed mess that left the player with no real clue as to what the point of this installment was.\n\nWhile some factors of the game like dividing the cost of ship upgrades and the store was a welcomed change, everything else, especially the story line, seemed like a mess. While I support the first Sunrider and Sunrider academy and recommend those games to other players, I regret spending money on both the game and the production fund fo it.\n\nI can only hope that Love in Space will fix these issues for the sake of those who have loved their past games and supported them.

I really tried. But when you get a short game that features a linear story path where your options from the previous game dont matter..... It just hurts. There were some improvements such as separating the currency bewtween shopping and upgrading, along with a combat that doesnt completely rely on kinectics which actually made the combat somewhat fun but the original reason why i stayed with the series was the story which ended as a rip-off of an episode of Game of Thrones at best.\n\nThe main issue that i've seen in my experience and along with other reviews is that as a player, you have no connection to the story in this game. Sure the same cast comes back and some crazy stuff happens, but there's no moment where you feel attached to the new plot of the story. What got my attention in the first part of the series was the ability to learn about the characters who were in the story and discover this new universe that was so wonderfully designed. Liberation Day however, doesnt do that. Instead its only a singular war and the threat of a traitor that drives this game throughout the entire time with only one character who actually matters and the rest being side notes. The love of the characters that i had in the first game died in this seque. I hope one of the developers see this because i honestly hope that there's another game where this doesn't happen. I WANT to love this series and all the characters that come out, but there needs to be reason to. MoA and First arrival did this. Liberation Day took that all away.","March 5","false","12.1"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

Quite a bit has changed from MoA and after playing through what is apparently now known as 1.0 (2.0 being a planned update that will rehash the story ending and bring back some lost MoA features) I can safely say that as a strategy RPG title, Sunrider stands loud and proud.\n\nOur hull is holding! - The Great:\n\n- Alot of MoA's clearly specialised ryder craft didn't actually have alot of specialization behind them apart from raw stats. LD changes this a bit by giving your units a few upgraded and a few more completely new abilities that really set them apart from each other. Where as in MoA it didn't reeeeaaaalllly bother me if a unit was knocked out of action, now in LD I can really feel the set back as I lose an entire front of strong counters for my recklessness in the form of a single loss.\n\n- The cinematic value of LD has spiked unbelievably so in comparison to its past entry, which as far as Visual Novels go, was pretty darn cinematic and gripping (if at times rushed) in its own way. The Sunrider and her crew have really come to life here in the story sequences.\n\n- Complementing LD's cinematic spike is all new art that cures the majority of same-face syndrome from MoA.\n\n- Dat soundtrack. A good portion reused from MoA, but that's not a bad thing.\n\n- XO Crescentia has taken the liberty of automatically declining any and all escort missions. Good on you commander.\n\nOur hull is beginning to fracture! The Good:\n\n- As mentioned above, your units are each altered a bit in how they function in LD, and since a single loss can feel potentially feel monumental, this also leads to rage and confusion moments when such units are lost to the overwhelming odds you face in this game. The Sunrider's captain must be of sound tactical mind to get anywhere. At all.\n\n- Command points have been redesigned to be less blatantly spammable, with a hard cap of 4000. (5000 with the upgrade) Vanguard uses all 4000 points, so it really feels like your ultimate gambit and the dramatic sequence that plays everytime you use it cements that.\n\n- All mini battle scenes that played out in MoA whenever a unit took an action besides movement have been cut out of LD. At first this struck me as a disasterous cut, but then I remembered just how unbelievably laggy MoA could be at times, largely due to the demand those scenes put on the struggling game engine. Small on board animations now play out for actions taken. The frame and responsiveness improvement is monumental and will help most anyone that might have missed the scenes to get over it. Overall, a step in the right direction in my opinion.\n\nSections 32, 60, and 2 have been compromised! - The Mixed\n\n- You have pretty much no choices to make in LD. On the other hand LD does a decent job of playing off choices you made during MoA. I get the feeling of the same approach Muv-Luv Alternative took, where as the series went on, the actual choices you made and how much they mattered became less and less due to the odds the protagonist faced. The concept can be said to be the same here, but it isn't pulled off nearly as well. Some situations can be so utterly nonsensical that it will break your story immersion in favor of facepalm spam.\n\n- The ship map is gone. (For 1.0 at least. Apparently to return in 2.0 update) The map vanishing felt like a big loss to me at first, but then I got to thinking, even if the ship map was still here, what would that change? I would still run through every scene, every side mission, and I'm still getting to R&D just fine. The only thing that changed would be the feeling of Kayto moving through the ship wherever you clicked to trigger the scenes being shown. An interesting change of psyche over something so simple.\n\nHull breaches on Deck 0! - The Bad\n\n- Despite attempts to solve the problem, battle lag is still the Sunrider's greatest nemesis. It can get to old MoA levels of rapid clicking to hasten turns accidentally giving units bad orders.\n\n- The story is all over the place. Everything done and timed just right in some places and then completely wat in others.\n\n- You still don't see or care about any of the Sunrider's other crew. A wasted opportunity, but understandably skipped in the face of so much more content that would have to be made for them in order to do it well.\n\n- Do you prefer English dubbed voices? Yes? WELL THEN TOO BAD! (To be addressed for battle scenes in 2.0)\n\nOur systems are catastrophically failing one after another! - The Really Bad\n\n- Who wrote those ending plot twists? Seriously? For what possible reason?\n\n- At times the balancing can feel way off, when in actuality everything is working in a fair manner. Just not for you.\n\n- This one is more just me, but I remember way more high percentage misses and low percentage hits than normal. The latter half of LD saw me not having faith in whatever numbers the game saw fit to show me for shot calculations. For a turn based strategy, these numbers are all this game has in the end.\n\nReccommend we abandon ship! - Whhhhhyyyyyy???????\n\n- By now it's no mystery. Dat ending and those final scenes that lead up to it are just plain stupid. There was no reason to do that beyond creating potential sequel (or prequel) bait. It does a good job of making you feel like you wasted your time.\n\nThe Sunrider is at your command - The Verdict\n\n- Well, the good and the bad wrap up nicely enough. As long as you ignore certain story developments, wasted characters and potential, and head cannon your way through the stupid, Liberation Day is a great game to own and play.\n\ntl;dr\nits kay.","March 11","true","22.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

I am very torn since the first game I got free and I have nothing but respect and love for the creators, so much so that I bought this game without hesitation or looking at the reviews. So as a story sequel, this is worthy of purchase, especially if you got Mask of Arcadius free.\n\nBad part, it seems a majority of the budget was spent on voice acting, which for me didn't add anything since it was all japanese, which is proper to form but, still it took away from my game. Secondly, feature that i liked, were removed without option to toggle. Like I enjoyed the close up animations of the ships firing but now gone. I enjoyed the english announcements during combat especially when there are no subtitles in combat I would miss when new enemies appeared so it started to affect gameplay. I don't understand why there was no toggle for this as well. Finally it's buggy, my game crushed about 5 times on a playthrough which was ok and not ok cause it was short tooo short. Or at least the story felt short. I understand why it felt that way but as a stand alone game it's too short.\n\nMy main advice do not buy this without playing Mask first. Do buy if you have played Mask if you just want a decently resolved story with some genuine and brave twists.","March 6","true","13.9"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","20","30","0","0"

(That being said, it might be a good idea to wait for it if you haven't bought the game.)\n\nHere's the link to the dlc announcement: http://sunrider-vn.com/sunrider-liberation-day-return-announced/?age-verified=0cee2757c0\n\nEven though I'm pretty excited to get what's basically a free game, I will say that [RE]turn sounds like a really dumb name. Hopefully the sequel won't get changed to [RE]birth. Now, onto the actual review:\n\nAs a fan of the previous games (which are free, if you haven't played it yet then get to it), this game is a 10/10 for me. I  really like the v1.0 release, although many people did not. The v2.0 made a few fixes to the gameplay and extended the ending. However, I really loved the 1.0 ending and would reccommend playing that one first, then installing 2.0 to see the extended ending. I'll give some general pro/cons and then some spoiler-free details about the two different versions.\n\nCONS\n\n- Poor optimization. I've heard that Renpy is a bad engine and in my experience makes my cpu run at mach 10. I've also heard that pretty much every VN uses this engine, so we'll just have to keep dealing with it I suppose.\n\n- There are no choices in this game. Like, at all. There is a single, mostly meaningless choice Only in the 2.0 extended ending are there choices like there were in the previous games.\n\n- Forced romance route. I thought it was a very good route that served the story well, but I understand a lot of people play this as a waifu game, and in this category it's lacking. If this was the main draw of the game for you consider getting it on sale.\n\n- Side missions are both required and rather dull. Not a huge complaint, but the side missions felt like filler and lacked the humor of the filler missions in past games. (looking at you, escort mission from hell)\n\n- Quite a bit shorter than the other sunriders, probably 5-6 hours. The additional ending adds an hour or so. (My own playtime is off because I played it before buying on steam)\n\n- I think the game is best experienced by playing 1.0 first, then the expanded ending. Inconveniently, the saves are incompatible and you will need to rush through on easiest difficulty. (It didn't take me that long, be sure to hold down ctrl for the skip button)\n\nPROS\n\n+ Fantastic story. This is the best one so far, and it more than makes up for the things I listed as cons, such as the short length, lack of choices, and routes. If you liked the end of MoA, this one is even better.\n\n+ INTENSE story. The marketing for this game made it pretty clear that you would be betrayed, and the game didn't disappoint.\n\n+ Significantly prettier. Looks better in every way. The characters, backgrounds, and UI have all gotten a lot of love.\n\n+ More improvements to the gameplay. One notable change is the command points, which are now capped at 4000, upgradable to 5000. Rather than hoarding your points to pull levers, you will regularly use it in combat, and it gets a boost from every non-vanguard kill (during the mission instead of after).\n\n+ Voiced, in Japanese. I just disabled voices, so this didn't add anything for me.\n\n+ Gorgeous soundtrack, but you knew that already. There's a new vanguard cannon song (that's longer than 45s!!!) and a very good OP, and I think a couple other background tracks.\n\n+ I am expecting there continued dev support, because they've done so for MoA, which recieved an upadte, and Academy, which was on early access. They've responded to their somewhat negative feedback by releasing 2.0, and may do more in the future. (Updated: They ABSOLUTELY will be doing more in the future, in case you didn't notice the bold text at the top. According to the link, it's going to be twice as long, and will feature life-or-death choices and several routes. Notably lacking is a Chigara route, this might be because of spoiler reasons or just something they didn't mention. It won't be voiced either, but I don't care because I don't speak Japanese.)\n\nNow, onto the different versions. The game, as of the time I installed it, 3/12, will default to v1.0. I would recommend you leave it at that at first. To opt in to v2.0, right click on the game and go to properties, then the beta tab. There is a drop down menu with two choices. Here is the changelog: http://steamcommunity.com/app/358750/discussions/0/405694115198117174/\n\nv1.0:\n\n+ I'm pretty sure that this is the ending as it was intended. The other one is good, for sure, but I think it was scrapped to become the beginning of Sunrider 4.\n\n+ There is a rather simple but fairly major change in the story pacing prior to the ending in v2.0. It took away some of the dramatic effect that was in 1.0. This is one of the main reasons that I recommend v1.0 first.\n\n+ The point I'm trying to back in the above is that v2.0 is slightly more accessible at the cost of the story being a bit more hand-holdy. It explains things that could be inferred, and generally makes it clear that it is setting up the next game. Some people were confused or unsure about if there would be a sequel and wanted more to the ending, and to me 2.0 feels like it was released as a response to that, because, in part, it was. It's not a BAD ending, I just don't think it's the BEST ending. It's like an epilogue tacked on to a great story.\n\n+ You can still play 2.0 afterwards.\n\nv2.0:\n\n+ You get the whole story in a single playthrough, which will save around an hour of your time. 1.0 does not have the extended ending and  If a future release is compatible with 1.0 saves, or you wanted to replay it anyway, this is a non-issue, however as it stands you need to suffer the inconveinence of skipping through every battle. It's pretty easy to rush through the game on easy (you don't even need to buy upgrades, really), but it takes upwards of an hour. Hold down ctrl the whole time and it's not too bad.\n\n+ A couple aesthetic changes that bring back some of the good from the past games, taken from the changelog: - Ship map restored (that blueprint of the Sunrider where crewmates faces pop up) - Galaxy map restored (however this doesn't matter much since side quests are required. The weak side quests are just paced SLIGHTLY better this way) - Battle voices from MoA can now be turned on (rather than only having Japanese battle voices or no voices)\n\n- And of course, the ending. It's a good ending, but I think it works better if it's viewed as an extension to the original ending, that sort of bridges the gap between Liberation Day and Sunrider 4. It has a lot of very good stuff in it, it just doesn't conclusively end the game as well as 1.0 did. I would strongly recommend playing it, but wait until after finishing the first playthrough because 1.0 is such a strong ending.\n\nI'll probably update this again once the dlc is out, because why the hell not. I like these games.","March 12","true","11.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

More routes will also be added later on, so thankfully, the devs are responding to criticism and working to improve their game. I highly suggest waiting to buy the game until all new updates come out, because as it is right now, the game is not completed. There IS a good amount of story content right now, so if you're a fan of the series, I suggest trying out what's currently available. However, if you haven't even played the original, I suggest waiting until this game is completely finished, and then do the original, and then this one.\n\nv2.0Here is my quick re-review for the v2.0 content:\n\nThe later story content (late-game and v2.0) is AMAZING. I really look forward to the continuation of the story. There are so many plot twists, I was on the edge of my seat most of the time. It really plays with your emotions, and makes up for the somewhat predicatable story near the beginning of the game. I thought things were going to play out in a cliche way, but it turned out WAY better than I expected. However, the overall game is still relatively short, has a forced romance, hardly any side quests, etc. as people always complain about. I won't deny that. I believe these will all be fixed in future updates. This one update MAJORLY improves the game, and I sincerely hope that Samu-kun will continue to provide great content for this game. With the way the ending was set up (I will avoid spoilers) I believe that additional romances will open up in the game, as well as many new options for improvements. With what was foreshadowed for the future, there's an infinite amount of possibilities. I hope Samu-kun / Love in Space will milk this opportunity and add more content to THIS game, since the content that was supposedly for the next game has already been added in this v2.0 update. If, and I say *IF* there is a significant amount of content coming out as an update, I will say it's acceptable for it to come out as say, a $5 DLC for this game. On top of which, it's already a hassle to import the save from the original Sunrider, so having to do it again for another sequel would be a pain. Another good option would be to release new content as episodes.\n\nAll in all, I was really impressed with the content, despite all the mixed reviews. My only real disappointments were:\n- Choices not mattering all that much (even if you import your save, a lot of the old choices don't make much of a different in this game since they aren't really referenced... I think a lot of them will come into play in future content, though)\n- Battle maps being extremely laggy at times, and battles themselves being overly hard (I was able to play on Captain difficulty for a couple battles before it became overly hard, maybe I'm just bad?) Battles are still a ton of fun though, and the Vanguard Cannon animation is BADASS. The game could be a lot better if more awesome animations were added.\n- Plot-based forced romance (understandable, please offer more options in the future!) however it's a nice excuse to include Sunrider's first H scene so I'll let it go this time.\n- Minimal amount of side quests (they can't really be called side quests anyway, since they're important to the plot), but hopefully this will be fixed in future updates. I think if there were more it would fix the difficulty issues as well, and it could offer opportunities for more meaningful choices.\n\nOther than that, great work, Love in Space. I look forward to updates on this game. Please don't ruin this opportunity. I will continue being a $20 patron, so I expect more great work! Seriously, the story was so much better than I expected in this update, just continue with what you're doing and you're golden.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nFULL REVIEW\n\nOVERVIEWSunrider: Liberation Day is the sequel to Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius (or just Sunrider), which is a free game offered here on Steam. Sunrider Academy is also on steam, but it's a spinoff prequel to the original, isn't canon, and doesn't include all the characters of the original game. Skip to the bottom for a quick summary. Don't let my playtime fool you, I've been playing betas of this game for a long time now via Love in Space's Patreon.\n\nWHAT'S DIFFERENTLiberation Day is a very good sequel compared to the original. As one of the Patreon backers, I was able to follow this project from beginning to end. I must say it's been improved a lot. The battle mechanics, which were the main issue in the original game, have been improved. The graphics and animations have been improved. There's also a wider variety of music, and even a great OP.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that unlike the original game, the characters in this game are voiced in Japanese ONLY. The original Sunrider had only English VAs, but due to the R18 content in this game (if you get the Denpasoft edition mod http://steamcommunity.com/app/358750/discussions/0/405693392916238299/ ) they had to get professional Japanese VAs. This was also due in part to their stretch goal being reached on Patreon, where they said they'd get professional Japanese VAs for the game, as well as a great opening animation. They really have delivered.\nEDIT: Thanks to the v2.0 update, it's now possible to enable MoA battle voices, and to disable story voices, so it's more similar to the original game.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTEI *HIGHLY* recommend you play the original game first, otherwise you'll have no idea what's going on in this one. And you might as well, since it's free and only takes a couple hours to complete. The story is great, you make important choices, and it introduces you to all the different characters. And best of all, you can import your save from the old game into this one. If you copy your persistent save file from Mask of Arcadius(game/saves/persistent) into the same directory as Liberation Day, you will be able to import your choices from the original game when you hit Start. Sunrider is extremely plot-driven and there will be many battles. It's not all about the cute girls, so if you're looking for a cheap, quick eroge, look elsewhere.\n\nBATTLESAs for the battles themselves, it's a turn-based strategy game. You place your units (Ryders and ships) at the left, and the enemy approaches from the right (and sometimes other directions depending on the situation). Each unit has different strengths and weaknesses and has a variety of skills and other weapons to use. Some may be better for close range combat and travel fast, and others may be slow but hard hitting, for example. There's many strategic possibilities and you can choose how to level up your crew, as well as your ship (the Sunrider) itself. I don't want to spoil every mechanic of the game, but you get the general idea.\n\n<I removed some content here from my original review since it was taking up space I needed for the update above>\n\nSUMMARY / TL/DRSolid combat. Great music and art. Choices matter. Play the original first to know what you're getting into: http://store.steampowered.com/app/313730/ Access H scenes with http://steamcommunity.com/app/358750/discussions/0/405693392916238299/ Lots of cute girls.\n\nSHOULD YOU BUY?If you liked the original Sunrider, definitely! Just don't forget to import your save from the original.\nCopy your persistent save file from Mask of Arcadius (game/saves/persistent) into the same directory as Liberation Day. You can then import your choices from the original game when you hit Start.","March 4","true","12.0"," 42 of 71 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","42","71","4","0"

They also added various elements that went missing in the transition from Mask of Arcadius to Liberation Day such as the ship/galaxy maps and English voices for the combat missions, which are welcome additions, even if having the voices switch between languages can be strange to listen to.\n\nIf you are a fan of the previous Sunrider games, then I would definitely recommend Liberation Day as it is essentially more of what you have come to love in regard to the upgrading, combat and storytelling. If it happens to be on sale, that's even better ... Just make sure to play with V2.0 installed for a much more fulfilling experience.","March 14","true","22.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The story is an epic continuation with only a few points in which I am either confused or dissatisfied (This review is before the promised patch to add more story content). Combat is more adaptive in the sense you don't feel like you're just repeating one strategy over and over and the difficulty of the game makes more sense than the last game. There are a few minor bugs but the beta did a good job of removing the worst of them. The new character arts look amazing and the novel parts feel more in depth and interactive than the last game.

They keep teasing the routes but leave it linear as the dev said they didn't think we wanted as much of a dating sim as we're asking for. This makes no sense as that is what they are selling us.

I'm going out on a limb here, and support a company that shows they care for the product AND userbase. That's very rare in this day and age.\n\nAight.\nSunrider Mask of Arcadius was a free game I stumbled upon while browsing for a turn-based grid game. Little expectations, but boy was I in for a surprise. This totally free game with a couple of awkward moments :) turned out to be a GEM, everything about it screamed that it was happy with his creators. And the user/fan-base was likewise happy. Guys, you scored bigtime on my love-for-gamecompanies-meter, something that seldom happens anymore.\n\nSo, Love in Space created a little love on earth and I was curious where the next chapter would take us. Following the just released Liberation Day, it was kind of a surprise to see so many negative reviews, but mind you.. almost all the negative comments were correct and it broke my heart a little. But then something truly amazing happened:\n\nLove in Space read all those comments and instead of getting mad at us (like most companies nowadays) they showed their humble shame in a matter that I can only applaud and got to work at breakneck speed. These guys MUST have worked around the clock to deliver new installments to improve on the beatdown newest chapter. Believe me, as former 3D developer in the game market I know a bit or two about the work-hours prior to release. The tension and nightshifts eventually got to me (getting olderrr *ugh*) so I am a happy deskslave now :P. The amount of work spent on the improvements in such a short notice shows me two things: willingness to improve their product (it's primarily not treated as a sales-product, well eventually yes but they couldn't bear watching it being buried underground by a enraged fanbase) and I keep coming back to this, willingness to listen carefully to well.. us, as in the users. Haven't seen this kind of commitment in quite a while and I'm loving you for it, despite the mistakes in Liberation Day.\n\nHeck, we all make mistakes but it requires HEART to acknowledge this and come up with a solution. In the end, it's not how or why you fell, it's how (and why) you get up again! Triple Cudo's For That!\n\nSoooo, zero hours on the clock and this will stay for a while :). Currently running around in another game (Don't Starve Together) and it requires my attention and time.\n\nAs for the pricetag on Liberation Day, I have to strongly say: 'Meh..'\nIt being overpriced is clearly true, especially compared to previous releases lol, and even the discount can't really hide this fact. Well, on the other hand, they gave .. GAVE us a free game which turned out to be very special and even nice companies have to eat. Even Mother Theresa couldn't live on air alone and was depending on the karmic principal 'give love, get love'. So, my karmic little guy told me I already got much love from Love in Space, now it's maybe my turn to give something in return and show a little trust in people that can make mistakes, but also can admit it and get up again.\n\nBy your latest actions my broken heart was fixed, and I owe you this much for showing that not all game companies are heartless, moneygrabbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥. After release, it's so rare that products are improved upon, without the PAY FOR THIS DLC WHICH ACTUALLY SHOULD BE IN THE BASEGAME attitude...\n\nKEEP AT IT, LOVE IN SPACE!\nLove from Earth, Oldskool.\n","May 27","true","2.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","3"

Its Mass Effect meets the more recent Fire Emblems.\n\nLiberation day is the series version of Mass Effect 3, where your choices (all 4 of them) don’t do an awful lot. Your choices from the previous games don’t really do a lot either; did you spend your time talking up one character? Well too bad you’re locked into a romance that feels very forced in order to fit into the very short game. I kept waiting for the game to open up out of the prologue so that I could talk to my crew mates like in MOA and then the game ended.\n\nOn the positive end, combat has been greatly improved from MOA, the story is great as it goes along to its conclusion and the music and art are very high quality. However the length of the game does not justify the price.\n\nAll in all, Sunrider is a great series and you should play the previous game which is free on steam however you should wait for a big sale for this one due to the lack of sub-quests, choices and crew interaction that really made the previous Sunrider game unique.\n","March 5","false","13.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathzealotzero/recommended/358750/","deathzealotzero","anakin736","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathzealotzero/","30 products in account","Alright first I like to mention beware of spoilers when reading this for while I shall try to use spoilers tags but I may still drop one or two minor spoilers here or there in this review. Thank you.\n\nMoving on.\n\nOriginally, I played through this game and was quite enjoying it. The Japanese VAs were at first gratting but once the game picked up I started to like them. As for the Linear Storyline, I wasn't all that happy about it for I am a fan of Chiraga therefore didn't really mind it all that much. The game play itself was still similar to the other games in the series but adds some new stuff like Paladin's draw fire command, and the new mercenaries added to the game. This resulted in larger battles which where quite interesting.\n\nThen came the ending, and I just couldn't not believe what had happened. I was upset and angry at it like many others I am sure. I kind of figured there would be another game after this thanks to the TBC banner. But still the ending just was punch in the gut. One that I did not see coming. I get that Love In Space wanted a Cliffhanger that would bring in more players for the next half of the series. I understand that. But that wasn't the way to do a cliffhanger. As a writer and reader of fanfiction myself doing a cliffhanger like that often ends up with many readers dropping the story all together.\n\nA few hours after I beat the game I calmed down to look at the ending without being upset and I wondered what the next game would bring with the main ship and character dead. Finally Samu-kun announced the 2.0 update. I was at first was like it wasn't going to change much at all. Therefore wasn't expecting much to change when I played through the game a second time with the 2.0 update added. I may have missed a few of the new changes made to the story line as I was just breezing through the game to get to the ending to see what changes where made.\n\nFinally the ending started. At first I was like okay no real changes then the music changed and the missing two Ryders of the Sunrider Team show up to save the day. I was cheering like crazy, pumping my fist in celebration. But the Sunrider was still destroyed and my mood dropped like a rock wondering what was going to happen now. Then we see Kayto being saved by the Prototype Lynn. And I let out the breath that I did not know I was holding. I was like okay the Sunrider is destroyed, but the majority of the cast are okay, with only two dead. Then WHAM. Hello Claude I thought you were dead! My mood start soaring. Especially when it was mentioned that Chigara maybe still alive as well. I was like alright things are looking up. Then we get a peak into the second phase of the Neutral Rim War. While the Sunrider Crew gather themselves after the diaster that was Second Battle of Cera. The crew split up to prepare themselves for the next stage of the war. Then we get the same after-credit scene that the original ending had. Which makes things far more interesting. Though I do admit the ghost!Chigara scene freaked me out.\n\nAlright for those who haven't played the 2.0 update yet I recommend you do not read thoe above spoilers. For it will spoil the entire game. That said here is brief list on the pros and cons of Liberation day for me like other reviews.\n\nPRO\nAwesome new Soundtrack\nNew Add Ons Make the Game Far Better\nThe Japanese VA while at first not that good gets better as the game goes on\nThe Storyline\nCON\nGame was Too Short. Could have been longer.\nThe choice to change VA to English in the 2.0 Update is a bit out of synce of sorts with the rest of the game which is still Japanese\nCould have done VA for some of the mercenary units like in the other games. Only a few lines would have been good.\nThe Japanese In-Battle Chatter could have gotten subtitles or something.\nNeed an end game save at the end of the game.\nThat is about it for this review. I hope you enjoy the game. It may not be your cup of tea but for those who like these type of games it should a be a good choice.

Now, just for clarity I both Kickstarted Sunrider and support them on Patreon so my love for this game runs quite deep.\n\nNow then, Sunrider is a fantastic VN. I'm not ashamed to say it's probably one of my favourite VN's out of all the ones i've played, this is actually a close second to Fruit of Grisaia.\n\nAnyway, back to Liberation Day. Admittedly the price is a little high, but some may say it's probably worth it considering what it gives us. So I, like many absolutely hated the first ending that Love in Space gave us. However v2.0 completely changed the ending and gave us more to work with. It rounds out the first chapter of the Sunrider's history and paves the way for much more. The combat in the game is excellent and has been from the very start, and the addition of splitting the resources used for upgrades and store purchases works very well.\n\nIf I were posting this review with just the release patch, I wouldn't recommend it due to how short the ending was and how much it left unaswered, however patch 2.0 completely changed everything. It added a lot to the game in terms of the story aspect and allowed us to be satisfied with how the game ended whilst also leaving us wanting more.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? Yes.

(I brought this after the 2.0  release). There is some non-specific spoiler near the story review section.\n\nI have to admit I love the idea: Engrossing Sci-fi fiction, Mecha, and hot girls.  I brought all three games and played them from beginning to end, and have to admire some of the down-to-the-wire battles that you would never find in a anime. (Like the nightmare escort missions).\n\nUnfortunately, it feel apart after that.\n\nGameplay:\n\nI am not sure how a VN could actually lag so badly. My comp may be old, but it is no potato seeing it could run Witcher 3 on High graphics. But as soon as I go into Battle I start to suffer major FPS lag. Trying to order my ships to SHOOT is a nightmare in a half. By the time I reach the 3rd battle I turned on Waifu mode because I just WANT IT TO END.\n\nI give it 4/10.\n\nGame Balance:\n\nAnything better than Captain Mode is extremely balanced--and incredibly tough. A balanced Mecha Anime game with real tactics is something to be applauded.\n\n9/10.\n\n\nSound:\n\nIt was really jarring to hear Japanese only for the game, when all the girls spoke English the first two games. Japanese VA make things more...authentic? Yes. But also incrediablly jarring.\n\nAlso the Miner Union Frigate whines everytime I order it to do something, while other ships just depressingly BEEPS. They could at least copy/pasted the Alliance Cruiser. I want my troops to sound heroic...\n\n5/10.\n\nMusic:\n\n8/10 Fantastic Music....now if only I could enjoy it while TRYING TO ORDER MY BATTLE SHIP TO FIRE!!!!!\n\nStory:\n\nThere has been some fantastic writing this series (I especially adore the Battle of Ongress and a certain "threat", as well as the Battle of Farport)\n\nI won't spoil the ending, but sufficiently say it was absolutely depressing most of the choices I made didn't matter at all (for example, trust/not trust Solar Alliance). There is only one "waifu" (for a harem game??), and most of the plot were badily railroaded.\n\nBut the most horrible part of it all? The gross use of Deux Ex Machina in a TACTIC Game.\n\nWho need ships, battle strategy, when a couple girls can just have their eyes GLOW and suddenly 1-shot entire fleets? The devs built an storyline based on Balanced Mecha Battles...then toss it all out in the writing with a classic anime "rage power up."  Or hell, apparently someone in the game can even re-write the entire Universe at will.\n\nIf that is the case...why should we even bother?\n\nSo in the end, I can take the singular storyline, I can accept this game has a limited budget and thus devs couldn't setup an ending for every girl, the crazy plot twist and the cliched anime love/friendship debate...but after fighting dozens upon dozens of nail biting battle just to find out the author choose to resolve it with "Deus Ex Machina"...\n\nI find this completely revolting.\n\n-5/10.\n\nSorry.","May 4","false","6.8"," 30 of 53 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","30","53","0","0"

And yes, it is SPOILER FREE.\nI got to say, wow. They manage to get their fans back for there disaster and still able to continue their story."redeem themself" what they called.\nAnyways, you can romance anyone now like the same path as acdamy except Krista since she is with Irca.\nThe story it takes place 3 days (72 hours) before the final battle with full knowledge of your past. Your job is to fix your mistakes and rewrite history. Or let it happen.\nThis is a great new start of the sunrider series and hope we could see more of it.\n\nPros:\nRomance!\nChoices does matter!\nImprove story\nDifferent story route\nDifferent endings\nBugs fixes\nCons:\nNo battles\nNo VOs, but doesn't really matters to me\nSomewhat short. (3 hours in Ava story)\n\nThe new free dlc is 9/10 for me and definitely saved the game series. Still kinda pricey, but less then $15 is a real steal.\n\n\n\n(Old)(Outdated)\nSPOILER FREE. YOU WILL NOT BE SPOILED WHEN READING THIS REVIEW.\n\nAt first, I would say not recommended at version 1.0 due to lack what the first and second sunrider had, freedom of choice, and the story was not impressive as the other two. Lack of orginal voice cast, and the worst part, you cannot chose what battle to fight, it all liner. which leading to a refund.\n\nBut after the 2.0 update, they added back the ship map, to add more to be part of the crew, and the galaxy map, to chose what battle to fight, the orginal VOs. And they also added extra scenes in the end that leads to the next Sunrider trilogy.\n\nPros\nStill Xcom with anime characters.\nYour choices carry over.\nThe story (that used to be horrible) is great and almost even better.\nThe combat is even better and as been improved so it should run faster then MoA.\nThe art style as been improve a whole lot.\nThe mission length in captain mode is much longer and intense than MoA or FA had. (about 40-120 minutes in for each battle)\nThe music is even better.\nThe patch is free for all you perverts.\n\nNow to the Cons.\nNot much mass effect choices compare to the first 2 orginal sunrider games. (Less choice opinions)\nKinda buggy and crashes sometimes, so save offten.\nStill forced romance.\nKinda short compare to FA and MoA. (15 hrs here while FA is 12 hrs and MoA is 15 more hrs on capt mode. 27 hrs in total.)\nThe Price is kinda pricey at this stage.\nLess missions than FA (First Arrival) or MoA.(There are 8 battles in LD)\nYour stats does not carry over.\nYou will have to wait 2 more years for the next Sunrider series.\n\nOverall I say 6/10 for me, was kinda worth a price, but yet the same time not due to force romance. But hell these Devs are much better and deserve more reapect. They make very good quality games much better than some AAA.\n\nIf you're a new to the sunrider series, then I highly recommend you to play Sunrider:  First Arrival   Mask of Arcadius first since it is free and carry off instantly in the battle.\n\nIf you are a fan to the sunrider series, then I highly recommend to get it under $20 since you will not be disappointed in everything. The combat, story, music, artwork, and even the background.","March 20","true","27.5"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","14","23","0","2"

A lot of the charm fo the original was getting to know your space crew, and this basically got rid of almost all of those fun interactions.  Like when you could go around your ship and talk to the crew to see how they're doing?  There is like once or twice in the game now that you can even do that.  Want to romance Asaga or Ava? No.  Want to learn more about Ancient Ryuvia from Sola? No.  Want to be sexually harassed by Claude? No.  Want to yuri-fanboy talking to Icari and Kryska? No.\n\nAnd choices dont matter, at all.  At the beginning I saved Lynn and Cosette, and they basically were non-existant until the very end.  Cosette literally was forgotten until the final battle, then she disappears again.  And no, there is no option in the ship to ever go talk to them.\n\nAnd I cant believe I paid $25 dollars for this.  After the original I was looking forward to buying this when i could, and i finally got to it on a Friday evening, and played most the game...I feel like I should have paid about $10 for how much content there was.  Sure, the original game was free, and it was damn good for a free game, but this is nowhere near the value of the asking price, especially considering the major step down in story.\n\nAlso, if your fave is Asaga (like me), prepared to be super ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Her character changes drastically to basically being a jealous brat for most of the game, instead of the outgoing girl you knew before.  The other girls didnt really change much, but since none of them got more than a scene or two, they didnt have much time to ruin them.\n\nIf you're wondering, the uncensor patch is literally one shower scene between Icari and Kryska (which admittedly is very good, there interactions being one of the few high points of the game) and an H-Scene that no one wanted in the first place.\n\nIf we're comparing this to anime sequels, this is essentially the GT to Z\n\nThe ONLY redeeming quality is that the battles are still fun (assuming you like that aspect of the game).  And you spend most of your time in them, since there is so few actual scenes to the story.  I knew the swerve was coming at the end because I thought that it seemed to short after you rescue your planet, and that the swerve would be the halfway point...but no, its not, its the actual end save for 1 last short battle and some scenes that were added after the original ending that should have been scenes fleshing out the middle of the game instead of the tail-end...","March 18","false","5.8"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","0"

I will admit that most of my issues have been addressed from the original release which was encouraging to see. There are still a few issues but I am changing my review to recommend it, but wait for it to be on sale.\n\nPros\nUpgrade Interface is better\nBattles overall are more fun\nArt is still good\nPatch 2 brings the Ship and Galaxy Map\nEngiish voice option returns\n\nCons\nToo short\nStill missing the animations during battle (Though after seeing them a few times I would always skip them)\nStill few choices, though a few have been added\nCharacter development still lacking\n\n\nPatch 2.0 fixed the issue with the game feeling too linear. While there aren't as many dialogue branching as the first game, just adding the ship and galaxy map and give the user choices of which conversations and side quests to do makes it feel like you are in command of a ship again like the first game. Overall not as good as the first but much improved over 1.0\n\nOverall the story is still pretty weak compared to the first game. The linear love story is very weak and not believable. Also the character chosen is not my favorite, probably near the bottom. The end is still a bit messy but the additional scenes added at the end give a lot more background and answer a few questions that were lingering. Not sure how they thought the original story ending was even remotely acceptable, but I credit them for taking the time to fix this.\n\nNow I am a bit more excited for the next game in the seriies. Hopefully if you can get this on sale you can enjoy what I consider better battles than the first one.","March 5","true","24.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Although the endings' triggering requirements are linear, each route has it's own interesting dialogues, so it is worth the grind.  As for my bad joke above, the hard part is indeed to find all the ways to die since there are multiple ways to die with different choices within each route.  For example,  the bad end where Ava died after getting you out of the brig because you got knocked out, and the massacre happened like it did in the original timeline, making things even worse.\n\nAs for the main game, it did not change a lot from First Arrival/MoA gameplay wise, except for some new upgrades you can buy and some new tricks your ryder squad can do.  The battle level design is terrifyingly nightmarish, in a good way, brings out that masochism deep inside you that you never knew you had by getting slaughtered with an infinite amount of quantum torpedoes and missiles because you did not plan your moves carefully.","May 27","true","41.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","5"

I (intentionally) didn't play V1.0, so here is my opinion only based on V2.0. I didn't really bother with spoilers tag as most of this is already heavy with spoilers. I tried to avoid major spoilers but minor to moderate spoilers are not hid in this review. You have been warned. Also, for spoilerless conclusion, or for TL;DR look at the last paragraph. So without further ado my personal take on Sunrider: Libartion Day:\n\nShort. Very short. At Captain difficulty it only took a little more than five and a half hour. For the price right now that's unacceptable especially after MoA and Academy.\nThe characters are... fine, I guess? I personally didn't really like how their personalities developed or declined in some cases. Sola has just a little more personality than her Seraphim until the very end where she gets a little time to shine, and I mean little. About a minute or two and that's it. Asaga and Ava have no defining character trait except jealousy for the majority of the game. Icari and Kryska could be furniture for all they add to the story. They bond somewhat with each other which I liked, but that's all. Claude is completely sidelined too until the last half an hour or so. Chigara as main love interest is an interesting idea which I personally would've liked but the romance is forced and basically just a plot device just as Ava and Asagas jealousy. All in all the charaters are just clichés, cardboard cutouts (and not from the good kind) and their interpersonal relationships are astonishingly poor at most cases. Which is a complete and utter shame as we saw in Sunrider Academy and even in MoA that they could be so much more. I mean if you could write your characters to be interesting in a slice-of-life how could you make them so uninteresting in a mecha-space setting, I have no idea. As for the supporting cast: they are there. Adm. Grey gives what you expect while Veniczar Fabulous Fontana doesn't really have any role until the end, and Cosette if alive is downplayed, forgotten in the brig until the very last fight. How can I be that critical of the characters but still say that they're fine? I'm a character guy, I'm very character conscious in my games where this aspect is expected which means anything below top-notch I'll slander without remorse.\nIn terms of story the game gives you what you expect with some good twists and turns. It's not a masterpiece but it's well done and enjoyable. A shame it's so short. The ending doesn't work in it's favor either because albeit enjoyable and emotional (well, for me at least) it's rushed. It can be excused (I quite like the ending actually) but it doesn't change the facts. What I expected, didn't get much, and realize that I didn't get much just after I finished it: humor. MoA and Academy was witty, used the situations and characters to it's full extent in terms of humorous situations, eased into and flow well with drama. And despite that a good 3/4 of the game would be ideal for good jokes what we get is: Icari is tsundere. Claude is useless. And pretty much that's it. There are still some good jokes (which I'll not spoil) but mostly the game plays seriously. I mean come on if you force the jealousy thing at least give us some well thought out jokes every now and then about it. You wanted to us to take things seriously, okay, I get it but if you could do that in MoA and even in Academy to some extent all the while keeping the humor why not here?\nThe battle mechanic (on the surface what I saw at least) didn't really change since MoA although there are some minor changes here and there. It's serviceable but not exceptionally good or bad. Firing the Vanguard cannon is still a thrill and it even got a little animation. If you don't like Japanese VO in battles you change to the MoA voices. But the engine (which is Ren'py if I'm not mistaken) seems to be pushed to limit and slows the game in bigger battles (under an i7, GTX980 and SSD so I don't think my rig is the problem here). But that was a problem in MoA too sometimes so as I said didn't really change. That's about that.\nI didn't encounter bugs through my playthrough either small or big ones, the game seems pretty stable (except for the aforementioned slowing in battles).\n\nIn conculsion the game feels like that it's just a link, a connection between MoA and the next game. It feels like what it was intended to be early in develpoment: the third part of the free Sunrider series. But they changed the name from Rebirth of the Holy Empire (although the title drop is still there) to Liberation Day and sold it as a new game. As an extention of MoA I'd say it's pretty good, but as a seperate game it lacks the lenght, the depth, and charaters (grr) to actually warrant a separate game. And after the beatdown I give this game why is it still a recommendation? Well, first of all, it's a recommendation with conditions: if you're a fan of Sunrider you'll get your game, flawed but still (if you didn't buy it already). If you just liked the Mask of Arcadius and/or Academy wait for a sale otherwise you'll be most likely dissapointed to some extent. Second: it's still Sunrider, even flawed as it is I just can't hate on it for long for one misstep. I just hope that the next game will be a step forward not backward, because that would really be inexcusable in hindsight.","March 12","true","5.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Decision making is still here along with a seamless importing of how you played Mask of Arcadius.\n\nSome nice improvements as well: there's a new pop-up menu before each battle to give you an opportunity to buy supplies or improve your ships and mechs in case you forgot to do so. The command point problem of the last two games has also been fixed, allowing you to now earn points ~during~ battle by destroying enemies; which makes tactics matter and makes sense from a realism perspective, since a good commander would inspire morale and be more effective. Another positive change is that the Vanguard canon now has unlimited range, which also makes sense since it uses technology that seems similar to Sola's rifle.\n\nPersonal observation: with four games under their belts and some of the best writing I've ever experienced in a game, I believe that Love In Space is ready to graduate from Python powered VNs to making a full length JRPG for console (on par with Omega Quintet, for example).","May 16","true","19.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The first two chapters were decent, if not overly cliche. This game takes so much from the first two, throws it in an airlock and jets it into space. Gameplay hasn't changed, but the system itself has so much lag, FPS drops, and bugs that it almost adds a new gameplay mechanic itself. The art looks good and the voice acting is decent, though the decision to change voice actors from English to Japanese will bother some. You can import your save game and choices, but they don't matter, as the game has an extremely linear and forced story for you to follow. Speaking of which, you're stuck with a forced romance option that does away with any silly romantic interest that you, the player, might would've preferred.\n\nSome mechanics have been dropped entirely, gone are side-missions, walking around your ship, and choices that impact the game. The game is way too short for the price tag, since there's no replayability except for grinding difficulty achievements.  The story itself was not overly shocking or original, you can see the ending and the "shocking" real ending coming a mile out. There's a lot wrong under the hood here in terms of development and  design decisions and you could do a lot better (and for free) by playing the first two chapters and waiting for this one to go on sale. Supposedly the devs are going to try and address "fan concerns," but there's more wrong here than you can explain away with a blog post about the story.\n\nEdit: Now that 3.0 is out I'll likely revisit the game to see just how much has been improved upon. The small improvements that were made in 2.0 was not enough to ultimately make me change my review from a thumbs down to a thumbs up, but perhaps 3.0 will. At the same time, it is perhaps telling (and reinforcing of the original review's point) that the devs have managed to put together an expansion that supposedly has "approximately three times as many words as the story of the main game" in a little over two months. It is also amusing that in the lead-up to the release of 3.0 the fanboys are out bombing all the negative reviews to try and push the game in a positive trend.","March 5","false","4.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

If you say yes, please seek immediate professional councel about what a proper cliffhanger to an ongoing series should be like. However, that is not the case here. That update saved this game by the narrowest of margins. Anything less would have had people demanding for their money back. This is only concjecture on my part, but i believe they couldn't finish the game due to money constraints, and needed that little push from everyone buying the game based on the MOA sequel to finish the current one into a passable sequel. This game was.... ok. I didn't like the fact that you were forced into a relationship with someone, absoulutly zero choices except at the end, (thats where the patch saved the CO's hide) and the fact that your previous choices from the prequel had absoulutly ZERO impact on the sequel. Do I recommend this game?.... Yes, for the continuation of the story, which many of you have done for your sanity, including me lol. A Warning though, I buzzed through it in 6 hours, where in MOA i easily had 2-3 times the gametime. I still play MOA for the story and the interaction, it really sucked you into a new world.

First, for what came out on release day and second what came out in the V2.00 update.\n\nV1.00:\n\nI supported Liberation Day for a while prior to its release, so it should go without saying that I am biased in favour of this game. When it finally came out, I played it immediately and after completing V1.00 I was in a state of confused anticipation. The game plays out fairly slowly for the most part plot-wise, and then suddenly it all kicks off at the end! Such plot twists! Such action! Before I go on for ages about it, I'll summarise.\n\nPros:\n>Music. The composer did a darn good job on this one, and at least three of these tracks are series favourites. I love a good tune, and this game has some. :D\n>Gameplay. While some people miss the old combat animations, I think that Liberation Day runs much smoother without them, and means that missions don't drag on for an eternity. The inclusion of number keys for abilities also make it a lot easier to perform actions.\n\nCons:\n>Price:Length. As stated in most of these reviews, the ratio was a bit too extreme at the start. Even I was looking at it warily after completion wondering if it would have been worth the purchase.\n>The route selection is practically done for you in V1. Not wanted, thank you very much. I'll choose my own waifus.\n\nUltimately it comes down to what you play it for. If, like me, you just wanted to find out what happens next, use the new battle mechanics etc., then I'd say go for it. If you're a little skeptical, then wait for a sale. This game is worth playing, but perhaps not at that price.\n\nSuch would my first review have gone, but then V2.00 came along...\n\nI've just completed it and the difference is astronomical in the ending. As well as the restoration of the english voices in battle with new phrases and the ship and galaxy maps, a bucketload of new VN content was slapped onto the end. It improves the cliffhanger tenfold, provides a better resolution than the original, gives us the confessions we wanted all along and sets us up for a really interesting sequel. After completing this end, I was so much more hyped than the first time around.\n\nPrice-wise, version 1 was worth (in my opinion) £10-£12 with no reasonable objections. With the patch included, I'd say that has gone up to at least £15-£17 if not more, detracting considerably from the aforementioned "con". While it still doesn't quite match the asking price, it's a lot more justifiable for longtime fans. I for one cannot wait until we get the next game. With the fan reaction V1 had, I believe (and hope) that Samu-Kun has learned what the fans want the game for, and will progress with that in mind in the next title, so we won't have to go through this again ^.^\n\nP.S. That vanguard cannon video. All of my yes! The new music for that sequence was one of my biggest early-on fears regarding Liberation Day, but they got it bang-on. And the tune is longer than 40 seconds this time!\n\nI still love that cannon XD","March 13","true","41.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The story writing feel so much worse in this than it did in the first game, not to mention the "Vastly improved gameplay" consists of very little, just a few new enemy ships and some modifacations to the Command orders and upgrades. not to mention all the money I spent on upgrades in the first game are gone now. And while yes, the art has been improved, it isn't by much. the game is so much more linear and you lose almost all control over Shields which is the worst part in my opinion. Even though the options kinda sucked in the first game, I still liked that it gave me a choice. Please save your money and spend it on something else instead of this waste. Maybe if enough people don't buy the game, the devs will actually spend the time needed to make a game worth it next time.","March 5","false","1.2"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ruhrgebietheld/recommended/358750/","ruhrgebietheld","ruhrgebietheld","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ruhrgebietheld/","49 products in account","Although I give the game a thumbs up, there are a lot of asterisks associated with it, so please read through the full review before deciding whether or not you want to purchase the game.\n\nFirst off, if you haven't played the previous Sunrider games (which are free), don't even bother getting this one until you have. The game throws you right into the middle of things, and nothing about it will make sense if you haven't played the previous games.\n\nSecond off, I wouldn't get the game at the current price. It's simply too short to be worth 20 bucks or more. It's worth at most about 10 dollars. Now, if buying this game gets you free access to future titles or free DLC for this chapter, I might change my mind, but as it currently stands, this game isn't even close to worth 20 bucks. I feel like the current price point might be the creators' way of trying to make the money they didn't get from the first two games, since they released them for free. So be warned, if you spend the full price (or the barely-discounted launch price), after you finish the game you will feel like you didn't get your money's worth. I feel like the mixed reaction this game is already getting will lead to the price eventually being lowered to a more appropriate level, so I would wait until that happens if you're interested in purchasing this game.\n\nNow, to get into the game itself. There are both some positives and negatives compared to the previous games in the series. One huge positive is a much-improved research and purchasing system. Researching upgrades for the Sunrider and its Ryders now use intel, which is earned during battles. You can still purchase things from the mining union using money, which is also still earned from battle. So now you can focus on improving both your individual ryders and strengthening your fleet as a whole, whereas in previous games you had to focus on mainly one or the other. It may not sound like much, but it made the game much more enjoyable, and also helped me to customize things to my overall strategy much better than I was able to in the previous games. Music was also a positive, as it was fairly solid throughout the game and really ramped up in a big way at the end. Some of the animations are a little different than in previous games, but once I got used to it I found the visual aesthetics of the game to be solid enough.\n\nNow, for some of the negatives. Choice has been almost entirely removed in this game. Aside from a couple choices, the game is frustratingly linear. When doing side missions, you don't pick and choose. You do them all in order, with no warning. You have almost no control over the plot of the game either. It heads in one direction and one direction only, and there's not a single thing you can do to change that. The first two games built such a wonderful universe that both enthralled the player and reacted to the choices the player made, to make for a rich, dynamic experience. This game just drags the player into increasingly dark places, almost against your will. The previous games had all sorts of thought-provoking philosophical ideas for the player to consider. This game doesn't do that, it just makes you angry.  It feels like instead of trying to be thought-provoking and nuanced like the previous games, the creators decided to forsake all of that in order to be as dark as possible. It's not even a nuanced kind of dark, it's just a shallow, over-exagerrated kind of dark. It's okay to not have a 100% happy ending, but this game doesn't even give you a nuanced path to the dark ending. Now there will be another game, but it's not clear at this time whether it will involve the same characters we've grown to love. If it does indeed feature new, different characters, then the story and ending of this game will have been a colossal mistake. It's not just that this ending is dark, it's that it's not particularly well done at all. It's not well-thought out, reasoned, or nuanced. It's honestly not of the quality of storywriting that I've come to expect from this studio. So if the next game will feature the same characters and provide more nuanced writing and expound on their stories, this game's writing could redeem itself. If not, then this game's story and writing will have been a major letdown, especially towards the end.\n\nAnother negative is that the game really bogs down towards the end. Once you're about 75% of the way through the game, it ceases to be fun or enjoyable and turns into an arduous task you have to trudge through to get to the end. It's just one fight after another against massive overpowered enemies. You get a victory screen in one battle, have a few cutscenes, and then get thrown right back into another battle against an even more massive and overpowered enemy fleet. And it repeats this cycle several times. Battles cease to be enjoyable and become something unpleasant you try to get over as quickly as possible so you can progress the story. This is due to two different flaws combining. One is that the pacing is really poor for the last quarter of the game. Too many massive battles in quick succession. The other is a flaw in the design of the enemy armies in the last several battles. They're just too big, and receive too many reinforcements each turn. It was okay to face that kind of thing once, but after that it just becomes frustrating and arduous to deal with. Even compared to the previous games, enemy fleet size gets really out of hand during the last several battles in this game. It gets to a point where it's not even enjoyable to defeat the enemies, it's just a pointlessly long chore to get through.\n\nAs far as the quality of the game goes, it's not bad. There were a few minor typos and I did get a error that crashed the game once, but I was able to just reload a quicksave and then got through the point with no issues. A few minor bugs are to be expected at launch from a small studio, so I wouldn't count it as a negative. It doesn't impact the game much at all, and I'm sure they'll get fixed soon anyways.\n\nSo overall, I do still give this game a thumbs up. If you really enjoyed the previous Sunrider games you won't be satisfied with never playing this one, so if you liked those games, I would eventually get this one once the price is about half of what it currently is, or maybe even wait until it's a little lower than that. The game does have solid enough storywritng for a large chunk of it, it's just the complete lack of choice overall and the turn towards poorly-written over-exagerrated darkness in the last quarter of the game that drags it down some. If the developers read this, my plea to you would be to make the story less linear overall, and especially to completely re-write the last 25% of the story to make it more nuanced. The darker overall tone of the game is fine, it's the fact that the player is forced down one concrete path that devolves into absolute hell that makes the story and ending of this game so unsatisfying. So yes, I do barely recommend this game as it's a great series overall and this game has many of those great elements, as well as introducing some great new elements too. But it's simply not worth the current price, and there are some major letdowns with the writing and story overall that the previous games don't really have, at least not to this degree, as well as a distinct lack of choices (especially meaningful ones) compared to the previous games. It's still a decent game overall, it's just not quite as good as I was expecting from the first paid game in a great series, and especially not what I was expecting for $23. Quite simply, I was expecting something that was at least an A minus, and what I got was something that was more in the range of C plus/ B minus. Still a passing score and slightly better than the average, which is why I give the game a thumbs up, just not what I was expecting out of the game and not enough content to justify the current price.","March 5","true","9.5"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

Wall of Text Ahead!]\nHaving played both the original and 2.0 patch, I understand why many of the fans are angry at Liberation Day.\n\nThe storyline is shorter than Volume 1 (First Arrival) and Volume 2 (Mask of Arcadius). There is a dissapointing lack of character development for best girl, after a strong showing in Volume 2. There are lots of blood, gore, and deaths (apparent deaths, especially in the original 1.0 Liberation Day) affecting even the main cast.\n\nYou are 'railroaded' down a path which leads to an (apparent) Bad End. Admittedly, the story was fairly linear in the earlier volumes, just disguised better.\n\nIf you are in the game for Waifus, I totally understand (and even expect) your anger.\n\nHowever, that ignores the good parts of the game. While the first half of the game felt cheesy, it helped set up the latter portion - and even the early half of the game confirmed your choices (from Volume 1 and Volume 2) had consequences. The bedside Ava scene was especially touching.\n\nAnd then the brutal reversals at the end of the story. The double (or was it triple?) plot twist.\n\nAs a fellow author, I can only applaud Samu-kun's (as the creator calls himself) incredible performance at the end of (1.0) Liberation Day. The shattering of ideas and hopes, juxtapositioned with Kayto Shields still deciding to do what his ideas tell him to be the right thing, rather than the easy path.\n\nSamu's execution of the ending was a masterpiece. As your legendary ship lies shattered, Camino beings to play. The Warning Tones alerting Kryska that she's about to run out of ammo, as Icari hides behind her shield.\n\nThe vocalist beginning her singing, just as the enemy captains order their crews to gun down your ship's lifepods. Even as holographic damage charts and navigational alerts show Kayto's impending doom, the soundtrack hits its climax as he gives the mother of all speeches.\n\nHoly ♥♥♥♥. The 'onii-chan' had me tearing up a little.\n\nAt the end of 1.0 Liberation Day, my internal thought process was "Samu, just take my money." If the main character has to go down a bad end, this is one of the most epic ways to die.\n\nNow though, after the 2.0 patch... Yes, Sola has been promised character development. Yes, Kuushana is awesome as ♥♥♥♥. Yes, the entire harem command staff (bar Kryska, who is probably only into Icari) has finally confessed to the Captain.\n\nHowever, there are some problems with the "epilogue". Asaga's intense character development throughout the Liberation Day is undone in the blink of an eye. Kryska's naivety intensifies, as if to compensate for the burst of character development she had earlier. Worst of all, Kayto's most epic scene is devalued.\n\nBreakdown of Pros\nThe soundtrack, which was one of Sunrider:FA and MoA's strong points, is even better now. Liberation Day's music is not only intense but beautifully timed. I didn't think it could get any better, but I was happy to be proven wrong.\nAdmiral Grey, Fontana Icari, Claude, and especially Kryska's voice actors/actresses. I'll admit, initially I was not too keen on my money going towards JP VAs, but the above characters had amazing voice talent.\nThe new art design for Chigara succeeded in reducing her 'blandness'. It was very cute. Initially, I didn't like Eyepatch Ava, but it grew on me as I played the game more. Icari's art definitely feels more refined than before.\nThe brutal reversals and the stacked plot twists. Some of them, I suspected, even predicted on the forums, but the combination was a merciless (and painful) gutwrench worthy of Gen Urobochi himself. Well done, Samu.\nTactical variety - combat is more balanced and there are more differing units and viable strategies than before.\nMecha porn. The 'animations' and the unit designs feel even sharper, crisper than before.\nUI. Sunrider Academy's interface is much cleaner and pleasant to look at than the First Arrival/Mask of Arcadius UI.\nBreakdown of Cons\nLag. Holy ♥♥♥♥ the lag. Why does this game run so poorly? What the flying ♥♥♥♥ is going on when a visual novel lags my dual video card rig? It's handling like a Pentium III trying to play a modern game.\nCheesiness of the first half. This story has the potential to become a masterpiece, but the in-your-face cheesiness lends itself better to a bland Harem Drama. Please, Samu, please.\nSola's Voice Actress. The other VAs have moments of dissonance where they don't sound like their characters, but Sola's VA almost never sounds like Sola. I had to turn on English Battle Audio because I could not stand JP Sola.\nClarity. Some things are a bit murky on the first read, and not expressed really well. I'm relatively certain, for example, most readers didn't get that Alice wanted humanity dead while Alpha wanted dominion.\nAgain, I highly recommend this game. If you are here for ecchi harem action, you may be dissapointed (especially by patch 1.0) or even angry - however, if you realize this is but the stepping stone to something even bigger, this is an amazing experience.\n\nFinal thoughts:Kayto better have some impressive scars from the Sunrider's last battle. It'll help mark his transformation from a tactically brilliant pretty boy into a hardened combat veteran who has seen and experienced things.\nNow that we used Cossette (heh) can we execute her next time? Preferably without using up a Wishall?\nYandere Chigara is one of the great gems of the 2.0 Patch. Truly impressive, how much meaning can be compressed into a single line.\nI liked how both the brutality of autocracy (Ryuvia, New Empire) is contrasted with the corruption and mindless destruction of the masses (The Alliance, PACT)\nSamu-kun, please do not have Kayto ♥♥♥♥♥ out and get all wishy washy. His waifu died in his arms - that's not something you come back with and retain all your Sanity Points. Please have him fulfill his promise of destroying everything Fontana holds dear. I want to see full out Murderboner!Kayto Shields execute Fontana. Bonus points if you contrast Captain Shields, Space Hero (from Volume 1 and 2) with Captain Shields, the Genocide.","March 12","true","16.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Get this game if you like a mind-bending story! That freaking v2.0 is a friggin' plot twist! Damn I wish I didn't read that, I'd probably enjoy the next installment better.\n\nCons: Not actually a con for me, but seems like plenty others are bothered. This installment (not including the v2.0 update) is kinda like a kinetic novel. So don't expect something like Sunrider Academy or eroges where you choose options and end up with someone during this installment.

This WHOLLEE episode is just a prelude.\n\nHowever, without v2.0, the story is kinda bland and the impact scenes ain't that impactful, but that might be because it has been sometime since I played MoA, so I don't feel as attached  to the characters. So, I'll say just play the v1.0, and if you don't feel satisfied with the ending, then update to v2.0.

You have to give them credit for caring.\nThe initial release was awfull, but I'm happy to say they fixed it up nicely. The Sunrider series is one of my favourites and this continuation gets my hyped for the next installment. If you havn't played the original Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius then I highly recomend it, it's free on steam!\n\nPROS:\n-Great Graphics, impovement over MoA\n-Great Vocals, can toggle between english and japanese\n-One of my favourite strategic combat systems, vary occasionally crashes when combat starts but it always offers a quicksave just before combat. And lets face it; if you don't save before combat then anything that happens afterwards is your own fault.\n-Great Sci-Fi story, PLAY MoA FIRST!\n-Your spaceship is a badass cross between a space-battleship and a space-aircraft carrier, only the aircraft are giant robots. On top of that, the entire ship is basically a giant space laser cannon of death. It's like the death-star laser, only on a ship not a metal moon.\n-Foreshadows an AMAZING sequel.\n-You get closer to the pilots in this game, theres more cooperative character development and the devs have confirmed we will get different romantic routes in future installments.\n\nCONS\n-Kinda short for 25 bucks, MoA is completely free and still longer than this, It's worth it if you really like this series though.\n-No routes yet. (confirmed in future installments however)\n-Vary occasionally crashes when combat starts but it always offers a quicksave just before combat. And lets face it; if you don't save before combat then anything that happens afterwards is your own fault.\n\nNote:\nSomething everyone was complaining about, despite clearly having a harem you are forced into a (TEMPORARY) romantic relationship with Chigara. Now I don't DISLIKE her, I doubt anyone does, BUT I have no romantic fealing towards her whatsoever. PLEASE NOTE: The devs have said that we WILL get to choose the route we want! We will NOT be locked into a perminent relationship with Chigara, but I assume it's still available if anyones into loli. Wasn't sure where to put this, it started as a CON, but turned into kind of a PRO, it's good to know that the devs have basically said we WILL get the ending we want.\n\nAnother note:\nThere was originally way more CONS, but I feel the V2.0 update fixed them! YAY!\n\nConclusion:\nYou need to understand that I wouldn't have recommended this game when it was first released, there was less content, and various other annoying things, but loveinspace listened to their fans and put in the effort to make the game better, thats an amazing thing to be able to say about the developers. They released V2.0 and I played through it again, and I can honestly say that my opinion has changed after greatly enjoying it. Also keep in mind that some reviews you may read were written before the V2.0 update, I urge you to give V2.0 reviews priority over V1.0 reviews.\n\nIf you enjoyed MoA, then you will enjoy Liberation Day, it's a bit pricey but if you can afford it and liked MoA then please consider buying it.\nIf you havn't played MoA, then download it right now, it's free, on steam, and everyone loves it.","March 11","true","23.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I hope developers reading comments here.\n\n\nThis game contains 1 huge mission, lacks missions/choices/adventures that were so good on previous game. After beating the game the feeling that it was demo (or DLC for MoA) version arises. V2.0 adds only some explanations, not fixing game's emptiness.\n1) There are almost 0 choices. Call of Duty in my sunrider?? No way! Here are reasons why it sucks:\n- No emotions. Mask of Arcadius was making me take a choice and think carefully what could go wrong, and it's completely obliterated by story rails here. Look at all those choices in previous game at the beginning!\n- No replayability.\n2) Forcing you into useless relationship. Whole story part looks useless, but unavoidable. Even if you delete all those scenes, the story itself will still be intact. Also replacing one girl with another will do no harm to story too.\n3) In V2.0 story conclusion is a big ex machina punch.\n\nAfter Mask of Arcadius i was expecting a huge game, full of new characters, explorable systems with many events, side missions (and please, not KILL EVERYONE or HOLD FOR X TURNS types), markets, artifacts, politics (girl's affection levels on sunrider could be helpful), more battle capabilities (new types of guns, possibly some less random mechanics   so tired of reloading coz no1 hit that damn torpedo). I thought that choosing girl will be mine option, and it will affect the story and battles both (for example your girl will be even more powerful in battle, but you will have consequenses with other girls) Also the main story longer than 1 mission.\n\nWhy i still recommend this game? Because i think original game worth these money. And this is just a DLC.","March 12","true","25.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game continues the story directly where Mask of Arcadius ended. The battles, the music, the good looking art (even better than before), the new japanese voice actors (which I personally love!) and the great story continue our adventure through this great galaxy.\n\nWith the V2.0 added to the game they brought back some of the things from the previous games like the english voice actors, even more story content for the ending of Liberation day (which clears a lot of open questions and makes the ending more understandable) and also the restored ship and galaxy map.\n\nFor the price: I see lots of reviews saying that the price is too high for such a short story. I personally think it's okay because I have played the previous games and they were around the same playtime (8-10 hours) depending on if you just rush through the battles or try them on a normal/higher difficulty. If you think it's still too much then you can wait for a discount, it will come sooner or later.\n\nBefore I end my review here with an  absolutely recommendation  for the game there's one very  Important  thing to say: This is  not  the final end and story of Sunrider, there will be more installments coming and therefore I hope you give the whole Sunrider Series a chance because you won't get disappointed!","March 10","true","24.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The update dosnt add any tactical gameplay just a load of 'loaded' choices leading to what will be for most a horrendious doom. I couldnt find anything to using my old save data off Re:turn and when a few characters mentioned some choices i 'did not' make in the past it left me rather confused but overall i have to say in its completed state this quirky VN is money well spent, ive backed this game since day one and regret nothing. Give it a go if you make it through on your first try you may be a space whale.\n\n\n\n\nV2.03 Review: That little strand of faith paid off, I am amazed at the little amount of time it took to fix all the atrocities that were version 1.0, Bioware & Ea could learn a thing or two about correcting endings from Love in Space. I am pleased with the amount of choices that were added in the end that break free from the offensive railroading the story seem to have lead. If we are to expect similar quality of this (completed version?) of Liberation day it will easliy be one of the stars of the indie-vn industry.\n\n\n\n\nV1.00 Review: Why isnt there a neutral button? Such a long wait, for sublte moments, empty dialog and an ending that will leave you questioning if anything ever mattered to begin with. I can't bring myself to leave a negitive review because i want to cling on to a little faith that Samu-Kun will do what is needed. Maybe we can just say this was the one meh sunrider once "Sunrider: Reborn" is released.

I played it in one go last night and i must say i am not that impressed. The game was overall a bit too short, the story felt a bit weird, you cant make any choices (like for Sidequests or Conversation Choices), it feels like you are getting grabbed by the hand and are just being pulled through the story. there are some good aspects, like the whole Traitor Hunt, but it wasnt enough made out of it. Another point is that you get forced into a relationship (with Chigara) which may some of you like, but that isnt the thing for everyone. Like i mentioned, you dont have a single choice between right at the beginning where you either use the wiswall if you still have it to save corsette or not, which kills her (though you shouldnt be sure of that either). But that was it. then the only choices you can make are what to buy and what to upgrade.  And i miss the Battle Animations from the previous Games, cause now you always watch from the top and see attacks fly over the map and then hitting the enemy, which is kinda sad. But its not all bad.\n\nThe Voiceover was well made, the Art still looks amazing and the soundtrack gives me goosebumps. Overall the menus look better and the CGI scenes are also good made (for a visual novel) If you dont have a savegame from the previous game but played it you can recreate your decisions before you start the game which is a nice thing to have, but you can also import it with a click on the right button. And dont mistake me here, i just cut this part here short, that doesnt mean that it doesnt mean equally much as the part i wrote above.\n\nMy Opinion of the game overall is that it has a lot of wasted potential, which is sad cause it could have been more. The lack of choices and the forced story line kinda ruins it for me a bit, cause in the previous games it always felt like your choices have an impact on the story and the characters. but no choices, no impact. The forced relationship may be a good plotdevice, but i still prefer multiple storylines then one that feels rushed. and content wise its not a masterpiece, cause you can beat it in around 4 to 5 hours, depending on the difficulty. i still recommend the game for fans of the series, but for the actuall price it has not enough content. if i were you i would wait till the prie drops a bit more, and prepare for a huge feels trip when you are forced to watch the continue somewhere where you dont want it to go and you cant do anything about it","March 5","true","7.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The combat has been changed up with some new features and removal of some old ones.  There are new units, like gunships that work well against ryders, AOE attacks, unlimited Vanguard range, and CP changes to consider.  CP is capped at 5000, but you gain more in combat for each destroyed enemy.  Something taken out is the close-up animation of attack results.  All combat animations and damage results are now displayed on the battle map.  That means you do lose some information like how much damage was blocked by armor or shields and how many missiles actually hit.  Gravity abilities on some units now work on capital ships as well, so you can line up some awesome Vanguard shots.  Speaking of which, there is a cool new animation for firing the cannon now.\n\nThe story pretty much picks up right where MoA left off.  The PACT fleet is defeated, Sunrider is heavily damaged, and the war will soon be at an end.  The clones are now the real enemies with Fontana and much of the rest of PACT wanting peace.  There is only going to be one love interest for Captain Shields and that is Chigara.  It seems a little odd if you've been trying to woo any of the other women in the last game; because everyone seems to be under the impression that you've been interested in her all along.  This does bring out some jealousy among some of the crew, and that'll cause trouble down the road.  The effects of jealousy and unconditional love are explored, as well as how those can be used to help or harm.  The story is linear and about as long as the first release of Sunrider; ending after the outcome of the battle of Cera.\n\nThe ship and galaxy map are gone, but it seems the next big update is going to patch them in along with some extra ending story content.  The option to visit the store, buy upgrades, or save are now automatically presented before each battle.  At this time there are only Japanese voiceovers, and the music continues to impress.","March 6","true","6.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

On the same token, I dislike it. I like the new music, the new art in the game was very polished, and overall the story was nice until the end. The story had me on the edge of my seat and did leave me wanting more and got me worried about events that might happen. Claude's death felt very cop out and I wasn't very happy about that. Out of everything that was happening on the battlefield, and positions one holds on a ship, (I'm looking at you radar guy) somehow in all that she got killed in a way that felt cheap. All those wtf events that happened at the end... Like come on man. Really? I'm all for cliffhanger ends to get someone to think about past events, and theory craft for future installments, but thats too much. Too many cooks spoil the broth so to speak. So much happened at the end that the emotion of the scene fell upon dull emotions. I didn't feel anything, and I felt like I was supposed to feel something. But so much was going and constantly changing so fast you have no time to feel anything, but try to make sense of the events that are transpiring. I'll be honest, and I am sure thats what devs want, feedback of sorts. The writing at the end, it sucked. It didn't pull me in like the rest of the writing in this VN, it didn't leave me wanting more, and the attachment I felt throughout the story was gone at the end. If there is something I can impart from having some writing experience of my own, is don't oversaturate plot points all in one moment. It will leave the reader feeling overwhelmed. LD was rather kinetic and lacked the choices that MOA had. I see the way they wanted to direct the game towards, just wish you had more control over it.\n\nAll that aside, I would say I really enjoyed it, but due to the nature of the events at the end, I give this game a 7/10, which is not bad. Also since Sunrider is a game about multiple parallel universes and time travel, I don't even wanna start theory crafting, like nope. In the end, I still have the Wishall, and I don't know how that will affect events in the fourth game, if at all. I feel more like Time Travel will play a huge role in the next game with going back to the past as a certain character to try to change events for the better. Considering someone came from the future at the end of LD. Also that end cg is puzzling with that quote it had. Needless to say, I hope the next Sunrider is longer than this one.\n\nTo all you guys and gals out there, I await to see speculation posts pop up. I will probably replay this to get the final cgs, and replay Sunrider Academy a bit to try to find more evidence. Cause really I doubt this will be the end of Claude, Chigara, or anyone else that carries an affection score.","March 7","true","5.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

However, now version 2.0 has been released (available via beta opt in) and it radically changes my review of this game. I would urge everyone to consider newer reviews or edited reviews with greater weight than old ones.\n\nThe combat is functional and tight, the mechanics are easy to learn but can be difficult to master, presenting the player with a challange at the medium difficulty levels and there has been significant rebalancing since the last full release game. Combat is often tense but not truly unfair.\n\nThe art work is wonderful, full voice overs in Japanese and partial voice overs in English are very well done and the music is first rate. Even without understanding the words the main theme is highly kinetic. The art work, and particularly facial expressions, really convey tone and subtle meaning.\n\nThe majority of the game as of the time of writing is quite linear, and long time fans will know that this series is used to giving us choice and room to move. This can come across as jarring and even agrevating as our protagonist is forced into choices we would not have him make. However, the v2.0 update changes everything. Stick with it and you will be rewarded. Choice and agency return in the v2.0 editions and the pay off is well worth the wait. There are new and interesting major plot developments and key personal moments.\n\nI can now say this with confidence to newcommers and old fans alike. I recomend this game. V2.0 fixes a great deal. To newcommers I would also recomend picking up Mask of Arcadius (the direct prequel) it should still be free and will make this a much richer story for you. You may also wish to consider the Academy spin off. Give this game a go!","March 5","true","20.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It does wonders for reducing hype.^^\n\nActually, a few more months of development would have done good, of course you can never prevent all glitches and it was more stable for me than the previous games. No idea at which patch, but I came across the series after Mask of Arcadius was already released.\n\nMy main gripe is the comparative linearity, though I can see why the development team felt that was necessary. But even if a certain plot thread had to be linear, there were other ways to accomplish much the same emotional impact and retain many of the conversations (this is a considerable cost factor) while giving the player more freedom than this had, though there some scenes I have not seen, judging by the empty CG slots. However, character interaction was too scarce for my liking, which was also understandable but is still not appreciated.\n\nThis is not even a complaint about eroge narrative conventions or any one character being particularly misportrayed or underrepresented as some people may feel, since I don't consider this an eroge, and it works quite well as a VN. It doesn't even deserve the 18+ tag in my opinion (yes, with the patch and all) because it's just a story that has some sex in it. Which is a little graphic. Change one or two angles minimally and this is completely tame. There are plenty of books and TV series that are much more graphic, and aren't at all marketed with that. It's hardly ever even mentioned in any sort of commentary or coverage. Take Ken Follet's The Pillars of Earth, for example, which even has graphic assault. Perhaps people are more sensitive about pictures, but pictures of much harsher things are so easy to come by nowadays, and you see much of the same in sex education at schools, the label becomes a farce. Which makes me rant. This is a filibuster though, not really anything to do with the game and the reviewer criticism wouldn't much change either way, except perhaps in tone.\n\nHowever, having played the previous games, I would retroactively buy this one at the price above, and I probably would even if I hadn't played it yet, just because the first two parts, over 30 hours of playtime for me, are free and would even be worth the price of a full game to me, though I doubt they'd find terribly many buyers that way. XD\n\nAnd finally: The ending is good. Though I also liked the original ending of the Mass Effect trilogy, so maybe that is not for you. Also, it isn't the ending of the series, and will not even stay the ending of this game (the latter feels like a bit off a loss, since the impact is just right like this). Still, the developer is doing their best to meet the criticism: http://steamcommunity.com/games/358750/announcements/detail/955132547461863264","March 6","true","20.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

When I heard it was coming out I decided to hold off on playing until the update was released.\n\nAnyway...\n\nOverall while I did enjoy the game, but that is mostly from the story perspective. I felt the game overall was kinda short compared to the last two versions. But that being said this game depends on the fact you had played the previous Sunrider games otherwise I can see newcomers having a rough start so if you are interested in playing this game I recommend you play the previous games first.\n\nI played the game on a lower difficulty setting, mostly because I knew of the changes in game play from the previous versions, but the battles were fewer in-between even with the side missions which was disappointing. I hope they will have more battles as well as more story content with more choices, because the game felt lacking in choices you could make, in the upcoming games because the game felt short despite the story and character interactions being among my favorites in this game to enjoy.\n\nThe improvements to the shop and research areas were much better than the last two versions of the game. I liked the conversations were fully voiced now, but only in Japanese...still it wasn't bad.\n\nI see this game in its future sequels can go in different directions depending on what paths will be open for our hero, but I hope the developers will really work on adding more battles to balance out the story so this game has room for improvement.\n\nBut considering how far they came from the last two games so far I am hopeful that the next game will surpass this one and its previous installments. So my expectations for the next game will be very high.\n","April 12","true","15.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ClipOnSunglasses/recommended/358750/","ClipOnSunglasses","ClipOnSunglasses","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ClipOnSunglasses/","52 products in account","I would probably give Sunrider: Liberation Day a "Neutral rating" if I could. I would recommend the game to fans of the first one, but with the stipulation that those who are turned off by the cons section wait until it goes on sale or something to buy it.\nThe game comes with an unfortunate mix of improvements (mostly in gameplay) and setbacks (mostly in story). The improvements are really awesome, but the setbacks can drag the rest of the experience down. So some might not mind but others might leave the game with a bad taste in their mouth. Ultimately I knew in advance that there were some issues, but when I accepted them for what it was, I had a mostly positive experience, barring some bugs & crashes forcing me to repeat battles.\n\nPros:\n- A very compelling continuation of the story, with many memorable moments and it expands upon an interesting universe. I already anticipate playing the next game in the series.\n- Greatly improved artwork, plentiful CGs, improved UI\n- A better upgrade system that relies on intel for basic ryder and Sunrider upgrades that can be refunded at full cost to encourage experimenting with builds, with additional ships, torpedos, repair drones and unique upgrades being acquired with money.\n- A stunning variety of new units. On your side there are many new ships that server additional and interesting combat roles, as well as many additional temporary allied units, and well a more variety in enemies and group compositions for all enemy factions.\n- Voice acted line with professional japanese voice actors, and the option to include the original english voices in combat sequences. Every line except those that were patched in the beta update are voice acted.\n-The developers gave a large free content update and patch due to the initial backlash from the fans and kickstarter backers. This was very professional of Love In Space to do and I appreciate their efforts to build bridges with valued customers.\n\nCons\n-The game costs money, but it is actually the third episode of Sunrider, with the first title technically being the first two episodes. So despite the costing money when the first game is free, it is roughly only half as long.\n- This is a serious bugbear for many; the increased linearity of the plot, including a forced romance route for much of the game. There are very few choices in the bulk of the game, and half of the choices occur in the patched in updated content (so about the last hour of playtime). Again the story is good, if not even better than the first in my opinion. But the lack of choices also hurts another aspect of the Sunrider series. They know how to make compelling moral dillemmas with few clear answers but not many are to be found in this installment.\n-This is my opinion and other will disagree, but the battles can get too crowded and it can make turns feel like they take too long. While I like the interesting new units, I find that a full fleet of the Sunrider, 6 ryders, a whooping 12 additional ships along with whatever temporary units are fighting along with you can be way too much. Likewise, the enemies can have too many units to compensate for your mass of forces. It can feel like it gets out of hand at times.\n- [Experimental version] The game has bugs and crashes. This game must had more crashes than Fallout New Vegas. Torpedos crashed my game, some unit placements seemed to crash the game. I had to repeat a lot of battles due to crashes.\n- [Mild Spoilers] The final bossfight 	is a bit disappointing as the Final Boss comes out of nowhere to fight you in the climatic battle. The Legion in Mask of Arcadius spent the whole game humiliating you and destroying everything you had, and the OHKO telegraphed laser mechanic was refreshing. The story set up made it one of my favourite boss fights in gaming, believe it or not. But this boss has few interesting mechanics outside of taking of a lot of hit points, an AoE laser shot & missiles and having a really powerful melee counterattack.","May 1","true","9.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I love everything that was created. Love every girl who is on board that ♥♥♥♥ing ship. Kryska, Icari and Ava are my top 3.

The game is cool, but except for one decision or another (save Cosette, Ava triggered or not the cannon) I do not feel so eager to play the game again. It would be a game I would rent for a weekend (at the time of rental shops in the 90s), would end and would return without thinking of renting it again.\nThe game has a very linear story, the update 2.0 brought back the map of the galaxy and the map of Sunrider, but they are unnecessary because things will going to happen obligatorily or you have only one choice to make.\nSo have the map there or not makes no real difference.\nI think what everyone expected was the ability to choose which girl you could have a romance.\nI never cared about achievements, so I will not play to just get a trophy on Steam. For me it is nonsense be spending time on it.\nBut, just as I did with Sunrider Academy, in a game play I could stay with Kryska, then having to start over and choose Icari and then ... etc..etc ... I would play it once for each girl.\nNow, basically, the story is the same, with some different details only, so I really do not see much need to replay the game.\nIf you like Sunrider universe, then the game is recommended.

I can't emphazise this enough: it's not just a VN, more than half of the game consist of the turn-based combat.\n\n\nDifficulty:\nThe difficulty of this game is very high, even though it may appeal as some generic VN. Everyone who was shocked by the previous game's difficulty can rest assured: the balancing is much better than in the previous one. You'll propably still die a lot during your first playthrough, but it never feels unfair.\n\n\nStory (there will be a few spoilers but nothing critical):\nThe game starts exactly where the last one ended. The story has two main aspects: one being the war against PACT to free Cera, another one being the search for a traitor. There are some obvious candidates for the traitor, but in the end I'm still not sure who actually betrayed whom. Either everyone betrayed everyone or no one betrayed anyone. Additionally there's a forced romance which is important to the story's end and propably also the start of the next game.\n\n\nMy review:\nMost people complain about the game's playtime and the forced romance in the story.\n\nRegarding the playtime: when you're playing on medium difficulty you'll propably need around 10 hours. That people who rush through the game only need 5 hours or less is only natural. As I said in the beginning: this isn't just a VN, half of it is tactical battles. If miss half of the game it's self evident that you only need half the time to finish.\n\nRegarding the forced romance: Personally I don't have a problem with the forced romance and neither with the choiceof character the devs made. The actual problem is the pacing of the game's story. I think it's just a few weeks of in-game time and because of that the romance feels very rushed and quite unnatural.\n\n\nThe short version of all this: the turn-based battles are challanging and for me even the main appeal of the game. The story has a small problem with it's pacing but is still very enjoyable.","March 23","true","20.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I really do think they need to take the time on the next game and add as much story and gameplay as possible, and they really do need to take the time to proof read there are a couple spelling mistakes so do fix thosecbreaks immersion. I do think the gameplay needs more excitement I found it very bland and kindof boring and ad mode above casual and even ensign is just ridiculous even with good strategy the odds are just so terrible and frustrating and you make no money to upgrade ship, ryders, buy everything you need it really needs to be balanced, I found myself putting it on the easiest mode and roleplaying to have fun with the gamplay so it really needs more to it.

While Mask of Arcadius kept me on my seat, Liberation Day made me almost miss work. Twice.\n\nIt was a neat little sequel that honestly felt a little rushed when compared to it's predecessor in terms of pace. I get that this chapter is focusing more on the story than the combat, which I'm sure a lot of people appreciated considering how long someone can spend on a single battle, especially if they save scum like me in order to make every shot count. I understand that the majority of the war had already been fought out in the first game, but the buildup between the first fight and the final boss just didn't feel satisfying. I'm just kinda dissapointed that there wasn't a little more meat in between those two points as far as combat goes. A couple more optional sidequests would have helped significantly. The fact that they would be optional would be perfect, because the people who are just in it for the story wouldn't have to deal with them. The combat system is honestly half of the reason I love this game series so far, so I did feel it didn't recieve as much love as it could have.\n\nA few neat points is that the options in the first game actually have an effect on this one. One of the most important one I feel being whether or not you commanded Ava to fire the Vanguard or not. (Then again, that could just be because Ava is my BEST GRILL) For one, it felt a lot more rewarding considering how long I had to wait to find out what happened to her. Secondly, the scene where they reunite is a lot ♥♥♥♥ing cuter when you did order her, plus you got her wearing that cute little eye patch the rest of the game. (RIP Ava's depth perception) The others I feel, didn't have as strong an impression, seeing as they don't actually dictate which girl you have the most browny points with. Then again, lets get real. ALL of'em want the Kayto ♥♥♥♥, minus maybe Kryska and Cosette.\n\nThis brings me to my next point. The forced romance... God, this made me SO pis-sed. Honestly, even though Chigara was one of my top three favorites in the first game, as well as Asaga, I came to sort of hate them both as the game went on. The further I got into the story, the more Chigara didn't seem like the Chigara I fell for in the first game. And Asaga. *sigh* Might as well change her name to Asuka cause of how bit-chy she became. The only thing I can say made up for the forced romance was the ending. Blew my ♥♥♥♥ing mind. It made me forgive everything I didn't like about the storyline and I can't wait for what happens next. I still hate Asaga though. And I'm sorta confused what my feelings towards Chigara are. Claude too, now that I think about it...\n\nAnyways. Great game.

Probably not worth $25 on it's own, but remember they did give MoA away for free. Unfortunately XCOM with waifus kind of loses it's apeal if you can't choose your waifu. Hopefully the next part will have multiple romantic routes. This coupled with a second act that rubbed me the wrong way in a manner that I can't articulate properly, I don't know. It's to linear, and Shields is too bland to support a linear story.\n\nI'm actually kind of impressed with what Love In Space is doing with the Ren’Py engine, but I think they're either reaching the limits of it's abilities or their coding is inefficent. I'd go with the former though. Input is laggy and occasionally causes miss clicks, and the UI does some crap. Thank god their is an autosave function and a cancel movement button.\n\nOST is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing rad. I actually feel a little dirty for how much I like it.\n\nCombat is challenging to the point of being unfair on the higher difficulties. It's very difficult to work out what upgrade is the best to invest in, and it does seem to drastically affect how easy a battle is. Once you have a good set up though it is really fun. Short range warp to the enemy line, fire the vanguard, wipe them all out in a calculated manouver, and finish off the straglers with kenetics.\n\nGo play MoA, it's free.

I LOVED it. I think the game manages to keep everything that was great about MoA, whilst making minor changes which were usually great improvements. The battles are still a lot of fun, the melodramatic space opera is in the same spirit, and the story is still great. I understand a lot of the criticism was related to a forced romance, which I didn't mind at all because I never thought of this game as a dating simulator or the kind of game where you choose a girl and romance her. It's a great and challenging strategy game with a very fun story and entertaining bits between gameplay. The only real negative point I can think of is its relatively low replayability, although I did start it again immediately on a higher difficulty.\n\nI should say that I only played V2. Although, I think I know where the original version ended because there was a point that seemed like a cliffhanger ending after which there was no voiced dialogue. I loved that ending, by the way. I thought it was great and everything after it kinda seemed like it was written to hastily give a more "complete" ending.\n\nFinal thought, loved it. I recommend it.","April 25","true","30.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

One and a half yars we've been waiting for the conclusion of the adventures of the Sunrider. Was the wait worth it?? short answer: yes. Long answer: yeeeeeeees.\n\nok, but now seriously:\nSunrider: Liberation Day is set right after Mask of Arcadius. To be precise, it starts off right when Fontana shot (one of the many) Arcadius at the end of MoA . The battle against PACT is won, their old leader gone and now it's time to liberate Cera, Kayto's homeplanet. before doing so, he (who still doesn't have a voice, safe for his very energetic 'FIRE', lol) and Admiral Grey meet onboard the Core, which they had gotten access to. They discuss their future plans, what to do with the core and also get a peace treaty (too high of a word, but eh.) with Fontana, the new PACT leader, done.\nAll that's left before setting course for Cera is to fix up the Sunrider and interrogate the captured Cosette and 'Arcadius'.\nWhile the former doesn't contribute anything helpful, the interrogation of the Arcadius-clone gives them some knowledge about the 'Prototypes' as they're really called and about how Chigara is also one of them. This sparks some distrust towards Chigara under some of the Sunrider's crew, especcially Asaga, who is having a hard time dealing with the situation as she wants to protect the Sunrider and Kayto in particular by all means necessary.\nAfter the interrogation, the crew tries their best to get the repairs done as quickly as possible, but when an ambushing PACT fleet that has hidden itself in an ion storm attacks them, they are forced to enter the first 'real' battle with a bit of a handycap.\n\nAs I entered the first battle, I immediately noticed some severe improvements over the combat of FA and MoA:\n1) Icari and Kryska are no longer next to useless. Kryska can now pull enemy fire onto her and simultaniously increase her armor while Icari's stealth now makes her WAY less likely to get targeted by the enemy.\n2) Battles no longer have several pictures for every attack, attacks now happen on the overmap no matter what. This really improves the flow of the battle.\n3) There are many, MANY more ships per battle than previously. You now have ~ 2-3 times as many ships as in the first two games and the enemy has... honestly, it's hard to tell how many more they have, since they always had a ♥♥♥♥♥on of them. With the addition of these ships, it really has more of a feel of a battlefield and you are less reliant on the RNG-gods to be on your side (which they weren't).\nThere are also several changes to the commands: you can now order multiple of them per round, the command points now cap out at 4000 (can be upgraded to 5000) and charge up by destroying individual ships, the vanguard cannon now costs 4000 points but has unlimited range and the costs for short range warps increase when used several times in quick succession.\n\nAfter this battle (which took over an hour to complete... I was deeply impressed), the Sunrider and the Alliance set course for Cera to liberate it and to defeat the Prototypes, which have taken over the control over many PACT ships.\n\nNow... I won't go into detail here (for obvious reasons), but I want to say that the last... let's say 15-20 minutes had as jarring a shift of tone as I've seen in a long time. Just when I had thought that all had ended well, the fake credits stopped and made room for a really f'ed up after story. When the REAL credits then rolled, it took me quite some time to fully comprehend what the hell I had just witnessed. The only comfort I can find for myself is that my favorite characters, Asaga (I think I'm the only one in the Asaga fanclub now... yay ;-;) and Sola, survived.\n\nI have to say though, there aren't just positive things I can say about Sunrider: Liberation Day.\nFor one, it's a bit on the shorter side with ~8 hours of gameplay. It's probably my fault for expecting something a bit bigger, but I feel as if I should adress it anyways.\nThere were also a few things (two of them are bugs/glitches, with the other one I'm not sure what exactly it's classified as) that forced me to reload and in some cases even restart the entire game. For example, the good old 'out of memory' bug/glitch is back, which made me restart the game in two cases. Luckily the Auto-save function works really well :D\nAlso: there were several times, especcially earlier in the game, where I had to end my turn prematurely because one of the Cera gunships got stuck somewhere in an Assault-attack and I was unable to use ANYTHING until I ended the turn.\nLastly, the battles had a tendancy to lag quite a bit. This is most likely caused by the many units, but more often than not, there would be random timeframes in the enemies turn where absolutely nothing happened, followed by a unit hopping to another square/hexagon/whateveryouwannacallit. This seemed to be happening the most with the Arcadius Ryders, but that might've just been my imagination.\n\nIn the end, I have to say that I really love Sunrider: Liberation Day, because it has several severe improvements over the first two games, which I already loved, while keeping the core intact. There were less choices and the Lovestory was with Chigara no matter what happend, but since that was essentially what was to be expected, considering how MoA played out, I didn't mind that too much.\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'll go back to SA to see Asaga and Kayto together again. Because while I really didn't mind how it played out here and feel like anything else would've been just weird, Asaga's still my favorite character in the series by a long shot =w=.","March 5","true","24.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

It delivers, the Devs care about player feedback and have a sense of humor(unlike most devs for alot of recent games in the past year or so such as destiny,CoD, evolve,etc where they feel only half baked and like cash grabs. those guys treat their hugh player bases like ♥♥♥♥) I have to say try MoA its free then if your really into the story buy it, if your intrested but the price is too high throw it on your wishlist and wait for a steam sale.\n\nOk the New add ons just great Omg yes these Devs have earned my respect for a rapid Responce to player feedback and gave players what they wanted while keeping their story intact Vers 2 makes it much more clear that this isnt the end for Captian Sheilds but mearly a new Begining and with REturn you get all the choice you want with all the girls to ♥♥♥♥ cept kyska but shes not great.\n\nI love how they Dealt with the hugh player backlash in a great way with time travel and the fact they make fun of themselves in the new DLC(which is free) by compalining about how Shields felt chained to someone elses plans and how he cant rip up the rule book anymore it made me Rofl for real\nafter all the changes the only question you should be asking is When is the next one coming and  which ending is canon?

The price point is going to be an issue right away, because you are paying 25$US for a game that can be completed even on the harder difficulties in about 4 hours. That stings.\n\nBUT, that's about the same length of each of the previous TWO chapters (yes, there were two). Also similarly priced before the free release (from what I've been told).\n\nThis episode improves graphically and mechanically over MoA, with the exception of some lag in the battle screen. Kudos all around for Love in Space's commitment to improving their game. The character and unit sprites are better, the new VO is professional, and the new additions to the soundtrack are excellent.\n\nThe narrative though, that's the part that's got people up in arms. Ignore the people whining about the ending; cliffhangers are nothing new to games, don't start getting your panties in a wad over it now. The real problem is the EXTREME linearity of this installment. The choices are minimal, the story arc itself has NO deviation, and in spite of the fact that you can import your saves, it feels like none of the previous choices mattered beyond delivering you to the same controversial ending. YOU DO NOT GET TO MARRY YOUR WAIFU IN LIBERATION DAY, regardless of which one you're going for. In fact, it seems like very little of that matters this time around.\n\nMy overall impression of Liberation day is positive. It delivers another chapter in an increasingly compelling story, but at the same time it feels as if the story was written into a corner and needed to backpedal but couldn't fight its own momentum. If you like Sunrider, stop griping about the price and for f$ck's sake quit telling people to pirate it.\n\nTL;DR Liberation Day as a strategy game is an improvement over its predecessors in almost every way. On the other hand, the story feels rushed, cut off too abruptly and with so much cheese you'll never crap again. Here's hoping the next installment spends more of its time on the story all these fans are so invested in (myself included).\n\nP.S. I'm currently 120$US into Love in Space's endeavour.

They listened to the fans fixed many things. Everything I listed badly in my original negative review has been fixed with the latest patch. The developers said it best in a post that they focused so much on the battle system and ways to improve its mechanics that they lost touch with the story content. Which is why there is so little content especially since most people play the game on waifu mode the battles are nothing. I expect the next chapter in the game will have much more content and story too it as the romance routes are now finally underway and the linear story is behind us.

Being a patreon and supporting this company for months, I feel robbed that this is the product given out to us. Sad since how much I enjoyed Mask of Arcadious and Sunrider Academy.","March 5","true","27.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, looking at what they changed I dont think v2.0 would change most of my opinions.\n\nAs a stand alone game I can't recommend it; at least not at full price. It's a nice follow up to the first game which in my opinion is better in just about every way. Since it's free, go play that if you haven't already.\n\nPros\n+More adventure time with familiar faces.\n+The "cinematics" are intense, and exciting.\n+The combat is complex, like a good chess match. All of the pieces have their uses. But it can be repetitive since it's the only gameplay we get now.\n\nCons\n-Crashes pretty regularily. Thank god for that very reliable autosave.\n-Not sure what, if anything was affected by the choices I made in the first game. Considering they carry over your decisions you'd think they'd play a bigger part.\n-What happened to all of the moral decision making we got to make in the first game? What happened to chosing which characters you wanted to visit and get to know better? Now we just follow the story, we don't shape it.\n-What happened to English voice acting?\n-Consider the game is all about having a harem of beautiful women to spend your days with it's weird that you get pushed into one romance, and can't choose to get to know the other characters better.\n-Is it just me or did most of the characters lose their minds following the first game? It made for some nice drama, but it felt super forced and insincere.\n-It had a decent ending point, and then continued on for no real reason. Everything that happened after that was a big "Why?"\n-Not a lot of immediate replay value unless for some reason you want to play on a harder difficulty, but why would you?","March 14","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It didnt take long for me to declare it to be one of my favourite Game. I finished it in one day and was waiting for the third chapter <--- this game to arrive.

Anyone who has played mass effect 3 will fully understand what im getting at, From Chapters 1 to the end of 3 (Liberation Day) the storyline was Excellent altho within the last .... 30 mins tops (Note there is ONLY one ending) the story gets a MAJOR nose dive from great to poor.\n\nAt the end of your war you've made peace everyones everythings going well, Chigara is about to get her medal of bravely.. when oh no.. shes being controlled by prototype, and kills him, she turn orders down drones to crash thought the roof and kills EVERY alliance official in the ballroom. for some wierd reason shields feels oh "the love of my life, just killed a room full of people... lets run up to her and kiss her on the lips,,, yelling your not chigara... to which we find out prototype is controlling chigara they get her out of chigara but within seconds fortana kills chigara,,, instantly after both pact and the alliance want you dead... so you try to escape... nope.. that fails... sunriders about to get blasted to bits...\nshields orders you to get to the escape pods... nope.... the people wanting you dead have detected the escape pods and are under orders "take no prisoners"... so ofcoure that means ava isn't going to make it... and then ofcourse shields doesn't make it.....\n\nliteally the second chigara/alice shots grey i instantly knew what was coming because i've seen it before in games/animes/movies where everyone kills everyone and the main characters get killed (Rolls Eyes)...\n\nSO...\nas i said... as much as it pains me to have to write this review so low... it sadly has to be done...\nduring the whole game i would have HIGHLY recommended sunrider, and would have recommended getting all loveinspaces games to help fund there next project....\n\nbut with liberation days ending being so POOR i get the feeling there is going to be a low... next to no chance of getting "Rebirth of the holy empire" i can't believe i was so hyped up and excited to play liberation day before it released and while playing it...As it has left me with a gut rumbling empty feeling of disappointment :<..........\nShame that i've hit way past the 2 hour mark... so i wont beable to get a refund...\nas i know i will NOT be playing Liberation day again =/... unless loveinspace add some extra endings to the game... but till then this will just start to gain cyber dust =/....\n\ni would consider the ending to liberation day to be the sort of\n"True bad ending you'd get in some rpg/visual novals you'd play\ngoing from\nTrue bad, bad, normal, happy, true happy ending\n\n<Update>\nA recent post from the president of loveinspace posted in regards to the ending,\nstating that its a "cliffhanger" to what you'd get in animes and tv series.\nand that liberation day (the 3rd chapter), barely half-way thought the story,\nand the next chapter will start immediately after liberation day, and as things to do with why the ending is what it was.\n\nWeep if thats the cause, lets hope it manages to set things right..","March 5","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So i just finished all the happy endings, a few bad ones, and the secret one and i am pretty pleased, the only complaint i have is that the good paths all play pretty much the same (except the secret one) and have very little different other than the  girl your doing it with, also i was really hoping there woulo\d be space combat but sadly there was not. I dont mean to sound over critical so i'll state that i enjoyed this as a whole, it was a free expansion and i got to romance best girl Ava so i'm walking away happy. i think they should have made the good endings more different but again it was free so im not gonna complain to much. The best route is the secret one, it was very interesting and focused on one of the more mysterious crew members. In the end i give it a 7/10 (but there really should of been space combat)","May 27","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now I can absolutely recommend the game! It is a story-only expansion with a very well-developed branching story where your choices actually matter. Great replay value, good writing, and most importantly the developers listen to their fans!
